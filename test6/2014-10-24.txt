Top 10 Most Unbelievable Excuses for Calling in SickTop 10 most unbelievable excuses for calling in sick
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Video: Career Builder offers a roundup of the craziest excuses employees have given for calling out sick, including one who said they had a casserole in the oven, and another who reported that they accidentally got on a plane.
Faking a cough sounds so boring compared to these sick day excuses. CareerBuilder released its 2014 roundup of the year's most unbelievable excuses bosses have heard from employees. If they're to be believed, American workers got into some serious hijinks this year.
Here are the top excuses from their representative sample of 2,203 hiring managers and HR professionals across companies:
10. Employee just put a casserole in the oven.
9. Employee’s plastic surgery for enhancement purposes needed some "tweaking" to get it just right.
8. Employee was sitting in the bathroom and her feet and legs fell asleep. When she stood up, she fell and broke her ankle.
7. Employee had been at the casino all weekend and still had money left to play with on Monday morning.
6. Employee woke up in a good mood and didn't want to ruin it.
5. Employee had a “lucky night” and didn’t know where he was.
4. Employee got stuck in the blood pressure machine at the grocery store and couldn't get out.
3. Employee had a gall stone they wanted to heal holistically.
2. Employee caught their uniform on fire by putting it in the microwave to dry.
1. Employee accidentally got on a plane.

While these could give you a stitch in your side from laughing, faking a sick day is no joke. One in four employers have caught an employee faking a sick day by checking his or her Twitter or other social media feeds. And one in five have fired a worker caught in a lie.

More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now.When it comes to retirement savings, 'later' is a bad word
Kelli B. Grant CNBC
Email
Procrastination can pay for last-minute sports tickets or 11th-hour holiday  bargains. But when it comes to retirement savings? Bad idea.
More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for  retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now, according to a new  Wells Fargo survey. Worse, many aren't saving at all—34 percent of the 1,001  adults surveyed aren't currently setting money aside for retirement and 20  percent have no retirement savings. The median balance among savers is $20,000,  down from $25,000 last year.

Don't procrastinate when it comes to saving for retirement. Save early, save often.
"That's a big problem," said Joe Ready, director of institutional retirement  and trust for Wells Fargo. "You're already not saving enough, so you're kicking  this empty can down the road."
Postponements can make a big difference in your final account balance. By  Ready's calculations, a 25-year-old who saves $100 per month until he retires at  65, with a 6.5 percent annual return, would have accumulated more than $225,000.  Wait until age 40 to start those contributions, and the balance would be a much  slimmer $75,000.
"I don't know how much of this is survival and [how much is] the mindset that  they'll be able to catch up over their career trajectory," said Lazetta Rainey  Braxton, a certified financial planner in Baltimore, Md. Of course, the basic  advice is to save more, but strategies can vary depending on which of those two  categories you fall into. 
Video: TODAY financial editor Jean Chatzky offers advice on how to live comfortably in retirement, suggesting waiting until you’re 70 to collect Social Security benefits.
Consumers who don't feel like they have any wiggle room in their budget to  save for retirement will benefit from analyzing their cash flow and looking for  areas to cut back. "It's pretty basic. Either you increase your income or  decrease your expenses," said Rainey Braxton. Even small amounts can add  up over years of compounding—especially with advantages like a 401(k) employer  match.
Although consumers expressed concerns over balancing savings and regular  monthly bills, survey results indicate there's some fat to be cut: 56  percent said that "later" they would cut splurges such as spa treatments and  jewelry to save more for retirement, and 55 percent would dine out less  frequently. Half also said they would postpone big purchases like a home  renovation or car.

Consumers who have concrete expectations of having more disposable  income in a few years—say, after a college-bound child's final tuition payment  or once they've moved up the career ladder—still need to plan. Later  contributions have less time to grow, meaning you'll need to contribute more to  have the same ending balance as if you'd started today. Freezing current  expenses can help capitalize on those raises and windfalls, said Rainey Braxton.  
In either case, it can help to have a written plan, something as simple as  "I'm currently saving $X per month, and want to get to $Y," said Ready. The 28  percent of survey respondents who had such a plan were setting aside a median  $250 a month, compared with $100 among those who didn't.

Feder: New CBS channel turns back timeThat’s the way it was: New CBS channel turns back time

Walter Cronkite
Walter Cronkite will be back on TV. And I for one couldn’t be happier.
That’s the headline as far as I’m concerned out of news this week that CBS is launching a new digital network called Decades in partnership with Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting.
Set to debut this spring on a digital subchannel of WBBM-Channel 2 and 15 other CBS-owned stations nationwide, Decades will feature news and entertainment programming culled from the network’s vast library and organized around theme and dates. It will mark the first time CBS 2 is utilizing its digital tiers.
Neal Sabin, vice chairman of Weigel Broadcasting and the programming genius behind MeTV, Me-Too, The U and the just-launched Heroes & Icons, among other channels, said he hopes to air as many of Cronkite’s vintage broadcasts as possible, including perhaps nightly runs of the “CBS Evening News” from the Cronkite era. Way to go, Neal.
Revered by millions as “The Most Trusted Man in America,” Cronkite stepped down as anchorman of the “CBS Evening News” in 1981 and died in 2009 at age 92. But his archive of work represents an unparalleled record of the second half of the 20th century.
Neal Sabin
“The overall concept of Decades is to create a daily time capsule of historical events of all types — hard news, pop culture and entertainment,” Sabin said. “Our relationship with CBS News will enable Decades to tell these stories via legendary journalists such as Walter Cronkite. Viewers will relive — or for younger viewers, experience for the first time — how events large and small were first brought to the attention of the American public.”
A centerpiece of the network will be “Decades Retrospectical,” a daily one-hour program that will be produced around the news events and cultural touchstones of a specific day, week or theme. Shows presented each day will reflect that day’s theme or commemorative event, according to CBS.
Entertainment programming will be drawn from among more than 100 classic series going as far back as “I Love Lucy,” which debuted in 1951.
“Decades is the most ambitious and creative subchannel programming service that has ever been created,” Peter Dunn, president of CBS Television Stations, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Weigel Broadcasting, the leaders in this space, to make smart use of our stations’ spectrums and our companies’ considerable programming assets. This service will be a tremendous new business for CBS and all of the other stations across the country that participate, regardless of their primary network affiliation.”
Added Sabin: “In a video marketplace filled with more and more trivial information and exploitation, Decades will showcase substance and class, and have some fun in doing so.”

Should Retailers Be Scared of the Amazon Storereddit
In 2003, founder and CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos coined the word 'unstore' to describe what made Amazon unique. It's a philosophy he has run his business by over the last 20 years; limitless shelf space, always on, reviewable, and cheap. Seemingly no longer content with dominating online retail, Bezos has moved away from his founding philosophy to launch a physical store, just in time for Christmas. Situated in the heart of New York, the shop will let customers purchase Amazon branded products and take advantage of a same day click and collect service.
I'm just not feeling it. Although it might be a growing trend for online retailers to exploit the frenzied xmas market with a pop up presence on the high street, I just don't think Amazon can live up to its own expectations when it comes to the bricks and mortar store. Amazon has perfected the art of ecommerce, taking away the risk of buying stuff online, and making it seamless, accessible, and low priced. While it does ecommerce exceptionally well, retail experience it does not.
As Amazon has done for online, a store such as Selfridges has refined the art of the department store. The experience is just that - an experience. People flock to Selfridges, not just to shop but to socialise and be entertained, making Selfridges a place to be. Of course I shop online all the time, but I don't get excited by it in the same way I do when I see the lavish displays to celebrate Halloween or of course Christmas. It's sometimes just good to potter and be part of the store, be part of the experience of consuming.
Amazon's store as it stands is never going to excite me.  Whilst the store will I'm sure bring the online retail giant some benefits, it just doesn't sit well with the Amazon brand - the 'unstore'. The store in New York ultimately will only be granting access to a smaller range of their products slightly sooner than they offer online - how is this better than what they are currently offering?
As bricks and mortar retail becomes more about the customer experience, it naturally follows that it is the brand stores that are delivering. Take Nike for example, or Apple. They both ensure that retail experience reflects the brand and all it stands for. Their product is their holy grail, and the stores focus on the product, not the cost. A cluttered store centred around bargains and money off will reduce the experience. Simple.
If Amazon was to build a store around its brand, it would be a store that is always open, has huge amount of product and is cheap. I just don't see how, on the basis of where Amazon is coming from; never having created a physical store before, never having built a brand beyond online, never having looked at the physical experience of the customer; they will be able to execute a store that will be any better, or any different to anyone else.
The store in New York has built the hype around Amazon once again, and in its twentieth year of trading, Amazon knows the best way to be talked about is by being forward thinking, just look at the announcement of the 30 minute delivery by drone.
Bezos is a smart guy. I mean really smart. He is an exceptional individual. With his intellect and business philosophy, if Bezos really did decided to take Amazon to the high street, then that store would also be exceptional. And it is at that point, and that point only, that retailers should take note.
Now? This store is about hype, not retail.

12 retail chains that are closing stores12 retail chains closing stores the fastest

AP/Sears
Sears stores continue to be even more of an endangered species as the retailer closes more locations.
And Sears isn’t alone.
There are 12 retailers in the very broad Russell 3000 index, including Sears (SHLD) , apparel seller Christopher & Banks (CBK) and toy builder Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) that have fewer stores now than they had two years ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Keep in mind that this analysis only evaluated retailers that reported the number of stores they had open in the most recent quarter and two years ago. Many retailers only disclose their number of stores on an annual basis, so they were excluded due to the lack of data. Sears disputes recent reports of store closures , but the company’s financial reports show the chain has been shrinking.
Investors are certainly not pleased when retailers shut stores. That’s almost guaranteed to cut revenue. Shares of the 12 retailers that have closed stores over the past two years are down an average of 3.7% this year as investors shift their retail money to companies that are growing.
Sears is the fastest shrinking retailer — by far. It reported 2,302 stores as of its latest quarter, S&P Capital IQ says, which is down 40% over the past two years. Just this year the stock is down 27%.
Women’s apparel seller Christopher & Banks has reduced its store footprint by 16% over the past two years. It reported 545 stores as of its most-recent quarter. The stock is down almost as much as Sears’ this year: 25.8%.
But closing stores isn’t always bad news. Build-your-own teddy-bear shop Build-A-Bear Workshop has taken its store count down 11.4% over the past two years. But it’s been focusing on high-traffic areas mostly in tourist areas. The stock has doubled this year as the company’s cash flow has improved as it drives more profit from fewer stores.

Bigger not always better for 26 companiesBigger not always better for 26 companies

Earnings season is a chance to see which companies are dominating their industries. But investors are currently trying to figure out if size is an edge, or a disadvantage.
There are 26 stocks in the broad Russell 1000 index, including shoemaker Nike (NKE) , Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) that dwarf the competition in terms of revenue, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
To make the list, the companies need to post at least triple the revenue of their nearest competitor in the same industry classification. To make it a fair fight, the industry also must have more than one company in it. The list shows the companies that have gained enormous revenue leads over their industry peers.
But here’s where things get complicated in today’s market. Investors might think that bigger is better. And in some ways it is – in terms of giving the titan companies resources and reach. But so far this year, having a big size advantage over the competition hasn’t automatically translated into stock market gains. The opposite is actually the case.
These 26 biggest-in-class stocks are up 0.4% on average this year, which is underperforming the S&P 500’s 4.3% increase. Investors are closely watching these companies to see if size ends up as an advantage as the economic recovery ages, or if there’s a shift going on where smaller companies win out by being able to more quickly change and adapt.
There’s good reason for the confusion. Warren Buffett has long preferred industry giants — as they have massive size to conquer rivals. But consider one of Warren Buffett’s picks that isn’t working out so well this year: International Business Machines (IBM) , is the leader in the IT Consulting industry. It’s 225% larger than the No. 2, Accenture (ACN) . But shares of IBM are down 14% this year. Accenture is down too, but not nearly as much: 5.8%.
Here’s another example of an industry titan struggling. Amazon.com’s revenue of $145.7 billion over the past 12 months is 979% higher than the next biggest player: Priceline.com. This huge lead over competitors gives Amazon the luxury to experience with money-losing propositions it hopes will pay off in the future. Investors will be paying attention to how the company is using its lead when it reports quarterly results Thursday. But shares of Amazon — despite the company towering over any of its online rivals — are down 22% this year.
But that’s not to say size has universally been a detriment. Buffett, the king of looking for companies with defensible positions, crushes the competition himself. His Berkshire Hathaway posted revenue of more than $342 billion over the past 12 months, which is 1468% greater than the closest rival in the Multi-Sector holdings industry, Leucadia (LUK) . And shares of Berkshire are well ahead of the market this year, gaining 16.1%.
Investors, too, know that size can give companies advantages in purchasing and distribution. Nike is a classic example of a company that’s pulled ahead like a nimble rival. Despite efforts by rivals to challenge the company’s dominance of the shoe business, Nike posted 1,714% more revenue over the past twelve months than the second biggest player in the footwear industry – Ugg boots maker Deckers (DECK) . Nike is up 14% this year, making it one of the year’s stand-out big companies in all the S&P 500.
This year has shown that just because a company is ahead of its rivals by a mile in terms of revenue doesn’t mean it will be a winner for investors. Part of the complication is that it’s increasingly common for leaders in one industry to poach at rivals in other industries. Amazon and Google, for instance, are swiping at each other’s mobile businesses even though they’re not in the same industry. There’s also the danger that Staples (SPLS) faces – – dominating an industry, selling office supplies in physical stores, that’s in decline.
But it at least helps to know where companies stand.

Equity Firm Says Twitter Bailed on Share Sale
By LORRAINE BAILEY 
Tweet
 
     (CN) - A Cayman Islands-based private equity firm says Twitter backed out of a deal to sell it $100 million in pre-IPO shares in order to sign a similar deal with BlackRock, an investor the equity firm originally recruited.
     1 Oak Private Equity Venture Capital, serving as manager for Bluebird Access 1 LP, sued Twitter, Inc. in New Castle County, Delaware on October 22.
     1Oak manages money for high-net worth individuals and institutional investors. Its New Digital Age Fund invests in late stage, pre-IPO internet and mobile investments.
     "In around early 2012, 1OAK began discussions with Twitter about an arrangement under which 1OAK would assemble and vet a group of sophisticated investors who would invest a minimum of $100 million to purchase pre-IPO Twitter shares from Twitter employees or Series A and/or B early stage investors," the firm says.
     This deal would allow Twitter employees to immediately profit on their shares, avoiding post-IPO restrictions, and give Twitter a new set of shareholders with whom it had already negotiated share restrictions, such as proxy voting rights, according to the complaint.
     Twitter drafted an Approved Buyer Agreement in April 2012, after vetting 1Oak's qualifications as an eligible purchaser. It allegedly encouraged 1Oak to raise the $100 million as quickly as possible.
     "1OAK proceeded to spend substantial time, effort, money and reputation assembling an investor pool to acquire Twitter pre-IPO employee shares - a pool which ultimately far exceeded the minimum $100 million that Twitter said would be required. In September/October 2012, 1OAK provided Twitter with documents reflecting that 1OAK had obtained investor commitments for $500 million," 1Oak claims.
     1Oak returned the Approved Buyer Agreement to Twitter on April 8, 2012, but Twitter never signed it. However, the social media website continued to assure 1Oak that it was committed to the deal for the next six months.
     In October, 1Oak recruited BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, to invest in Twitter through 1Oak's Fund. BlackRock entered into a non-disclosure agreement with 1Oak on October 17, 2012.
     Five days later, "Twitter abruptly informed BlackRock that Twitter would terminate 1OAK's status as an 'approved buyer,' which predictably caused BlackRock to cease working with 1OAK. Twitter began to work with BlackRock directly.
     "In January 2013, Twitter and BlackRock announced an $80 million pre-IPO share purchase transaction with Twitter employees, which was the type of investment that Twitter agreed that 1OAK would develop and for which: (1) 1OAK had been designated the approved buyer by Twitter; (2) 1OAK developed and procured BlackRock's interest in an investment to be made through 1OAK; and (3) 1OAK disclosed BlackRock's interest to Twitter under a non-disclosure agreement that precluded Twitter from using confidential customer information except for a potential business transaction involving 1OAK," the firm says.
     Twitter denied 1Oak's demand that it be permitted to participate in its deal with BlackRock, 1Oak claims.
     The social media site set its IPO price at $26 a share. It now trades at $50 a share.
     1Oak seeks punitive damages for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith, promissory estoppel, and interference with prospective business advantage.
     It is represented by Theodore Kittila with Greenhill Law Group in Wilmington, Delaware, and Jeffrey Makoff with Valle Makoff in San Francisco.

There are 12 retailers in the very broad Russell 3000 index, including Sears (SHLD) , apparel seller Christopher & Banks (CBK) and toy builder Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) that have fewer stores now than they had two years ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Keep in mind that this analysis only evaluated retailers that reported the number of stores they had open in the most recent quarter and two years ago. Many retailers only disclose their number of stores on an annual basis, so they were excluded due to the lack of data. Sears disputes recent reports of store closures , but the company’s financial reports show the chain has been shrinking.
Investors are certainly not pleased when retailers shut stores. That’s almost guaranteed to cut revenue. Shares of the 12 retailers that have closed stores over the past two years are down an average of 3.7% this year as investors shift their retail money to companies that are growing.
Sears is the fastest shrinking retailer — by far. It reported 2,302 stores as of its latest quarter, S&P Capital IQ says, which is down 40% over the past two years. Just this year the stock is down 27%.
Women’s apparel seller Christopher & Banks has reduced its store footprint by 16% over the past two years. It reported 545 stores as of its most-recent quarter. The stock is down almost as much as Sears’ this year: 25.8%.
But closing stores isn’t always bad news. Build-your-own teddy-bear shop Build-A-Bear Workshop has taken its store count down 11.4% over the past two years. But it’s been focusing on high-traffic areas mostly in tourist areas. The stock has doubled this year as the company’s cash flow has improved as it drives more profit from fewer stores.

Home prices in 70 Chinese cities fell year over year in September for the first time in nearly two years, and developers are cutting prices to lure new buyers.
Berkshire Hathaway has sunk $15 billion into renewable energy  and may double that amount via Berkshire Hathaway Energy, run by Greg Abel, a 52-year-old Canadian and candidate to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO.
Speaking of Berkshire Hathaway, Charles Munger, Buffett’s longtime partner and sidekick, is giving $65 million to Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Physics is vitally important,” Munger says. “Everyone knows that.”

How Chipotle Has Revolutionized The Way We EatOne Way Chipotle Has Completely Revolutionized How We Eat
Posted:
reddit
Judging by our eating habits, we've become a nation of adult babies eating pre-cut food out of bowls.
Instead of sitting in highchairs toying with our cooked beef and rice, we shovel our lunches into our mouths while typing at computers in open-plan offices or robotically scrolling through our News Feeds.
Always an option at home and some restaurants, the bowl meal truly launched a decade ago when Chipotle first introduced its burrito bowl, a diners’ choice of rice, beans, meat, salsa and other fixings mixed up in a bowl. Chipotle now sells more bowls than burritos, according to Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the chain. Though Chipotle doesn't break out revenue by menu item, its success overall has been meteoric -- with revenue rising about 11 percent from $2.73 billion in 2012 to $3.04 billion so far this year.
Sales of so-called Mexican bowls at fast-casual restaurants went up 14 percent over the past two years, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. The number of chains offering "Asian bowls" with ingredients like noodles, chicken, rice and vegetables grew 8 percent over the same period, according to Technomic. Chipotle’s Asian-themed spinoff, ShopHouse, exclusively sells bowls comprised of a base of rice, noodles or salad mixed with a protein like grilled chicken satay, vegetables and a choice of curry and tamarind sauces.

Besides just tasting good, the bowls play into some recent dining trends: the rise of gluten-free eating and the popularity of protein over carbs as people turn away from bread-heavy sandwiches. We're also increasingly picky, and a setup with a base of grain or lettuce and a choice of toppings allows us to dictate our meals to our exact preferences.
Perhaps more importantly, bowls are also perfect for workers looking for meals they can eat easily at their desks.
“No one is sitting down and eating a meal you have to cut up into little pieces,” said Kira Fisher, who runs the blog Sad Desk Lunch , which succinctly sums up the bowl trend. “It takes a lot of space to eat like a proper person.”
Some industry observers dismiss the bowl meal as trend. But it hints at more troubling concerns, said Marlene Schwartz, the director at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.
Part of the recommended treatment for obesity and eating disorders is to “sit at a table without the television on and actually eat your food with a knife and fork,” Schwartz said. “The fact that that’s part of the treatment means that we’ve really moved away from it” as a society, she added.
Forking a mixture of rice, vegetables and meat into your mouth while looking at email or making phone calls isn’t an ideal way to eat, according to Schwartz. “People do tend to eat more and not realize how much they’re eating” if they’re distracted by another task, she said.
It’s true that in some cultures, people regularly eat stews, noodles and sushi without a knife and fork, and those meals are often unrushed family or even community events. But the elimination of the knife and the move towards the bowl at fast food and fast-casual restaurants is largely a Western invention of convenience.
Traditional fast food restaurants are on trend, too. The number of fast food restaurants offering a "bowl meal" grew by 5.6 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Dataessential, a Chicago-based firm that tracks food industry trends.
Taco Bell launched a Cantina Power Menu earlier this year, which includes a selection of steak, chicken and veggie bowls featuring lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and rice. KFC has offered its “famous bowl” line -- a mix of mashed potatoes, bite-sized crispy chicken pieces, gravy and cheese -- since 2006.
Many of the submissions coming into Fisher’s blog celebrate the old-school bowl meal: leftovers of a meat and rice stew or lasagna that were better the night before. “There’s always been casseroles and one-dish meals,” said Mary Chapman, senior director of product innovation at Technomic. “How it’s positioned is new.”
A sampling of the classic one-dish bowl lunch:
Part of the appeal of the bowls offered in fast-casual and fast food restaurants is that they can stand in for many of the standard lunch items, Chapman said. They’re “a way to have a big giant sandwich without having to hold it in your hand” or “a healthful alternative without having to be a salad,” she said.
But the rise in restaurants offering a bunch of ingredients mixed up in a bowl is “pure trend” that’s liable to go out of fashion, said David Just, a behavioral economist at Cornell University who has studied why people eat what they do.
“It’s trying to play to a modern idea of what’s beautiful and attractive,” Just said, noting that bowls also allow restaurants to rein in portion sizes because it takes less food to make a bowl look full.
And customers seemed convinced. A group of 16-year-old boys having their first-ever off-campus lunch at a Manhattan Chipotle one recent afternoon bragged about their ability to game the system by ordering bowls. “They give you more if you get the bowl,” one said. “I got it literally every day this summer,” another noted. An 18-year-old NYU student having a quick lunch by himself cited similar reasons for choosing a bowl instead of a burrito. “It’s more calories, more bang for your buck,” he said.
(That may be more perception than reality. According to Chipotle’s calorie calculator, burrito bowls typically have about 300 fewer calories than burritos.)
Out of 13 people who went through the line in about a 15-minute period during the lunch rush at the restaurant, just four ordered burritos. The other nine opted for bowls.
Even Mitt Romney gets a burrito bowl at Chipotle.
Eating without a plate, knife and fork has become so ubiquitous, we may have actually reached peak bowl. While the number of bowls on the menus of fast food and fast-casual chains grew between 2010 and 2014, it declined in fine dining restaurants, according to research from Datassential, a Chicago-based firm that studies food industry trends.
Once a trend starts to fall off in more expensive eateries, that typically means it’s saturated the market as much as it’s going to, according to Christin Groh, a senior manager on the MenuTrends team at Datassential. “It may end up tapering off,” Groh said. “In recent years, penetration has really remained flat.”
Still that doesn’t mean bowls are disappearing from restaurants like Chipotle any time soon. As Cornell's Just said, diners "are looking for things that are easy to eat and go without much thought.”

The Tragic Reality Of Americans  Vacation DaysAmericans Are Taking Fewer Vacation Days Than At Any Point In Nearly 4 Decades
Reuters
reddit
WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Americans took the least  amount of vacation time in almost four decades last year,  forfeiting billions of dollars in compensation without scoring  points with their bosses, according to an industry group  analysis released on Tuesday.
The report for the U.S. Travel Association said the average  American with paid time off (PTO) used 16 of 20.9 vacation days  in 2013, down from an average of 20.3 days off from 1976 to  2000. It added that 169 million days of permanently forfeited  U.S. vacation time equated to $52.4 billion in lost benefits.
"By choosing to work instead of taking PTO, employees are  essentially working for their employers for free," the analysis  said.
The report did not give a reason for the drop in vacation  time but the fall coincided with the 2007-2009 recession and a  slow economic recovery. An Ipsos/Reuters survey in 2010 found  that only 57 percent of Americans used all their vacation time.
Wealthier workers tend to earn more vacation days, and also  leave more of it on the table, according to the study. People  with an annual income of more than $150,000 failed to use an  average of 6.5 vacation days last year, while those with less  than $29,000 did not use 3.7 days on average.
Employees who foreited paid time off do not get more raises  or bonuses than those who take all their vacation time. They  also report higher levels of stress at work, the survey said.
"America's work martyrs aren't more successful. We need to  change our thinking. All work and no play is not going to get  you ahead - it's only going to get you more stress,"  Roger Dow,  president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a  statement accompanying the report.
The analysis was prepared by Oxford Economics, a forecasting  group. It used Labor Department data and a June survey of 1,303  workers by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications in  conjunction with Oxford Economics.

Models say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cycloneModels say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cyclone
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 21:  
A day after its genesis, a rogue low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea is forecast to become a tropical cyclone by a number of weather models.
India Met Department appears to take the brewing cyclone to the northwest Arabian Sea for a likely landfall over the Yemen-Oman coast in another week’s time.
Likely target
But two other leading models suspect that the system may steer to the north-northeast and strike south Gujarat around Surat and adjoining Mumbai in a week’s time.
These are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a Global Forecast Model of the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction.
India Met has located the low-pressure area to the southeast Arabian Sea and neighbourhood and has put it already under watch for intensification.
The ‘low’ would strengthen a round to a well-marked ‘low’ by tomorrow and further into a depression two days later, according to a bulletin issued this afternoon.
India Met watch
But wind field projections depicted on its site hint its onward intensification as a likely tropical cyclone tracking away from the Indian coast in a west-northwest direction towards the Arabian Gulf, along the Yemen-Oman coastline.
The two other models stick their neck out suggesting that the cyclone would actually steer mid-course towards north-northeast and hit South Gujarat-Mumbai.
The timeline for the landfall in this manner is also around the month-end, around October 29-30, according to the European and US model forecasts.
Drains moisture
Meanwhile, the brewing weather system in the Arabian Sea has drained the south peninsula of some moisture.
This morning, an upper air cyclonic circulation has formed once again off the Sri Lanka coast, which should bring rain to parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep today.
There is also the presence of the rain-friendly Madden-Julian Oscillation wave in the higher levels over the tropical Indian Ocean/west Arabian Sea.
According to the Met, the heavy rain may lift from tomorrow as the away-looking ‘low’ in the Arabian Sea starts intensifying.
Outlook for a counterpart ‘low’ in the Andaman Sea is retained, but models are not very confident about it since the entire activity is now shifting to the Arabian Sea.

Microsoft Co-Founder Bumps Ebola Effort to $100 Millionmicrosoft co-founder bumps ebola effort to $100 million
Billionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight EbolaBillionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight Ebola
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls Ebola 'unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced'
Paul Allen, billionaire owner of sports teams and mega yachts, on Thursday pledged at least $100 million to fight Ebola in what is believed to be the largest private foundation gift to combat the deadly disease and support healthcare workers in West Africa.
The co-founder of Microsoft — who regularly inhabits lists of the richest and most generous Americans — has already donated an estimated $26.5 million toward his pledge, including $12.9 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $3.6 million to UNICEF, $2.8 million to the International Red Cross and $1.3 million to Doctors Without Borders.
It was an epidemiologist¿s worst nightmare: one of the world¿s deadliest contagious diseases loose in one of the world¿s most densely populated and sometimes chaotic megacities ¿ Lagos, Nigeria. ( Robyn Dixon )
“The Ebola virus is unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced and needs a response unlike anything we have ever seen,” Allen said in a statement. “I am committed to tackling Ebola until it is stopped.”
The disease, which has spurred worldwide panic, travel restrictions and a scramble by hospitals and health agencies to contain it and prepare for its possible spread, is generally transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.
8
The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is believed to have infected nearly 10,000 people and claimed more than 4,800 lives, with the highest death toll in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. It pegs the cost of fighting the disease at $975 million.
WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said his organization “welcomes all financial and technical support in our efforts to save the lives of those infected with Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and to halt the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible. We need funds, and we need foreign medical teams most of all, to staff the 50 Ebola treatment centers now operating or under construction.”
With so many people possibly affected by this particularly deadly disease, funds have been hard to come by, especially from smaller donors who often step up to help in times of crisis.
“The small American donors are simply not there,” said Jack Shakely, president emeritus of the California Community Foundation. “It takes a wealthy donor to step up to the plate.”
Shakely is also a board member of Operation USA, a global relief organization that has sent medical supplies to Liberia, and he describes Ebola as “one of those horrible, horrible problems that can be fixed. [Allen] tends to be one of a group of social entrepreneurs who like to see results. This $100 million could, in fact, effect amazing results.”
How dare those .01%ers donate their money for a cause. This is a job for the gov't
Barry3
1
The $100-million pledge by the owner of the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers is the latest in a stream of donations by wealthy individuals and foundations, many with ties to technology.
Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million to the CDC Foundation, noting on his Facebook page that the deadly disease “could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed.”
In September, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $50 million to support the emergency response to the disease, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation committed $5 million. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave $1 million in August.
Allen plans to partner with the University of Massachusetts Medical School to provide medical workers and laboratory equipment in Liberia, with a particular focus on making sure that local hospitals are outfitted with decontamination equipment.
He also will fund the development and manufacture of two medevac containment units to evacuate medical workers from West Africa, what Dune Ives, senior director of Allen’s Vulcan Philanthropy, calls “safety cocoons.”
“As we started looking early on at what it is going to take, we recognized we need more trained healthcare workers to go to West Africa,” Ives said. “Personally, unless I knew I had safety and support to get back home if I got infected, I would think twice.”
The medevac units fit into airplanes and carry the kind of equipment and staff seen in hospital rooms, Ives said, adding that “right now, there is one plane that can safely medevac infected healthcare workers back to their country of origin. We wanted to provide the assurance of safe transport.”
One goal of Allen’s is to urge others to donate — individuals of modest means, corporations, foundations, the super-rich. To that end he has set up an online donation platform at TackleEbola.com to allow individuals to give money to specific areas of need.
“Time is not our ally in this fight,” Allen said in a blog posted Thursday. “The time is now to do the right thing. So let’s do this.”

Microsoft Sales Beat Street Hopes  Cloud Profits UpYou are here: Home Corporates
Microsoft Sales Beat Street Hopes, Cloud Profits Up
Reuters | Updated On: October 24, 2014 08:04 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Seattle:
Microsoft Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.
The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.
Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 per cent over the past year, rose another 3 per cent in after-hours trading to $46.36.
"In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.
Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp and SAP about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.
Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 per cent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 per cent.
Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 per cent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.
In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 per cent from above 80 per cent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.
"We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates," said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.
Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. "Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility," he said.
PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE
Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 per cent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.
Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July, to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 per cent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.
Revenue rose 25 per cent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter.

Police: Gunman Acted Alone In Ottawa Shootingreddit
Canadian authorities confirmed early Thursday that there was only one shooter in Wednesday's horrific attack in Ottawa, the Associated Press reported.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was shot dead after opening fire near the Canadian Parliament building, killing Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and wounding three other people.
An Ottawa police spokesman had previously told HuffPost that they were looking for multiple possible suspects, but would not confirm the news later in a press conference.
Witnesses say Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo near the National War Memorial at point-blank range on Wednesday morning before being chased inside the Canadian Parliament building, where he was killed by Kevin Vickers, a sergeant-at-arms.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper characterized the attack as an act of terrorism and vowed a renewed crackdown on terrorist activity.
"This will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats," Harper said in a televised address late on Wednesday.

Officials told the Globe and Mail that the Canadian government had been monitoring Zehaf-Bibeau over potential suspicious activity. He was deemed a "high-risk traveler" and had his passport taken away.
The Associated Press reports that court records appear to indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau had a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes.
A friend told the Globe and Mail that Zehaf-Bibeau had experienced a religious reawakening of late. Senior U.S. officials confirmed to the New York Times that he had recently converted to Islam.
In a brief interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother said she was crying for the victim's of Wednesday's attack, not for her son.
"Can you ever explain something like this?" she said. "We are sorry."
Wednesday's shooting came just days after a similar attack in Quebec, where Martin Rouleau-Couture attacked two soldiers with his car, killing one, before being apprehended by police. Rouleau-Couture was also a recent convert to Islam who was being monitored by federal authorities.

India Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment BankIndia Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment Bank
PTI
Tweet
Beijing, Oct 24:  
India Inc today welcomed the country’s participation in the newly—established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) saying it will help to leverage badly needed funds for infrastructure development.
The moot point is that large economy like India really needs financing badly as it requires over a trillion USD for infrastructure development, A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said today.
India along 20 other countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be its founding member.
“It is a very positive development in the sense that it opens up more borrowing opportunities. As another window of financing we welcome it,” Singh told PTI.
“There is tremendous requirement of funding in India for the a trillion USD infrastructure development. It is not possible for the Indian banking sector to manage that kind of investment,” despite the presence of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral financing bodies.
“More is required beyond that. Therefore, if we get support from the BRICS Development Bank and AIIB offer further options and availability of finance which we need to tap into,” he said.
Singh, who is here to attend a separate event, said it will be mostly private sector which will access such funding.
“They will do it on terms favourable, transparent and good for them.”
But bank need to function on certain norms of governance, standards and transparency, he said.
Singh said India should access investments from China as it is plush with funds.
“China is a large economy with trade and manufacturing prowess. It also has funds which we have to recognise.
Therefore, businesses in India can leverage that funding also it will be one more addition to technology and market related relations.”
India along with 20 other countries today signed an agreement to become founding members of the China—backed AIIB to aid the infrastructure development in the Asian region and reduce the dependence on Western—dominated World Bank and IMF.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Cong chief: Chidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014

Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

Government considering changing protocols for aid workers who return to the U.S. after fighting EbolaBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”

Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Diwali gift: Flats  cars  jewellery to `loyal staffersSurat-based diamond firm Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd gave away gifts including Fiat cars to its employees at a function held on Sunday at the company's private lawns..
Ahmedabad, Oct 20:  
They all waited in their hundreds with bated breath in that sprawling lawn in Surat, awaiting the ‘divine’ announcement from the generous pauper-turned-diamond king and returned home as happy owners of cars, flats and gold-and-diamond jewellery worth a total of Rs 50 crore on Sunday.
In what was, perhaps, the most generous Diwali gift event anywhere in India in recent history, as Savjibhai Dholakia, a diamond worker-turned-merchant, gifted those valuables to the nearly 1,200 employees of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd who passed the ‘loyalty test’. The venue looked like a vast car mela as shining vehicles awaited their owners. Each rewardee returned with a Diwali gift worth Rs 4 lakh.
People recalled it like a Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL’s) AGMs held in a stadium in the past, as Savjibhai doled out jaw-dropping goodies as rewards to his ‘best performing’ employees.
“We don’t look at it as a bonus or incentive. But we call it a Loyalty Programme, under which we recognise our employees who have contributed great value to the growth of this company by constantly upgrading their skills over these years,” Dholakia told BusinessLine on Monday.
The company, which has over 6,000 employees in Surat alone and another 3,000 in Mumbai and across the world, had organised a grand celebration on Sunday at its huge private lawn inside Hari Krishna Complex on the outskirts of Surat. The 1,200 employees who were qualified for the ‘Loyalty Programme’ were given three options to choose from: a Fiat Punto car, part-payment for a 2-BHK flat or gold and diamond jewellery.
“We wanted our employee to live a complete life with own house and a car. Hence, the company offered Rs 4 lakh contribution for purchase of a 2-BHK flat. Those who already had a house, we offered them a Fiat car worth about Rs 4 lakh. And those who had both, we rewarded them with jewellery worth the same amount,” said Dholakia, who had bargained hard with Fiat dealer for a heavy discount.
Around 491 employees opted for cars, 207 preferred taking company’s contribution for new flat and the remaining over 500 employees chose to take jewellery.
Interestingly these employees hold job profiles ranging from diamond polishing worker to marketing executive and office executives - most of them drawing a minimum monthly salary of Rs 60,000. About 60 per cent of his total workforce is from Saurashtra, while many workers hail from North Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Dholakia had began Hari Krishna Exports in 1991 after 10 years of rigorous diamond polishing work. Today, he claims to achieve the sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore from diamond exports for the fiscal 2014-15. Its jewellery vertical has a turnover of about Rs 700 crore.
As a recognition of the contribution of his employees to his company’s success, Dholakia introduced the Loyalty Programme two years ago. In the first year, three diamond polishing workers were gifted cars, while last year this number went up to 72.
Meanwhile, Dholakia has also set up an in-house institute, which runs one/two-year courses on diamond polishing and overall diamond polishing engineering for those interested to take up diamond polishing as a profession.
“We guarantee that trained at our institute, the person will surely get a job with starting salary of at least Rs 50,000 per month,” added Dholakia

Women wary of anti-poverty schemesWomen wary of anti-poverty schemes
Deepti KC
Incorporating women: Greater awareness and tangible results are factors to consider. AKHILESH KUMAR
They drop out on account of cultural taboos and lack of follow up efforts by implementing agencies
Despite opportunities and systematic community-driven handholding support from the Government and non-government bodies, women might still choose not to participate in the economic development process. Under the purview of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the world’s largest poverty alleviation initiative, the Government and NGOs are targeting women from the poorest households in the economic development process. One such project is the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) or Project JEEViKA.
Implemented in select districts of Bihar, the project facilitates the formation of women-based self-help groups (SHGs) federated at the village level to form village organisations (VOs). VOs receive investments from the project and play a vital role in implementing livelihoods interventions. Additionally, village resource persons (VRPs) are engaged to provide technical assistance to SHG members.
To understand what influences women’s willingness to participate in economic development programmes, we interviewed 613 SHG women from 24 villages in three districts of Bihar, where the project was introduced more than four years ago. The sample is not representative; ; nevertheless, the challenges we have recognised in these 24 villages could work as lessons for all.
Missing links
Half the women we interviewed were from landless households, and amongst those who owned land, the average land size was not more than half an acre. Thus, the project has been exceptionally successful in mobilising women from the poorest households in its community structure. However, a majority of the women, despite being informed about the livelihoods intervention, were not engaged.
JEEViKA’s most promoted intervention, system of crop intensification (SCI), was adopted only by 27 per cent of women, of whom half had discontinued the service. For many, it was due to lack of adequate land (60 per cent). This casts a serious doubt on the concept of farm innovation alone being the right kind of innovation for women belonging to landless or near landless households. JEEViKA has acknowledged this concern and so it also promotes off-farm and non-farm interventions such as poultry farming, agarbatti-making and so on. However, the data implies that participation has been less than satisfactory. Firstly, cultural barriers and taboos discouraged women from participating. For example, despite being affordable, only 8 per cent took up poultry farming; 43 per cent reported they did not want to share their household space with chickens as it affected their social status within the caste system.
Another constraint was lack of time. The project started the kitchen garden initiative in order to enable women to grow a variety of vegetables in their own premises. The project provides free or subsidised seeds and other technical support. Despite this, only 4 per cent of women adopted the initiative, mainly because many perceived it as requiring extra time and energy, and not providing any immediate income.
At the same time, many women felt that enterprise-based intervention could help them generate immediate income. However, there were no active follow-ups provided. For example, 52 per cent reported that they had been waiting for the agarbatti-making enterprise to start, however, they had not heard about it from the resource persons. This clearly highlights the incongruity between the women’s needs and the opportunities being offered by the project.
Continuous support
We also found that participating women who frequently receive handholding support from resource persons were three times more likely to re-apply the technique. For example, 48 per cent of women who had previously adopted the SCI technique stopped re-applying. Of the women who were visited by the resource persons, 58 per cent re-applied, compared to 31 per cent who had not been visited. What is interesting is that 64 per cent of women who had adopted this technique reported an increase in the productivity of crops, yet this had no significant effect on the re-application.
Lastly, it has been observed that a woman who is in the SHG leadership position or receives support from the village organisations is more than twice as likely to participate in the intervention. The findings of the IFMR study clearly indicates that provisions of well-designed interventions do not guarantee participation. There are many factors that come into play that influence women’s decisions — cultural beliefs, perceived opportunity cost of the intervention, and handholding support they receive from the project’s stakeholders.
The implementers need to be aware of the factors. Failure to do so might not only affect its long-term success, but also systematically exclude the most disadvantaged women from participating in livelihood interventions.

Chicago revamps its SRO proposalChicago revamps its SRO proposal

Chicago's tweaked SRO proposal has more in it for developers
Tenants still to get cash in tweaked Chicago SRO proposal
Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants.
An ordinance that would make it more expensive to convert single-room-occupancy hotels in Chicago into market-rate housing moved closer to becoming law Monday with an endorsement from aldermen. ( John Byrne, Mary Ellen Podmolik )
Backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and introduced last month, the original proposal's long list of mandates would have barred the city from approving the demolition or conversion of an SRO to market-rate housing unless the owner set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents or paid the city $200,000 for each unit that should have been kept affordable.
That key requirement, deemed onerous by building owners who said they might mount a legal challenge, is gone from a revised proposal circulated among housing groups, building owners and developers.
However, the proposed substitute Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance still offers protections and cash payments that range from $2,000 to $10,600, depending on the circumstances, to displaced tenants who have lived in a building for at least 32 days.
8
Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy chief, said set-aside requirements were not needed to accomplish the city's goal, which is to preserve the stock of affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods. "The right-to-purchase section really gets at our concern, buildings that are housing vulnerable populations but are in areas that are growing," he said. "Now there's an early warning system."
0
Owners who choose to sell a building would have three options. They could  negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days with a representative of tenants like a nonprofit group that would keep the entire building affordable. If those talks produce no agreement, the owner could sell to another buyer within the next 90 days with no affordable-unit restrictions. If no sale occurs in those 90 days, the owner would have to again start the process of finding a buyer that would keep the building affordable.
Or, owners could bypass the first two options and sell the building to whomever they choose. In that case, the buyer would have to pay to the city $20,000 per unit in preservation fees. In that scenario, each displaced long-term renter would receive $10,600.
Long-term tenants who are not given the opportunity to return to their building would receive a relocation payment of $2,000 or three months' rent, whichever is greater.
Shorter-term displaced tenants would get back their security deposits plus interest and any unpaid rent.
The revised proposal could be taken up by the city's housing and real estate committee next week. In July, the city passed a six-month moratorium on issuing building permits for projects other than normal maintenance while it developed protections for Chicago's supply of housing for its very-low and low-income residents. In the past three years, more than 2,000 rooms of housing have been converted to market-rate apartments. The city has said it wants to preserve at least 700 SRO units during the next five years.
"We recognized the reality that we needed to compromise," said Mary Tarullo, a community organizer with ONE Northside, a group working with the city to draft regulations. "We still think we have a strong ordinance. The goal is for these developments to be put into the hands of developers who are going to improve them and also keep them affordable."
Fees collected under the ordinance would be set aside in a fund from which SRO owners could seek forgivable loans for building rehabs.
Owners say the proposal still needs more tweaks. They say the 180-day sale negotiation period is too long and the potential $10,600 payment is too high and unfairly based on the Keep Chicago Renting ordinance when SROs, by their definition, house only one person in a unit.
"Before, the city said take it or leave it," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties. "The city is understanding better that the original version was lopsided and unfair and would drive these properties out of business. We still have a lot of work to do on this."

Amazon Fire Phone Proves To Be an Expensive Flopamazon fire phone proves to be an expensive flop
Cloud  lifts Microsoft earnings above expec...'Cloud' lifts Microsoft earnings above expectations
By Reuters | 24 Oct, 2014, 07.22AM IST
Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, easily beating analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEATTLE: Microsoft Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.
The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.
Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36.
"In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.
Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp and SAP about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.
Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 percent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 percent.
Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 percent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.
In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 percent from above 80 percent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.
"We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates," said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.
Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. "Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility," he said.
PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE
Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 percent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.
Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July, to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.
Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter.

Google is expanding its artificial intelligence initiative, hiring more than half a dozen leading academics and experts in the field and announcing a partnership with Oxford University to "accelerate" its efforts.
Google will make a "substantial contribution" to establish a research partnership with Oxford's computer science and engineering departments, the company said on Thursday regarding its work to develop the intelligence of machines and software, often to emulate human-like intelligence.
Google did not provide any financial details about the partnership, saying only in a post on its blog that it will include a program of student internships and a series of joint lectures and workshops "to share knowledge and expertise."

#google #oxford university #artificial intelligence
Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, is building up its artificial intelligence capabilities as it strives to maintain its dominance in the Internet search market and to develop new products such as robotics and self-driving cars. In January Google acquired artificial intelligence company Deep Mind for $400 million according to media reports.
The new hires will be joining Google's Deep Mind team, including three artificial intelligence experts whose work has focused on improving computer visual recognition systems. Among that team is Oxford Professor Andrew Zisserman, a three-time winner of the Marr Prize for computer vision.
The four founders of Dark Blue Labs will also be joining Google where they will be will be leading efforts to help machines "better understand what users are saying to them."
Google said that three of the professors will hold joint appointments at Oxford, continuing to work part time at the university.

More on Clarence Thomas and KorematsuBy Ilya Somin October 24
Drake Law School Professor Mark Kende has posted a response to my critique of his argument that Justice Clarence Thomas supports the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the World War II-era internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans.
In my previous post, I emphasized that Thomas’ occasional positive citations to Korematsu are limited to a largely uncontroversial part of its holding: that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny national security is a “compelling” government interest that might sometimes justify racial discrimination in extreme circumstances. By contrast, he has never said that the Korematsu Court correctly applied that rule to the facts of the case before it. Kende responds as follows:
[I]n the Fisher v. Texas affirmative action [case], Justice Thomas cites to Korematsu as supporting the forcible relocation of Japanese-Americans on the west coast even under strict scrutiny. Thomas in Fisher said that Korematsu found the internment “had a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.” But Ilya then says that Justice Thomas is only “summarizing” Korematsu without necessarily approving it (despite Thomas’s recitation of the facts). This is odd. For example, at the end of his essay Ilya says that Justice Thomas is “usually among the justices least willing to suppress his own views for the sake of consensus.” By that logic, one would suspect Justice Thomas cited Korematsu approvingly in Fisher. Thomas could have cited other cases.
There is no contradiction here. I did not claim that Thomas, in this passage, suppressed his view on Korematsu for the sake of consensus. He simply chose not to give a comprehensive analysis of the rightness (or lack thereof) of Korematsu, because he didn’t need to do so to make the very limited point this passage was devoted to. All he did was 1) cite Korematsu for the mostly uncontroversial proposition that national security is a compelling state interest (the supposed threat of espionage and sabotage is of course a national security interest), and 2) summarize its holding in a passage whose main function is to summarize past cases where the Supreme Court held that a particular interest is important enough to qualify as compelling for strict scrutiny purposes. He could perhaps have cited a different case for the former proposition. But, as Thomas himself explained, he cited Korematsu because it was both the first case to hold that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications and the first to conclude that national security was an important enough interest to pass strict scrutiny.
Kende also argues that Thomas’ dissent in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld can’t be distinguished from Korematsu on the basis that the former involved alleged enemy combatants, whereas the latter involved civilians who were not enemy combatants or even claimed to be such. Kende suggests that “[t]he alleged grave national security concerns asserted by American military leaders and by the President regarding Japanese-American loyalty on the west coast, and regarding the supposed danger of invasion, would have likely created far greater national security worries for Justice Thomas than a single enemy combatant.” Obviously, the issue in Hamdi was not just the status of a single enemy combatant, but the way alleged enemy combatants should be handled in the War on Terror more generally (just as the rule in Korematsu was not limited to Fred Korematsu himself). Moreover, there are a obvious differences between alleged enemy combatants and ordinary civilians distinguished from the rest of the population only by race or national origin. The latter both have stronger legal rights and are less likely to be threats to national security than the former.
Kende also suggests that Thomas’ deference to racial classifications by prison officials in Johnson v. California would require him to deter to the government in Korematsu because “Japanese-American internment camps were… the essential equivalent of prisons.” The camps were certainly prison-like in the sense that their inmates were not free to leave at will. But, as I noted in my earlier post, the camps were not legally equivalent to prisons because the Japanese-Americans interned in them had never been convicted of any crime, or even charged with one. Thus, they are not covered by various precedents holding that convicted criminals incarcerated for their crimes have much weaker constitutional rights than ordinary citizens. As I also pointed out, this distinction is likely the reason why Justice Scalia joined Thomas’ dissent in Johnson, but also opposes the Korematsu decision .
Finally, Kende argues that Thomas’ failure to cite Korematsu in his dissent in Hamdi is somehow an indication that he agrees with the former. He suggests that Thomas chose not to cite it, despite its potential relevance, because he did not want to reveal the fact that he agreed with it. If Thomas really were intent on hiding his supposed agreement with Korematsu by avoiding citation to it, one would think that he would also avoid citing it in other opinions. Yet, as Kende emphasizes he did cite it in at least two other cases. Moreover, Thomas’ omission of Korematsu from the discussion of precedents supporting his position in Hamdi could just as easily be construed as due to disagreement with the case. Unlike in Fisher, where the relevant part of Korematsu was largely uncontroversial, in Hamdi the relevant part was the Court’s deference to the executive on the question of whether the Japanese-Americans really posed a serious enough threat to justify racially-based internment. Quite possibly, Thomas chose not to cite the Court’s analysis on this point because he thought it was wrong.

Euro dips ahead of banks  stress test results  sterling firmDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.

Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.

Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

What was fake on the Internet this week: Banksys arrest  Red Velvet Oreos and exploding bongsBy Caitlin Dewey October 24 Follow @caitlindewey
A screenshot from the satirical Facebook page “Christians for Michele Bachmann.” (Facebook)
There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights . Fake pumpkin-spice products . Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt !
So rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.
Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:
1. Banksy was not arrested in Bristol. This is not the first time that Paul Horner has tricked the Internet into thinking he’s Banksy. This latest hoax, spurred by a (fake) story that Horner wrote for the (fake) news site National Report, was read by nearly 5 million people — and shared more than 3 million times. Of course, as we discovered in a long chat with Horner this week , he’s a would-be comedian in Phoenix … not, you know, an elusive graffiti mastermind with a cult-like following. Incidentally, the real Banksy painted a new mural  just this Monday.
2. New York police did not stop and frisk two Muslim men for wearing traditional garments. Some 200,000 viewers were rightly disturbed by a video that surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, purportedly showing an NYPD officer confronting two Muslim men over their clothes. The officer in the video was, however, and actor — and the men in the video were forced to admit, after taking a bit of Internet heat, that the clip was “a dramatization … to raise awareness for Racial Profiling.” Unfortunately, that message seems to have gone right over some commenters’ heads: “These muhammadan seditionists need to be arrested for impersonating a police officer,” raged one popular comment. “[They] are abusing our laws to line their own pockets and to gain more islamic terrorists through their twisted lies.” The lies might be twisted, but they’re just trying to gain YouTube hits, bro.
3. There is no Red Velvet Oreo. Marketing students in San Marcos, Tex., should definitely get an A for this little stunt, wherein they Photoshopped a crimson cookie onto an Oreo package and claimed that Nabisco was launching the new flavor for Valentine’s Day. Nabisco has not, alas, chosen to weigh in on the issue. But a Facebook post on the “Red Velvet Oreo” page two days ago would seem to confirm that this weird novelty — like Butterbeer and Fried Chicken before it! — isn’t actually meant to be.
4. An exploding bong did not take off half a woman’s face. A Facebook PSA about the dangers of marijuana — captioned, scarily, “THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU” — claims that a young woman was gruesomely disfigured when her bong exploded. In fact, the woman pictured is an Internet-famous makeup artist dressed up for a zombie bar crawl … and “Christians for Michele Bachman,” the page that posted her picture, is satirical and has nothing to do with the politician. Alas, this has not stopped 21,000 people from sharing the post, and a whopping 49,000 from commenting.
“How did this dumb s*** get on my page?” One man wrote. “It’s an insult that they think we are this stupid. LOST MY VOTE.”
Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime.

Tata Motors to raise $600 mn through notes to service debt  fund capexTata Motors to raise $750 mn through notes to service debt, fund capex
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 25, 2014 12:44 AM IST
Tata Motors, India’s biggest automaker, is set to raise $750 million (Rs 4,600 crore) in what could be its second fund raising activity this year.
The Mumbai-based company will reportedly issue $750 million of senior unsecured notes, according to Bloomberg.
The $500-million 5.5-year issue is priced at 4.625 per cent while another $250-million issue is priced at 5.75 per cent for a 10-year period, stated the agency.
In May, the company’s wholly owned-subsidiary TML Holdings raised $300 million (about Rs 1,800 crore) through an issue of debt securities having fixed interest rate. Last year TML Holdings, which also owns Jaguar and Land Rover, raised $350 million through senior fixed notes.
When contacted the company did not comment.  Tata Motors intends to use a bulk of proceeds to refinance existing ECB debt with the balance to be used to fund capital expenditure plans and investment. Tata Motors would be spending about Rs 3,500-4000 crore on capital expenditure at the stand-alone level this year. Last year it spent Rs 3,094 crore on capex, design and development of products.
Jaguar Land Rover, the UK-based luxury brand, has announced a hike in capital expenditure plan this year to £3.5-3.7 billion from around £2.75 billion last year. This includes funding for the new China and Brazil plants, new power trains and technologies to meet regulatory requirements, capacity expansion at the existing UK facilities and also meeting new product development expenses.
“In the near term, funds are needed to support the Zest and Bolt launches as well as the inventory increase as overall activity picks up. We also expect further investment to be made in TMFL, which is integral to the marketing effort but which is experiencing a higher level of NPAs and lower margins resulting from the last two years of weak vehicle sales,” said a recent Moody’s report on Tata Motors which gave a Ba2 rating to the issue of notes with a stable outlook. The compact sedan Zest launched by the company in August met a lukewarm response from the market with just over 3,300 units sold in the first month (September) of the sale. Maruti Suzuki Dzire sold a little over 17,000 units and Honda Amaze clocked around 5,000 units in the same month.
The company had stated in September that it had got bookings for 10,000 units for the Zest. It is also simultaneously gearing up for the launch of the hatchback Bolt set for launch before March. The Bolt is built on the same platform as Zest and would be competing against the like of Hyundai Grand i10 and Maruti Celerio.
“The stable outlook reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core Indian business to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating. However, FY2015 is a critical year as JLR's sales growth rate slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations. At the same time, Tata's Indian operations need to regain some of their lost market share with success of new launches key to the passenger car business's long-term prospects,” stated the Moody’s report.

Tamil Nadu—based Equitas Holdings Pvt Ltd, with the largest proposed investment in the lot, would bring foreign capital of Rs 325 crore.

Meanwhile, FIPB rejected 5 proposals including Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd.
SSTL sought permission to increase FDI up to 100 per cent in the company and its downstream wholly owned subsidiary Shyam Internet Services Ltd, both engaged in the telecom sector, on account of conversion of redeemable preference shares into equity.

French filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa  FIR filedFrench filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa, FIR filed
PTI
Tweet
Port Blair, Oct 24:  
Two French filmmakers have been booked on the charge of trespassing into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve in the Andaman islands and filming a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe.
“We have filed an FIR against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert for violating the law of the land. Entering the Jarawa area is banned and so are making any contact with them or shooting any photo or video,” the union territory’s Tribal Welfare Secretary Theva Neethi Dhas told PTI today.
“The police are investigating the matter and gathering evidences against them. If the charges are proved, it could lead to three years of imprisonment, besides a fine,” the Secretary said.
He said two local inhabitants have been arrested for allegedly helping the filmmakers to enter the Jarawa area.
The case was registered on October 19 while the incident is said to have happened during March-April.
The matter came to light only when the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti (AAJVS) reported the matter to the administration.
Dhas said they had already sent notices to the filmmakers, who have returned to their homeland, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
The administration will also ask the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with the French government, he said.
Charges against the two French filmmakers include violation of Protection of the Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012, Foreigners Amendment Act 2004, and Information Technology Act.
Under post-production stage now, the film ‘Organic Jarawa’ is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.

Black money case: Jaitley hiding the truth to show PM Modi in poor light  claims Jethmalani in letter43
4
New Delhi: Former BJP member and Supreme Court advocate Ram Jethmalani has written a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accusing him of not taking effective steps to bring back black money.
Jethmalani in his letter to the Finance Minister slammed his argument that the names of black money account holders cannot be revealed beacuse it breaches double taxation avoidance agreement with other countries. The former BJP leader claimed that German authorities have agreed to share names with the Indian government without any cost or condition.
The senior lawyer said that he suspects Jaitley did not want the truth to come out, exposing PM Modi to allegations of misguiding the nation. He added that Jaitley had ambtions of becoming PM and it seemed he was trying to take revennge against Modi for taking office.
#ram jethmalani #arun jaitley #black money #bjp
"You are taking the nation to suicide and exposing Modiji to the charge of misguiding the nation. This might be your method of taking revenge for his snatching office which you thought belonged to you," Jethmalani wrote.
Earlier last week, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that it cannot disclose the names of people having black money stashed abroad. The government said that the names could not be made public as it violated the double taxation avoidance agreement.
The government, however, said that the names will be shared with the concerned agencies.
The apex court will hear the government's plea on October 28.

Delhi: Man acquitted of charge of gangrape2
0
New Delhi: A man, who was accused of gang raping a woman along with his two associates after giving her sedatives-laced drink, has been acquitted by a Delhi court which said the alleged victim has turned "hostile" and there was no evidence that she was raped at all.
Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma freed Manpreet, resident of Ranhola in west Delhi, after the woman deposed that she has no grievance against him and she had established physical relations with co-accused Vipin Lakra, who was earlier acquitted in the case, with her own consent.
Co-accused Lakra and Satpal were acquitted by the court in May this year. The court said that the woman has not deposed an iota of evidence of her being intoxicated and raped at all.
The court said that the woman has not deposed an iota of evidence of her being intoxicated and raped at all.
#delhi #gangrape #delhi court #crimes against women
"She has not even mentioned the word 'rape' in her evidence nor has deposed anything incriminating against the accused Manpreet," the court said, adding that the woman has turned hostile.
"It is clear that the claim of the prosecution is neither reliable nor believable and is not trustworthy and prosecution has failed to establish the offence of intoxication and gang rape against accused. The evidence of the prosecutrix makes it highly improbable that such an incident ever took place," the court said, while acquitting Manpreet.
According to the police, on December 31, 2013, Manpreet along with Lakra and Satpal had given a sedatives-laced cold drink to the woman and thereafter, the trio raped her in a plot in Ranhola Extension.
A supplementary charge sheet was filed against Manpreet. The woman, however, deposed before the court that none of the accused persons had gangraped her after intoxicating her. She had developed friendship with Lakra on facebook and she had physical relations with him several times with her free consent, she told the court adding that he has never forced her in any manner to have physical relations.
She also said that she did not have any grievance against Manpreet and prayed that he may be acquitted. She also said that she did not know Manpreet and also failed to identify him in court.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Hudhud : NIO vessel capsizes off Vizag 
 
The coastal research vessel (CRV) -- Sagar Paschmi -- of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIO) capsized off Visakhapatnam coast on the day of cyclone Hudhud,  according to a press release issued by Forward Seamen's Union of India.
Abdul Sharieff, the union representative, said the vessel belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India was on hire to the NIO and on the day of the cyclone it sank near the fishing harbour. All the 12 crew members escaped unhurt. He said it was regrettable that neither the SCI nor the NIO had deemed it fit to report the capsize of the vessel with costly equipment worth crores. Nor did the authorities bother about the crew, he alleged.

Govt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policyGovt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policy
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
The Government has constituted an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) think-tank to help draft a new National IPR Policy and to advice it on issues related to intellectual property.
The think-tank, headed by Justice Prabha Sridevan, will highlight anomalies in the present IPR legislations and advice the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on possible solutions, according to an official release.
It will also provide views on the possible implications of demands placed by negotiating partners of proposed free trade pacts and other regional arrangements.
With several developed countries criticising India’s IP regime on grounds of laxity and the US carrying out a review to see if it should be black-listed as a `priority country’ for giving insufficient IP protection to its companies, the think-tank is expected to play an important role in helping the Government deal with international pressure.
Other members of the IPR think-tank include Narendra K Sabarwal, former Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organisation, Rajeev Srinivasan, Director, Asian School of Business, Advocate Pratibha Singh, Advocate Punita Bhargava and Cadila Pharma’s Unnat Pandit.
The DIPP, which constituted the think-tank of Friday, will co-ordinate with it to identify areas in intellectual property where study needs to be conducted, an official release said.
It will also take inputs from it on the new IPR policy which has been proposed to bring clarity in existing laws and safeguard interests of Indian industry.
An inter-ministerial group, with representatives from Ministries and Departments including Commerce & Industry, Health, Information & Broadcasting and Telecom, will soon meet to discuss the new policy for India’s IPR.

Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday reviewed the performance of oil marketing companies for the relaunch of Direct Benefits Transfer in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)  scheme.
The Union Cabinet had, on 18 October, approved the launch of the scheme aimed at cutting LPG subsidies as well as getting rid of diversion of subsidised cooking gas for commercial purposes. The scheme would be launched in 54 districts across the country in mid November.
Pradhan spoke to a field officer of Indian Oil Corporation in Jalandhar district through video conferencing to understand the issues faced by consumers in implementation of the earlier version of the Direct Benefits Transfer in LPG.
“The oil marketing companies informed the minister about the roll-out plan, along with timelines for different activities to create awareness among LPG consumers about the scheme, the technological changes required and the processes to be put in place for the implementation,” the oil ministry stated.

Paswan meets FM; wants import duty on edible oils to be hikedPaswan meets FM; wants import duty on edible oils to be hiked
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 07:02 PM IST
Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here and discussed the issue of raising import duty on crude and refined edible oils to restrict cheap imports and protect domestic farmers, among other matters.
Problems faced by sugar mills in availing of loans sanctioned through the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and the issue of additional budget allocation for FCI were also discussed.
"The proposal on increasing import duty on edible oils, additional budget for FCI and loan issue under SDF, among others, were on the agenda of the meeting," Paswan told PTI.
The Food Ministry favours increasing the import duty on crude and refined edible oils from existing 2.5% and 10%, respectively, he said.
Industry body Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10% and on refined edible oils to 25% as local prices have fallen to historical lows due to cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
On sugar sector issues, Paswan briefed the Finance Minister about the current impasse between the UP sugar mills and the state government over cane price policy, sources said.
Private sugar mills in the state have threatened to suspend operations in the current season beginning this month.
Paswan also discussed about relaxing certain norms so that sugar mills can avail of loans easily from SDF, sources said, adding that he also sought additional budget allocation for state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) for giving food subsidies this fiscal.
A budget allocation of Rs 92,000 crore has been made against the requirement of Rs 1,47,700 crore for this fiscal.

Ebola vaccine doses could reach Africa by mid-2015: WHOEbola vaccine doses could reach Africa by mid-2015: WHO
AFP | Geneva Oct 24, 2014 06:50 PM IST
Ebola vaccine trials could start in west Africa as early as December, with hundreds of thousands of doses potentially being rolled out by mid-2015, the World Health Organisation said Friday.
"All is being put in place to start efficacy tests in the affected countries as early as December," said WHO assistant director general Marie-Paule Kieny, adding that several hundred thousand doses could be available in the "first half" of next year.
Kieny spoke after the UN health agency held closed-door talks yesterday on potential vaccines with medical experts, officials from Ebola-affected nations, pharmaceutical firms and funding agencies.
Two experimental vaccines are seen as the leading candidates to beat Ebola.
Supplies of Canadian-discovered experimental vaccine rVSV are arriving in Geneva for a new round of trials. Hopes are also centred on ChAd3, made by British company GlaxoSmithKline.
There are five other potential vaccines in the pipeline, Kieny said.
WHO hopes to deploy huge numbers of doses of whichever vaccine proves its mettle in trials to Africa for "real-world" tests.
"Vaccine is not the magic bullet, but when ready, it may be a good part of the effort to turn the tide of the epidemic," Kieny said.

Government rejects SSTL s FDI proposalGovernment rejects SSTL's FDI proposal
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 06:34 PM IST
The Finance Ministry has rejected Sistema Shyam Teleservices' (SSTL) proposal to increase foreign stake to 100% due to conversion of redeemable preference shares into equity.
SSTL, controlled by Russian conglomerate Sistema JSFC, had applied in May to increase the total FDI in the company beyond 73.95%.
Increases in FDI up to 100% in M/s Sistema Shyam Tele Services Limited and its downstream WoS M/s Shyam Internet Services Limited, both engaged in telecom sector, on account of conversion of Redeemable Preference Shares into equity have been rejected, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), a multi-department panel headed by Finance Secretary, said in a statement.
The meeting of FIPB took place on September 16.
Sistema JSFC holds 56.68% in SSTL, Russian government 17.14% and 0.13% other foreign entities.
The government in July 2013 had allowed 100% FDI in telecom companies.
SSTL, which offers services under MTS brand name, has presence in 9 telecom circles.

CIL trade unions caution against de-nationalisation of minesCIL trade unions caution against de-nationalisation of mines
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 06:30 PM IST
Cautioning against any attempt to de-nationalise coal mines, the five operating trade unions of Coal India Ltd (CIL) have said they will meet shortly to decide the future course of action.
"The senior leaders of 5 CTUs will meet shortly to decide future course of action to combat the menace of gradual de-nationalisation of coal mines besides various other policy related decisions of Government of India.
"(These have been) resorted arbitrarily without associating or ascertaining the views of one of the most important stake-holders i.E. The coal workers and the CTUs," S Q Zama, secretary-general, Indian National Mine Workers' Federation said in a letter to Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal.
The e-auction of coal blocks for private companies has been approved through an ordinance promulgated recently. This comes in the backdrop of Supreme Court order quashing 214 coal blocks to companies since 1993.
The letter further said that notwithstanding merit/de-merit of the ordinance, the coal workers and the 5 CTUs of Coal India Limited (CIL) are concerned with the enabling clause to allow commercial mining by private firms in future.
Although government says that CIL's interest will be fully maintained and protected, it is "absolutely untenable and unacceptable as it amounts to gradual and indirect de-nationalisation of coal mines," the letter said.
Coal India workers are represented by five unions including Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).
The Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier recommended to the President promulgation of ordinance in order to resolve the pending issues particularly the situation arising out of the Supreme Court judgement quashing the allocation of the coal blocks.
Following this Ordinance, state sector requirements including those of the Central and state governments would be met through government dispensation route and coal mines would be allocated to PSUs like NTPC or state electricity boards.
Government will put sufficient coal blocks on e-auction for the private sector players who are into the cement, steel and power sectors.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had earlier said that that the e-auction process will be "transparent" and completed in "three to four months" with proceeds going entirely to the state governments where the mines are located.
The biggest beneficiaries would be the eastern states like Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. States like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh would also benefit.

Burdwan blast probe: NSA-led high level delegation to visit WB on Monday125
0
New Delhi: A high-level delegation led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval will be visiting West Bengal on Monday to take stock of the progress in the Burdwan blast case. The high-level delegation will include NIA, RAW and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials.
On Friday, NIA Director General Sharad Kumar visited the blast site in Khagragarh, Burdwan. He said the NIA was "developing strategies to arrest those accused who are absconding". The officer refused to divulge any further information in the case.
Earlier this month, two suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorists were killed in a bomb blast in Burdwan. They were making bombs in a house owned by TMC sympathiser Nurul Hasan Chowdhury.

Ever since it took charge of the Burdwan probe, the NIA has unearthed various others hideouts of the terror module and recovered sophisticated explosives from Burdwan and its adjoining districts of Murshidabad, Nadia and Birbhum.
Opposition parties have slammed the Mamata Banerjee government for fanning terror modules in the state and suggested a link to the Sarada chitfund scam.

Sonia  Rahul Gandhi should speak more  saysChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”
“I have, not only I, others have urged that the reorganisation that was promised in continued…

Kochi, October 24:  
SmartCity Kochi has received environmental clearance for the entire project covering 246 acres, even as the construction of the first IT building is fast nearing completion.
Gigo Joseph, CEO, said the environmental clearance was received in July last year for the 6.5 lakh sq ft first IT building (SCK01), and later the company applied for the rest of the project, which has now been cleared.
According to him, not less than 8.8 million sq ft built-up area will be developed, with substantial area left for greenery and open spaces, attracting companies from within India and abroad.
Joseph said the environmental clearance was given at the meeting of State Environment Impact Assessment Authority Kerala (SEIAA-K) followed by the State Expert Appraisal Committee’s (SEAC) recommendations.
He said SEAC appreciated SmartCity’s effort in presenting a clear-cut master plan of the project. Now, as the decks have been cleared for the entire project, the company will speed up the construction of infrastructure.
SmartCity has entered into agreements for joint development of infrastructure with leading IT, hospitality, realty and education companies to make the hub an integrated township.

Wipro Fails to Impress in Q2, Falls 5% in Muhurat Trade
NDTV | Updated On: October 23, 2014 19:43 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The 50-share Nifty ended at one-month high in Muhurat trading on Thursday, but shares in IT major Wipro fell as much as 5 per cent. Wipro, which had missed its earnings estimate in the September quarter, was also the top loser in the 50-share Nifty. ( Track stock )
In the September quarter, Wipro's IT services revenues grew just 1.8 per cent sequentially to $1.771 billion lagging its peers Infosys (3.1 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.6 per cent).
For most IT services companies, analysts and investors track the dollar sales numbers as clients overseas get billed in dollars. Revenue guidance for the third quarter is expected in the range of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion, implying a sequential revenue growth of 2-4 per cent, Wipro said.
India's third largest outsourcer also missed estimates on the profit front, with Q2 profit rising 8 per cent to Rs 2,085 crore against Reuters estimate of Rs 2,109 crore.
Wipro said it continued to face "headwinds" in key accounts, particularly European clients.
Wipro and its larger peer Infosys have underperformed companies like TCS and HCL Tech in revenue growth over the last few quarters. Infosys managed to beat Street estimates in the September quarter and the announcement of a bonus issue has acted as a strong support for the stock. But Wipro seems to have failed to impress the Street with Q2 numbers.
"Infosys has now laid out their plans, so we know what the idea is. Wipro has talked about plans for some time, but it does not show on results," Ankita Somani, analyst with MSFL Research said.
Wipro closed 4 per cent lower at Rs 560.25 on the NSE. It underperformed the IT index on the BSE, which ended 0.14 per cent higher. ( Track stock )

The Rise of Xtremepreneurs: Today s World-Changersreddit
"Personal drive without ego, dedication beyond failures and conviction above circumstances. This describes the spirit of an Xtremepreneur." -- Val Jon Farris
What is an "Xtremepreneur?" Allow me to answer in an extreme way. I was recently invited to a cave dive in the Yucatan Peninsula with Guillermo de Anda , one of National Geographic's Global Explorers . We rappelled 100 feet underground to the surface of a "sacrificial cenote," or subterranean lake. ("Sacrificial" because human sacrifices actually took place there.) Equipped with underwater torches and a video camera we descended into the darkness of what the Maya call "Xibalba, the Underworld Goddess of Death."
After traversing ancient limestone catacombs we emerged into a grand underwater cavern, when suddenly my buoyancy compensator filled with water and I sank uncontrollably. By the time the dive team noticed, I had plummeted 120 feet to the cavern floor! I literally had to pry my mask from my face to equalize it, and as I did my nose and throat flooded with water.
Guillermo appeared in front of me with his hand raised cautioning me to not panic. On my knees in the darkness among scattered animal and human remains, and unable to breathe, I was about to find out who I was with respect to my opening quote of, "conviction above circumstances."
Before I tell you what happened next I want to discuss Xtremepreneurs and World-Changers for a moment. Xtremepreneurs are a hybrid between extreme sports enthusiasts and philanthropic entrepreneurs. And while the sports they engage in, (kiteboarding, base jumping, heli-skiing, cave diving, etc.) possess varying degrees of risk, those who participate in them share a common philosophy of using extreme challenges to access extraordinary capabilities.
How this extreme breed of entrepreneurs evolves into World-Changers is by shifting their attention off themselves and onto being a contribution to others. World-Changers exist at all levels of entrepreneurial success, from the likes of Richard Branson , Elon Musk and Guy Laliberte , all the way to professions like you and me who know we make a difference in the world and are striving to expand that difference. We do this by pressing ourselves beyond our limits, learning from our failures and moving forward with conviction, which brings us back to the challenge I faced on the underwater cavern floor...
On my knees, staring at Guillermo's raised hand, two waves of energy roared through me. First was sheer terror and second was some urgent advice from deep within my core, "Val Jon, you can't make the surface, you need to work with what you've got. If you don't, you will die right here, right now."
What happened next was a testament to the power of the Human Spirit and Greater Self which I believe dwells within all of us. Rather than panicking or trying to force a solution, I literally surrendered my Will over to the Greater Self Within Me to know what to do. And what was that? To simply wait until I could swallow the water blocking my airways and take tiny breaths until I could regain my composure. I did just that and by doing so it saved my life.
You might conclude it was remaining calm that saved me, but I say this to you. The moment "I" got out of the way, the Greater Self Within Me knew exactly what to do. It is this same Greater Self within us that always knows what to do, not only in life and death situations, but in business dealings and with respect to realizing our greatest dreams and aspirations.
Neither equipment failure nor personal threat was going to stop me from succeeding with our cenote dive. We surfaced, repaired my gear, added an additional proximity safety protocol and submerged again. Our willingness to reengage as a team, learn from our mistakes and persevere beyond fear yielded both an extraordinary experience and some extreme underwater footage. (To experience our actual dive, click here for the YouTube clips .)
I have a profound admiration for those who persevere and use life's challenges to better themselves and at the same time support others in doing the same. And obviously I have a special appreciation for the extreme crowd. To me, Xtremepreneurs like pro-kiteboarders Susi Mai and Bill Tai , founders of Mai Tai Global are an example of real World-Changers. And while I run the risk of appearing promotional, I want to mention a remarkable mentoring project Richard Branson and Kym McNicholas are spearheading in partnership with MaiTai Global called the Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC . I pay tribute to them here because it's my way of giving back to the spirit of mentorship that was so instrumental to my own entrepreneurial success many years ago.
These kinds of extreme mentoring projects develop something extraordinary within us, something greater than thrill seeking or even fame and fortune. There is a need today for bringing greater purpose and contribution into the world of commerce. And while it may sound Pollyanna to some, what I see happening is an "evolution of self" in which our egos are learning how to step aside so our Greater Selves can step forward into our lives and into our world. This spirited movement is The Rise of Xtremepreneurs, Today's World-Changers.
To learn more about a wide range of mentoring programs, log onto SuperSummit . You'll find a host of world-class talent gathering there. I also personally invite you to learn about our growing Global Xtreme Team at www.whowithinyou.com . And finally, true to my extreme spirit I encourage any and all Xtreme expedition invites!

California s Fracking Controversyreddit
Will a "Yes" or "No" vote on Measure P (the measure that bans all forms of enhanced drilling techniques, including steam injection and fracking) have an impact on Santa Barbara County's property values? This may be one of the biggest concerns for this California County's voters in November.
With nearly 7,000 new wells proposed locally, there is concern for the loss of property values - on top of environmental concerns related to fracking and other high intensity petroleum operations.
A Calgary and Duke University study of property values near shale gas wells notes a ten percent drop in values, but with fracking operations in place, values dropped some 22 percent. "Whether or not fracking causes groundwater pollution, people fear the risk enough that property values have dropped for homes with drinking-water wells near shale-gas pads, according to new research," writes Forbes in an article entitled Pollution Fears Crush Home Prices Near Fracking Wells.
"Real estate brokers say they see more signs of prospective home buyers worrying about the health and environmental effects of living close to a well," Reuters_News@reuters.com writes. "'For the most part, it renders those houses unsellable,' said Phyllis Wolper, a Denton, Texas, realtor who has several clients who live near oil and gas wells and have been unable to sell their homes."
These well sites impact individuals and developments. "When Gary Gless bought his sleek, modernist house in Los Angeles in 2002, he thought he had hit a "gold mine," reuters.com notes. "The world's largest inner-city park - featuring a lush, 18-hole golf course - was about to get built across the street. Gless's balcony was set to overlook the clubhouse and first tee....Today, instead of golf carts and fairways, Gless looks out on to drilling wells and oil pads. The park plan was ditched, and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC now operates 700 wells there - and 400 more are on the way. All the drilling, Gless says, has caused house foundations to crack and swimming pools to start to slide down hills."
And fracking operations are non-stop, thanks to the "Halliburton Loophole", a 2005 amendment to the Clean Air and Water Acts that VP Dick Cheney, former Halliburton CEO, pushed through Congress exempting fracking operations from almost all Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
"Coupled with existing exemptions to a variety of pollution laws like the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the 2005 carve-outs gave the fracking industry seven total exemptions from important environmental regulations," reported a recent truthout.org article.
California already has a thriving fracking industry. The majority of the state's new and active wells are concentrated in Kern and Los Angeles counties, said a National Resource Defense Council report entitled Drilling in California: Who's at Risk? However, expanded fracking in the large Monterey Formation is projected to bring the oil and gas industry into more communities, especially in Ventura, Monterey, Fresno, and Santa Barbara counties . According to http://ecowatch.com in Fracking the American Dream,
"In Pavilion, WY, where the EPA has linked groundwater contamination with fracking, Louis Meeks saw the value of his 40-acre alfalfa farm all but disappear completely. In 2006, his land and home were appraised at $239,000. Two years later, as ProPublica reported, "a local realtor sent Meeks a coldly worded letter saying his place was essentially worthless and she could not list his property."
"Last July, Nationwide Insurance spelled out specifically that it would not provide coverage for damage related to fracking. According to an internal memo outlining the company's policy, 'After months of research and discussion, we have determined that the exposures presented by hydraulic fracturing are too great to ignore. Risks involved with hydraulic fracturing are now prohibited for General Liability, Commercial Auto, Motor Truck Cargo, Auto Physical Damage and Public Auto (insurance) coverage," notes ecowatch.com.'
One little noticed side effect of this property value impact is that the secondary mortgage market hasn't caught up with the risk of loaning on properties affected by fracking and extreme oil production methods. As they do, these properties could be harder to finance. Housing Wire has reported on a webinar entitled, Oil and Gas Exploration for Mortgage Bankers, in which Daniel McKenna, with the Ballard Spahr's Mortgage Banking Group said, "The loans are actually low risk. But Fannie, Freddie, the FHA, and the VA prohibit gas leases on their loans. There are a ton of different regulations that impact selling these loans on the secondary market."
Even Exxon CEO and Board Chairman Rex Tillerson, is suing to stop construction of a water tower that would supply nearby drilling operations because of the nuisance of, among other things, heavy truck traffic, noise and traffic hazards from the fracking operations the tower would support.
So the CEO of the single largest drilling company in the world acknowledges the "constant and unbearable nuisance" that would come from having "lights on at all hours of the night...traffic at unreasonable hours... noise from mechanical and electrical equipment." And Tillerson's lawsuit - filed in 2013 with other plaintiffs, including former House Majority Leader Dick Armey - claims the project would do "irreparable harm" to his property values, in papers filed for the Denton County, Texas lawsuit.
Then, there's the real danger of earthquakes from injecting waste water back into the ground, which have been occurring with increasing frequency in some Oklahoma fracking fields, as reported on NPR Radio in a July 2014 broadcast by Linda Wertheimer.
Denver, Colorado had the same problems with so-called natural gas injection wells back in the 1960s, and played a critical role in discovering the link between forced injection wells and induced earthquakes.
There are currently more than 1.1 million active oil and gas wells in the United States, and more than 15 million Americans now live within a mile of the hundreds of thousands that have been drilled since 2000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Made possible by the advent of fracking, drilling is taking place in shale formations from California to New York and from Wyoming to Texas. And there's no indication that this "unprecedented industrialization" shows any signs of slowing. Almost 47,000 new oil and natural gas wells were drilled in 2012, and industry analysts project that pace will only continue.

The Case for a Sustainability Plan in Business: Short-Term Savings and Long-Term Opportunitiesreddit
We live in a world plagued by extreme weather events. Yet, as a general rule (and there are some outstanding exceptions), the world of business still hasn't woken up to the threat of climate change. All too often the sustainability team or programme is a side-lined function and very much seen as a 'nice to do.'
I can see why it happens. There is a perception (an incorrect one!) that going green costs more and therefore balance sheet pressures dictate going with the status quo of doing business.
Our view couldn't be more different. We believe that sustainability is both a moral and commercial imperative.
There is a business case for going green, and after seven years of following our own sustainability programme, we have a good case study to share.
In the short-term, it is about insulating your business from cost pressures; in the longer-term, a more sophisticated business case has emerged, predicated on opportunity, innovation and new revenue streams.
Seven years ago we set aside a massive £200 million for a five year initiative called Plan A, an eco and ethical programme that pledged to transform M&S by changing the way it did business. The environment and the right way to do business would be built into every decision made at the company and we set 100 bold targets to be achieved by 2012 including becoming carbon neutral, sending no waste to landfill and ensure that key raw materials come from the most sustainable sources available.
In only its second year, it became clear that Plan A was delivering significant cost benefits. To add to that it was opening up new revenue streams that were taking off. In year three it returned a net benefit to the business, or profit if you like, and has delivered one every year since. Last year the net benefit was £145 million and over the seven years in total, the benefit is £435 million.
That's £435 million that M&S would either have had to find from elsewhere or simply would not have had in the first place. The savings we're making include being more energy efficient, using less fuel, recycling and reusing clothes hangers, reducing waste, using less packaging etc etc.
But it's not just financial savings; we are seeing many other benefits such as increased staff motivation, brand enhancement and supply chain resiliency to name a few.
We're not the only company with a great business case story to tell. Companies like Walmart, O2, Unilever and Nike also understand the green imperative commercially and have embarked on their own eco-ethical journeys.
And, if you're reading this and thinking, that's all well and good for M&S, but what about small and medium sized companies? It's not the preserve of big businesses like us.
Our suppliers -- many of them small businesses -- are also getting involved in Plan A and making their businesses more efficient and more profitable. Take West Mill, a hosiery factory in Belper, Derbyshire, which was on the brink of closure a few years ago. Now it has turned its fortunes around by controlling its energy use, slashing £2 million from its annual bills. It was awarded eco-factory status by M&S meaning that every product produced at the factory can be labelled as having a Plan A attribute -- boosting the marketing power of the factory's products.
Going forward, as a consequence of interconnected opportunities and risks, business models will be disrupted by sustainability for the first time. We can't monetise the long-term business benefit but our use of the word 'disruption' highlights just how crucial we believe the business case for sustainability will become in the future. At M&S we're very clear the purpose of our business is to enhance lives everyday. And by doing this we will prosper.
That's why we've developed the next stage of our plan -- Plan A 2020, which aims to help accelerate our sustainability efforts. It's organised around four pillars -- Inspiration, In Touch, Integrity and Innovation, and supports our aspiration to become the world's most sustainable major retailer.
I call on every other business to not wait for the future to happen, but to proactively create it -- developing their own sustainable business plan, setting out, amongst other priorities, how they will promote wellbeing, sustain nature, take account of environmental and social impacts and be transparent.
Each plan needs to be adapted to their specific industry challenge and opportunities. It needs to inspire and mobilise everyone in the organisation. There are clearly huge challenges and headwinds ahead, but a sustainable business plan is the first step to realising opportunities and shifting to a new way of doing business, fit for the future.

Craving a Crumbs cupcake? They're back.
Crumbs Bake Shop reopened its location in Water Tower Place on Thursday, ending a three-month absence of the colossal cupcakes in Chicago.
In July, Crumbs was delisted from the Nasdaq and soon after closed its remaining locations. Marcus Lemonis and Fischer Enterprises stepped in to buy the chain and said they would reinvent Crumbs as more of a sweets and snacks shop, rather than just focusing on cupcakes as the chain had since it opened in 2003.

Along with its well-known cupcakes, the chain is now selling items such as the Crumbnut, a cross between a doughnut and a croissant, and a Baissant, which it said is a combination of a bagel and a croissant.
The new owners previously said they planned to reopen about two dozen stores of the 50 or so that abruptly closed July 7.
The Water Tower Place location, at 835 N. Michigan Ave., reopened Thursday.
Lemonis, known for his CNBC show "The Profit," is expected to be at a grand reopening event at 6 p.m.
Along with the Chicago store, two stores have reopened in New York, along with one store each in California, Delaware and Washington, D.C., according to the chain's website.
The company said this week that it plans to open a store at 469 Central Ave. in Highland Park in the next 30 days. It also plans mass market products such as a new cookie line, ice cream products and a chocolate bar.

Labor Secretary:  We Suckreddit
Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Thursday the United States' current federal minimum wage is an international embarrassment, specifically calling out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for fighting attempts to raise the wage floor.
Speaking at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News , Perez noted the U.S.'s dismal standing among the 34 countries who belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The current federal minimum wage of $7.25, when compared to the median wage of full-time workers, ranks among the lowest of all member countries.
“I mean, we suck,” Perez said . “We really do.”
Last year, President Barack Obama threw his support behind a Democratic proposal to raise the federal wage floor to $10.10 an hour . In January, Obama announced he would raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10, pushing Congress to do the same on a national level.
“A majority of Americans – not just Democrats, not just independents, but Republicans too – support raising the minimum wage,” Obama said after signing the executive order. “It’s the right thing to do. So that’s something Congress should keep in mind this year.”
Republicans, however, have pushed back on the proposal. In April, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have gradually increased the wage, citing concerns over the impact on businesses and job growth. Democrats have used the GOP opposition as midterm campaign fodder, and hope that ballot measures in states like Arkansas and South Dakota will help boost turnout in November.
During the Bloomberg event, Perez called out Christie, who earlier this week said he is " tired of hearing about the minimum wage ."
“Chris Christie’s got his head in the sand if he’s getting tired about the minimum wage,” Perez said. “Chris Christie needs to talk to his economists, who will tell him that 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption.”
Perez, who is reportedly under consideration to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke earlier this week on the country's " dismal " record on paid parental leave, saying that policies like paid leave and a higher minimum wage are the path to "shared prosperity."
"This is a family issue and an American issue," Perez said . "We need to lead on leave. We can't simply leave talent on the bench."

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Some people are urging the Colorado burrito chain Illegal Pete's to change its name because of the way the word "illegal" has been used to describe immigrants.
The Coloradan (http://noconow.co/1wpoTne ) reports that about 30 people gathered in Fort Collins Wednesday to ask owner Pete Turner to change the name of the chain, which is about to open an outlet there.
It's part of a bigger campaign nationally against what critics refer to as the "I-word." They think using the word to describe a person is dehumanizing.
Turner said the name is a reference to novel he read in college and the "Pete" part refers to his name and his father's. He told the crowd that he is committed to an "inclusive" business and has helped pay for some employees to become citizens.
"This is all very near and dear to me," he said.
But those at the meeting likened the name to a racial slur used against African-Americans or hanging a Confederate flag in the restaurant's window.
"Social context is hugely important," Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator Kim Medina said. "We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language."

Arabian Sea storm starts reorganising  eyes Gujarat for landfallArabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone, target Gujarat
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 24:  
After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

China to open more sectors to investment for...China to open up more sectors to private investment to spur growth
By Reuters | 24 Oct, 2014, 07.53PM IST
Premier Li Keqiang chaired a meeting of the council, China's cabinet, which decided that China would "open the door" to more areas for social investment.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: China's State Council will expand the scope of private investment in key sectors, including telecoms and transport, it said on Friday, as part of measures to support the slowing economy.
China's economy, the world's second largest, grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis in the September quarter and risks missing its official target for the first time in 15 years, stoking worries about global growth as well as the risk of social discontent.
Premier Li Keqiang chaired a meeting of the council, China's cabinet, which decided that China would "open the door" to more areas for social investment, particularly private capital, a statement on the government's website said.
China will "support essential telecommunications enterprises in attracting private strategic investors", the statement added.
It said it would also seek to spur investment in rail, port, river transport, airport, and water projects, and guide private capital investment in broadband Internet construction and national civil space infrastructure.
China's economy is expected to expand 7.4 percent this year, narrowly missing the government's 7.5 percent annual target, as Beijing tries to derive more future growth from consumer demand rather than exports.
China will open up more state-dominated sectors to private investors to help boost the economy, the State Council said.
Smashing unreasonable monopolies and market barriers, and building a fair investment environment "will be beneficial to stimulating vital market forces and latent development potential", it said. The statement did not mention foreign investment.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras inIndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

(The Commerce and Industry…)
NEW DELHI: The government is aiming to improve India's ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
"Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India's ranking," sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest 'ease of doing business' list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India's ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code , Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Congress chief: Chidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014

Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

New quarantine rules considered for aid workers returning to U.S. from Ebola-stricken regionBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”
The day after a doctor in New York City was diagnosed with Ebola, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama would have "no qualms about riding the subway...or taking a stroll on the High Line." (AP)
Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Rural job scheme has tremendousimpact on womens lives: Study60% of workers in Alappuzha district depend on the scheme for daily bread
Kochi, October 24:  
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) Scheme has helped improve the social and economic status of women and to alleviate poverty in rural areas, according to a study.
The study, conducted in Alappuzha district by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), showed that 97.3 per cent of workers under the scheme are women.
Empowerment
The study was funded by the Kerala State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) to assess the impact of the scheme on poverty eradication and empowerment of women and marginalised groups.
It found that 60 per cent of workers earned their daily bread through the scheme and that it was a source of additional income for the remaining 40 per cent.
According to the study, 27 per cent of respondents believed that the scheme had helped boost their saving habits and that it brought a kind of financial literacy necessary for financial inclusion.
Impact on wages
The scheme also resulted in wage raise in other sectors, especially in fisheries, construction, coir and agricultural sectors. The study has recommended disbursing the wages within seven days and inclusion of agriculture related works such as harvesting of paddy and works in fish farms under the scheme.
According to V Ambilikumar, Head, Department of Business Administration and Management, KUFOS, and principal investigator of the project, the scheme had made a huge impact on women’s lives and this would reflect on the socio-cultural dynamics of the State.
Kerala has a higher density of population, very limited land holdings and shortage of agricultural land. Hence the list of permissible works under the scheme should be reviewed accordingly, he said.
MS Raju, Director, School of Management and Entrepreneurship, KUFOS, and Mathew Sebastian, Associate Professor, KUFOS, were the co-investigators.

Insurance scheme for Asset Homes buildingsInsurance scheme for Asset Homes buildings
Our Bureau
Kochi, October 24:  
Kerala-based Asset Homes has introduced bundled insurance coverage for all its newly constructed dwellings.
All natural and manmade calamities are covered under the scheme, said Sunil Kumar, Managing Director, Asset Homes. The financial loss caused by recent cyclone Hudhud and Kashimir floods to building structures has prompted the company to go in for an insurance coverage, he added.
Incidents of natural calamities and manmade disasters such as terrorism and bomb explosions can damage buildings fully or partially.
Asset Homes has entered into an agreement with New India Assurance Company to offer the coverage called Insured Asset Scheme.
As per the MoU, all new villas and apartments of Asset Homes will be covered against damages caused by fire, earthquake, lightening, explosion etc for a period of 25 years.
The insurance company has agreed to extend a similar package to existing apartments of the company, for which discussions are in progress with resident associations.
CJ Philip, Deputy General Manager, New India Assurance Company, hoped that all builders in the country would emulate the initiative.

Getting a Grip on Ebolareddit
We have to get a grip. Ebola is not a crisis in the United States. One person has died and two people are infected with his body fluids.
The real crisis is the hysteria over Ebola that's being fed by media outlets seeking sensationalism and politicians posturing for the midterm elections.
That hysteria is causing us to lose our heads. Parents have pulled their children out of a middle school after learning the school's principal had traveled to Zambia. Zambia happens to be in Africa but it has not even had a single case of Ebola.
A teacher at an elementary school has been placed on paid leave because parents were concerned he might have contracted the Ebola virus. When and how? During a recent trip to Dallas for an educational conference.
Are we planning to quarantine Dallas next?
Some politicians from both parties are demanding an end to commercial flights between the United States and several West African countries. But there are no direct flights to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where Ebola is taking its biggest toll.
So do they want to ban all commercial flights that might contain someone from any of these countries, who might have transferred planes? That would cover just about all commercial flights coming from outside the United States.
The most important thing we can do to prevent Ebola from ever becoming a crisis in the United States is to help Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where 10,000 new cases could crop up weekly unless the spread of the virus is slowed soon.
Isolating these poor nations would only make their situation worse. Does anyone seriously believe we could quarantine hundreds of thousands of infected people a continent away who are infecting others?
The truth is quite the opposite. If the disease is allowed to spread in these places, the entire world could be imperiled.
These nations desperately need medical professionals in the field, more medical resources, isolation facilities, and systems in place to detect early cases.
Even at this stage, that's not an impossible task. Nigeria is succeeding in checking the spread of the disease. It has not had a new case of Ebola in over a month.
But I'm worried about America. I'm not worried about Ebola. I'm worried about our confidence and courage.
Every time a global crisis arises these days -- the drug war in Latin America, terrorism in the Middle East, climate change that's straining global food and water supplies and threatening many parts of the world with flooding -- the knee-jerk response of some Americans is to stop it at our borders.
As if we have the option. As if we live on another planet.
What's wrong with us? We never used to blink at taking a leadership role in the world. And we understood leadership often required something other than drones and bombs.
We accepted global leadership not just for humanitarian reasons but also because it was in our own best interest. We knew we couldn't isolate ourselves from trouble. There was no place to hide.
After World War II, we rebuilt Europe and Japan. Belatedly, we achieved peace in Kosovo. We almost eradicated polio. We took on tuberculosis, worldwide.
Now even Cuba is doing more on the ground in West Africa than we are. It's dispatching hundreds of doctors and nurses to the front lines. The first group of 165 arrived in Sierra Leone in the past few days.
Where are we?
We're not even paying attention to health crises right under our own noses.
More people are killed by stray bullets every day in America than have been killed by Ebola here. More are dying because of poverty and hunger.
More American kids are getting asthma because their homes are located next to major highways. One out of three of our children is obese, at risk of early-onset diabetes.
We're not even getting a flu shot to all Americans who need one.
Instead, we bicker. For the last eight months, Republicans have been blocking confirmation of a Surgeon General.
Why? Because the President's nominee voiced support for expanded background checks for gun purchases, and the National Rifle Association objected.
We've got to get our priorities straight. Media outlets that are exploiting Ebola because they want a sensational story and politicians using it to their own ends ought to be ashamed.
Public fear isn't something to be played with.
There's a huge job to be done, here and abroad. Let's roll up our sleeves and get on with it.

Barack Obama extends Diwali greetings to people across the worldBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:28 am
US President Barack Obama greeted Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists across the world on the occasion of Diwali, saying it was a chance to remember that even in the midst of darkness, light will ultimately prevail.
“I want to wish a Happy Diwali to all those who are celebrating the festival of lights here in the United States and around the world,” Obama said in his Diwali message yesterday.
In 2009, Obama became the first US president to celebrate the festival, a time of rejoicing for many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and across the world.
“For Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists, lighting the lamp – the diya – is a chance to remember, even in the midst of darkness, that light will ultimately prevail. Knowledge will defeat ignorance, and compassion will triumph over despair,” he said.
“Diwali is also a reminder that we must each do our part to achieve that victory, by dedicating ourselves to service to others. If we affirm our commitments to one another and strive to lift each other up, then together, we will continue moving closer to that brighter future we all seek,” he said.
America is a great and diverse nation, strengthened by the contributions of its entire people, he said, adding, he was proud to host the first Diwali celebration at the White House in 2009.
“Since then, we’ve continued to mark this holiday to honour the rich traditions that define the American family. And I know Michelle and I will never forget the wonderful time we had celebrating Diwali in Mumbai with food, dancing, and the company of friends,” Obama said.
“So, to all the families gathering together this Diwali to reflect on all the blessings of the past year, I wish you a joyous celebration and Saal Mubarak,” said the US President.
This year Secretary of State John Kerry would host the annual Diwali celebration of the Obama Administration.
It would be held at the historic Benjamin Franklin Room of the Department of State.
Kerry will be joined on stage by the Indian Ambassador to the United States S Jaishankar, the State Department said yesterday.
Following their remarks, Kerry and Jaishankar will light a traditional Diwali oil lamp.
A local Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple will preside over the ceremonial lighting and will drape Kerry with a traditional shawl.
In his remarks Kerry will celebrate the important contributions Indian and South-Asian Americans have made to the United States, and highlight the State Department’s commitment to human dignity, compassion, and service – a commitment that is at the heart of all great faiths, a media release said.

Concern for Washington real estate: declining Metro commutersBy Jonathan O'Connell October 23 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Fewer riders are taking Metro downtown for work in the morning. (Photo by jahi chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
For 15 years, more and more people rode Metro. Ridership increased an average of 3 percent annually, going from 150 million trips in 1996 to almost 225 million trips in 2009, according to the agency.
Growth came not only from the job gains Washington enjoyed during that period but rapid development near stations along the Green Line in the District, the Orange Line in Arlington and the Red Line in Montgomery County, among other places.
The growth came to a halt during the recession, but many assumed that it would restart once the economy recovered.
Instead, after plateauing, ridership resumed dropping  the past two years even as public transit usage nationwide reached record levels . Metro rail ridership is now almost at its 2005 level.
Metro is enduring a drop in ridership. (Courtesy WMATA)
Such declines concern Metro as it pushes for funding for its long-term improvements. What’s causing ridership to wane?
The agency’s staff raised a bathtub full of possible concerns for the drop-off in a recent report to the board , among them cuts to federal jobs, slow economic growth, a possible rise in teleworking, increased alternative work schedules, more bike commuters and the increased fares and track work that have driven some longtime Metro riders up the wall and maybe back into their cars.
In the report, Metro staff pointed out that recent surveys of federal workers found that more than 10 percent telecommute at least once a week. “Changing commute patterns, particularly in the form of telework and alternative work schedules, are an area of continuing investigation for Metro,” the staff wrote.
Declining ridership is also troubling for the real estate firms and developers that build and own offices near the stations, and of particular concern is a drop in the number of commuters who are taking Metro downtown in the morning.
The real estate services firm JLL looked at the number of morning passenger arrivals (pre-9 a.m.) at the system’s busiest stations, most of which are in or around downtown D.C. All but two of the stations saw declines in 2014 and the drop in Foggy Bottom, of 13.6 percent, was dramatic.

Total arrivals at downtown stations were still up slightly, at 1.7 percent, but JLL’s Brian Sullivan said that from a real estate perspective there is concern that teleworking policies — which have been talked about for a decade or more — are finally taking hold.
Walking, biking or driving to work is one thing, as those employees still need offices. But if you own an office building, employees not coming to work at all is quite another because their employers may decide they don’t need to lease as much space. Sullivan said it’s possible the drop-off “signals that the federal telecommute policies are taking hold, as fewer federal employees take Metro to work on a daily basis.”
“Real estate east of 15th Street caters more to supporting federal offices and we’ve been seeing steady declines in federal employment, so that would explain some of the changes,” Sullivan said.
Richard Barkham, chief global economist at the real estate services firm CBRE, said he sees a societal shift but toward the tech industry, not toward teleworking.
Workers at technology companies are pushing the growth in residential density that cities such as Washington have experienced in recent years, he said. More of them are walking or biking to work and fewer are clocking in from 9 to 5 at the office the way previous generations did.
“The big story in U.S. cities is densification,” Barkham said. “People are moving downtown because it’s very fashionable and very popular. I don’t think it’s threatening suburban living at the moment but it’s what young workers want to do.”
“I don’t think you should overstate teleworking,” he added. “People have talked about this for more than 15 years. When I was doing my PhD in the early ’80s … we were talking about it then. While people are more location-flexible, the more creative industries actually need more face-to-face time.”

Health minister: Mali confirms its first Ebola caseA volunteer receives the Ebola vaccination "cAd3-EBO-Z" at the vaccine center in Bamako, Mali, on Oct. 9. (Alex Duval Smith/EPA)
Mali's health minister confirmed Thursday  that the West African country has its first Ebola case.
Health Minister Ousmane Kone told state television Thursday that the patient is a 2-year-old girl in the Kayes region in the west of the country, Reuters reported. The girl recently came from Guinea, the minister added, which neighbors Kayes to the south.
"The condition of the girl, according to our services, is improving thanks to her rapid treatment," the minister said, according to the Reuters report. He added, "the sick child and the people who were in contact with her in Kayes were immediately identified and taken care of." 
According to the health minister, the patient's blood tested positive for Ebola after she was admitted to a hospital Wednesday evening, the AP notes .
Although the World Health Organization recently declared neighboring Senegal Ebola-free after a single case of the virus there, Guinea is one of three West African countries hit hard by the outbreak.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization has counted 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
The vast majority of those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Along with Senegal, the WHO has also determined that Nigeria is now Ebola-free.
There have been 4,877 confirmed deaths in the current outbreak.
Guinea alone has 1,540 cases of the disease and 904 deaths, according to the latest available figures from the WHO.

E-commerce Industry to Touch $90 Billion by 2021 in IndiaIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Mumbai: The e-commerce industry is worth $13 billion (Rs 79,300 crore) today and is expected to touch $90 billion (Rs 5,49,000 crore) by 2021, according to eTailing India Founder Ashish Jhalani.
This 700 per cent growth will change the way organisations allocate internet advertising budgets in India, eTailing India's Jhalani said in a statement here today.
"E-commerce is a full-fledged industry today, from being ancillary part of the retail industry less than a few years ago. Much like Apple changed the music industry, e-commerce will not only impact retail, but also the advertising industry, Mr Jhalani said.
Shoppers in India are increasingly using smartphones to buy products; sites such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Shopclues have reported that that up to 35 per cent of their traffic comes from the mobile phone. With the high penetration of phones in India and improving internet connectivity, e-commerce firms are expected to reach millions of new users in the coming years, he said.
In line with the growth of e-commerce, one-third of the world's advertising revenue is also expected to go digital by 2018, Mr Jhalani said.
At a recent conference, Google India declared that Indian internet users will surpass the number in the US by the end of 2014 and around 500 million people will be online by 2018.

Oil Slips to $86 on New York Ebola Case, Slowing Growth
Reuters | Updated On: October 24, 2014 15:48 (IST)
Gold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
London:
Brent crude oil fell to around $86 a barrel on Friday after a confirmed case of Ebola in New York raised fears that travel restrictions could trim jet fuel demand, and poor economic growth expectations weighed on projected oil demand.
European equities and US stock futures fell sharply on news that a doctor in New York City had been diagnosed with Ebola.
The doctor, who had worked in West African countries afflicted by the deadly virus, was diagnosed after returning to New York.
"Such news is not good for risk assets, with investors looking for a flight to safety. This could curb travel and that's how it could feed through to the oil markets," said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress.
Brent crude for December fell $1.02 a barrel to a low of $85.81 before recovering slightly to around $86 by 0835 GMT. US December crude fell 70 cents to $81.39 a barrel.
Economists anticipate subdued growth in China and the euro zone next year, though signals from India are more positive, according to a Reuters poll released on Friday.
The gloomy outlook in two major oil consuming markets added to fears of slowing oil demand at a time of global oversupply.
Manufacturers in China and the euro zone performed better than expected, according to purchasing managers' surveys released on Thursday, but industrial growth in the United States fell to its slowest rate since July.
Brent was on track to end the week flat, after four straight weeks of steep losses. The global benchmark rose $2.12 on Thursday on news that Saudi Arabia supplied less to the market in September.
But many analysts thought that the market had overreacted to the news, given that overall Saudi production rose month-on-month, with unsupplied oil being placed in storage.
"The reaction to the Saudi news was surprisingly high, and we may see a correction today," said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is a leading member, will meet on Nov. 27 to review its output target for the first half of 2015. So far, only a minority of members have called for an output cut, including Libya.

CIC devising system to keep tab on defaulting PIOsCentral Information Commission devising system to keep tab on defaulting PIOs
Gangadhar S Patil, ET Bureau Oct 24, 2014, 07.06PM IST

CIC
(The IMS which is awaiting DoPT’s approval…)
NEW DELHI: Keeping in view increasing numbers of cases of non-compliance of orders, the central information commission is working on an information management system (IMS) to keep a tab on the defaulting public information officer (PIO).
The IMS which is awaiting DoPT's approval would enable officials to prepare list of defaulting PIOs and also status of other orders passed by the commission, which is the apex body for RTI complaints at the centre. This would help commission take action against frequent erring officials and help applicant get needed information. This apart, the system would send SMS alert to complainants as soon as their complaints gets registered. It would also keep them updated on the progress of the complaint.
In June, the commission sent the proposal to the department of personnel and training, nodal agency for implementation of the RTI act and subsequently held discussions over it. "DoPT has sent us some queries pertaining to implementation of the system which we have replied. We are now waiting for the approval," said a senior official with commission. The commission has already designed the system.
Several orders passed by the commission are not implemented and there is no system to track them to punish the defaulting PIO . This has resulted in increasing number of rejection of RTI applications in recent past. At present, the commission does not maintain any register for non-compliance cases. Thus, the total number of such cases are unknown. However, officials say that it could run in thousands. The commission decides on nearly 60-70 cases every day and during 2013-14 it registered more than 20,000 complaints.
RTI experts opine that such system would put pressure on the officials to comply with orders leading to strengthening of the transparency law. The purpose of the act fails if the applicant does not get information sought even after getting a favorable order from the commission, said Hyderabad based RTI expert CJ Karira. "Commission needs to digitize its work as several cases of complaints missing and getting lost have come up," he added.
The CIC is the second level of appeal for RTI petitioners who are dissatisfied with responses provided by the public information officer and subsequently, the first appellate authority, who is usually the senior officer in the same department. The time limit for responding to both the petition and appeal is 30 days.
The problem of non-compliance of orders was discussed by the commission in its meeting held last month. "A proposal for additional staff may be sent to the DOPT for its consideration as the present staff strength is grossly inadequate to deal with such cases in the registry," said the minutes of meeting.

00:06  Yesterday the government announced the annual cost of living increase
00:09  in Social Security benefits. A whopping one point 7% hike or
00:13  about 22 bucks a month for the average beneficiary Hulu. But
00:17  there are three other thing can he do about Social Security.
00:19  I'm John Wagoner and this is America's markets. First Social Security
00:24  isn't all that generous. The average Social Security pay out as
00:27  1294. Dollars a month you know can be spending a lot
00:31  of time on the Love Boat on that. Second a lot
00:33  of people live off Social Security alone. For about 23% of
00:37  all Mary beneficiaries. Social Security represents 90% or more of their
00:41  income. Net source to 46%. For single beneficiaries. Third it's valuable
00:48  if you wanna replace Social Security in the private market leading
00:50  more than 300000. Additional retirement savings according vanguard. That's without benefits
00:56  to survivors or disability benefits with Social Security also provides. Sure
01:01  you might say people should pay their retirement out of their
01:03  own pockets but they go the average middle class workers say
01:06  just 20000 dollars towards retirement. Even with a really good and
01:10  that's returns that won't get too far and with your retirement
01:13  hobby is confusing and exploded bombs. Social Security is designed to
01:17  supplement your retirement income to keep save. And it can be
01:20  fixed reasonably easily at this point but for many people it's
01:24  their most valuable retirement nest it.

Social Security recipients will get a 1.7% cost-of-living raise starting in January, the Social Security Administration announced Wednesday.
For the average retired person receiving Social Security, monthly payments would rise $22 to $1,328 from $1,306. The average couple's benefits would rise to $2,176 from $2,140. Average annual payout: $15,936.
The maximum monthly Social Security benefit for a single worker at full retirement age will rise to $2,663 in 2015 from $2,642.
The increase will affect nearly 64 million Americans.
The cost-of-living increase was determined by the change in the government's Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) from the third quarter 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2014.
Retirement planning with Social Security's 'annual report'
Those who pay Social Security taxes will pay a bit more as well. The maximum amount subject to Social Security tax will rise to $118,500 from $117,000. Of the estimated 168 million workers who will pay Social Security taxes in 2015, about 10 million will pay higher taxes because of the increase in the taxable maximum, Social Security says.
Employees pay Social Security taxes at a 7.65% rate, with employers paying an equal amount. The self-employed pay the full 15.3% rate.
Although the raise is small, it's important, says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines. "The main thing is that payments do, in fact, go up with inflation," Jones says. Social Security recipients got a 1.5% raise this year and a 3.2% increase in 2012.

Ford CEO Mark Fields says the company has the expertise and ability to build a Tesla-style full-size, high-tech, high-performance, long-range electric vehicle.
Fields stopped short of saying Ford will do so, but did say, "It's consistent with our product philosophy."
Ford's only all-electric is the small Focus electric. Ford also sells plug-in hybrids.
Fields made the Tesla comment Friday during a conference call with Wall Street investment analysts and reporters discussing Ford's third-quarter earnings announcement.
Ford said it has no plan to copy the Tesla Model S -- a big, four-door hatchback sedan. But a larger vehicle of some kind, with greater range and better performance than the Focus electric, would fit Ford's lineup and its emphasis on technology, the automaker said.
In the conference call, Fields said Ford has the engineering and manufacturing sophistication to do such a model, with the range and quickness that characterize the Model S.
Ford bought a Tesla Model S and, Fields said, "We drove it. We took it apart. We put it back together and we drove it again."
One possibility, though Ford didn't bring it up: Inject some verve into the flagging Lincoln luxury brand by having it offer a large, fast, long-range electric car. Lincoln already enjoys some success with its mid-size MKZ hybrid sedan.
Lincoln's big sedan, a derivative of the Ford Taurus, is the MKS. So if Lincoln were to electrfy that one, it, too, would have an "S" model battery car.
Tesla was supportive.
It opened its patents in June to hurry the development of high-performance electrics by other makers. The company said Friday it believes that automakers "and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform."
Tesla could benefit financially, because it's planned "giga-factory" would be a main source for the high-capacity battery packs such cars would require.
In its earnings report Friday, Ford ( F ) said it had pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion the quarter and net income of $835 million, both well down from a year ago on higher costs, lower sales volumes.

New Yorkers and others further afield took to social media to criticize New York City Ebola victim Dr. Craig Spencer for going out and about in the city — including on the subway, in an Uber car and visiting a bowling alley — despite reportedly feeling unwell , though apparently before full symptoms exhibited themselves.
"Dr. Craig Spencer returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea on Oct 17 and didn't think to at least self quarantine?!" wrote Twitter user @DodieClouse about the case.
Meanwhile, tweeter Jake Nyborg vented:
Have Ebola? Feel free to take planes, trains, taxis (hell, even lick a few light posts) but stay away from the bowling lanes, man...
— jake nyberg (@jakenyberg) October 24, 2014
And New Yorker Melissa Stetten (@MelissaStetten) asked: "How did you get ebola? You rented some bowling shoes on Wednesday night and had a scratch on your toe? That's bad luck, man."
Spencer returned to New York from Guinea, where he had been working with Doctors Without Borders treating Ebola patients, and was declared asymptomatic at a New York City-area airport. He flew out of the West African nation on Oct. 14, traveling via Europe, and arrived in New York on Oct. 17.
Twitter users said he should have thought more about others' safety.
"#EbolaNYC doctor had overwhelming evidence he must self quarantine. Use common sense! Should be tried for manslaughter if he infects anyone!" tweeted Orlando, Fla., resident Nick Egoroff.
Others were just as vociferous, such as:
And Staten Island native and former Jersey Shore star Vinny Guadagnino was forthright in his criticism: "ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY for a doctor who knows he's been in contact w/Ebola, goes bowling, takes 2 subways, has contact with girl, Uber. none"
In typical New York style, some used gallows humor to highlight their thoughts:
The ballwasher at that Brooklyn bowling alley suddenly hates his job even more than usual. #EbolaNYC

@evanengel that doctor selfishly put his city at risk to go bowling...and p.s. subway sweat is highly unavoidable #CraigSpencer #ebola
— Court Jester (@courtjesterias) October 24, 2014
But mostly there was a sense of outrage on display.
@Dsr2 I wonder if he was working in West Africa with a group of physicians called #DoctorsWithoutBrains . #BowlingEbolaDoctor
— Evan Van (@MadAnter) October 24, 2014
Doctors Without Borders? How about Doc without a brain? Why the hell did this guy go bowling & take subway if fatigued on 10/21? #NYCEbola
— Todd Schnitt (@toddschnitt) October 24, 2014
Also, a call for common sense:
Any doctor returning from treating Ebola patients overseas might oughtta wanna be quarantined out of caution, no? http://t.co/QqbJz6c7wk
— Bill Green (@mtlb) October 24, 2014
All New Yorkers need to stay calm and not cause unneeded panic with regards to #NYCEbola . Don't let the media scare you! Think for yourself!

India s warning on pro-Pakistan group s rally on Kashmir in London15

New Delhi: Two days ahead of a planned rally in London by a pro-Pakistan group on Kashmir issue, India on Friday warned that forces inimical to Indo-UK relations may utilise such opportunity in open societies.
However, it appreciated Britain's stand that the Kashmir issue was to be resolved only by India and Pakistan and said that with this reassurance the government was "quite comfortable" of any march being organised.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the 'Million March', being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don't "overawe" it.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the 'Million March', being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don't "overawe" it.

"Now it is possible that forces inimical to India-UK relations may utilise opportuinities of this sort and it was in this context that we discussed with UK and we were reassured repeatedly that the UK's view is very clear and that it is for India and Pakistan to resolve any issue that they have by themselves.
"With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us....," he said.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised with Deputy Prime Minister of Britain Nick Clegg organisation of the planned anti-India march during her visit to London last week. The "Million March" is planned on October 26 from London's Trafalgar Square to highlight the Kashmir issue.
Asked about Pakistan parliament passing a resolution yesterday against the alleged "unprovoked and indiscriminate" ceasefire violations by India and seeking UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue, the Spokesperson said it was aimed at the domestic audience and that India opposed the option of involvement of any third party on the matter.
"Resolutions passed by Parliaments are... internalisation processes. Therefore, why should we have any problem with any internalisation process in any country? This is for that country to take a view on," he said, adding India was strongly opposed to internationalising the issue.
"As regards to any issue of international nature, we have given our views on that we do not see any option of any third party be involved in this. Therefore, as far as internationalisation is concerned, we are against it. As far as internalisation is concerned, this is for Pakistan to sort itself out," the Spokesperson said.
The Spokesperson said India was ready for talks with Pakistan under the provisions of Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration but it was for that country to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.
"Our view is that it is for Pakistan to enter into a situation where we can have an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, our view is very clear that we are ready for a bilateral dialogue under the Shimla agreement and the Lahore declaration. But that requires an atmosphere which is conducive for talks.
The ball, therefore, is in Pakistan's court," he said. To another question on information on the blast in Burdwan, as was sought by Bangladesh government, the MEA Spokesperson said the ministry has requested concerned agencies to collate information and was awaiting a report in this regard.
Once the Ministry receives the report, it will be factored-in in the response to Bangladesh government, he added. Earlier, the Spokesperson had confirmed that the Bangladesh government has requested India's assistance in the case.

Demand concerns put pressure on base metalsDemand concerns put pressure on base metals
G Chandrashekhar
:  
The global base metals market is currently facing strong headwinds that impact price performance.
In 2012 and 2013, a combination of expanding liquidity, weakening dollar, China’s voracious appetite for consumption and slowly improving growth prospects helped a strong uptick in demand. Although selective, investor interest in base metals was healthy.
Things are different now. This year has not been a great one for metals market.
In recent months, some of the important drivers have reversed direction while new challenges have emerged. Shrinking liquidity following the US Fed’s tapering programme, a steadily firming dollar, slowing industrial production in some of the major economies and lower inflation expectations have combined to cap the upside and force market prices down.
Currently, macroeconomic risks are casting a shadow – concerns over growth being the most important.
There is apprehension of demand slowdown. As the mover and shaker of the world commodity market, China’s import and consumption of metals exert a profound impact.
With construction activity in the Asian major slowing, there are fresh concerns over metals’ demand growth.
Another reason is the high level of corporate debt in China.
Although inflation is under control and employment healthy, the Chinese government seems to be worried about corporate debt and has, therefore, asked State-owned enterprises to fund purchases through cash flow rather than on credit.
According to experts, the metals and mining sector in China is not in a good shape. Declining investment growth and falling property prices have generated fears that the 2015 GDP growth target may be lowered. There are demand concerns is other regions too. Although US recovery is back on track, global growth is still uneven. Demand in Europe and Japan is still fragile.
Of course, many emerging markets show signs of stabilising with activities being adjusted to global realities. The US Fed’s monetary policy normalisation is seen as another uncertainty as expectations differ about the timeframe. Geopolitical tensions may have somewhat receded, but the Russia-Ukraine stand-off and insurgency in Syria and Iraq can potentially create a turmoil.
Simply put, the global environment is full of strong pulls and pressures.
As a result, many commodities are trading close to their cost curve.
Some of the less-efficient producers have shut down. It has also prompted a cut in capacity expansion.
Collapsing metal prices deter fresh investment while investor risk appetite wanes.
Supply demand fundamentals have begun to assert themselves.
Exception
An exception to the general trend of falling base metals prices is nickel whose price surge has been triggered by Indonesian ban on export of unprocessed raw material. Zinc is another exception because of tightening supplies.
Despite all the uncertainties surrounding the base metals market, on current reckoning, nickel will turn out to be a winner next year followed at a distance by zinc.

Gridco may earn Rs 700 cr from power tradingGridco may earn Rs 700 cr from power trading
Jayajit Dash & Sadananda Mohapatra | Bhubaneswar Oct 24, 2014 08:20 PM IST
State-run power trader Gridco Ltd said, it is at a comfortable position to earn Rs 700 crore in the current fiscal by trading power on energy exchanges and selling to other states as better post monsoon rainfall has increased chances of higher hydro power production.
“We have so far managed to trade power worth Rs 350 crore both on exchanges and via short-term trade with other states such as Uttar Pradesh. We hope the trading revenue could go upto Rs 700 by end of 2014-15,” said an official of Gridco. The state has generated around 750 Mw hydro power in the current month out of total 3200 Mw power available from different thermal power and renewable energy generators, compared with less than 500 Mw hydro power generated a month ago.
The hydro power output has got a major boost in last couple of weeks due to better post monsoon rainfalls. Between October 1 and 22, Odisha received 18 per cent excess rainfall than normal, against 31 per cent deficit recorded for all India. In the July-September monsoon period, it had recorded 4 per cent deficit than normal rainfall. Due to ample supply of water, major hydro power stations have reported better performance in October, data from Odisha Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) said. All the major reservoirs have water levels either at the maximum level or a little below the upper limit, it said.Hydro power rates are much cheaper compared with electricity available from coal-fired thermal sources. Gridco usually buys around 15 per cent of its total power requirement of 3000 Mw from hydro power generators.
Officials said, due to ample hydro power availability, Gridco wants to keep cheaper power for the state and sell costlier thermal power outside to earn profit. However, due to poor demand and lack of transmission facility for supply of power, the trading has remained rather dull for some time now.“Gridco can sell 400 Mw power everyday provided there is corridor (power supply path) for us to do that. Due to power traffic issues, the rates have dropped to below Rs 3 per unit and hence, we hold our power sales some days,” said the Gridco official.However, with the winter season approaching, Gridco is expecting better demand and hopes to generate Rs 350 crore more, the official added.
Cost of power purchase is one of the highest expenditure incurred by Gridco, roughly eating away around 83 per cent of each rupee earned by the power trader, as per financial data provided by it for 2013-14. However, due to better rainfall last year, hydro power generation met as much as 35 per cent of total requirement, pushing Gridco’s profit by 51 per cent to Rs 48.25 crore.  In 2012-13, total revenue earned from power trading stood at Rs 413.55 crore, including Rs 14.8 crore income via trading through power exchanges. Gridco mostly sells power through bilateral agreements, which are long term power supply commitments.

HDFC Life eyes Rs 100 cr premium from online salesHDFC Life eyes Rs 100 cr premium from online sales
Jayajit Dash | Bhubaneswar Oct 24, 2014 08:19 PM IST
Leading private sector life insurer HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd is targeting Rs 100 crore premium from online sales of its insurance products in the current fiscal.
The company is betting big on the online platform to push growth, having launched an array of 15 online products in the last couple of months.
“Our mantra here is to Sell Online, Deliver Online, Service Online. Our Click2Invest plan is a best in class ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) available exclusively for online customers. It is a low cost plan that delivers everything that customers asked of us in terms of features. We also recently launched a new online term plan Click2Protect Plus that has richer features than its previous avatar Click2Protect”, Sanjay Tripathy, senior executive vice president (marketing, product, digital and e-commerce) said in an e-mailed response.
The company plans to roll out more products shortly, exclusively for its online customers.“To leverage the true disruptive potential that the digital medium offers, it becomes crucial to adapt your systems, processes and personnel to best suit its unique demands. This has led to many insurers to adopt, and rightly so, a vertically integrated SBU (strategic business unit) like structure to ensure a dedicated focus that allows for agility, responsiveness and efficient scale up. We were the first ones to do this”, said Tripathy.
Commenting on HDFC Life's premium growth, he said, “Total premium (in April-September period) grew by 21 per cent compared to the previous year, aided by all-round growth in first year individual premium (28 per cent), individual renewal premium (17 per cent) and group premium (21 per cent). The company maintained a balanced product mix during this period”.
In 2013-14, total premium collected by the company grew by seven per cent over the previous year to Rs 12,063 crore.HDFC Life has wiped off its accumulated losses in the first quarter (April-June) of 2014-15 and has posted a net profit of Rs 454 crore in the April-September period and an accumulated surplus of Rs 220 crore by the end of September.The life insurance industry in the country is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12-15 per cent in the next five years and insurance penetration levels are expected to rise to five per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by 2020 from the current level of 3.2 per cent.
HDFC Life has ranked among the top three players in the private sector since 2009-10 on individual new business basis. The company's market among private sector life insurers has gone up from nine per cent in FY 10 to 14 per cent in FY 14.
The company recently forayed into the health insurance segment with the HDFC Health Assure Plan.
“We have met with a very encouraging response for the product. Our superior brand value, unique features like lifetime coverage, three year premium guarantee, 100 per cent increase in sum insured in two years in the event of no claims, restore benefit, no room rent cap and maternity benefit have struck a chord with the customers”, Tripathy claimed.

Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:50 pm
Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

Microsoft drops Nokia name from Lumia smartp...Microsoft drops Nokia name from Lumia smartphones
By PTI | 24 Oct, 2014, 10.11PM IST
US software giant Microsoft today said it will now start selling Lumia smartphones as 'Microsoft Lumia' device instead of calling them Nokia Lumia.

WASHINGTON: US software giant Microsoft today said it will now start selling Lumia smartphones as 'Microsoft Lumia' device instead of calling them Nokia Lumia.
"Our global and local websites are going through a transition as we speak and in the coming days our social channels will get a new name too - they will be called Microsoft Lumia," Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones Tuula Rytila said on a blog.
"We have now started the transition from Nokia Lumia to Microsoft Lumia," the company said.
The move comes within 6 month of Microsoft acquiring Finnish telecom company Nokia's mobile device business for about $7.5 billion. The deal was completed on April 25, 2014.
Rytila did not share timeline for launching Lumia device without Nokia brand name but said "we are looking forward to unveiling a Microsoft Lumia device soon. This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft."
Microsoft, however, will retain Nokia brand name for entry level phones.
"Microsoft will continue to sell Nokia-branded, entry-level category of phones, such as the Nokia 130. We have licensed the Nokia brand for such devices," Rytila said.
Microsoft has a 10-year license to use the Nokia brand on current and subsequently developed mobile phones from the date it acquired Finnish mobile devices company.

At least 824 000 displaced by Ukraine crisis...At least 430,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine as of Thursday, according to the UNHCR refugee agency, up 170,000 since early September.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ENEVA: The conflict in Ukraine has driven more than 824,000 people from their homes, but the real number could be far higher, the United Nations said on Friday, as it scrambled aid to offset the impact of winter.
At least 430,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine as of Thursday, according to the UNHCR refugee agency, up 170,000 since early September.
"With the crisis in Ukraine entering its first winter, UNHCR is racing to help some of the most vulnerable displaced people cope with expected harsh winter conditions," UNHRC spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters.
But he said the real picture is still emerging. "Ongoing fighting in the east, and the resulting breakdown of basic services, continues to drive more people from their homes," Edwards said.
Most are living in rented accommodation or staying with family or friends, but up to 18,700 are in improvised shelters which need weather-proofing, Edwards said.
Ukrainian government troops have been battling pro-Russian separatists since they rose up in April, after mass protests in the ex-Soviet republic ousted Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.
More than 3,700 people have been killed since April, according to UN figures. In addition to people displaced within Ukraine, another 387,000 have fled to Russia, Edwards said, citing official figures from Moscow.
The actual number in Russia may be far higher, given that Ukrainians do not need visas to travel there, Edwards said. Many Ukrainians have also headed westwards, either to the European Union or former Soviet republics such as Belarus.
In addition, an estimated 17,000 people have fled Crimea, the strategic Black Sea peninsula mainly populated by Russian-speakers which was annexed by Moscow in March.

Hero MotoCorp plans to launch 2 new models in next one year
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 17:  
Seeking to cash in on the fast growing scooter segment in the domestic market, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to launch two new models in the next one year.
The company is also considering to scale up its monthly scooter production capacity to 1 lakh units by January 2015 and 1.5 lakh units in the mid-term.
“In the next one year, there will be two new scooter models in the market,” Hero MotoCorp Senior Vice-President & CFO Ravi Sud told analysts in a conference call.
While he did not elaborate on the segmentation of the new scooters, Sud said it would add to the company’s existing models — Pleasure and Maestro — to accelerate growth in the scooter segment.
Domestic sales
Scooter sales in India grew 32.11 per cent during the April-September period at 21,90,351 units this fiscal against 16,57,920 units in the year-ago period.
In the first half of the ongoing fiscal, Hero MotoCorp had posted a growth of 5.52 per cent in scooter sales at 3,52,330 units against 3,33,889 units in the same period last fiscal.
Sud said that the company’s domestic scooter sales did not reflect the actual growth as Hero MotoCorp had committed its capacity to execute a one-time export order of 45,000 units by the beginning of November.
Production capacity
Seeing further growth in the scooter segment, the company would be enhancing its scooter production capacity.
“Currently we have a capacity to produce 80,000 units per month, which we are scaling up to one lakh units by January 2015. The consideration is to take it to 1.35-1.5 lakh units in the mid-term,” Sud said.
He said the one lakh scooters capacity would come from the existing plants of the company.
“When we increase it to 1.5 lakh units a month, it could also include the scooter capacity from the upcoming plant in Gujarat,” Sud said.
Currently, Hero MotoCorp produces its scooters from Gurgaon and Dharuhera plants.
Sales growth
He said scooter penetration in India is expected to increase to around 32-33 per cent from the current 27 per cent. Scooter sales growth has been urban-led where the penetration is 40 per cent, which can go up to 45 per cent.
The company has a total two-wheeler production capacity of 7.65 million units annually from its plants at Gurgaon, and Dharuhera in Haryana, Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Neemrana in Rajasthan. By next year, it would add another 1.8 million units annually when its fifth plant at Halol in Gujarat becomes operational.
The company is planning to set up its sixth plant in Andhra Pradesh.

Luxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sitesLuxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sites
Purvita Chatterjee
Cutting edge Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand.
Believe discounts will erode image
Mumbai, October 23:  
Even as pure play e-commerce sites bend backwards to offer deep discounts, some brands have been keeping away from the action, refusing to mark down their products.
Luxury and bridge-to-luxury brands such as Celio, Swarovski and Zegna are willing to jump onto the e-commerce bandwagon, but on their own terms. These brands feel that discounting would erode their premium image among consumers.
Calling the shots
“We should be in a position to control our prices so there will be no third-party sites. There are plans to start online transactions under our own site like we do worldwide, but there will be no discounts. Prices will be similar to our brick-and-mortar outlets,” says Sukanya Dutta Roy, MD, Consumer Goods Business, Swarovski India.
Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand. Its managers feel the brand should not be seen on pure play e-commerce sites.
Reliance Brands, too, has decided to stay away from selling most if its luxury brands on third-party Websites. “Mainstream consumers do not shop from luxury sites. We have limited e-commerce operations to just two of our brands like Quicksilver and Steve Madden. We have not yet taken a decision to bring the rest of our portfolio of brands on the e-commerce platform” says Darshan Mehta, CEO, Reliance Brands.
None of Reliance Brands’ iconic brands such as Timberland, Diesel, Ermenegildo Zegna and Paul & Shark are available on any Indian e-commerce sites as of now.
Given their premium offering, luxury brands insist that they do not like the idea of being treated like commodities. However, there are some international brands present on e-commerce sites. They do not have a choice, and are not allowed to go it alone because of the laws governing single-brand retail.
“We resort to third-party online sites to sell some of our products. We have to be FDI approved to start our own e-commerce operations,” explains Rajiv Nair, CEO, Celio Future Fashions. Though the brand is present on some leading Websites, Nair says: “Ideally, we would like to bring down discounts to a minimum. Once we have our own site, it will reflect the prices are offered at our brick-and-mortar stores.”
Touch and feel
Says Anjana Sharma, COO and Fashion Director, Stylista, a fashion portal: “Luxury brands are about experience, customisation, touch and feel… unlike the rest of the brands, which prefer to go online to get volumes.
Incidentally, most brands having their own e-commerce portals prefer to have similar prices as their offline counterparts. As Nair says: “Even the website belonging to Madura Garments has similar prices as their brick-and-mortar stores.”

10 Money Things You Must Know After 50reddit
Birthdays that mark a new decade tend to prompt personal reassessment: In your 20s, starting your career may have been your focus. In your 30s and 40s, maybe it was the big goals you wanted to reach with your family.
But by 50, you may already feel like you've got it figured out. You make a good salary, you've reached many of your life goals and your kids are on their way to independence.
But there are still a lot of money truths left to learn, especially as you're approaching your retirement years. Plus, times are changing: What was a financial truism in your youth may not be the reality now.
So we asked several CFPs to reveal 10 crucial things that could affect your money once you enter your 50s, both the bright spots and the potential pitfalls. Read on to see where you might need to be better prepared.
1. The cost of long-term care insurance
While it may not be the most pleasant thing to think about, how you plan to cover potential eldercare costs like a nursing home or a home health aide should be on your radar, stat. Long-term care insurance can help pay for so-called "custodial care" services like those, which are often not covered by Medicare -- but the longer you wait to buy a policy, the more expensive it's likely to be.
"It's something to start thinking about even prior to age 50," says Chuck Roberts, CFP®, founder and C.E.O. of Financial Freedom Planners in Richmond, Virginia. "It becomes more expensive as you grow older."
According to 2012 data from the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a couple taking out a policy at age 55 will pay an average of $2,466 a year, while a couple who waits until they're 60 will pay $3,381. But some health conditions -- a stroke or metastatic cancer, for example -- can make you ineligible to purchase such a policy in the first place. So it can be wise to look into a policy now, while you're in good health.
2. You're likely not going to stay an empty nester
Got grand plans to build a wet bar in your basement? Not so fast. "Unless [your child] is a shark on Wall Street, he may need some help from his parents," says Brian Mahany, CFP®, principal at Sustainable Financial Planning in Toledo, Ohio. "I am definitely seeing some parents converting their basements for their kids to live in."
Pew Research data reveals that the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living in "multigenerational" households rose from 11 percent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2010. And only 48 percent of these so-called Boomerang kids pay rent to their parents. "A great many parents feel honor-bound to help their children," says Mahany. "They're not giving their kids any kind of lease."
3. And you may still have to pay for your children's health insurance
Recent grads are having a hard time in the job market:  One study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that 44 percent of recent grads are underemployed, meaning that they work in jobs that don't require a college degree -- which also likely means they aren't getting the perks that a good job normally brings, like insurance.
On top of that, they are graduating with a lot of debt, which tends to leave little money left to cover their bills, let alone health care. "With the student debt load kids are carrying, I have seen more instances of parents bringing kids back into the family health plan," says Mahany.
According to Healthcare.gov , children under 26 may be eligible for coverage under their parents' health insurance plan even if they're married, not living at home and attending school. Keeping your kids on your insurance may only amount to a few extra dollars a month for you, but it's still an extra cost that you'll have to budget for -- on top of the fact that they've taken over the basement.

4. You should consider making credit card debt a thing of the past
"By the time you're 50, you should be out of revolving debt, such as credit card purchases," Roberts says. That money would probably be better off helping you prepare for retirement -- plus, when you're ready to enter your golden years, you don't want a debt burden during a time when you're no longer earning a salary.
Unfortunately, debt has been steadily rising amongst people of retirement age: According to recently released  research by the National Center for Policy Analysis, in 1989 the average credit card balance for people ages 65 to 74 was $2,100, compared with $6,000 in 2010.
If paying down credit card debt is something you still need to work toward in your 50s, you can use our checklist to help you get started.

5. It's a good time to start thinking about where you want retire
Especially if you don't plan on staying in your current home, you should ask yourself where you might want to settle down, whether it's a ranch house in Tucson or a condo in Miami Beach.
That's because where you eventually relocate will likely have an impact on how you're saving for retirement now. For example, you may need to ask yourself, "Do I really have enough to take on a new mortgage 15 years down the line? Does my current savings plan take into consideration a change in cost of living? How retiree-friendly -- or not -- is the state I'm thinking of moving to?"
And get as granular as you need to, even down to the type of home. "People should [even] think about what kind of house they want to live in: Is it a single story or multiple story?" Mahany says. All those details may help you determine what you'll end up paying for housing in your dream retirement locale.
6. Your life insurance needs may change
If your children are grown and independent, and if you have enough savings to provide for a spouse in the event of your death, you may decide that you no longer need as much term-life insurance coverage as you used to have, or you may need it only for a shorter period of time.
"In [your 50s], some of the heavy living expenses that life insurance provides for families in case of a premature death are lessened at that age," Roberts says, so it may be a good time to reassess what costs you'd need insurance to cover.
That's for term life insurance. Permanent life insurance -- like a whole life policy, for example -- has an added investment component that could potentially grow in value, and which you may be able to borrow against. Whether you decide to keep that type of policy will probably depend on whether you still see value in it as an investment vehicle, says William Bregman, a CFP® who practices in New York City.
For most people, however, term life insurance may be sufficient, and you can get coverage up until age 80. Whole life insurance generally is more often used if you're concerned about estate taxes or want to leave behind a legacy for your family. Because permanent life policies are often more difficult to understand -- and usually carry higher premiums -- it's important to consult with your insurance agent or a CFP® to determine whether a permanent life policy makes sense for you.

7. You don't have to worry about Social Security collapsing
Yes, the Social Security Administration has stated that , by 2035, taxes will be able to cover only 75 percent of scheduled benefits. But older Americans have a brighter Social Security future than their younger counterparts. "Confidence that Social Security will continue to provide benefits that are at least equal to today's value is higher among workers ages 45 and older than among younger workers," according to EBRI's 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey .
Why? Because even small tweaks to Social Security [policies] could secure it well into the future, according to Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist with the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at University of California, Berkeley. "Before the first Social Security check went out, people called for its demise, said it would fail," says Allegretto. "Yet not one person has ever had a missed Social Security check."

8. Retirement doesn't mark the end of your career
Even when you call it quits from your current job, your knowledge and experience could still be in demand -- and help earn you some additional money in your later years.
"I've had some nice good-news conversations with a client in his 60s, who found out he could retire right now if he wanted," says Roberts. "He's in the engineering profession and could easily do some additional consulting, which could add to savings."
Indeed if you've had a long career in the knowledge sector -- accounting, medicine, law, etc. -- you could very well extend your working years with a consulting side gig. According to 2013 data from the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 82 percent of Americans over the age of 50 expect to work in some capacity after retirement.

9. You can contribute more to retirement than you used to
Feel a little behind in your retirement savings? The good news is that turning 50 means you're eligible to make a "catch-up contribution" of $5,500 to your 401(k) plan. That's over and above the $17,500 that the IRS allows anyone younger than 50 to contribute to a 401(k) now.
You also get to play catch-up with your IRA too -- you can contribute an extra $1,000, for a total of $6,500.
10. It's never too late to save for retirement
"At 50 you can still take great advantage of compounding interest" in your retirement portfolio, says Roberts. He notes that while you may have a different asset allocation than you would have had at, say, 30, the fact is that  compound returns  take effect no matter when you start.
In fact, many financial planners complain about clients who don't seek help mapping out their retirement until they reach their 60s. "When anyone comes to me thinking about retirement by their 50s," says Mahany, "I'm very happy."

Ericsson s India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networksEricsson's India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networks
Our Bureau
Hans Vestberg
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson has reported a 56 per cent growth in revenues from India, making it the highest growing region for the company worldwide. Sales in India grew to 2 billion (SEK) Swedish Kronor or Rs 1,685 crore in the third quarter of 2014 from 1.28 billion SEK in the corresponding quarter last year. India, which accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s global revenue, now ranks number four behind the US, China, and Japan.
“Since the end of last year, sales in the region has recovered, mainly driven by an increase in operator capital expenditure spending in response to greater data uptake. The year-on-year growth in support solutions is driven by OSS and BSS and TV & media,” the company said.
(OSS and BSS are software solutions that enable telecom service providers to manage their networks, their business and their customer relations.)
Ericsson’s Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said the investment climate in India continues to improve.
The performance in India, China, West Asia and Russia helped Ericsson to grow its global revenue to 57.6 billion Swedish kronor ($7.94 billion) in the quarter, up 9 per cent from 53 billion kronor a year ago.

Suicide bomber threat to Air India flights  four major airports on alertBomb threat puts India's airports on alert
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  New Delhi/Thiruvananthapuram: , October 24, 2014
First Published: 13:16 IST(24/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:59 IST(25/10/2014)
Comments
Airports across the country have been put on high alert after the Airport Authority of India (AAI) received a letter saying the Kochi- Mumbai and Ahmedabad - Mumbai flights would be attacked on October 25 and 26. Reports suggest suicide bombers could board the planes in the early hours of the morning.
Security at Kochi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports has been tightened with enhanced screening of passengers and rigorous anti-sabotage checks. Ground staff of AAI have been sensitised about the threat and aircraft are being more meticulously sanitised.
At Kochi airport, Rapid Action Force personnel have been deployed with extra policemen frisking passengers and checking luggage. Access to the airport has also been restricted.
 “We received information from Kolkata that there is a threat to the Mumbai-Kochi flight on Oct 25. We are on high alert,” said Kochi airport director A K C Nair.
A security source said the letter – most likely an act of mischief --- was received about a week back at one of AAI’s offices and led to elaborate security arrangements.
“All such threats are taken seriously, even if it is the act of some mischief monger,” said a security official.

The renowned M3 badge may be alive and kicking to refer to the ‘M’ version of the latest generation of BMW’s 3-series sedan but for all intents and purposes, it is this car – the new M4 – which is the real successor to the legendary BMW M3 Coupé.
It turns out Kawasaki’s big bike portfolio is steadily evolving at a welcome pace in India, with each successive motorcycle pretty much at the top of its game, even in terms of the crucial affordability factor.

PMs flood-relief package draws flak from Kashmir political partiesPolitical parties in Kashmir slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Rs. 745-crore relief package for the flood-hit state on Friday, saying it was a “cruel joke” and fell way short of expectations after the worst flooding in decades.

Kashmiris were expecting a Rs. 44,000 crore-package during Modi’s Diwali visit to help rehabilitate thousands of people who lost their homes in the devastating floods, but the prime minister earmarked a far lower Rs. 570 crore for renovation of flood-hit houses. The rest was to rebuild six hospitals in the state.
``I have come to the state today to show solidarity with people of the state. I  have always maintained that the calamity is not only for the people of the state, it is a calamity for the entire country. The nation stands with the people of the valley,'' the prime minister said on Thursday when he met delegations of flood-affected people, traders, Sikh and Pandit groups as well as representatives of various political parties.
But political parties were not impressed, with the Congress party describing the package as “a cruel joke”.
"Modi's announcement is like adding insult to the injury. It showed his casual approach to give a helping hand to the people ravaged by the severest flood in their recorded history," said Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief Saifuddin Soz.
The ruling National Congress and chief minister Omar Abdullah were also disappointed with the relief package.
“If it's the final relief amount, then we are disappointed. We are hopeful to get Rs. 44,000 crore as proposed by us. Besides the housing sector, our private sector and infrastructure need impetus," said National Conference spokesman Junaid Azim Mattu.
The BJP hit out at the Congress and the National Conference, saying they were trying to politicise every issue.
“The two parties do not understand the pain and grief of those who have lost their family, homes and what not. The PM went there to share their grief, but the Congress had problem with that as well. This shows their negative state of mind,” said BJP spokesman Anil Baluni.
“Our government is committed to proper and adequate relief and rehabilitation exercise there, irrespective of the cynicism of our political opponents.”
Separatists, who organised a shutdown during the prime minister’s trip, described the visit as "politically motivated" and aimed at assembly elections due by early next year. The Bharatiya Janata Party is hoping to expand its support beyond the Hindu-majority region of Jammu to the Muslim-majority Valley and is aiming for 44 seats in the 87-member assembly.
"The real aim of the visit to Kashmir was to further his political interests in the wake of the sham assembly elections. He was not even remotely concerned about the sufferings and hardships faced by the Kashmiris," said moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.
Muslim Conference head Shabir Ahmad Dar, a constituent of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat led by Shabir Ahmad Shah, said the prime minister's visit was intended to only meet the armed forces in Siachen.
"The relief amount is so small that it cannot rehabilitate even a mohalla, forget Kashmir," he said.

Peace with China not at cost of honour: RajnathComments
Home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that India wants peace with China but that cannot come at the cost of honour.
"We want peace with honour. Peace cannot come at the cost of honour," he said, referring to the recent border row with China.
"Pride is the ultimate accomplishment of a human being, of mine and yours," he said, addressing the 53rd raising day function of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) , which guards the Sino-Indian border.
Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that New Delhi wants to maintain peaceful relations with all its neighbouring countries and wanted to resolve border issues peacefully.
"Our Prime Minister has told the Chinese president and requested him that if there is a dispute we should talk," he said.
The home minister said China often raises question over the border and even had raised objections when India wanted to improve border infrastructure within its own territory.
Referring to Pakistan, the home minister said the neighbouring country should stop firing on border posts and civilian areas.
He said Pakistan had fired upon the civilian areas along the border in Jammu and Kashmir just a day before Diwali.
"When we get to know about ceasefire violations done by Pakistan or there is some dispute in the context of India-China border, we feel hurt and we feel angered.
"Pakistan fired on civilians even on the eve of Diwali festival and they did not even spare our festival. Pakistan should be wary of this. I want to tell Pakistan to stop this continuous violation of ceasefire," he said.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Congress chief  saysChidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014
First Published: 19:27 IST(24/10/2014) | Last Updated: 08:57 IST(25/10/2014)

Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

WHO sends expert team to Mali after first Ebola diagnosis in the West African countryBy Abby Ohlheiser October 24 Follow @abbyohlheiser

The World Health Organization is preparing to send a team of experts to Mali after the country announced that it had its first Ebola case, a WHO spokesperson said Friday.
Mali's health minister said Thursday night that a 2-year-old girl who recently traveled from Guinea with her grandmother was admitted to a hospital in Kayes this week and tested positive for Ebola.
On Friday, WHO spokesperson Fadéla Chaib told The Post in an e-mail that four experts would travel to Mali as soon as possible to provide help with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing and social mobilization. "These functions need to be deployed within the next 24 hours," Chaib said.
The group will join a team of three WHO workers already in Mali, where they have been working on outbreak preparedness in the country since Oct. 19.
According to the WHO's statement on the case, the toddler's symptoms included a 102.2-degree fever, a nose bleed, bloody stools and a cough.
Chaib said the child first saw a health-care worker in Kayes, in the western region of Mali, on Monday. The next day, she was moved to the Fousseyni Daou Hospital and admitted to the pediatric ward.
Officials took samples from the patient on Wednesday, which were analyzed at the Bamako University Lab on Thursday. (An earlier statement from Malian officials said that the patient was admitted to a hospital on Wednesday.)
The WHO said that 43 contacts of the child have been isolated, including 10 health-care workers in Kayes. Local authorities are in the process of contact tracing and training personnel at the isolation site treating the child, the organization added.
In a second statement Friday, the WHO said that, based on an initial investigation, officials believe the grandmother traveled to a funeral in southern Guinea. The grandmother then returned to Mali on Oct. 19 with the child. The pair used public transportation.
"The case history revealed that bleeding from the nose began while both were still in Guinea, meaning that the child was symptomatic during their travels through Mali," the statement said. "Multiple opportunities for exposure occurred when the child was visibly symptomatic."
WHO officials are "seeking confirmation of media reports that the funeral was for the child’s mother, who is said to have shown Ebola-like symptoms before her death."
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
Mali is now the sixth West African country to record an Ebola case during the deadliest outbreak in history . The epidemic, whose death toll is rapidly approaching 5,000, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Nigeria and Senegal have also recorded cases.
Just hours before Malian health officials announced the diagnosis, WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said to reporters that the organization had "reasonable confidence right now that we are not seeing widespread transmission of Ebola into the neighboring countries," including Mali, Guinea Bissau and the Ivory Coast.
However, WHO hadn't ruled out the possibility of an Ebola case in Mali, as it was one of 15 countries identified as a "priority" by the WHO as the outbreak spread -- due in part to its proximity to the most severely affected regions. That's why, Chaib said, there was already a small WHO team in Mali before the first case was identified.

The Kayes region of Mali, where the first case was diagnosed, borders Guinea, one of three countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic. Guinea alone has recorded 904 Ebola deaths and 1,540 total cases of the disease, according to the latest figures available from the WHO .
In all, there are 4,877 confirmed deaths and 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
Two of those countries are now considered Ebola-free: Nigeria and Senegal. Senegal, which also neighbors Mali, had a single case of Ebola, also imported from Guinea.
Also on Friday, the WHO announced that "several hundred thousand" doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine will be available by the first half of 2015.

Socialist Party Pushing $20 Minimum Wage Defends $13-An-Hour Job Listingreddit
The Freedom Socialist Party has right - wing bloggers seeing red over a job listing that paid less than the group advocates for a minimum wage.
Earlier this month, the nonprofit posted listings on Craigslist and Indeed to advertise an opening for a part-time web designer. It offered to pay $13 an hour or more, depending on the designer's experience. That's well below the $20 minimum wage the party pushes for in its platform , and lower than the $15 wage it helped pass this year in Seattle. Right-leaning sites promptly seized on what they saw as hypocrisy.
But Doug Barnes, the party's national secretary, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that the group relies heavily on donations from low-wage workers and could not afford to pay much to an inexperienced designer.
"We're practicing what we're preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage," Barnes said, making his first public comment on the controversy. "But we can't pay a lot more than $13."
He said the party's revenues would increase if the minimum wage were raised to $20 -- and he'd even prefer $22, at least in Seattle. The city will begin phasing in a $15 minimum wage in April.
"Our donor base would all be affected, and the low-wage workers who support us with $5 to $6 a month would be able to give more," he said. "That would affect our ability to pay higher wages as well."
But Barnes said he removed the $13 starting wage from the Craigslist ad on Friday in response to the online criticism.
"The right-wing attack is very hypocritical," he said. "These are the same people who fought against the minimum wage and support companies like Walmart."
He said the Freedom Socialist Party, which was formed in 1966 as a revolutionary feminist breakaway group from the United States Socialist Workers Party, does not accept donations from corporations.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Move Higher in Muhurat Trading
NDTV | Updated On: October 23, 2014 18:59 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The BSE Sensex and Nifty moved higher today in the special 'Muhurat trading' session to mark the festival of Diwali.
The Sensex rose over 100 points to 26,930 while Nifty jumped to 8,031.The gains were broad-based today with all the sectoral indices on the BSE rising in today's session. The broader markets outperformed with all the BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising over 1 per cent. ( Track shares )
Shares of IT major Wipro fell as much as 5 per cent. Wipro, which had missed its earnings estimate in the September quarter, was also the top loser in the 50-share Nifty. ( Wipro falls sharply after lacklustre Q2 )
Indian markets have rallied in the past four sessions, buoyed by gains in global markets and energy sector reforms announced by the government.
From last year's Diwali to this Diwali, India's bluechip indices Sensex and Nifty ended with more than 25 per cent gain. Buying by foreign funds, a stable government at the Centre and hopes of big bang reforms are the three big triggers that have lifted domestic stock markets to record highs during the period.
The gains have been bigger in broader markets with midcaps and smallcap indices surging 48 per cent and 75 per cent.
Analysts expect the gains to continue in Indian markets but not to that extent compared from last Diwali.
Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO of Axis Capital, says the handsome returns from the previous Diwali are unlikely to be repeated till the next Diwali but investors can still expect double-digit returns. The polarisation between the largecaps and midcaps are likely to narrow down, he added.
Brokerage firm Karvy Stock Broking has put out a Sensex target of 29,300 by next Diwali, a gain of nearly 10 per cent.

India firmly on the radar for HyundaiIndia firmly on the radar for Hyundai
Murali Gopalan
Hot seller The i20 elite has caught the fancy of the market and is a heavy contributor to Hyundai's sales.
The company clocked domestic sales of 4.44 lakh units for January-September
It was at the 1998 Delhi Auto Expo when Hyundai first made known its India intent with the unveiling of the Santro hatchback. This was the year when all eyes at Pragati Maidan were on the Tata Indica.
It was also the time when Suzuki Motor Corporation and its partner, the Indian Government, were locked in a bitter war-of-words.
There was a sense of enormous excitement coupled with fierce nationalism. This was thanks primarily to Tata Motors which was keen to show that India could also make its own car even while it had thrown open its gates to multinationals. The Indica was naturally the cynosure of all eyes at the Expo but nobody could ignore Hyundai either which, apart from the Santro, also had the Accent on display.
The numbers
Many Expos have come and gone at Pragati Maidan since then, but the Korean automaker is perhaps in the most exciting phase of its India tenure. Its recent launches comprising the Grand i10, Xcent and Elite i20 have caught the fancy of the market and are clocking over 20,000 units between them each month.
The entry model, Eon, has settled to a routine of nearly 7,000 units while the old warhorse, Santro, comfortably does around 4,000 cars.
On Thursday, Hyundai declared its third quarter results in Seoul where India clocked sales of 4.44 lakh units for the January-September period.
The i10 was the largest selling model with 2.12 lakh units followed by the i20 with 82,000 and the Eon with 74,000 units. Other models including the Santro, Xcent etc chipped in with the balance 76,000 units.
Sure, Maruti continues to be the market leader with monthly numbers averaging over one lakh units thanks to a host of successful models such as the Alto, Wagon R, Swift, Dzire and the more recent Celerio. It is equally true that the company has faced no threat to its numero uno status for many years now.
Yet, what is interesting about Hyundai is a new sense of energy and determination within its system. The new products (i10, Xcent and i20) have been loaded with features which have caught the attention of the market in a big way. “In terms of styling and design, Hyundai is making a strong statement which young buyers are finding incredibly hard to resist,” a top auto executive says.
Will this be enough to upset the Maruti applecart during the course of this decade?
Very unlikely given that the Japanese automaker is not being remotely complacent even for a minute.
Aware that it is still associated with the small car imagery, Maruti has been working on ideas like AMT (automated manual transmission) on its Celerio and more recently, the Alto. The Ciaz will show if the company can make a strong mark for itself in the sedan segment.
Hyundai also has competition from Honda which has staged a strong comeback with the Amaze, new City and the Mobilio multipurpose vehicle.
“The Xcent has made a bigger impact than the Amaze and Hyundai will now have to replicate this with the Verna against the City,” an industry observer says.
Why is Hyundai making news now when it has already proved that it is Maruti’s closest rival?
After hitting paydirt with the Santro and Accent in the late-1990s, the Getz and Elantra did not quite set the market afire.
And even as numbers continued steadily, there was really no excitement on the product front.
Bad timing
As an entry-level option, the Eon was an interesting product from the Hyderabad R&D centre but was unfortunate to be launched when the country was in the mist of a diesel buying craze three years ago. With petrol back in favour now, the car has made up lost ground.
Global conundrum
Unlike Suzuki which, apart from Japan, has India and ASEAN as its key growth regions, Hyundai is well and truly a global company with a presence in the US, Europe, China and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) regions. In the process, it becomes doubly difficult for the company to focus exclusively on countries such as India when other parts of the world, especially the West, are far more profitable markets.
This is a challenge that Toyota also faces except that Hyundai has rediscovered its mojo a lot faster in India.
Going forward, the company will launch a compact SUV here while building the base for exports to West Asia and Asia-Pacific.
And even while it focuses on important global projects such as the electric vehicle (planned with Daimler) which debuts in Europe next year, Hyundai will now step up the gas in a big way in India.

The #1 Dumb Thing Businesses Do to Hurt Themselvesreddit
If you really want to hurt your business, ignore what your customers want. Let me give you a few examples of this stupid business trick in action.
If you're a seafood fan like me, chances are you've eaten at Red Lobster. A couple years ago, I noticed the quality of service sharply decreased. It turns out, in their never-ending quest to cut costs, the owners eliminated all busboy positions and demoted many of the servers. In addition to bussing their own tables, servers now had to take on four tables at a time instead of three. The leadership did so after convincing themselves, somehow, that both the wait staff and the customers approved. Actually, they didn't. People got sick of waiting for clean tables and meals, and started voting with their feet. Less than a year later, Red Lobster rescinded the policy, and business has picked up since.
Downsizing can be deadly, and not simply because it overworks the surviving employees, but because it can lower your ability to respond to customer needs. You may have read my previous discussions of Circuit City's suicidal decision to save money by replacing commission-based sales personnel with minimum-wage newbies who didn't know the difference between a USB port and an Ethernet plug.  People stopped buying, and Circuit City died an ignominious death. Leadership forgot that while labor is your biggest expense, your employees are your greatest asset.
Borders couldn't adapt to the e-book phenomenon customers were demanding, whereas Barnes and Noble embraced it wholeheartedly. Borders eventually went the way of the buggy-whip makers who thought horseless carriages were a passing fad. Speaking of passing fads, wasn't that what the old Bulletin Board Services called the Internet? When was the last time you dialed into a BSB? (Do you even remember them at all?)
Netflix also ignored customer desires to their peril. They started out by mailing DVDs to subscribers, then added online video streaming. Eventually, Netflix decided to split the services into different two companies, despite the outcry against it. They stuck to their guns, making ready to spin off the DVD mailing as Quickster. They even hiked their fees...then, just as Quickster was almost a reality, they killed it. Those who had gotten used to the idea were outraged again. Once the brouhaha calmed down, Netflix finally stopped reloading the gun they kept shooting themselves in the foot with.
Bottom line: keep your ear to the ground, do what your customers love, and make changes that follow their desires.

The Bottom Line on Climate Change Costsreddit
The recent  report published by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , an organization aimed at helping the world's societies to combat the effects of climate change, suggests that the costs of combating climate change are considerably lower than widespread opinion has suggested. This new analysis is considered to be a real game changer in how we perceive and act on remedies for polluting the planet.
The analysis cuts to the heart of climate deniers contentious arguments that an overhaul of the fossil fuel industry will cream our economy. Not so.
The study tells us that between 2015 and 2030, nations are expected to invest roughly $90 trillion in urban, land-use and energy infrastructure. The report suggests that implementing the fixes necessary to transition to entirely sustainable sources of energy would amount to  4 trillion.  So, this amounts to 5% increase of the total amount that is estimated to be spent on new power plants, transit systems, and other infrastructure over the same period. While economically feasible, the report's recommended changes are expected to face a tough political reception.
The report outlines the plunging costs of renewable energy and point to solar technology costs which have been cut in half since 2010. Meanwhile, it paints the compelling argument, known for quite some time that limiting urban sprawl and deforestation are essential steps in combating climate change.
It's going to require the cooperation of countries to cease subsidies for fossil fuels and transition to renewable sources of energy alongside the adoption of a wide variety of initiatives to encourage--for instance-- more efficient land use and fighting forest fires.  Add to this, consistent and credible government policies  signals, which  are essential for businesses and investors to create jobs, growth and spur innovation.
Additional specifics deal with the implementation of a carbon tax and enabling the growth of alternative energies.  An investment is required of public infrastructure and is key to moving forward successfully. Another aspect is increasing the encouragement of low carbon innovators thru patents, public spending, and alternative energy research and production.
Action suggested by the report will require long years of hard work and an optimistic vision for  the future, but its authors argue that these practices currently have real world proof in major metropolitan centers all over the world. So, a greener tomorrow is just on the horizon, but it's all dependent on how willing we are to embrace it now.

US Firm Fined for Underpaying Indian WorkersYou are here: Home Corporates
US Tech Firm Fined for Underpaying Indian Workers
Associated Press | Updated On: October 24, 2014 11:25 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
San Francisco: A Silicon Valley company is paying more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after labor regulators found eight employees brought from India were grossly underpaid and overworked while assigned to a special project in the US
The probe announced this week by the US Department of Labor uncovered several egregious violations at Electronics for Imaging Inc., a printing technology specialist that generated revenue of $728 million last year, when the misconduct occurred.
Among other things, Electronics for Imaging paid the eight workers far below California's required minimum wage - $8 per hour at the time - while they helped the company move its headquarters from Foster City, California, to Fremont, California, during a three-month period, according to the Labor Department.
While assigned to the project, some of the Indian workers logged as many as 122 hours in a week without being paid overtime. As result, they received as little as $1.21 per hour.
Electronics for Imaging says it "unintentionally overlooked" US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least minimum wage, with overtime for more than 40 weekly hours on the job. Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore, India. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US.
Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California.
"This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops," Eastwood said Thursday.
The Electronics for Imaging case serves as a reminder of the economic divide between high-tech workforces in the US and less-developed countries. While engineers and other technology employees are paid more than $100,000 salaries and lucrative stock incentives, workers handling other jobs for the same employer often receive paltry pay if they are based in countries such as India, China and Mexico.
Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.
Electronics for Imaging is paying more than $40,000 in back wages and damages to the eight Indian workers and a $3,520 fine.

GM Posts Higher-Than-Expected Profit on Strong North American DemandAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Detroit: General Motors Co on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected profit in the third quarter on strong demand for its redesigned full-size pickup trucks in North America.
"Clearly, high transaction prices - the new trucks and SUVs are more profitable than the ones they replace - that certainly helps," GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said at the company's Detroit headquarters.
The positive results provided a respite from the drumbeat of negative news this year surrounding faulty ignition switches that led to massive recalls and have been blamed for at least 29 deaths.
Shares in the No. 1 US automaker were off 13 cents at $31.18 in midday trade.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lauded GM's "Audi-style" profit margins in North America that approach German luxury levels. However, he added investors should consider exiting the stock, citing a dial-down of European growth and increased pressures on the key US market.
"We believe no (automaker) with global exposure can confidently offer guidance for the 2015 period," he said. "This is not just a GM issue."
Higher pricing on GM's vehicles resulted in a $600 million profit gain in the quarter. It launched new versions of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks last year and followed those with other updated SUVs on the same vehicle platform earlier this year.
Stevens said GM remained on or ahead of its financial forecast from January, when it said it would see a slight increase in pretax profit this year.
The quarter did not include any charges for costs related to the record number of recalls this year as GM has already booked them. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said GM has repaired more than 1.2 million of the cars recalled for the defective switch, and had enough replacement parts to service the rest.
Net income rose to $1.38 billion, or 81 cents a share, from $698 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, GM earned 97 cents a share, 2 cents above what analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The quarter included $300 million in special items for flood damage sustained at GM's Michigan technical center and the writedown of Russian assets.
Revenue rose slightly to about $39.3 billion from $39 billion. Analysts expected $39.8 billion.
GM reported a profit margin of 9.5 per cent in North America, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.
GM said average transaction prices in the US market and vehicle sales in China reached record highs in the quarter. It is getting almost $4,000 more per full-size pickup than it was before the new model was introduced. Stevens expects GM's North American incentive spending to decline in the fourth quarter.
In North America, earnings rose 12 per cent to $2.45 billion.
Profit at GM's international operations, including China, fell about 20 percent to $259 million. However, GM's equity income in China rose 14 per cent to $484 million.
The loss in Europe, which included $200 million in restructuring costs, widened by about $150 million as the Russian market struggled.
GM posted a loss of $32 million in South America, and CFO Stevens said GM remained focused on cutting costs there.

After video controversy  senior Marine is now helping Chicago youthBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe
Now-retired Marine Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown here in 2007 while receiving a Bronze Star with V medal for heroism while deployed in Iraq. He retired amid controversy earlier this year after getting in an altercation that was depicted in a viral video, and says he has moved on with life. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron Rooks/ Marine Corps)
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie was a well-respected senior member of the Marine Corps when he came across something at the gates of Parris Island, S.C., that infuriated him: a man protesting while wearing the iconic “campaign cover” hat meant for drill instructors who are on base training future Marines.
The ensuing June 5 incident escalated quickly — and was captured in a video that went viral online. It showed Archie, wearing his desert tan utility uniform, going toe-to-toe with Ethan Arguello, a former drill instructor who was protesting the controversial U.S. decision to exchange five Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who went missing in Afghanistan in 2009.
No punches were exchanged, but Archie could be seen getting close enough to Arguello to knock the cover off his head. Archie snatched it as it fell, and then stormed back to his black Jeep Sahara and drove away.
“You’re about to get locked up!” Arguello yelled.
As noted in this Checkpoint post at the time , Archie resigned a short time afterward and was charged with assault. Marines and veterans, meanwhile, debated whether Archie was wrong for confronting Arguello, and whether Arguello was violating the spirit of Marine Corps tradition by wearing the campaign cover out of uniform.
There’s more to the story, however. Archie, in his first comments since the controversy, said Thursday that he was asked to retire by the senior enlisted member of the Marine Corps within days of the incident.
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown in this Marine Corps photograph in February 2014, after taking over as the sergeant major at Parris Island, S.C.
He declined to use his name, but he is Sgt. Maj. Mike Barrett. Archie added that he did not feel like his chain of command at Parris Island was inclined to keep him, either.
“He told me, ‘Paul you know you were wrong. You need to step down and resign before your chain of command needs to decide,’ ” Archie said of Barrett’s direction. “I kind of figured that was coming. I’d been let down before, but this time I was really let down.”
Barrett could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Gunnery Sgt. Chanin Nuntavong, said the contents of the conversation between the two sergeants major should stay between them, but he confirmed they spoke at the time of the video.
Brig. Gen. Lori Reynolds, then the commanding general at Parris Island, addressed the issue in an interview with the Island Packet newspaper in June. She said that Archie was a great Marine worthy of emulation by others, but that his leaving was “about a very high standard, and that’s what we’re looking for from all our Marines.”
Archie, who served more than 25 years and earned a Bronze Star with V for heroism in Iraq, has moved on. The charges against him were dropped earlier this month, and he has moved to Chicago with his family to take a job as a sergeant major with the Marine Leadership Academy , a public high school that has a military curriculum and a strong ROTC program.
“It’s a motivating environment, and you see kids grow daily,” Archie said. “I loved my time in the Marine Corps, but the writing was definitely on the wall that it was time for me to move on.”
Archie said that “it was a fall from a high-ranking billet” and that he wanted to serve a full 30 years before retiring, but that he won’t look back. He realizes he could have diffused the situation by stepping away when it escalated, he said, but felt that Arguello needed to be corrected.
“When I saw his temper going up, hindsight being 20-20, I should have just got in the vehicle and drove away before it just kept escalating,” he said. “That’s the only thing I would say. But I still stand behind, ‘I was doing something for the Marine Corps and the institution.’ I wasn’t doing something for my sole gratification. It was all about the Marine Corps, and what it stands for. I regret not cutting the conversation shorter, but I do not regret what I did.”

Power has been restored to most of IT units at Rushikonda hills
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 24:  
The IT sector in Visakhapatnam like the other sectors has suffered considerable damage due to Hudhud cyclone, but there is no need for any apprehensions on the long-term prospects and the State Government will extend full support to it in all forms, according to IT Minister P. Raghunadhra Reddy.
He said here on Friday that power had been restored to the IT units at Rushikonda hills and all the pending incentives and subsidies to the units would be quickly given. "We will also make efforts to get the insurance claims of the companies cleared as quickly as possible. We are in touch with the insurance companies," he said.
He said the IT signature tower would be built on the Rushikonda hill, as planned, and all efforts would be made to attract investments into the sector. "We invited several IT companies earlier this month and nearly 400 of them responded. Several of them are positive about setting up units and starting operations here. There is no blow to the brand image of Visakhapatnam as an IT destination," he said.
According to the IT entrepreneurs, power was restored to the units on the Rushikonda hills only on Deepavali night and still some units were waiting for it. B. Gopi, of the Sankhya Technologies, said power had been restored to his unit only on Thursday night. "We have resumed operations on a small scale on Friday. Still, some of the IT units are waiting for power restoration," he said.
He said his company had put up a claim for Rs 77 lakh and so far two surveys had been conducted and yet the damage had not been accurately assessed. "We are waiting for another qualified surveyor to arrive at the spot and make a final assessment. In spite of the Chief Minister's clear directive that the process should be expedited and multiple surveys avoided, it has not yet resulted in any concrete action," he complained.
He wanted the insurance companies to understand the gravity of the situation and respond quickly.

Google to Spend $1 Bn to Lease Office BuildingsAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
San Francisco: Google Inc said it is committed to spending $1 billion to lease office buildings over the next 13 to 14 years.
Google did not say where the office buildings were located in its disclosure as part of its quarterly regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.
A source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said the Mountain View, California-based company was investing in new office space in Silicon Valley.
Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search company, has been looking to expand beyond its headquarters to accommodate its growing ranks of employees.
The company has acquired 24 office buildings near its campus, known as the Googleplex, in recent years, according to a July report in the San Jose Mercury News. Google hopes to transform many of the purchased buildings into taller, high-density office buildings, the report said.
It was not clear if the new leases were related to those buildings.
Google said the new lease periods will expire between 2027 and 2028.
In addition to the $1 billion lease obligation, Google noted that it was also "committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under these lease agreements which are not included in the total obligation amount."
The company said it was in the process of evaluating the impact of these lease agreements on its financial statements.
Google's staff grew by about 3,000 in the third quarter to more than 55,000 full-time employees worldwide.

Arunachal Pradesh
(Unfazed by China's objections…)
GREATER NOIDA: Unfazed by China's objections to development of border areas, Government today announced setting up of 54 new border outposts and a Rs 175 crore package for beefing up the infrastructure along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.
The announcement was made by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh even as he made it clear that India wanted to solve the border dispute with China through dialogue, asserting "peace with honour" was most important requirement for building good friendly relations with that country and other neighbours.
"Today when I talk about the border, be it with Pakistan or China, I feel pained and anguished over reports of ceasefire violations by Pakistan or incursions by Chinese troops," he said at the 53rd raising day function of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) here, which guards the 3,488 km long border from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.
"Humlog shanti chahte hai samman ki saath. Asamman ke saath shanti nahi ho sakti (We want peace with honour. Peace cannot come at the cost of honour," he said, referring to the recent border row with China.
"Pride is the ultimate accomplishment of a human being, of mine and yours," he added.
On development of areas bordering China, the Home Minister said the Government has started working on a plan for setting up of 54 border outposts(BoPs) for ITBP and also a Rs 175 crore package for building infrastructure along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.
All these posts will be set up in Arunachal Pradesh where there were large gaps at the Line of Actual Control(LAC).
China has been objecting to any development of infrastructure along the LAC and setting up of border outposts leading to instances of stand-offs with India including during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to this country in September this year.
Singh also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi making it clear that India wants to maintain peaceful relations with all its neighbouring countries. "Our Prime Minister has told the Chinese President that if there is a dispute we should talk," he said.
"India wants to keep friendly relations with our neighbours whether it is China or Pakistan. We believe in the philosophy of 'Vasudaiva Kutumbakam' which means the world is one family and India has told the world about it," he added.
Singh also said the Government was looking into the demand for a dedicated air support for the ITBP personnel.

Rejoinder to Sherif Girgis on sex discrimination and same-sex marriageBy Ilya Somin October 24
Political theorist Sherif Girgis has written a thoughtful response to my critique of his argument that laws banning same-sex marriage should not be subject to the same heightened scrutiny as other legislation that discriminates on the basis of gender. The response helpfully clarifies Girgis’ position, but fails to fix its shortcomings.
I. Sexism and the motivation for excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage
Early in his response, Girgis disclaims reliance on the common argument that laws banning same-sex marriage are different from laws banning interracial marriage because, while the latter are motivated by racism, the former are not motivated by a desire to promote “male supremacy.” I appreciate the clarification and am sorry if I misinterpreted his earlier reference to this argument as an endorsement of it. But if supposed lack of sexist motives does not distinguish laws banning same-sex marriage from other forms of gender discrimination, this weakens the case for exempting them from heightened judicial scrutiny.
Moreover, as I noted in my earlier post, the issue of motive cuts against Girgis’ position in another way: sexism was historically one of the reasons for excluding same-sex relationships from marriage recognition in the first place. Same-sex relationships were excluded from marriage and often subjected to persecution in large part because their participants did not conform to traditional sex roles and were seen as a potential threat to male dominance. The presence this motive does not by itself prove that discriminatory marriage laws should be struck down by courts. It also does not mean that everyone opposed to same-sex marriage is automatically a sexist. But it further undermines the case for subjecting legislation banning same-sex marriage to a lower standard of review than other sex-discriminatory laws. In modern jurisprudence, even laws that are formally gender-neutral or race-neutral are subjected to heightened scrutiny if they were enacted in large part out of racist sexist motives . This principle applies with even greater force to laws that are not gender-neutral at all, because, as Girgis himself puts it , they “involve.. treating sex as Virginia’s ban [on interracial marriage] in Loving had treated race.”
II. Is there a unique “conceptual” connection between between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction? Does it matter if there is?
Girgis also tries to clarify his central argument for exempting laws banning same-sex marriage from heightened scrutiny, its connection to reproduction:
When a policy’s form triggers extra scrutiny, again, judges pivot to examining its justifications: the state’s reasons for thinking that the classification is sufficiently linked to a legitimate interest….
But my point was that in the case of a law classifying by sexual composition—by male-female pairing—the law’s form itself already points to its own link to the common good, apart from mere social conventions, or merely contingent data about men and women. So the justification of this classification begins to appear at the first, “formal” stage of analysis….
neither (a) reproduction nor (b) its social value nor (c) its link to the male-female pairing is just a social construct….
Likewise, my argument isn’t undermined by Somin’s objection that “adoption and artificial insemination” make “same-sex marriage . . . also closely connected to reproduction.” Neither adoption nor reproductive technology weakens the conceptual link tying male-female union to reproduction. So they do not justify a judicial presumption against classifications based on the male-female pairing. Even finding ways to make children out of two ova or two sperm cells wouldn’t cut that link. It would only mean that, while male-female union has a conceptual link to reproduction, other groupings could have a contingent, technologically enabled link. The latter (unlike the male-female) link would require inquiry into empirical data; and it wouldn’t be limited to same- or opposite-sex couples, but any group of adults deciding to produce and rear children.
None of this provides a good reason to treat laws banning same-sex marriage differently from other laws that discriminate on the basis of gender. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is important to emphasize that an opposite-sex relationship is neither necessary nor sufficient for reproduction to occur. Many opposite-sex couples are unwilling or unable to reproduce by standard biological means (e.g.- because of age or sterility). Conversely, reproduction and child-raising can and do occur in same-sex relationships. Girgis makes much of the fact that “male and female are defined with respect to the physical potential for… reproduction.” But potential for reproduction is not the same thing as reproduction itself. The connection between potential and actuality is, in Girgis’ terms, a merely “contingent” one.
Moreover, legal status of marriage is not and never has been limited to those couples who are willing and able to engage in conventional biological reproduction. There is of course a high correlation between marriage and biological reproduction. But that connection, although strong and important, is also “social” or “contingent” rather than “conceptual.” Or, if it can be considered conceptual despite the fact that it is not an inevitable link, then the same goes for the connection between same-sex marriage and reproduction.
It is also worth noting that, as a social good, reproduction cannot be separated from child-raising. The latter is the main purpose of the former. And even if same-sex relationships had no direct connection to reproduction whatsoever, they still clearly can and do facilitate child-raising. Including them in the institution of marriage enhances same-sex couples’ ability to raise children in a variety of ways .
Finally, even if there was a conceptual connection between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction in some strong sense of the term that does not apply to same-sex couples, this still would not justify exempting laws excluding the latter from heightened judicial scrutiny. The whole point of heightened scrutiny is to ensure that the gender classification in question really is necessary to advance the interest in question, and that there is not a comparably effective gender-neutral way of achieving the same goal. The need to conduct that inquiry is not obviated by the existence of a “conceptual” connection. In this case, the ability of opposite-sex marriage to facilitate reproduction and child-raising is in no way impaired by extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. In states where same-sex marriage exists, opposite-sex couples can still reproduce and raise children, and the institution of marriage can still facilitate those activities.

Assam Muslims for speedy  unbiased probe into jihadiactivitiesPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:51 pm
With the Assam Police widening its net to apprehend persons having links to jihadi groups including the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a group of leading Muslim citizens of Assam today urged the government to carry out speedy but unbiased investigations into such activities in the state. It also asked the government to mete out stringent punishment to those found guilty.
“The Muslims of Assam do not support any kind of terrorist activity and strongly condemns any kind of terrorist activity carried out in the name of jihad,” a resolution adopted in a meeting of leading Muslim citizens of the state said here today. The group also called upon all right-thinking Muslims and such organizations to intensify public opinion against such anti-national and terrorist activities.
Presided over by veteran journalist Haider Hussain, the meeting also asked the government to take care so that the entire Muslim community was harassed due to suspicion as an outcome of anti-national activities carried out by a handful of persons who have gone astray. “The Muslim community should also remain alert against elements that might drag members of the community into anti-national and criminal activities by taking advantage of their socio-economic backwardness,” the group in an appeal issued here today said.
Interestingly, even as the Assam Police have arrested six Muslim persons from Barpeta district on October 10 for their alleged links with JMB, a section of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) leaders have said that those arrested should not be labeled as terrorists until proven guilty in a court of law. They has also alleged that the Congress government in the state had hatched a conspiracy to brand Muslims as jihadis.

Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

New Delhi: Despite the bitterness in Indo-Pak ties, Pakistan has sent 'Diwali sweets' to President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The sweets, by Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and his wife, were also sent to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. According to sources, Basit sent the boxes to the Prime Minister's Office for Modi apart from the President and the External Affairs Minister and seemed an "initiative" taken totally at the High Commission level.
Significantly, Indian forces have not offered sweets to their Pakistani counterparts on Diwali in the wake of repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the border.

The Border Security Force (BSF) in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir did not exchange sweets and greetings, a goodwill gesture carried out during major occasions, especially festivals like Diwali and Eid.
"In the light of present scenario with Pakistan, this time India has decided not to offer sweets to Pakistan on Diwali," Jalandhar-based BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Ashok Kumar told PTI over phone.
There were repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan along LoC as well as International Border in Jammu and Kashmir recently, he said, adding, therefore, offering of sweets to Pakistani counterparts was "totally out of question."
"This Diwali we did not exchange sweets with the Pakistani side following the heightened tension along the International Border," a senior BSF officer said in Jammu. The Army also did not hold any function along the Line of Control and no sweets were exchanged with the Pakistani troops.

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing businessrankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:18 pm
The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Top Jet Airways Officer Subodh Karnik Quits
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 24, 2014 23:58 (IST)
New Delhi: Top Jet Airways' officer Subodh Karnik has quit the airline, becoming the latest in a spate of resignations from the premier private carrier after Gulf-based Etihad Airways picked up a 24 per cent stake in it.
Mr Karnik was appointed chief operating officer-designate, pending regulatory clearances, only in July this year.
A spokesperson for the airline said Mr Karnik left Jet for "family reasons".
There have been several other high-profile exits in the carrier over the past few months. They include two CEOs Nikos Kardassis and Gary K Toomey, chief commercial officer Sudheer Raghavan, chief financial officer Ravishankar Gopalakrishnan and vice president (investor relations) K G Vishwanath, after Jet and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad struck the deal in November last year.
"Subodh Karnik, Chief Operating Officer (Designate) will be leaving Jet Airways for family reasons and is returning to Atlanta to be closer to his wife and children who were unable to move to India," a Jet spokesperson said here.
"He will continue to work with Jet Airways in an advisory capacity on key strategic initiatives," she added.
Mr Karnik, who took over from Hameed Ali after the latter joined the airline's board, was given the task to oversee commercial and sales functions of the airline.
Mr Karnik had earlier worked for several global airlines like North West, Continental and Delta Airlines and was also the CEO of Global Aero Logistics, one of the largest provider of private air charter service to US military and corporates.
Cramer Ball, a former chief executive from Air Seychelles in which Etihad has a stake, is now the CEO of Jet Airways after receiving security and regulatory nod.

Premature to talk of US troop cuts in Asia: JohnKerrySecretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops.
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:40 pm
Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops stationed in Asia and South Korea, amid increased tensions on the heavily guarded peninsula.
The top US diplomat insisted before any such moves could happen North Korea must first show a serious commitment to rejoining six-party talks on ending its suspect nuclear program.
Asked after meeting his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se whether Washington would consider reducing its military presence in Asia if North Korea returned to the stalled nuclear negotiations, Kerry ruled out the idea.
“The mere entering into talks is not an invitation to take any actions regarding troops or anything else at this point. It would be way too premature to have any thought, or even discussion” along those lines, Kerry said.
“The only purpose of entering the talks is to come to an understanding regarding first the denuclearization and then following the denuclearization obviously whatever relationship might be appropriate.”
He also ruled out any idea of visiting isolated North Korea and meeting leader Kim Jong-un in the near term. Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic ties.
Yun said South Korea was awaiting a “clear stance” on Pyongyang’s nuclear policy and “a halt to the sophistication of its nuclear weapons.”
“All of this has to be real. It has to lead to real solutions,” Yun said.

How Chipotle Has Revolutionized The Way We EatOne Way Chipotle Has Completely Revolutionized How We Eat

Judging by our eating habits, we've become a nation of adult babies eating pre-cut food out of bowls.
Instead of sitting in highchairs toying with our cooked beef and rice, we shovel our lunches into our mouths while typing at computers in open-plan offices or robotically scrolling through our News Feeds.
Always an option at home and some restaurants, the bowl meal truly launched a decade ago when Chipotle first introduced its burrito bowl, a diners’ choice of rice, beans, meat, salsa and other fixings mixed up in a bowl. Chipotle now sells more bowls than burritos, according to Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the chain. Though Chipotle doesn't break out revenue by menu item, its success overall has been meteoric -- with revenue rising about 11 percent from $2.73 billion in 2012 to $3.04 billion so far this year.
Sales of so-called Mexican bowls at fast-casual restaurants went up 14 percent over the past two years, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. The number of chains offering "Asian bowls" with ingredients like noodles, chicken, rice and vegetables grew 8 percent over the same period, according to Technomic. Chipotle’s Asian-themed spinoff, ShopHouse, exclusively sells bowls comprised of a base of rice, noodles or salad mixed with a protein like grilled chicken satay, vegetables and a choice of curry and tamarind sauces.
A Chipotle burrito bowl.
Besides just tasting good, the bowls play into some recent dining trends: the rise of gluten-free eating and the popularity of protein over carbs as people turn away from bread-heavy sandwiches. We're also increasingly picky, and a setup with a base of grain or lettuce and a choice of toppings allows us to dictate our meals to our exact preferences.
Perhaps more importantly, bowls are also perfect for workers looking for meals they can eat easily at their desks.
“No one is sitting down and eating a meal you have to cut up into little pieces,” said Kira Fisher, who runs the blog Sad Desk Lunch , which succinctly sums up the bowl trend. “It takes a lot of space to eat like a proper person.”
Some industry observers dismiss the bowl meal as trend. But it hints at more troubling concerns, said Marlene Schwartz, the director at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.
Part of the recommended treatment for obesity and eating disorders is to “sit at a table without the television on and actually eat your food with a knife and fork,” Schwartz said. “The fact that that’s part of the treatment means that we’ve really moved away from it” as a society, she added.
Forking a mixture of rice, vegetables and meat into your mouth while looking at email or making phone calls isn’t an ideal way to eat, according to Schwartz. “People do tend to eat more and not realize how much they’re eating” if they’re distracted by another task, she said.
It’s true that in some cultures, people regularly eat stews, noodles and sushi without a knife and fork, and those meals are often unrushed family or even community events. But the elimination of the knife and the move towards the bowl at fast food and fast-casual restaurants is largely a Western invention of convenience.
Traditional fast food restaurants are on trend, too. The number of fast food restaurants offering a "bowl meal" grew by 5.6 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Dataessential, a Chicago-based firm that tracks food industry trends.
Taco Bell launched a Cantina Power Menu earlier this year, which includes a selection of steak, chicken and veggie bowls featuring lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and rice. KFC has offered its “famous bowl” line -- a mix of mashed potatoes, bite-sized crispy chicken pieces, gravy and cheese -- since 2006.
Many of the submissions coming into Fisher’s blog celebrate the old-school bowl meal: leftovers of a meat and rice stew or lasagna that were better the night before. “There’s always been casseroles and one-dish meals,” said Mary Chapman, senior director of product innovation at Technomic. “How it’s positioned is new.”
A sampling of the classic one-dish bowl lunch:
Part of the appeal of the bowls offered in fast-casual and fast food restaurants is that they can stand in for many of the standard lunch items, Chapman said. They’re “a way to have a big giant sandwich without having to hold it in your hand” or “a healthful alternative without having to be a salad,” she said.
But the rise in restaurants offering a bunch of ingredients mixed up in a bowl is “pure trend” that’s liable to go out of fashion, said David Just, a behavioral economist at Cornell University who has studied why people eat what they do.
“It’s trying to play to a modern idea of what’s beautiful and attractive,” Just said, noting that bowls also allow restaurants to rein in portion sizes because it takes less food to make a bowl look full.
And customers seemed convinced. A group of 16-year-old boys having their first-ever off-campus lunch at a Manhattan Chipotle one recent afternoon bragged about their ability to game the system by ordering bowls. “They give you more if you get the bowl,” one said. “I got it literally every day this summer,” another noted. An 18-year-old NYU student having a quick lunch by himself cited similar reasons for choosing a bowl instead of a burrito. “It’s more calories, more bang for your buck,” he said.
(That may be more perception than reality. According to Chipotle’s calorie calculator, burrito bowls typically have about 300 fewer calories than burritos.)
Out of 13 people who went through the line in about a 15-minute period during the lunch rush at the restaurant, just four ordered burritos. The other nine opted for bowls.
Even Mitt Romney gets a burrito bowl at Chipotle.
Eating without a plate, knife and fork has become so ubiquitous, we may have actually reached peak bowl. While the number of bowls on the menus of fast food and fast-casual chains grew between 2010 and 2014, it declined in fine dining restaurants, according to research from Datassential, a Chicago-based firm that studies food industry trends.
Once a trend starts to fall off in more expensive eateries, that typically means it’s saturated the market as much as it’s going to, according to Christin Groh, a senior manager on the MenuTrends team at Datassential. “It may end up tapering off,” Groh said. “In recent years, penetration has really remained flat.”
Still that doesn’t mean bowls are disappearing from restaurants like Chipotle any time soon. As Cornell's Just said, diners "are looking for things that are easy to eat and go without much thought.”

The Tragic Reality Of Americans  Vacation DaysAmericans Are Taking Fewer Vacation Days Than At Any Point In Nearly 4 Decades
Reuters
reddit
WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Americans took the least  amount of vacation time in almost four decades last year,  forfeiting billions of dollars in compensation without scoring  points with their bosses, according to an industry group  analysis released on Tuesday.
The report for the U.S. Travel Association said the average  American with paid time off (PTO) used 16 of 20.9 vacation days  in 2013, down from an average of 20.3 days off from 1976 to  2000. It added that 169 million days of permanently forfeited  U.S. vacation time equated to $52.4 billion in lost benefits.
"By choosing to work instead of taking PTO, employees are  essentially working for their employers for free," the analysis  said.
The report did not give a reason for the drop in vacation  time but the fall coincided with the 2007-2009 recession and a  slow economic recovery. An Ipsos/Reuters survey in 2010 found  that only 57 percent of Americans used all their vacation time.
Wealthier workers tend to earn more vacation days, and also  leave more of it on the table, according to the study. People  with an annual income of more than $150,000 failed to use an  average of 6.5 vacation days last year, while those with less  than $29,000 did not use 3.7 days on average.
Employees who foreited paid time off do not get more raises  or bonuses than those who take all their vacation time. They  also report higher levels of stress at work, the survey said.
"America's work martyrs aren't more successful. We need to  change our thinking. All work and no play is not going to get  you ahead - it's only going to get you more stress,"  Roger Dow,  president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a  statement accompanying the report.
The analysis was prepared by Oxford Economics, a forecasting  group. It used Labor Department data and a June survey of 1,303  workers by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications in  conjunction with Oxford Economics.

Pakistan s Assembly passes resolution against  Indian aggressionPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:18 pm | Updated: October 23, 2014 6:22 pm
Pakistan’s parliament on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution against the alleged “unprovoked and indiscriminate” ceasefire violations by India and asked the government to seek UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue.
The resolution, moved by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, stated that the National Assembly condemned Indian ceasefire violations at the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB).
It strongly condemned unprovoked and indiscriminate ceasefire violations by India on LoC and IB resulting into loss of human and material losses.
13 Pakistani nationals have been killed in exchange of fire since September 13.
It called upon the Government that while pursuing bilateral dialogue with India, the issue should be raised at the UN and with the international community urging them to play their role in resolution of Kashmir dispute in accordance with the wishes of Kashmiri people.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan’s military was capable of responding to all aggression. He said that India was mistaken if it thought Pakistan’s internal issued could be used to its advantage.
“India should not misunderstand Pakistan’s initiative towards peace as our weakness…We can respond effectively,” Asif said.
He said that both countries were nuclear and should refrain from any kind of misadventure.
The house also expressed concern over the plight of people of Kashmir living under “Indian occupation.”
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tasneem Aslam alleged that Indian forces under the cover of unprovoked firing were engaged in constructing bunkers in locations within 500 metres of the IB.
The construction of these bunkers is in violation of the 2010 agreement between New Delhi and Islamabad, she said.
“Pakistan would never permit this construction which is in violation of a bilateral agreement,” Aslam said.
The agreement prohibits any construction, including that of bunkers, within 500 metres of either side of the international boundary.
Pakistan’s Punjab provincial assembly had on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution condemning “Indian aggression” at the IB and urged the international community to take note of the situation.

The revamped Regency Restaurant at Abad Plaza boasts an all-encompassing menu
Abad Hotel’s Regency restaurant’s redone, revamped, cheerful and bright interiors in violet and cream welcome us. The buffet spread at the restaurant has always been popular among corporates, shoppers and those looking to eat out. A buffet is easy, it is fast, you can’t go wrong with it and for lunch it is perfect.
The revamped restaurant is spacious unlike in its previous avatar. And there is plenty of natural light which gives it an airy feel.
The multi-cuisine restaurant boasts an impressive menu spanning continents and countries. Dinner is an a la carte affair, complete with the karaoke experience of Mohd. Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh songs.
The lunch buffet is extensive, complete with a tempting array of desserts. “On any given day there are a couple of dishes which are chefs’ innovations,” says executive chef Jayakumar. The surprises awaiting us on the day were Hawaiian miso dumplings and Turfan beef.
Both of which were different from anything one has eaten before, especially the beef which had the strong flavours of ground green chillies
The highlight of the lunch, however, are the a la carte dishes—the dramatically named Tom Sawyer’s fish, honey chilli prawns and murg malai kebab – which the chef wants to showcase.
Sliced fillet of Mahi fish topped with white sauce on a bed of rice bordered with green, yellow and red bell-peppers, chopped fine and rings of olives is a visual treat, and the complete meal assures Jayakumar, one which is very popular with the kids and tourists from abroad, says the chef. Why Tom Sawyer? “Because of its appeal for children,” he adds. A name like that would, undoubtedly, arouse curiosity.
Continental done, we move to the Chinese part of the menu and in come honey chilli prawns fried crisp with a glistening coating of honey. Spicy in parts, tangy in others...the sweetness of honey misleads the palate as the gingery aftertaste provides that spicy kick.
From the bland, easy on the palate, fish to the fiery-sweet honey chilli prawns, it is a leap across continents in terms of flavours. The creamy murgh malai kebabs are bite-sized chunks of chicken with hints of spices. The kebabs and the prawns make for filling finger foods too.
Squid rings, prawn cocktails, cashew chicken and the super healthy farmhouse broth are just some of the other dishes on the revamped menu which has plenty on offer.

Models say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cycloneModels say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cyclone
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 21:  
A day after its genesis, a rogue low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea is forecast to become a tropical cyclone by a number of weather models.
India Met Department appears to take the brewing cyclone to the northwest Arabian Sea for a likely landfall over the Yemen-Oman coast in another week’s time.
Likely target
But two other leading models suspect that the system may steer to the north-northeast and strike south Gujarat around Surat and adjoining Mumbai in a week’s time.
These are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a Global Forecast Model of the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction.
India Met has located the low-pressure area to the southeast Arabian Sea and neighbourhood and has put it already under watch for intensification.
The ‘low’ would strengthen a round to a well-marked ‘low’ by tomorrow and further into a depression two days later, according to a bulletin issued this afternoon.
India Met watch
But wind field projections depicted on its site hint its onward intensification as a likely tropical cyclone tracking away from the Indian coast in a west-northwest direction towards the Arabian Gulf, along the Yemen-Oman coastline.
The two other models stick their neck out suggesting that the cyclone would actually steer mid-course towards north-northeast and hit South Gujarat-Mumbai.
The timeline for the landfall in this manner is also around the month-end, around October 29-30, according to the European and US model forecasts.
Drains moisture
Meanwhile, the brewing weather system in the Arabian Sea has drained the south peninsula of some moisture.
This morning, an upper air cyclonic circulation has formed once again off the Sri Lanka coast, which should bring rain to parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep today.
There is also the presence of the rain-friendly Madden-Julian Oscillation wave in the higher levels over the tropical Indian Ocean/west Arabian Sea.
According to the Met, the heavy rain may lift from tomorrow as the away-looking ‘low’ in the Arabian Sea starts intensifying.
Outlook for a counterpart ‘low’ in the Andaman Sea is retained, but models are not very confident about it since the entire activity is now shifting to the Arabian Sea.

Microsoft Co-Founder Bumps Ebola Effort to $100 Millionmicrosoft co-founder bumps ebola effort to $100 million
Billionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight EbolaBillionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight Ebola
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls Ebola 'unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced'
Paul Allen, billionaire owner of sports teams and mega yachts, on Thursday pledged at least $100 million to fight Ebola in what is believed to be the largest private foundation gift to combat the deadly disease and support healthcare workers in West Africa.
The co-founder of Microsoft — who regularly inhabits lists of the richest and most generous Americans — has already donated an estimated $26.5 million toward his pledge, including $12.9 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $3.6 million to UNICEF, $2.8 million to the International Red Cross and $1.3 million to Doctors Without Borders.
It was an epidemiologist¿s worst nightmare: one of the world¿s deadliest contagious diseases loose in one of the world¿s most densely populated and sometimes chaotic megacities ¿ Lagos, Nigeria. ( Robyn Dixon )
“The Ebola virus is unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced and needs a response unlike anything we have ever seen,” Allen said in a statement. “I am committed to tackling Ebola until it is stopped.”
The disease, which has spurred worldwide panic, travel restrictions and a scramble by hospitals and health agencies to contain it and prepare for its possible spread, is generally transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.
8
The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is believed to have infected nearly 10,000 people and claimed more than 4,800 lives, with the highest death toll in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. It pegs the cost of fighting the disease at $975 million.
WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said his organization “welcomes all financial and technical support in our efforts to save the lives of those infected with Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and to halt the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible. We need funds, and we need foreign medical teams most of all, to staff the 50 Ebola treatment centers now operating or under construction.”
With so many people possibly affected by this particularly deadly disease, funds have been hard to come by, especially from smaller donors who often step up to help in times of crisis.
“The small American donors are simply not there,” said Jack Shakely, president emeritus of the California Community Foundation. “It takes a wealthy donor to step up to the plate.”
Shakely is also a board member of Operation USA, a global relief organization that has sent medical supplies to Liberia, and he describes Ebola as “one of those horrible, horrible problems that can be fixed. [Allen] tends to be one of a group of social entrepreneurs who like to see results. This $100 million could, in fact, effect amazing results.”
How dare those .01%ers donate their money for a cause. This is a job for the gov't
Barry3

The $100-million pledge by the owner of the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers is the latest in a stream of donations by wealthy individuals and foundations, many with ties to technology.
Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million to the CDC Foundation, noting on his Facebook page that the deadly disease “could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed.”
In September, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $50 million to support the emergency response to the disease, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation committed $5 million. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave $1 million in August.
Allen plans to partner with the University of Massachusetts Medical School to provide medical workers and laboratory equipment in Liberia, with a particular focus on making sure that local hospitals are outfitted with decontamination equipment.
He also will fund the development and manufacture of two medevac containment units to evacuate medical workers from West Africa, what Dune Ives, senior director of Allen’s Vulcan Philanthropy, calls “safety cocoons.”
“As we started looking early on at what it is going to take, we recognized we need more trained healthcare workers to go to West Africa,” Ives said. “Personally, unless I knew I had safety and support to get back home if I got infected, I would think twice.”
The medevac units fit into airplanes and carry the kind of equipment and staff seen in hospital rooms, Ives said, adding that “right now, there is one plane that can safely medevac infected healthcare workers back to their country of origin. We wanted to provide the assurance of safe transport.”
One goal of Allen’s is to urge others to donate — individuals of modest means, corporations, foundations, the super-rich. To that end he has set up an online donation platform at TackleEbola.com to allow individuals to give money to specific areas of need.
“Time is not our ally in this fight,” Allen said in a blog posted Thursday. “The time is now to do the right thing. So let’s do this.”

Police: Gunman Acted Alone In Ottawa Shootingreddit
Canadian authorities confirmed early Thursday that there was only one shooter in Wednesday's horrific attack in Ottawa, the Associated Press reported.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was shot dead after opening fire near the Canadian Parliament building, killing Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and wounding three other people.
An Ottawa police spokesman had previously told HuffPost that they were looking for multiple possible suspects, but would not confirm the news later in a press conference.
Witnesses say Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo near the National War Memorial at point-blank range on Wednesday morning before being chased inside the Canadian Parliament building, where he was killed by Kevin Vickers, a sergeant-at-arms.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper characterized the attack as an act of terrorism and vowed a renewed crackdown on terrorist activity.
"This will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats," Harper said in a televised address late on Wednesday.

Officials told the Globe and Mail that the Canadian government had been monitoring Zehaf-Bibeau over potential suspicious activity. He was deemed a "high-risk traveler" and had his passport taken away.
The Associated Press reports that court records appear to indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau had a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes.
A friend told the Globe and Mail that Zehaf-Bibeau had experienced a religious reawakening of late. Senior U.S. officials confirmed to the New York Times that he had recently converted to Islam.
In a brief interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother said she was crying for the victim's of Wednesday's attack, not for her son.
"Can you ever explain something like this?" she said. "We are sorry."
Wednesday's shooting came just days after a similar attack in Quebec, where Martin Rouleau-Couture attacked two soldiers with his car, killing one, before being apprehended by police. Rouleau-Couture was also a recent convert to Islam who was being monitored by federal authorities.

Surprise! The world s fastest growing consumer market is...World's fastest growing consumer... isn't Chinese
By Katie Holliday | CNBC –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014 4:19 AM IST

Burgeoning consumer markets usually bring the likes of China, India and Brazil to mind, but the top-five fastest growing ones aren't the usual suspects, according to a fresh report from Euromonitor International.
The fastest growing consumer market in the world is Malawi, a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, with a small population of 16.4 million consumers, Euromonitor found after analyzing markets by expected consumer expenditure and annual real growth this year. Consumer spending in Malawi, which is slightly smaller than the state of Pennsylvania, is set to grow 18.2 percent year-on-year in 2014, the report said.
Malawi's total consumer expenditure will likely reach $5.6 billion by the end of this year, translating into spending of only $335 per capita, the research firm said.
Read More China GDP beats, but growth rate slowest since crisis
The growth may be fast, but Euromonitor analysts cautioned that such a low level of spending inevitably limits business opportunities. Furthermore, finding ways to invest in Malawi can also be challenging, as barriers to investment include a shortage of foreign exchange and poor infrastructure.
"In the short term, consumer market growth in Malawi will be supported by the country's improved economic performance (which will help to raise incomes) and slowing consumer price inflation (which will raise consumer demand)," Euromonitor said.
The second-fastest growing consumer market may also come as a surprise to many: Sierra Leone.
The small Western Africa country is set to see rapid consumer expenditure growth this year, at a rate of 14.7 percent on year in real terms, Euromonitor said.
Read More Poverty data masks ongoing income strains
Its market is even smaller than Malawi with 6.1 million consumers and total consumer expenditure at $4.3 billion this year, equating to a higher per capita expenditure rate than Malawi at $688, Euromonitor said.
But the analysts added the caveat that Sierra Leone has been in the spotlight this year due to a high number of cases of people contracting the deadly Ebola virus. As a result, forecasts for growth are likely to be revised downwards as the outbreak takes its toll, adding to the country's challenges of poverty, youth unemployment, infrastructure deficit and corruption, it said.
In third place, central Asian state Turkmenistan has a consumer market set to expand 14.4 percent on year in real terms this year, Euromonitor said, supported by the fastest growth rate in annual disposable income globally.
Read More How Ebola can quickly mutate: 'Hot Zone' author
Per capita consumer expenditure in Turkmenistan, which is slightly larger than California, will hit $3,594 in 2014, rising to $6,422 in 2020, it said.
"Rising incomes and a rapidly expanding middle class will create opportunities over the long term and across many sectors," said Euromonitor, flagging communications, education, leisure and recreation as the most dynamic sectors.
Fourth in line is Saudi Arabia, which has the highest level of per capita expenditure out of the entire top five, the report found, set to reach $7,786 in 2014.
Saudi Arabia's entire consumer market will reach $241 billion this year, and Euromonitor analysts have tipped hotels and catering as a sweet spot for consumer spending, with that sector's spending set to rise 15.6 percent year-on-year in real terms in 2014.
Read More The happiest expats live here
Mongolia rounds out the top five, with a tiny population of 2.8 million people. The east central Asia country, bordered by Russia to the North and China to the east, south and west, is set to enjoy 11.8 percent year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure this year, with the average per capita spending level reaching $1,785, the report said.
Euromonitor warned that the country's small population could restrict consumer demand growth in the future, but said nevertheless Mongolia is not to be ignored. It's one of the world's fastest growing economies and has taken enormous strides in tackling poverty and boosting incomes for consumers this year, it said.

India Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment BankIndia Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment Bank
PTI
Tweet
Beijing, Oct 24:  
India Inc today welcomed the country’s participation in the newly—established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) saying it will help to leverage badly needed funds for infrastructure development.
The moot point is that large economy like India really needs financing badly as it requires over a trillion USD for infrastructure development, A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said today.
India along 20 other countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be its founding member.
“It is a very positive development in the sense that it opens up more borrowing opportunities. As another window of financing we welcome it,” Singh told PTI.
“There is tremendous requirement of funding in India for the a trillion USD infrastructure development. It is not possible for the Indian banking sector to manage that kind of investment,” despite the presence of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral financing bodies.
“More is required beyond that. Therefore, if we get support from the BRICS Development Bank and AIIB offer further options and availability of finance which we need to tap into,” he said.
Singh, who is here to attend a separate event, said it will be mostly private sector which will access such funding.
“They will do it on terms favourable, transparent and good for them.”
But bank need to function on certain norms of governance, standards and transparency, he said.
Singh said India should access investments from China as it is plush with funds.
“China is a large economy with trade and manufacturing prowess. It also has funds which we have to recognise.
Therefore, businesses in India can leverage that funding also it will be one more addition to technology and market related relations.”
India along with 20 other countries today signed an agreement to become founding members of the China—backed AIIB to aid the infrastructure development in the Asian region and reduce the dependence on Western—dominated World Bank and IMF.

Indias warning on pro-Pak groups rally on Kashmir inLondonPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 7:28 pm
Two days ahead of a planned rally in London by a pro-Pakistan group on Kashmir issue, India on Friday warned that forces inimical to Indo-UK relations may utilise such opportunity in open societies.
However, it appreciated Britain’s stand that the Kashmir issue was to be resolved only by India and Pakistan and said that with this reassurance the government was “quite comfortable” of any march being organised.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the ‘Million March’, being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don’t “overawe” it.
“Now it is possible that forces inimical to India-UK relations may utilise opportuinities of this sort and it was in this context that we discussued with UK and we were reassured repeatedly that the UK’s view is very clear and that it is for India and Pakistan to resolve any issue that they have by themselves.
“With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us….,” he said.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised with Deputy Prime Minister of Britain Nick Clegg organisation of the planned anti-India march during her visit to London last week.
The “Million March” is planned on October 26 from London’s Trafalgar Square to highlight the Kashmir issue.
Asked about Pakistan parliament passing a resolution yesterday against the alleged “unprovoked and indiscriminate” ceasefire violations by India and seeking UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue, the Spokesperson said it was aimed at the domestic audience and that India opposed the option of involvement of any third party on the matter.
“Resolutions passed by Parliaments are…internalisation processes. Therefore, why should we have any problem with any internalisation process in any country? This is for that country to take a view on,” he said, adding India was strongly opposed to internationalising the issue.
“As regards to any issue of international nature, we have given our views on that we do not see any option of any third party be involved in this. Therefore, as far as internationalisation is concerned, we are against it. As far as internalisation is concerned, this is for Pakistan to sort itself out,” the Spokesperson said.
The Spokesperson said India was ready for talks with Pakistan under the provisions of Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration but it was for that country to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.
“Our view is that it is for Pakistan to enter into a situation where we can have an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, our view is very clear that we are ready for a bilateral dialogue under the Shimla agreement and the Lahore declaration. But that requires an atmosphere which is conducive for talks. The ball, therefore, is in Pakistan’s court,” he said.
To another question on information on the blast in Burdwan, as was sought by Bangladesh government, the MEA Spokesperson said the ministry has requested concerned agencies to collate information and was awaiting a report in continued…

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Australia later next month, efforts are under way to schedule a visit to the nearby island nation Fiji, sources said here on Friday. Modi is expected to travel to Fiji on a day-long visit on November 19 from Australia where he will be attending a G-20 meeting.
This will be the Prime Minister’s first three-country tour. The tour will begin in Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw, where Modi will attend East Asia Summit on November 12-13. From there, he will go to Brisbane for the G-20 summit on November 15-16.
After Brisbane, Modi will travel to Canberra to hold a bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on November 18. This will be second meeting between the two leaders after Abbott visited India last month. During the last visit, the two countries inked the civil nuclear cooperation agreement.
Modi, who is set to be the first Indian PM to visit Australia since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, will deliver an address to a joint sitting of federal parliament, according to officials. He is also expected to address the Indian community at a reception in Australia, just like he did during his trip to the US at the Madison Square Garden.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more : PChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”
“I have, not only I, others have urged that the reorganisation that was promised in continued…

Government considering changing protocols for aid workers who return to the U.S. after fighting EbolaBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”

Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Diwali gift: Flats  cars  jewellery to `loyal staffersSurat-based diamond firm Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd gave away gifts including Fiat cars to its employees at a function held on Sunday at the company's private lawns..
Ahmedabad, Oct 20:  
They all waited in their hundreds with bated breath in that sprawling lawn in Surat, awaiting the ‘divine’ announcement from the generous pauper-turned-diamond king and returned home as happy owners of cars, flats and gold-and-diamond jewellery worth a total of Rs 50 crore on Sunday.
In what was, perhaps, the most generous Diwali gift event anywhere in India in recent history, as Savjibhai Dholakia, a diamond worker-turned-merchant, gifted those valuables to the nearly 1,200 employees of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd who passed the ‘loyalty test’. The venue looked like a vast car mela as shining vehicles awaited their owners. Each rewardee returned with a Diwali gift worth Rs 4 lakh.
People recalled it like a Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL’s) AGMs held in a stadium in the past, as Savjibhai doled out jaw-dropping goodies as rewards to his ‘best performing’ employees.
“We don’t look at it as a bonus or incentive. But we call it a Loyalty Programme, under which we recognise our employees who have contributed great value to the growth of this company by constantly upgrading their skills over these years,” Dholakia told BusinessLine on Monday.
The company, which has over 6,000 employees in Surat alone and another 3,000 in Mumbai and across the world, had organised a grand celebration on Sunday at its huge private lawn inside Hari Krishna Complex on the outskirts of Surat. The 1,200 employees who were qualified for the ‘Loyalty Programme’ were given three options to choose from: a Fiat Punto car, part-payment for a 2-BHK flat or gold and diamond jewellery.
“We wanted our employee to live a complete life with own house and a car. Hence, the company offered Rs 4 lakh contribution for purchase of a 2-BHK flat. Those who already had a house, we offered them a Fiat car worth about Rs 4 lakh. And those who had both, we rewarded them with jewellery worth the same amount,” said Dholakia, who had bargained hard with Fiat dealer for a heavy discount.
Around 491 employees opted for cars, 207 preferred taking company’s contribution for new flat and the remaining over 500 employees chose to take jewellery.
Interestingly these employees hold job profiles ranging from diamond polishing worker to marketing executive and office executives - most of them drawing a minimum monthly salary of Rs 60,000. About 60 per cent of his total workforce is from Saurashtra, while many workers hail from North Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Dholakia had began Hari Krishna Exports in 1991 after 10 years of rigorous diamond polishing work. Today, he claims to achieve the sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore from diamond exports for the fiscal 2014-15. Its jewellery vertical has a turnover of about Rs 700 crore.
As a recognition of the contribution of his employees to his company’s success, Dholakia introduced the Loyalty Programme two years ago. In the first year, three diamond polishing workers were gifted cars, while last year this number went up to 72.
Meanwhile, Dholakia has also set up an in-house institute, which runs one/two-year courses on diamond polishing and overall diamond polishing engineering for those interested to take up diamond polishing as a profession.
“We guarantee that trained at our institute, the person will surely get a job with starting salary of at least Rs 50,000 per month,” added Dholakia

Common Ground and Conversationreddit
I feel that we can all help start more conversations in regard to leadership, diversity, inclusion and respect. The old adage, never judge a book by its cover, applies to all walks of life. I remember when I first went to Stanford University, I participated in a group activity with my entire freshman dorm. All of us were apprehensive about this new chapter in our lives. The leader had us stand in a straight line and would pose a question to the group. Students would either take a step forward or stand still based on their individual response.
I took a step forward. I looked around the room and saw a group of people of different religions, races, genders, you name it. And they all answered the same way I did. The actual questions that brought us together weren't important; the questions and answers that followed were. All of a sudden, a group of strangers realized a collective common ground which served as a jumping off point for conversation.
A lot of times it's just a lack of exposure and awareness that is holding people back. Conversation and interaction help erase the lack of understanding by challenging people to discuss different things; share and appreciate new points of view. Eventually, we are able to accept and grow.
I've always found basketball to be a great vehicle to bring people together. It's such an easy sport to understand. It's just two hoops and a ball. You can play it indoors or outdoors and there is something about five people coming together -- and finding common language.
What sports can do is create a safe space for children. Some kids are going through some really difficult circumstances and dealing with adversity. But when they are on the court for a few hours, there is a safe space and a safe environment to play, interact, talk, and hang out. It's so important to know that someone else out there cares about you, that someone is trying to help and is on your team.
When you see guys like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, and many other players in the sport showing this level of care to work with young people, it's pretty telling how important that type of work can be.
I'd invite people of all ages to be an ally to someone who is less fortunate. You might be in the midst of a good situation -- but take the time to be a counselor, a mentor, or just a positive role model because it's a great thing to do and you never know when the person who needs the help could be you. At some point, you'll be going through that tough time and you'll appreciate the support.
There are so many ways to get involved. Last year, I was thrilled to work with the league to donate the proceeds of my Brooklyn Nets jersey to the Matthew Shepard Foundation and GLSEN. They are two organizations that do tremendous work to replace hate with understanding, compassion, and acceptance.
Your gender, religion, race, or sexual orientation has no effect on your ability to lead conversations. You can help others recognize the common ground and ultimately, you can change hearts and minds.

Russia spy plane intercepted in NATO airspace: AllianceThe Ilyushin IL-20 "intelligence collection aircraft" was first intercepted by Danish F-16 jets when it approached Denmark.
By: Agence-France Presse | Brussels | Posted: October 23, 2014 12:46 am | Updated: October 23, 2014 12:53 am
NATO fighter jets intercepted a Russian spy plane over the Baltic Sea after it breached Estonian airspace, the alliance said today in the latest of such incidents amid tensions with Moscow over Ukraine.
The Ilyushin IL-20 “intelligence collection aircraft”, which took off from the Russian Baltic coast enclave of Kaliningrad yesterday, was first intercepted by Danish F-16 jets when it approached Denmark, NATO said in a statement.
It then flew north towards non-NATO member Sweden which also sent jets to intercept the plane.
Nearly four hours later the plane flew towards NATO member Estonia and was detected in Estonian airspace “for a period of less than one minute, which represented an incursion of about 600 metres (yards) into NATO airspace,” it said.
Portuguese F-16s spotted the Russian propeller plane and escorted it out of NATO airspace, the alliance said.
The Ukraine crisis has produced the worst east-west tension since the end of the Cold War.
NATO has stepped up its Baltic air patrols due to what it says is a surge in intercepts of Russian warplanes near Polish and Baltic airspace since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March.
The Swedish Navy meanwhile has been searching for a suspected Russian submarine off the coast of Stockholm for nearly a week, although it said today it was pulling back some of its ships.

Women wary of anti-poverty schemesWomen wary of anti-poverty schemes

Incorporating women: Greater awareness and tangible results are factors to consider. AKHILESH KUMAR
They drop out on account of cultural taboos and lack of follow up efforts by implementing agencies
Despite opportunities and systematic community-driven handholding support from the Government and non-government bodies, women might still choose not to participate in the economic development process. Under the purview of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the world’s largest poverty alleviation initiative, the Government and NGOs are targeting women from the poorest households in the economic development process. One such project is the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) or Project JEEViKA.
Implemented in select districts of Bihar, the project facilitates the formation of women-based self-help groups (SHGs) federated at the village level to form village organisations (VOs). VOs receive investments from the project and play a vital role in implementing livelihoods interventions. Additionally, village resource persons (VRPs) are engaged to provide technical assistance to SHG members.
To understand what influences women’s willingness to participate in economic development programmes, we interviewed 613 SHG women from 24 villages in three districts of Bihar, where the project was introduced more than four years ago. The sample is not representative; ; nevertheless, the challenges we have recognised in these 24 villages could work as lessons for all.
Missing links
Half the women we interviewed were from landless households, and amongst those who owned land, the average land size was not more than half an acre. Thus, the project has been exceptionally successful in mobilising women from the poorest households in its community structure. However, a majority of the women, despite being informed about the livelihoods intervention, were not engaged.
JEEViKA’s most promoted intervention, system of crop intensification (SCI), was adopted only by 27 per cent of women, of whom half had discontinued the service. For many, it was due to lack of adequate land (60 per cent). This casts a serious doubt on the concept of farm innovation alone being the right kind of innovation for women belonging to landless or near landless households. JEEViKA has acknowledged this concern and so it also promotes off-farm and non-farm interventions such as poultry farming, agarbatti-making and so on. However, the data implies that participation has been less than satisfactory. Firstly, cultural barriers and taboos discouraged women from participating. For example, despite being affordable, only 8 per cent took up poultry farming; 43 per cent reported they did not want to share their household space with chickens as it affected their social status within the caste system.
Another constraint was lack of time. The project started the kitchen garden initiative in order to enable women to grow a variety of vegetables in their own premises. The project provides free or subsidised seeds and other technical support. Despite this, only 4 per cent of women adopted the initiative, mainly because many perceived it as requiring extra time and energy, and not providing any immediate income.
At the same time, many women felt that enterprise-based intervention could help them generate immediate income. However, there were no active follow-ups provided. For example, 52 per cent reported that they had been waiting for the agarbatti-making enterprise to start, however, they had not heard about it from the resource persons. This clearly highlights the incongruity between the women’s needs and the opportunities being offered by the project.
Continuous support
We also found that participating women who frequently receive handholding support from resource persons were three times more likely to re-apply the technique. For example, 48 per cent of women who had previously adopted the SCI technique stopped re-applying. Of the women who were visited by the resource persons, 58 per cent re-applied, compared to 31 per cent who had not been visited. What is interesting is that 64 per cent of women who had adopted this technique reported an increase in the productivity of crops, yet this had no significant effect on the re-application.
Lastly, it has been observed that a woman who is in the SHG leadership position or receives support from the village organisations is more than twice as likely to participate in the intervention. The findings of the IFMR study clearly indicates that provisions of well-designed interventions do not guarantee participation. There are many factors that come into play that influence women’s decisions — cultural beliefs, perceived opportunity cost of the intervention, and handholding support they receive from the project’s stakeholders.
The implementers need to be aware of the factors. Failure to do so might not only affect its long-term success, but also systematically exclude the most disadvantaged women from participating in livelihood interventions.

Chicago revamps its SRO proposalChicago revamps its SRO proposal

Chicago's tweaked SRO proposal has more in it for developers
Tenants still to get cash in tweaked Chicago SRO proposal
Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants.
An ordinance that would make it more expensive to convert single-room-occupancy hotels in Chicago into market-rate housing moved closer to becoming law Monday with an endorsement from aldermen. ( John Byrne, Mary Ellen Podmolik )
Backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and introduced last month, the original proposal's long list of mandates would have barred the city from approving the demolition or conversion of an SRO to market-rate housing unless the owner set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents or paid the city $200,000 for each unit that should have been kept affordable.
That key requirement, deemed onerous by building owners who said they might mount a legal challenge, is gone from a revised proposal circulated among housing groups, building owners and developers.
However, the proposed substitute Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance still offers protections and cash payments that range from $2,000 to $10,600, depending on the circumstances, to displaced tenants who have lived in a building for at least 32 days.

Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy chief, said set-aside requirements were not needed to accomplish the city's goal, which is to preserve the stock of affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods. "The right-to-purchase section really gets at our concern, buildings that are housing vulnerable populations but are in areas that are growing," he said. "Now there's an early warning system."

Owners who choose to sell a building would have three options. They could  negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days with a representative of tenants like a nonprofit group that would keep the entire building affordable. If those talks produce no agreement, the owner could sell to another buyer within the next 90 days with no affordable-unit restrictions. If no sale occurs in those 90 days, the owner would have to again start the process of finding a buyer that would keep the building affordable.
Or, owners could bypass the first two options and sell the building to whomever they choose. In that case, the buyer would have to pay to the city $20,000 per unit in preservation fees. In that scenario, each displaced long-term renter would receive $10,600.
Long-term tenants who are not given the opportunity to return to their building would receive a relocation payment of $2,000 or three months' rent, whichever is greater.
Shorter-term displaced tenants would get back their security deposits plus interest and any unpaid rent.
The revised proposal could be taken up by the city's housing and real estate committee next week. In July, the city passed a six-month moratorium on issuing building permits for projects other than normal maintenance while it developed protections for Chicago's supply of housing for its very-low and low-income residents. In the past three years, more than 2,000 rooms of housing have been converted to market-rate apartments. The city has said it wants to preserve at least 700 SRO units during the next five years.
"We recognized the reality that we needed to compromise," said Mary Tarullo, a community organizer with ONE Northside, a group working with the city to draft regulations. "We still think we have a strong ordinance. The goal is for these developments to be put into the hands of developers who are going to improve them and also keep them affordable."
Fees collected under the ordinance would be set aside in a fund from which SRO owners could seek forgivable loans for building rehabs.
Owners say the proposal still needs more tweaks. They say the 180-day sale negotiation period is too long and the potential $10,600 payment is too high and unfairly based on the Keep Chicago Renting ordinance when SROs, by their definition, house only one person in a unit.
"Before, the city said take it or leave it," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties. "The city is understanding better that the original version was lopsided and unfair and would drive these properties out of business. We still have a lot of work to do on this."

How to Create a Truly Supportive Community Onlinereddit
Do you ever feel lonely online?
You know, you're flipping through page after page of your so-called "friends" on Facebook or some other social media platform, but you realize you are actually quite lonely?
It may seem strange, but even though the world has become more connected via the internet and social media, studies are showing that more people consider themselves unhappy, even as we're becoming more connected.
Why More People Are Unhappy
A University of Michigan psychologist conducted a study last year which found that when users consumed online social media, it made those users more lonely and reduced overall life satisfaction.
Almost 100 participants in the study were sent questions five times a day over a two-week period with a link to a survey about their Facebook use, their feelings of well being and the amount of face-to-face social interaction they had engaged in.
According to the study, the more time participants had spent on Facebook, the less happy they felt over time.
"The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them," the study reported. "The more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time."
A few years ago, I was just like the participants in that study. I was active on all the major platforms, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, but I felt lonely. I didn't feel like I had a community where I belonged.
Part of the problem was my business. Like most lawyers, I was too dependent on the service-based billable hour. I was chained to my desk. If I wasn't at my desk, I wasn't making money.
I decided that I didn't want to be 100% dependent on the billable hour. I also knew I needed a community to help me transition my business by expanding my online presence, including using blogging and podcasting.
There's a saying "when the student is ready, the teacher will appear." That's what happened for me.
Enter Fizzle
Around that time, a new training program and community of small entrepreneurs, small business owners and wannabe business owners was forming. It was called Fizzle.co , and it was created in about September 2012 by three guys named Corbett Barr, Caleb Wojcik and Chase Reeves. It was just what I needed.
It's also a great case study in how to create a supportive online community.
The "3 C's" as they are known put together an incredible community of like-minded entrepreneurs. People who wanted to grow themselves, but also to help others to grow.
Through Fizzle, I have forged some amazing relationships with other solopreneurs like me who aspire to make a bigger dent in the universe in an ethical way.
These supportive Fizzlers have included people such as:
Darlene Hildebrandt , a great photographer and writer, who took the time to photoshop my headshot and critique my videos
Tony Rulli , who responded to my desperate call for help when I needed help with Facebook ads one early morning. I have since hired him to run Facebook ads for me and he's amazing.
Omar Zenhom , co-founder of The $100 MBA, who I've collaborated with on numerous projects.
Kevin Johns , a novelist and writing coach who helped me to create an ebook version of my Connect with Influencers course.
John Muldoon , who has helped critique my website and always makes me laugh when I'm feeling stressed
Julia Tunstall, who runs MastermindFinder to help people find mastermind groups, who has been a constant source of support
Bree Brouwer , who has given me tons of feedback on my progress log.
That's literally just the tip of the iceberg. There are many, many more.
How did it work? Why were other supportive entrepreneurs drawn to it?
I think it's because the 3 C's were authentic about who they were for, and who they were not for. They were not afraid to turn away people who they thought were not a good fit. They also created a popular podcast where they talked openly about these sorts of ideas -- who they wanted to attract, and who they didn't want to attract.
They also made it inexpensive (it's just $1 for the first 30 days; after that, it's $35/month.), which I think attracted a diverse audience.
I recorded a new video where I show off what this community looks like. You can watch it here:
What I Got From This Community
Now, what did I get from this supportive online community? Well, I got a sense of belonging. I got a feeling of being a part of something bigger, which is missing from other platforms like Facebook or Twitter. I got a sounding board for sharing my ideas where they would be accepted, even if some of my ideas were off-the-wall.
Most importantly, I built strong relationships with others who knew what I was going through and who wanted to help. (If you want to know more about this journey, read my guest post on the Fizzle blog )
These relationships have been instrumental in the metamorphasis my business has undergone over the last two years. Here's the before and after picture, and how Fizzle has impacted my business:
Before Fizzle email subscribers: 200 subscribers
After Fizzle email subscribers: almost 7,000 (3,200% increase)
Before Fizzle website traffic: my Mom and my dog
After Fizzle website traffic: 50K pageviews/mo
Before Fizzle income from blog and digital products: $0
After Fizzle income from digital products: approx. $4,000-$5,000/month and growing
Before Fizzle guest posts: N/A
After Fizzle guest posts: today, I write or have written for Forbes , Huffington Post , Psychology Today , Art of Manliness , BoostBlogTraffic , Smart Passive Income , etc.
I've also appeared on dozens of podcasts including The Art of Charm , Entrepreneur on Fire and Listen Money Matters (co-created by another Fizzler Matt Giovanisci) as a guest on CreativeLive , and I am going to be featured in at least two books in the next year.
(I have an ongoing progress log in the Fizzle forums that chronicles how I grew this side of my business between August 2013 and today. You need to be logged in to read it.)
I am not making so much that I'm able to go buy a boat and retire . But the revenue is significant, it is growing, and the products leverage my time much greater than one-to-one service.
Thanks to everything I have learned in Fizzle, today I am not 100% dependent on the billable hour. There have been numerous occasions over the past year where I've been out to lunch, or out with friends, or spending time with my kids, or sleeping, and someone somewhere who I've never met has sent me money. And that's super cool.
How Does this Affect You?
I am sharing all of this because I know a lot of people who have those feelings of loneliness like I felt. Often they are the most active on social media, but they are also the most lonely. They yearn to belong to something.
What you may not be realizing is you need to find a community and connect. You need to begin developing relationships, like I did. You need to find a community that is invested in seeing you succeed.
Now imagine what it would be like if you found that community. Imagine if you had friends who wouldn't let you fail?
Imagine if you were surrounded by people who are completely, 100% supportive of what you are trying to do. The business you want to create. The future you want to inhabit.
How would that make you feel?
I write on my blog about how to build relationships in our inter-connected world, and so I hear all the time about people who are struggling with their current relationships. They ask me what they should do.
And I can honestly say if you find you are not surrounded by a group of people who support you, then find a new community who does support you. That's what Fizzle is for me.
If Fizzle sounds like a community for you, then you can learn more about Fizzle here . (Full disclosure: If you do sign up through my link, I also get a modest affiliate commission, but that seriously is a very minor consideration. I would just want more cool people inside.)
But more importantly, find yourself a community and go build relationships and build connections. That's what really matters.

Innovation Reconsideredreddit
"I only came for the sushi," joked the dapper young man in the plaid shirt, popping a roll into his mouth. His friend turned his gaze away from the paintings on display at Portland's Elizabeth Leach Gallery and said, "He's lying. He's got 'innovate' tattooed on his arm."
That turned out to be a lie, too. But just because he didn't ink it doesn't mean he doesn't believe in it. The two friends were part of the hundred-odd designers, students, leaders, and entrepreneurs who attended a panel discussion on innovation hosted by Liquid Agency in Portland, Oregon.
What drives innovation? What stops it in its tracks? As part of Design Week Portland, a multidisciplinary exploration of the process, craft, and practice of design, I got to pose those questions to four business innovators: Jeff Faulkner, Creative Director for Analog at Microsoft; Micheael Shea, former creative director at Nike's Innovation Kitchen and cofounder of School+Jackson; Mohan Nair, Chief Innovation Officer at Cambia Health Solutions; and Genevieve Bell, Intel Vice President & Fellow.
The discussion was a heady one. Instead of focusing on the practicalities and modes of encouraging innovation, the panelists dove into dissecting the concept itself.
I suggested that an innovation is any invention that makes the world change around it. Mohan, too, invoked the idea of transformation: "it transforms the persons I seek to transform, and it also transforms me."
Michael noted the importance of execution. "If you can't put it out there, nothing's going to happen," he reminded the room. "You have to execute on creative insights." In other words, you can be as creative as you want to be and still not be innovative if you don't get your product to market.
Genevieve Bell pointed out that innovation doesn't always change things for the better. "The 20th century is littered with innovations that changed our lives that aren't necessarily good." She, for one, does not want an internet-connected toothbrush .
The Internet of Things became a bit of a punching bag for these tech-savvy thinkers. "Is it cool to get in an accident because you're turning off your washing machine at a stop light?" Michael asked, while Jeff wondered what exactly Facebook and its ilk are "doing to us."
The consensus, rather quickly reached, was that true innovation must aim for a larger societal good. Technological progress for the sake of technological progress was just more "noise," Jeff suggested. Mohan argued that we "should be worried about the health of our country and our world" broadly--and, mores specifically, things like cost of health care and education.
Taking it a step farther, one could argue that narrowly defined goals like shareholder value are damaging to society, since they tend to encourage irresponsibility in the name of a single group, causing other groups and future generations to pay for collateral damage.
It's a powerful thought. What if we put our energies toward creating broad-based, long-term value instead of mere shareholder value or corporate profits? What if we picked higher goals, as Mohan urged: "Aim for things you think you cannot reach and that will transform you"?
We still need a community of thinkers and makers and designers and funders who will spur innovation onwards, whether it's an internet-connected gadget that improves our morning routines or a novel way to produce clean energy.  As Michael reminded the room, "It's not a matter of 'if there's a will, there's a way.' You need a way... You need partners, teammates, experts.... You also need resources. And resources don't always mean cash. It means thought leaders, for example, and the alchemy of your team."
I think we provided a little alchemy of innovation that night. Not to mention free sushi.

More on Clarence Thomas and KorematsuBy Ilya Somin October 24
Drake Law School Professor Mark Kende has posted a response to my critique of his argument that Justice Clarence Thomas supports the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the World War II-era internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans.
In my previous post, I emphasized that Thomas’ occasional positive citations to Korematsu are limited to a largely uncontroversial part of its holding: that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny national security is a “compelling” government interest that might sometimes justify racial discrimination in extreme circumstances. By contrast, he has never said that the Korematsu Court correctly applied that rule to the facts of the case before it. Kende responds as follows:
[I]n the Fisher v. Texas affirmative action [case], Justice Thomas cites to Korematsu as supporting the forcible relocation of Japanese-Americans on the west coast even under strict scrutiny. Thomas in Fisher said that Korematsu found the internment “had a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.” But Ilya then says that Justice Thomas is only “summarizing” Korematsu without necessarily approving it (despite Thomas’s recitation of the facts). This is odd. For example, at the end of his essay Ilya says that Justice Thomas is “usually among the justices least willing to suppress his own views for the sake of consensus.” By that logic, one would suspect Justice Thomas cited Korematsu approvingly in Fisher. Thomas could have cited other cases.
There is no contradiction here. I did not claim that Thomas, in this passage, suppressed his view on Korematsu for the sake of consensus. He simply chose not to give a comprehensive analysis of the rightness (or lack thereof) of Korematsu, because he didn’t need to do so to make the very limited point this passage was devoted to. All he did was 1) cite Korematsu for the mostly uncontroversial proposition that national security is a compelling state interest (the supposed threat of espionage and sabotage is of course a national security interest), and 2) summarize its holding in a passage whose main function is to summarize past cases where the Supreme Court held that a particular interest is important enough to qualify as compelling for strict scrutiny purposes. He could perhaps have cited a different case for the former proposition. But, as Thomas himself explained, he cited Korematsu because it was both the first case to hold that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications and the first to conclude that national security was an important enough interest to pass strict scrutiny.
Kende also argues that Thomas’ dissent in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld can’t be distinguished from Korematsu on the basis that the former involved alleged enemy combatants, whereas the latter involved civilians who were not enemy combatants or even claimed to be such. Kende suggests that “[t]he alleged grave national security concerns asserted by American military leaders and by the President regarding Japanese-American loyalty on the west coast, and regarding the supposed danger of invasion, would have likely created far greater national security worries for Justice Thomas than a single enemy combatant.” Obviously, the issue in Hamdi was not just the status of a single enemy combatant, but the way alleged enemy combatants should be handled in the War on Terror more generally (just as the rule in Korematsu was not limited to Fred Korematsu himself). Moreover, there are a obvious differences between alleged enemy combatants and ordinary civilians distinguished from the rest of the population only by race or national origin. The latter both have stronger legal rights and are less likely to be threats to national security than the former.
Kende also suggests that Thomas’ deference to racial classifications by prison officials in Johnson v. California would require him to deter to the government in Korematsu because “Japanese-American internment camps were… the essential equivalent of prisons.” The camps were certainly prison-like in the sense that their inmates were not free to leave at will. But, as I noted in my earlier post, the camps were not legally equivalent to prisons because the Japanese-Americans interned in them had never been convicted of any crime, or even charged with one. Thus, they are not covered by various precedents holding that convicted criminals incarcerated for their crimes have much weaker constitutional rights than ordinary citizens. As I also pointed out, this distinction is likely the reason why Justice Scalia joined Thomas’ dissent in Johnson, but also opposes the Korematsu decision .
Finally, Kende argues that Thomas’ failure to cite Korematsu in his dissent in Hamdi is somehow an indication that he agrees with the former. He suggests that Thomas chose not to cite it, despite its potential relevance, because he did not want to reveal the fact that he agreed with it. If Thomas really were intent on hiding his supposed agreement with Korematsu by avoiding citation to it, one would think that he would also avoid citing it in other opinions. Yet, as Kende emphasizes he did cite it in at least two other cases. Moreover, Thomas’ omission of Korematsu from the discussion of precedents supporting his position in Hamdi could just as easily be construed as due to disagreement with the case. Unlike in Fisher, where the relevant part of Korematsu was largely uncontroversial, in Hamdi the relevant part was the Court’s deference to the executive on the question of whether the Japanese-Americans really posed a serious enough threat to justify racially-based internment. Quite possibly, Thomas chose not to cite the Court’s analysis on this point because he thought it was wrong.

Euro dips ahead of banks  stress test results  sterling firm0
The dollar posted its largest one-day loss against the yen since mid-October, falling after four straight days of gains. On the year, however, the dollar was still up 14 percent.
The U.S. currency's losses were in line with the drop in Treasury debt yields and stocks. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was last at 2.24 percent, down from 2.31 percent last Friday.
"We're drifting off in the dollar and this is just consolidation," said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. "All the signs point to a stronger dollar. Oil prices are down, we have a Fed meeting next week and some are pointing to a possible change in language."
Earlier in the session, the dollar soared to a fresh two-year high against the euro, a seven-year high versus the yen and touched a five-year peak versus a currency basket. It also rose to its highest in 15 months versus the pound.
The euro stumbled after Ewald Nowotny, the Austrian central bank chief, said government bond buying could be valuable in addressing the "massive" weakening of the euro zone economy.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments, but was last up 0.4 percent at $1.2332 .
"Markets are pretty much pricing in a Fed rate hike by the middle of 2015 and a growing likelihood of the ECB unleashing full scale QE (quantitative easing) in the months ahead," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The dollar surged to 121.84 yen , before falling 0.8 percent to 120.52 yen. Japan's national election on Dec. 14 is seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies that should further weaken the yen.
The dollar index climbed as high as 89.550 <.DXY>, its highest since March 2009. The index was last at 89.047, down 0.3 percent.

What was fake on the Internet this week: Banksys arrest  Red Velvet Oreos and exploding bongsBy Caitlin Dewey October 24 Follow @caitlindewey
A screenshot from the satirical Facebook page “Christians for Michele Bachmann.” (Facebook)
There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights . Fake pumpkin-spice products . Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt !
So rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.
Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:
1. Banksy was not arrested in Bristol. This is not the first time that Paul Horner has tricked the Internet into thinking he’s Banksy. This latest hoax, spurred by a (fake) story that Horner wrote for the (fake) news site National Report, was read by nearly 5 million people — and shared more than 3 million times. Of course, as we discovered in a long chat with Horner this week , he’s a would-be comedian in Phoenix … not, you know, an elusive graffiti mastermind with a cult-like following. Incidentally, the real Banksy painted a new mural  just this Monday.
2. New York police did not stop and frisk two Muslim men for wearing traditional garments. Some 200,000 viewers were rightly disturbed by a video that surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, purportedly showing an NYPD officer confronting two Muslim men over their clothes. The officer in the video was, however, and actor — and the men in the video were forced to admit, after taking a bit of Internet heat, that the clip was “a dramatization … to raise awareness for Racial Profiling.” Unfortunately, that message seems to have gone right over some commenters’ heads: “These muhammadan seditionists need to be arrested for impersonating a police officer,” raged one popular comment. “[They] are abusing our laws to line their own pockets and to gain more islamic terrorists through their twisted lies.” The lies might be twisted, but they’re just trying to gain YouTube hits, bro.
3. There is no Red Velvet Oreo. Marketing students in San Marcos, Tex., should definitely get an A for this little stunt, wherein they Photoshopped a crimson cookie onto an Oreo package and claimed that Nabisco was launching the new flavor for Valentine’s Day. Nabisco has not, alas, chosen to weigh in on the issue. But a Facebook post on the “Red Velvet Oreo” page two days ago would seem to confirm that this weird novelty — like Butterbeer and Fried Chicken before it! — isn’t actually meant to be.
4. An exploding bong did not take off half a woman’s face. A Facebook PSA about the dangers of marijuana — captioned, scarily, “THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU” — claims that a young woman was gruesomely disfigured when her bong exploded. In fact, the woman pictured is an Internet-famous makeup artist dressed up for a zombie bar crawl … and “Christians for Michele Bachman,” the page that posted her picture, is satirical and has nothing to do with the politician. Alas, this has not stopped 21,000 people from sharing the post, and a whopping 49,000 from commenting.
“How did this dumb s*** get on my page?” One man wrote. “It’s an insult that they think we are this stupid. LOST MY VOTE.”
Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime.

With Lalu attacking JD(U) s  weak  governance and Manjhi playing Dalit card  Nitish goes back to yatra politicsJD(U) senior leader Nitish Kumar addresses a protest dharna for special status to Bihar, in Patna on Monday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 24, 2014 3:21 pm
BJP’s victory in Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections may have caused discomfort and some amount of self-doubt in the much-touted grand alliance of RJD-JD (U)-Congress, but it still has not given these parties a sense of urgency to come together with a common poll plank. All top Bihar leaders from grand alliance camp have been backing on their individual strengths rather than pursuing a common goal against BJP.
While RJD chief Lalu Prasad has been recovering from heart surgery, party vice president and former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has started the party campaign, of course, with backing from Lalu Prasad, to take up “issue of public concerns”. Singh has, in fact, chosen 34-point agenda to attack JD (U) more than the ruling NDA.
Amidst such backdrop, former chief minister Nitish Kumar is back to his own Yatra politics, all by himself. He is back to renew his old agenda of demanding special status for Bihar, which otherwise failed to emerge a poll plank in last Lok Sabha elections. RJD legislature party leader AB Siddiqui asks how Nitish Kumar is thinking of consolidating alliance with RJD and giving it a formal shape when he is “running his own tune” to gain his lost political ground. Kumar will start his Sampark Yatra from West Champaran, again invoking Champaran symbolism of Gandhi, from 13 November and will cover two districts in a day.
Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi is bent on further “ultra Dalit” agenda, which has made the task of forging a strong grand alliance all the more difficult. Manjhi told a public gathering at Gaya on Thursday that Dalits, who are about 16 per cent of Bihar population, can make it count in next Assembly election. “I was made chief minister. If there is a greater political awareness, Dalits are in a position to choose its leader (read CM) after next polls, ” said Manjhi, who has earlier courted controversy for asking Dalits”to raise their numbers” by inter-caste marriage.
Nitish Kumar, the “yatri” trying to back his development politics, is now caught between personal ambition of Manjhi and “recalcitrance” of Lalu Prasad to not “allow him become a leader of grand alliance”. Nitish, who looks desperate to keep his pan-Indian appeal intact by joining meeting of regional parties outside Bihar, has now challenge at his own turf. The special status plank is the only thing that may get him into focus. But then, it remains to be seen how he tries to convince people against resurgent BJP under Narendra Modi.

FIPB okays 20 FDI proposals worth Rs 988 crFIPB okays 20 FDI proposals worth Rs 988 cr

New Delhi, Oct 24:  
The Finance Ministry has cleared 20 FDI proposals including 6 in the pharma sector envisaging a total inflow of Rs 988.3 crore.
The proposals of Fresenius Kabi Oncology for Rs 119 crore and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Company’s for up to Rs 205 crore have been approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), a multi—department panel headed by Finance Secretary.
Indusind Bank’s proposal seeking increase in foreign investment in the bank to 74 per cent has also been cleared.
The amount of fund flow would depend on when the actual transaction takes place in case of the bank.
The bank, according to a release today, sought “a specific request to grant post—facto approval for increase in foreign holding from 68.51 per cent to 72.07 per cent on June 30, 2014“.
These proposals were approved at the FIPB meeting held on September 16, it said.
Tamil Nadu—based Equitas Holdings Pvt Ltd, with the largest proposed investment in the lot, would bring foreign capital of Rs 325 crore.

French filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa  FIR filedFrench filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa, FIR filed
PTI
Tweet
Port Blair, Oct 24:  
Two French filmmakers have been booked on the charge of trespassing into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve in the Andaman islands and filming a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe.
“We have filed an FIR against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert for violating the law of the land. Entering the Jarawa area is banned and so are making any contact with them or shooting any photo or video,” the union territory’s Tribal Welfare Secretary Theva Neethi Dhas told PTI today.
“The police are investigating the matter and gathering evidences against them. If the charges are proved, it could lead to three years of imprisonment, besides a fine,” the Secretary said.
He said two local inhabitants have been arrested for allegedly helping the filmmakers to enter the Jarawa area.
The case was registered on October 19 while the incident is said to have happened during March-April.
The matter came to light only when the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti (AAJVS) reported the matter to the administration.
Dhas said they had already sent notices to the filmmakers, who have returned to their homeland, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
The administration will also ask the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with the French government, he said.
Charges against the two French filmmakers include violation of Protection of the Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012, Foreigners Amendment Act 2004, and Information Technology Act.
Under post-production stage now, the film ‘Organic Jarawa’ is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.

The S&P energy index <.SPNY> tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude  fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. Leading the decline, shares of Exxon Mobil  fell 2.3 percent to $91.70 while shares of Chevron  dropped 3.7 percent to $106.80.
The energy index is now down 12.8 percent for the year and is the only major S&P sectors in negative territory for 2014. [O/R] The S&P 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far.
Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market.
Meanwhile several of the year's biggest gainers also sold off, possibly due to year-end profit-taking, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among them, Apple  was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro  shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65.
"This has been a monster market, and it's been eking out new records. So it's taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done," said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69.
The tumble follows gains Friday, which had pushed the S&P 500 to a record high close for the 49th time this year.
Volume picked up after midday, while the S&P 500 moved more than 21 points from its high for the day to its low, its largest high-to-low swing in more than a month.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 71 more stocks made 52-week lows compared with those making new highs, the largest gap skewed in favor of new lows since Oct. 16, the day after the market made its bottom in the recent pullback.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 919, for a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,048 issues fell and 699 advanced for a 2.93-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
McDonald's  shares shed 3.8 percent to $92.61 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a steeper-than-expected fall in global same-restaurant sales in November and said fourth-quarter results would be hurt by a supplier scandal in China and a stronger dollar.
About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Hudhud : NIO vessel capsizes off Vizag 
 
The coastal research vessel (CRV) -- Sagar Paschmi -- of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIO) capsized off Visakhapatnam coast on the day of cyclone Hudhud,  according to a press release issued by Forward Seamen's Union of India.
Abdul Sharieff, the union representative, said the vessel belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India was on hire to the NIO and on the day of the cyclone it sank near the fishing harbour. All the 12 crew members escaped unhurt. He said it was regrettable that neither the SCI nor the NIO had deemed it fit to report the capsize of the vessel with costly equipment worth crores. Nor did the authorities bother about the crew, he alleged.

Govt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policyGovt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policy
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
The Government has constituted an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) think-tank to help draft a new National IPR Policy and to advice it on issues related to intellectual property.
The think-tank, headed by Justice Prabha Sridevan, will highlight anomalies in the present IPR legislations and advice the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on possible solutions, according to an official release.
It will also provide views on the possible implications of demands placed by negotiating partners of proposed free trade pacts and other regional arrangements.
With several developed countries criticising India’s IP regime on grounds of laxity and the US carrying out a review to see if it should be black-listed as a `priority country’ for giving insufficient IP protection to its companies, the think-tank is expected to play an important role in helping the Government deal with international pressure.
Other members of the IPR think-tank include Narendra K Sabarwal, former Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organisation, Rajeev Srinivasan, Director, Asian School of Business, Advocate Pratibha Singh, Advocate Punita Bhargava and Cadila Pharma’s Unnat Pandit.
The DIPP, which constituted the think-tank of Friday, will co-ordinate with it to identify areas in intellectual property where study needs to be conducted, an official release said.
It will also take inputs from it on the new IPR policy which has been proposed to bring clarity in existing laws and safeguard interests of Indian industry.
An inter-ministerial group, with representatives from Ministries and Departments including Commerce & Industry, Health, Information & Broadcasting and Telecom, will soon meet to discuss the new policy for India’s IPR.

Paswan demands hike in import duty on edible oilsPaswan demands hike in import duty on edible oils
PTI
Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10 per cent and on refined edible oils to 25 per cent to arrest cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here and discussed the issue of raising import duty on crude and refined edible oils to restrict cheap imports and protect domestic farmers, among other matters.
Problems faced by sugar mills in availing of loans sanctioned through the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and the issue of additional budget allocation for FCI were also discussed.
“The proposals on increasing import duty on edible oils, additional budget for FCI and loan issue under SDF, among others, were on the agenda of the meeting,” Paswan told PTI.
The Food Ministry favours increasing the import duty on crude and refined edible oils from existing 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, he said.
Industry body Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10 per cent and on refined edible oils to 25 per cent as local prices have fallen to historical lows due to cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
On sugar sector issues, Paswan briefed the Finance Minister about the current impasse between the UP sugar mills and the state government over cane price policy, sources said.
Paswan also discussed about relaxing certain norms so that sugar mills can avail of loans easily from SDF, sources said, adding that he also sought additional budget allocation for state—run Food Corporation of India (FCI) for giving food subsidies this fiscal.
A budget allocation of Rs 92,000 crore has been made against the requirement of Rs 1,47,700 crore for this fiscal.

Sonia  Rahul Gandhi should speak more  saysChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”
“I have, not only I, others have urged that the reorganisation that was promised in continued…

The Rise of Xtremepreneurs: Today s World-Changersreddit
"Personal drive without ego, dedication beyond failures and conviction above circumstances. This describes the spirit of an Xtremepreneur." -- Val Jon Farris
What is an "Xtremepreneur?" Allow me to answer in an extreme way. I was recently invited to a cave dive in the Yucatan Peninsula with Guillermo de Anda , one of National Geographic's Global Explorers . We rappelled 100 feet underground to the surface of a "sacrificial cenote," or subterranean lake. ("Sacrificial" because human sacrifices actually took place there.) Equipped with underwater torches and a video camera we descended into the darkness of what the Maya call "Xibalba, the Underworld Goddess of Death."
After traversing ancient limestone catacombs we emerged into a grand underwater cavern, when suddenly my buoyancy compensator filled with water and I sank uncontrollably. By the time the dive team noticed, I had plummeted 120 feet to the cavern floor! I literally had to pry my mask from my face to equalize it, and as I did my nose and throat flooded with water.
Guillermo appeared in front of me with his hand raised cautioning me to not panic. On my knees in the darkness among scattered animal and human remains, and unable to breathe, I was about to find out who I was with respect to my opening quote of, "conviction above circumstances."
Before I tell you what happened next I want to discuss Xtremepreneurs and World-Changers for a moment. Xtremepreneurs are a hybrid between extreme sports enthusiasts and philanthropic entrepreneurs. And while the sports they engage in, (kiteboarding, base jumping, heli-skiing, cave diving, etc.) possess varying degrees of risk, those who participate in them share a common philosophy of using extreme challenges to access extraordinary capabilities.
How this extreme breed of entrepreneurs evolves into World-Changers is by shifting their attention off themselves and onto being a contribution to others. World-Changers exist at all levels of entrepreneurial success, from the likes of Richard Branson , Elon Musk and Guy Laliberte , all the way to professions like you and me who know we make a difference in the world and are striving to expand that difference. We do this by pressing ourselves beyond our limits, learning from our failures and moving forward with conviction, which brings us back to the challenge I faced on the underwater cavern floor...
On my knees, staring at Guillermo's raised hand, two waves of energy roared through me. First was sheer terror and second was some urgent advice from deep within my core, "Val Jon, you can't make the surface, you need to work with what you've got. If you don't, you will die right here, right now."
What happened next was a testament to the power of the Human Spirit and Greater Self which I believe dwells within all of us. Rather than panicking or trying to force a solution, I literally surrendered my Will over to the Greater Self Within Me to know what to do. And what was that? To simply wait until I could swallow the water blocking my airways and take tiny breaths until I could regain my composure. I did just that and by doing so it saved my life.
You might conclude it was remaining calm that saved me, but I say this to you. The moment "I" got out of the way, the Greater Self Within Me knew exactly what to do. It is this same Greater Self within us that always knows what to do, not only in life and death situations, but in business dealings and with respect to realizing our greatest dreams and aspirations.
Neither equipment failure nor personal threat was going to stop me from succeeding with our cenote dive. We surfaced, repaired my gear, added an additional proximity safety protocol and submerged again. Our willingness to reengage as a team, learn from our mistakes and persevere beyond fear yielded both an extraordinary experience and some extreme underwater footage. (To experience our actual dive, click here for the YouTube clips .)
I have a profound admiration for those who persevere and use life's challenges to better themselves and at the same time support others in doing the same. And obviously I have a special appreciation for the extreme crowd. To me, Xtremepreneurs like pro-kiteboarders Susi Mai and Bill Tai , founders of Mai Tai Global are an example of real World-Changers. And while I run the risk of appearing promotional, I want to mention a remarkable mentoring project Richard Branson and Kym McNicholas are spearheading in partnership with MaiTai Global called the Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC . I pay tribute to them here because it's my way of giving back to the spirit of mentorship that was so instrumental to my own entrepreneurial success many years ago.
These kinds of extreme mentoring projects develop something extraordinary within us, something greater than thrill seeking or even fame and fortune. There is a need today for bringing greater purpose and contribution into the world of commerce. And while it may sound Pollyanna to some, what I see happening is an "evolution of self" in which our egos are learning how to step aside so our Greater Selves can step forward into our lives and into our world. This spirited movement is The Rise of Xtremepreneurs, Today's World-Changers.
To learn more about a wide range of mentoring programs, log onto SuperSummit . You'll find a host of world-class talent gathering there. I also personally invite you to learn about our growing Global Xtreme Team at www.whowithinyou.com . And finally, true to my extreme spirit I encourage any and all Xtreme expedition invites!

California s Fracking Controversyreddit
Will a "Yes" or "No" vote on Measure P (the measure that bans all forms of enhanced drilling techniques, including steam injection and fracking) have an impact on Santa Barbara County's property values? This may be one of the biggest concerns for this California County's voters in November.
With nearly 7,000 new wells proposed locally, there is concern for the loss of property values - on top of environmental concerns related to fracking and other high intensity petroleum operations.
A Calgary and Duke University study of property values near shale gas wells notes a ten percent drop in values, but with fracking operations in place, values dropped some 22 percent. "Whether or not fracking causes groundwater pollution, people fear the risk enough that property values have dropped for homes with drinking-water wells near shale-gas pads, according to new research," writes Forbes in an article entitled Pollution Fears Crush Home Prices Near Fracking Wells.
"Real estate brokers say they see more signs of prospective home buyers worrying about the health and environmental effects of living close to a well," Reuters_News@reuters.com writes. "'For the most part, it renders those houses unsellable,' said Phyllis Wolper, a Denton, Texas, realtor who has several clients who live near oil and gas wells and have been unable to sell their homes."
These well sites impact individuals and developments. "When Gary Gless bought his sleek, modernist house in Los Angeles in 2002, he thought he had hit a "gold mine," reuters.com notes. "The world's largest inner-city park - featuring a lush, 18-hole golf course - was about to get built across the street. Gless's balcony was set to overlook the clubhouse and first tee....Today, instead of golf carts and fairways, Gless looks out on to drilling wells and oil pads. The park plan was ditched, and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC now operates 700 wells there - and 400 more are on the way. All the drilling, Gless says, has caused house foundations to crack and swimming pools to start to slide down hills."
And fracking operations are non-stop, thanks to the "Halliburton Loophole", a 2005 amendment to the Clean Air and Water Acts that VP Dick Cheney, former Halliburton CEO, pushed through Congress exempting fracking operations from almost all Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
"Coupled with existing exemptions to a variety of pollution laws like the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the 2005 carve-outs gave the fracking industry seven total exemptions from important environmental regulations," reported a recent truthout.org article.
California already has a thriving fracking industry. The majority of the state's new and active wells are concentrated in Kern and Los Angeles counties, said a National Resource Defense Council report entitled Drilling in California: Who's at Risk? However, expanded fracking in the large Monterey Formation is projected to bring the oil and gas industry into more communities, especially in Ventura, Monterey, Fresno, and Santa Barbara counties . According to http://ecowatch.com in Fracking the American Dream,
"In Pavilion, WY, where the EPA has linked groundwater contamination with fracking, Louis Meeks saw the value of his 40-acre alfalfa farm all but disappear completely. In 2006, his land and home were appraised at $239,000. Two years later, as ProPublica reported, "a local realtor sent Meeks a coldly worded letter saying his place was essentially worthless and she could not list his property."
"Last July, Nationwide Insurance spelled out specifically that it would not provide coverage for damage related to fracking. According to an internal memo outlining the company's policy, 'After months of research and discussion, we have determined that the exposures presented by hydraulic fracturing are too great to ignore. Risks involved with hydraulic fracturing are now prohibited for General Liability, Commercial Auto, Motor Truck Cargo, Auto Physical Damage and Public Auto (insurance) coverage," notes ecowatch.com.'
One little noticed side effect of this property value impact is that the secondary mortgage market hasn't caught up with the risk of loaning on properties affected by fracking and extreme oil production methods. As they do, these properties could be harder to finance. Housing Wire has reported on a webinar entitled, Oil and Gas Exploration for Mortgage Bankers, in which Daniel McKenna, with the Ballard Spahr's Mortgage Banking Group said, "The loans are actually low risk. But Fannie, Freddie, the FHA, and the VA prohibit gas leases on their loans. There are a ton of different regulations that impact selling these loans on the secondary market."
Even Exxon CEO and Board Chairman Rex Tillerson, is suing to stop construction of a water tower that would supply nearby drilling operations because of the nuisance of, among other things, heavy truck traffic, noise and traffic hazards from the fracking operations the tower would support.
So the CEO of the single largest drilling company in the world acknowledges the "constant and unbearable nuisance" that would come from having "lights on at all hours of the night...traffic at unreasonable hours... noise from mechanical and electrical equipment." And Tillerson's lawsuit - filed in 2013 with other plaintiffs, including former House Majority Leader Dick Armey - claims the project would do "irreparable harm" to his property values, in papers filed for the Denton County, Texas lawsuit.
Then, there's the real danger of earthquakes from injecting waste water back into the ground, which have been occurring with increasing frequency in some Oklahoma fracking fields, as reported on NPR Radio in a July 2014 broadcast by Linda Wertheimer.
Denver, Colorado had the same problems with so-called natural gas injection wells back in the 1960s, and played a critical role in discovering the link between forced injection wells and induced earthquakes.
There are currently more than 1.1 million active oil and gas wells in the United States, and more than 15 million Americans now live within a mile of the hundreds of thousands that have been drilled since 2000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Made possible by the advent of fracking, drilling is taking place in shale formations from California to New York and from Wyoming to Texas. And there's no indication that this "unprecedented industrialization" shows any signs of slowing. Almost 47,000 new oil and natural gas wells were drilled in 2012, and industry analysts project that pace will only continue.

The Case for a Sustainability Plan in Business: Short-Term Savings and Long-Term Opportunitiesreddit
We live in a world plagued by extreme weather events. Yet, as a general rule (and there are some outstanding exceptions), the world of business still hasn't woken up to the threat of climate change. All too often the sustainability team or programme is a side-lined function and very much seen as a 'nice to do.'
I can see why it happens. There is a perception (an incorrect one!) that going green costs more and therefore balance sheet pressures dictate going with the status quo of doing business.
Our view couldn't be more different. We believe that sustainability is both a moral and commercial imperative.
There is a business case for going green, and after seven years of following our own sustainability programme, we have a good case study to share.
In the short-term, it is about insulating your business from cost pressures; in the longer-term, a more sophisticated business case has emerged, predicated on opportunity, innovation and new revenue streams.
Seven years ago we set aside a massive £200 million for a five year initiative called Plan A, an eco and ethical programme that pledged to transform M&S by changing the way it did business. The environment and the right way to do business would be built into every decision made at the company and we set 100 bold targets to be achieved by 2012 including becoming carbon neutral, sending no waste to landfill and ensure that key raw materials come from the most sustainable sources available.
In only its second year, it became clear that Plan A was delivering significant cost benefits. To add to that it was opening up new revenue streams that were taking off. In year three it returned a net benefit to the business, or profit if you like, and has delivered one every year since. Last year the net benefit was £145 million and over the seven years in total, the benefit is £435 million.
That's £435 million that M&S would either have had to find from elsewhere or simply would not have had in the first place. The savings we're making include being more energy efficient, using less fuel, recycling and reusing clothes hangers, reducing waste, using less packaging etc etc.
But it's not just financial savings; we are seeing many other benefits such as increased staff motivation, brand enhancement and supply chain resiliency to name a few.
We're not the only company with a great business case story to tell. Companies like Walmart, O2, Unilever and Nike also understand the green imperative commercially and have embarked on their own eco-ethical journeys.
And, if you're reading this and thinking, that's all well and good for M&S, but what about small and medium sized companies? It's not the preserve of big businesses like us.
Our suppliers -- many of them small businesses -- are also getting involved in Plan A and making their businesses more efficient and more profitable. Take West Mill, a hosiery factory in Belper, Derbyshire, which was on the brink of closure a few years ago. Now it has turned its fortunes around by controlling its energy use, slashing £2 million from its annual bills. It was awarded eco-factory status by M&S meaning that every product produced at the factory can be labelled as having a Plan A attribute -- boosting the marketing power of the factory's products.
Going forward, as a consequence of interconnected opportunities and risks, business models will be disrupted by sustainability for the first time. We can't monetise the long-term business benefit but our use of the word 'disruption' highlights just how crucial we believe the business case for sustainability will become in the future. At M&S we're very clear the purpose of our business is to enhance lives everyday. And by doing this we will prosper.
That's why we've developed the next stage of our plan -- Plan A 2020, which aims to help accelerate our sustainability efforts. It's organised around four pillars -- Inspiration, In Touch, Integrity and Innovation, and supports our aspiration to become the world's most sustainable major retailer.
I call on every other business to not wait for the future to happen, but to proactively create it -- developing their own sustainable business plan, setting out, amongst other priorities, how they will promote wellbeing, sustain nature, take account of environmental and social impacts and be transparent.
Each plan needs to be adapted to their specific industry challenge and opportunities. It needs to inspire and mobilise everyone in the organisation. There are clearly huge challenges and headwinds ahead, but a sustainable business plan is the first step to realising opportunities and shifting to a new way of doing business, fit for the future.

Craving a Crumbs cupcake? They're back.
Crumbs Bake Shop reopened its location in Water Tower Place on Thursday, ending a three-month absence of the colossal cupcakes in Chicago.
In July, Crumbs was delisted from the Nasdaq and soon after closed its remaining locations. Marcus Lemonis and Fischer Enterprises stepped in to buy the chain and said they would reinvent Crumbs as more of a sweets and snacks shop, rather than just focusing on cupcakes as the chain had since it opened in 2003.
0
Along with its well-known cupcakes, the chain is now selling items such as the Crumbnut, a cross between a doughnut and a croissant, and a Baissant, which it said is a combination of a bagel and a croissant.
The new owners previously said they planned to reopen about two dozen stores of the 50 or so that abruptly closed July 7.
The Water Tower Place location, at 835 N. Michigan Ave., reopened Thursday.
Lemonis, known for his CNBC show "The Profit," is expected to be at a grand reopening event at 6 p.m.
Along with the Chicago store, two stores have reopened in New York, along with one store each in California, Delaware and Washington, D.C., according to the chain's website.
The company said this week that it plans to open a store at 469 Central Ave. in Highland Park in the next 30 days. It also plans mass market products such as a new cookie line, ice cream products and a chocolate bar.

Labor Secretary:  We Suckreddit
Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Thursday the United States' current federal minimum wage is an international embarrassment, specifically calling out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for fighting attempts to raise the wage floor.
Speaking at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News , Perez noted the U.S.'s dismal standing among the 34 countries who belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The current federal minimum wage of $7.25, when compared to the median wage of full-time workers, ranks among the lowest of all member countries.
“I mean, we suck,” Perez said . “We really do.”
Last year, President Barack Obama threw his support behind a Democratic proposal to raise the federal wage floor to $10.10 an hour . In January, Obama announced he would raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10, pushing Congress to do the same on a national level.
“A majority of Americans – not just Democrats, not just independents, but Republicans too – support raising the minimum wage,” Obama said after signing the executive order. “It’s the right thing to do. So that’s something Congress should keep in mind this year.”
Republicans, however, have pushed back on the proposal. In April, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have gradually increased the wage, citing concerns over the impact on businesses and job growth. Democrats have used the GOP opposition as midterm campaign fodder, and hope that ballot measures in states like Arkansas and South Dakota will help boost turnout in November.
During the Bloomberg event, Perez called out Christie, who earlier this week said he is " tired of hearing about the minimum wage ."
“Chris Christie’s got his head in the sand if he’s getting tired about the minimum wage,” Perez said. “Chris Christie needs to talk to his economists, who will tell him that 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption.”
Perez, who is reportedly under consideration to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke earlier this week on the country's " dismal " record on paid parental leave, saying that policies like paid leave and a higher minimum wage are the path to "shared prosperity."
"This is a family issue and an American issue," Perez said . "We need to lead on leave. We can't simply leave talent on the bench."

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Some people are urging the Colorado burrito chain Illegal Pete's to change its name because of the way the word "illegal" has been used to describe immigrants.
The Coloradan (http://noconow.co/1wpoTne ) reports that about 30 people gathered in Fort Collins Wednesday to ask owner Pete Turner to change the name of the chain, which is about to open an outlet there.
It's part of a bigger campaign nationally against what critics refer to as the "I-word." They think using the word to describe a person is dehumanizing.
Turner said the name is a reference to novel he read in college and the "Pete" part refers to his name and his father's. He told the crowd that he is committed to an "inclusive" business and has helped pay for some employees to become citizens.
"This is all very near and dear to me," he said.
But those at the meeting likened the name to a racial slur used against African-Americans or hanging a Confederate flag in the restaurant's window.
"Social context is hugely important," Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator Kim Medina said. "We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language."

Arabian Sea storm starts reorganising  eyes Gujarat for landfallArabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone, target Gujarat
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 24:  
After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

Christian Siriano to appear at Gold Coast pop-up0
In addition to his fragrance, items from his ready-to-wear collection will be for sale.
The pop-up is the first Chicago location to sell Siriano's fragrance, called Silhouette and inspired by the airiness of a blue tulle dress from his spring 2013 line. Price ranges from $35 for perfumed shower gel to $92 for a 100 ml eau de parfum bottle. It also will be sold exclusively by Chicago-based luxury consignment shop eDrop-Off through Oct. 31, after which time it will be available at Neiman Marcus.
The event is organized in partnership with eDrop-Off, which this week announced news of its own.
After 10 years in business, the online auction site is opening a bricks-and-mortar retail shop. The Collection by eDrop-Off debuted Wednesday at 1201 N. Clark St., featuring curated collections of pre-owned luxury items that customers can buy at a fixed price rather than waiting to win an online auction. Items owned by Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant are featured. It also sells several new pieces by Siriano.
The shop, which will also continue to serve as one of the eBay seller's pickup and drop-off locations, will refresh its inventory every two to three weeks, said eDrop-Off owner Corri McFadden. eDrop-Off also recently launched The Collection online, where customers can buy select items at a fixed price (think $3,500 for a Chanel handbag, $250 for a Badgley Mischka gown), rather than buying on auction.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras inIndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

New quarantine rules considered for aid workers returning to U.S. from Ebola-stricken regionBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”
The day after a doctor in New York City was diagnosed with Ebola, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama would have "no qualms about riding the subway...or taking a stroll on the High Line." (AP)
Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Rural job scheme has tremendousimpact on womens lives: Study60% of workers in Alappuzha district depend on the scheme for daily bread
Kochi, October 24:  
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) Scheme has helped improve the social and economic status of women and to alleviate poverty in rural areas, according to a study.
The study, conducted in Alappuzha district by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), showed that 97.3 per cent of workers under the scheme are women.
Empowerment
The study was funded by the Kerala State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) to assess the impact of the scheme on poverty eradication and empowerment of women and marginalised groups.
It found that 60 per cent of workers earned their daily bread through the scheme and that it was a source of additional income for the remaining 40 per cent.
According to the study, 27 per cent of respondents believed that the scheme had helped boost their saving habits and that it brought a kind of financial literacy necessary for financial inclusion.
Impact on wages
The scheme also resulted in wage raise in other sectors, especially in fisheries, construction, coir and agricultural sectors. The study has recommended disbursing the wages within seven days and inclusion of agriculture related works such as harvesting of paddy and works in fish farms under the scheme.
According to V Ambilikumar, Head, Department of Business Administration and Management, KUFOS, and principal investigator of the project, the scheme had made a huge impact on women’s lives and this would reflect on the socio-cultural dynamics of the State.
Kerala has a higher density of population, very limited land holdings and shortage of agricultural land. Hence the list of permissible works under the scheme should be reviewed accordingly, he said.
MS Raju, Director, School of Management and Entrepreneurship, KUFOS, and Mathew Sebastian, Associate Professor, KUFOS, were the co-investigators.

Getting a Grip on Ebolareddit
We have to get a grip. Ebola is not a crisis in the United States. One person has died and two people are infected with his body fluids.
The real crisis is the hysteria over Ebola that's being fed by media outlets seeking sensationalism and politicians posturing for the midterm elections.
That hysteria is causing us to lose our heads. Parents have pulled their children out of a middle school after learning the school's principal had traveled to Zambia. Zambia happens to be in Africa but it has not even had a single case of Ebola.
A teacher at an elementary school has been placed on paid leave because parents were concerned he might have contracted the Ebola virus. When and how? During a recent trip to Dallas for an educational conference.
Are we planning to quarantine Dallas next?
Some politicians from both parties are demanding an end to commercial flights between the United States and several West African countries. But there are no direct flights to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where Ebola is taking its biggest toll.
So do they want to ban all commercial flights that might contain someone from any of these countries, who might have transferred planes? That would cover just about all commercial flights coming from outside the United States.
The most important thing we can do to prevent Ebola from ever becoming a crisis in the United States is to help Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where 10,000 new cases could crop up weekly unless the spread of the virus is slowed soon.
Isolating these poor nations would only make their situation worse. Does anyone seriously believe we could quarantine hundreds of thousands of infected people a continent away who are infecting others?
The truth is quite the opposite. If the disease is allowed to spread in these places, the entire world could be imperiled.
These nations desperately need medical professionals in the field, more medical resources, isolation facilities, and systems in place to detect early cases.
Even at this stage, that's not an impossible task. Nigeria is succeeding in checking the spread of the disease. It has not had a new case of Ebola in over a month.
But I'm worried about America. I'm not worried about Ebola. I'm worried about our confidence and courage.
Every time a global crisis arises these days -- the drug war in Latin America, terrorism in the Middle East, climate change that's straining global food and water supplies and threatening many parts of the world with flooding -- the knee-jerk response of some Americans is to stop it at our borders.
As if we have the option. As if we live on another planet.
What's wrong with us? We never used to blink at taking a leadership role in the world. And we understood leadership often required something other than drones and bombs.
We accepted global leadership not just for humanitarian reasons but also because it was in our own best interest. We knew we couldn't isolate ourselves from trouble. There was no place to hide.
After World War II, we rebuilt Europe and Japan. Belatedly, we achieved peace in Kosovo. We almost eradicated polio. We took on tuberculosis, worldwide.
Now even Cuba is doing more on the ground in West Africa than we are. It's dispatching hundreds of doctors and nurses to the front lines. The first group of 165 arrived in Sierra Leone in the past few days.
Where are we?
We're not even paying attention to health crises right under our own noses.
More people are killed by stray bullets every day in America than have been killed by Ebola here. More are dying because of poverty and hunger.
More American kids are getting asthma because their homes are located next to major highways. One out of three of our children is obese, at risk of early-onset diabetes.
We're not even getting a flu shot to all Americans who need one.
Instead, we bicker. For the last eight months, Republicans have been blocking confirmation of a Surgeon General.
Why? Because the President's nominee voiced support for expanded background checks for gun purchases, and the National Rifle Association objected.
We've got to get our priorities straight. Media outlets that are exploiting Ebola because they want a sensational story and politicians using it to their own ends ought to be ashamed.
Public fear isn't something to be played with.
There's a huge job to be done, here and abroad. Let's roll up our sleeves and get on with it.

Barack Obama extends Diwali greetings to people across the worldBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:28 am
US President Barack Obama greeted Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists across the world on the occasion of Diwali, saying it was a chance to remember that even in the midst of darkness, light will ultimately prevail.
“I want to wish a Happy Diwali to all those who are celebrating the festival of lights here in the United States and around the world,” Obama said in his Diwali message yesterday.
In 2009, Obama became the first US president to celebrate the festival, a time of rejoicing for many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and across the world.
“For Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists, lighting the lamp – the diya – is a chance to remember, even in the midst of darkness, that light will ultimately prevail. Knowledge will defeat ignorance, and compassion will triumph over despair,” he said.
“Diwali is also a reminder that we must each do our part to achieve that victory, by dedicating ourselves to service to others. If we affirm our commitments to one another and strive to lift each other up, then together, we will continue moving closer to that brighter future we all seek,” he said.
America is a great and diverse nation, strengthened by the contributions of its entire people, he said, adding, he was proud to host the first Diwali celebration at the White House in 2009.
“Since then, we’ve continued to mark this holiday to honour the rich traditions that define the American family. And I know Michelle and I will never forget the wonderful time we had celebrating Diwali in Mumbai with food, dancing, and the company of friends,” Obama said.
“So, to all the families gathering together this Diwali to reflect on all the blessings of the past year, I wish you a joyous celebration and Saal Mubarak,” said the US President.
This year Secretary of State John Kerry would host the annual Diwali celebration of the Obama Administration.
It would be held at the historic Benjamin Franklin Room of the Department of State.
Kerry will be joined on stage by the Indian Ambassador to the United States S Jaishankar, the State Department said yesterday.
Following their remarks, Kerry and Jaishankar will light a traditional Diwali oil lamp.
A local Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple will preside over the ceremonial lighting and will drape Kerry with a traditional shawl.
In his remarks Kerry will celebrate the important contributions Indian and South-Asian Americans have made to the United States, and highlight the State Department’s commitment to human dignity, compassion, and service – a commitment that is at the heart of all great faiths, a media release said.

Concern for Washington real estate: declining Metro commutersBy Jonathan O'Connell October 23 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Fewer riders are taking Metro downtown for work in the morning. (Photo by jahi chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
For 15 years, more and more people rode Metro. Ridership increased an average of 3 percent annually, going from 150 million trips in 1996 to almost 225 million trips in 2009, according to the agency.
Growth came not only from the job gains Washington enjoyed during that period but rapid development near stations along the Green Line in the District, the Orange Line in Arlington and the Red Line in Montgomery County, among other places.
The growth came to a halt during the recession, but many assumed that it would restart once the economy recovered.
Instead, after plateauing, ridership resumed dropping  the past two years even as public transit usage nationwide reached record levels . Metro rail ridership is now almost at its 2005 level.
Metro is enduring a drop in ridership. (Courtesy WMATA)
Such declines concern Metro as it pushes for funding for its long-term improvements. What’s causing ridership to wane?
The agency’s staff raised a bathtub full of possible concerns for the drop-off in a recent report to the board , among them cuts to federal jobs, slow economic growth, a possible rise in teleworking, increased alternative work schedules, more bike commuters and the increased fares and track work that have driven some longtime Metro riders up the wall and maybe back into their cars.
In the report, Metro staff pointed out that recent surveys of federal workers found that more than 10 percent telecommute at least once a week. “Changing commute patterns, particularly in the form of telework and alternative work schedules, are an area of continuing investigation for Metro,” the staff wrote.
Declining ridership is also troubling for the real estate firms and developers that build and own offices near the stations, and of particular concern is a drop in the number of commuters who are taking Metro downtown in the morning.
The real estate services firm JLL looked at the number of morning passenger arrivals (pre-9 a.m.) at the system’s busiest stations, most of which are in or around downtown D.C. All but two of the stations saw declines in 2014 and the drop in Foggy Bottom, of 13.6 percent, was dramatic.

Total arrivals at downtown stations were still up slightly, at 1.7 percent, but JLL’s Brian Sullivan said that from a real estate perspective there is concern that teleworking policies — which have been talked about for a decade or more — are finally taking hold.
Walking, biking or driving to work is one thing, as those employees still need offices. But if you own an office building, employees not coming to work at all is quite another because their employers may decide they don’t need to lease as much space. Sullivan said it’s possible the drop-off “signals that the federal telecommute policies are taking hold, as fewer federal employees take Metro to work on a daily basis.”
“Real estate east of 15th Street caters more to supporting federal offices and we’ve been seeing steady declines in federal employment, so that would explain some of the changes,” Sullivan said.
Richard Barkham, chief global economist at the real estate services firm CBRE, said he sees a societal shift but toward the tech industry, not toward teleworking.
Workers at technology companies are pushing the growth in residential density that cities such as Washington have experienced in recent years, he said. More of them are walking or biking to work and fewer are clocking in from 9 to 5 at the office the way previous generations did.
“The big story in U.S. cities is densification,” Barkham said. “People are moving downtown because it’s very fashionable and very popular. I don’t think it’s threatening suburban living at the moment but it’s what young workers want to do.”
“I don’t think you should overstate teleworking,” he added. “People have talked about this for more than 15 years. When I was doing my PhD in the early ’80s … we were talking about it then. While people are more location-flexible, the more creative industries actually need more face-to-face time.”

Health minister: Mali confirms its first Ebola caseA volunteer receives the Ebola vaccination "cAd3-EBO-Z" at the vaccine center in Bamako, Mali, on Oct. 9. (Alex Duval Smith/EPA)
Mali's health minister confirmed Thursday  that the West African country has its first Ebola case.
Health Minister Ousmane Kone told state television Thursday that the patient is a 2-year-old girl in the Kayes region in the west of the country, Reuters reported. The girl recently came from Guinea, the minister added, which neighbors Kayes to the south.
"The condition of the girl, according to our services, is improving thanks to her rapid treatment," the minister said, according to the Reuters report. He added, "the sick child and the people who were in contact with her in Kayes were immediately identified and taken care of." 
According to the health minister, the patient's blood tested positive for Ebola after she was admitted to a hospital Wednesday evening, the AP notes .
Although the World Health Organization recently declared neighboring Senegal Ebola-free after a single case of the virus there, Guinea is one of three West African countries hit hard by the outbreak.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization has counted 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
The vast majority of those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Along with Senegal, the WHO has also determined that Nigeria is now Ebola-free.
There have been 4,877 confirmed deaths in the current outbreak.
Guinea alone has 1,540 cases of the disease and 904 deaths, according to the latest available figures from the WHO.

Demand concerns put pressure on base metalsDemand concerns put pressure on base metals
G Chandrashekhar
:  
The global base metals market is currently facing strong headwinds that impact price performance.
In 2012 and 2013, a combination of expanding liquidity, weakening dollar, China’s voracious appetite for consumption and slowly improving growth prospects helped a strong uptick in demand. Although selective, investor interest in base metals was healthy.
Things are different now. This year has not been a great one for metals market.
In recent months, some of the important drivers have reversed direction while new challenges have emerged. Shrinking liquidity following the US Fed’s tapering programme, a steadily firming dollar, slowing industrial production in some of the major economies and lower inflation expectations have combined to cap the upside and force market prices down.
Currently, macroeconomic risks are casting a shadow – concerns over growth being the most important.
There is apprehension of demand slowdown. As the mover and shaker of the world commodity market, China’s import and consumption of metals exert a profound impact.
With construction activity in the Asian major slowing, there are fresh concerns over metals’ demand growth.
Another reason is the high level of corporate debt in China.
Although inflation is under control and employment healthy, the Chinese government seems to be worried about corporate debt and has, therefore, asked State-owned enterprises to fund purchases through cash flow rather than on credit.
According to experts, the metals and mining sector in China is not in a good shape. Declining investment growth and falling property prices have generated fears that the 2015 GDP growth target may be lowered. There are demand concerns is other regions too. Although US recovery is back on track, global growth is still uneven. Demand in Europe and Japan is still fragile.
Of course, many emerging markets show signs of stabilising with activities being adjusted to global realities. The US Fed’s monetary policy normalisation is seen as another uncertainty as expectations differ about the timeframe. Geopolitical tensions may have somewhat receded, but the Russia-Ukraine stand-off and insurgency in Syria and Iraq can potentially create a turmoil.
Simply put, the global environment is full of strong pulls and pressures.
As a result, many commodities are trading close to their cost curve.
Some of the less-efficient producers have shut down. It has also prompted a cut in capacity expansion.
Collapsing metal prices deter fresh investment while investor risk appetite wanes.
Supply demand fundamentals have begun to assert themselves.
Exception
An exception to the general trend of falling base metals prices is nickel whose price surge has been triggered by Indonesian ban on export of unprocessed raw material. Zinc is another exception because of tightening supplies.
Despite all the uncertainties surrounding the base metals market, on current reckoning, nickel will turn out to be a winner next year followed at a distance by zinc.

Six Assam men held in Burdwan blast case sent to judicial custodyNSG commandos investigates Burdwan blast case at Badshahi Road, in Burdwan on Friday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:50 pm
Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras in IndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

Hero MotoCorp plans to launch 2 new models in next one year
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 17:  
Seeking to cash in on the fast growing scooter segment in the domestic market, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to launch two new models in the next one year.
The company is also considering to scale up its monthly scooter production capacity to 1 lakh units by January 2015 and 1.5 lakh units in the mid-term.
“In the next one year, there will be two new scooter models in the market,” Hero MotoCorp Senior Vice-President & CFO Ravi Sud told analysts in a conference call.
While he did not elaborate on the segmentation of the new scooters, Sud said it would add to the company’s existing models — Pleasure and Maestro — to accelerate growth in the scooter segment.
Domestic sales
Scooter sales in India grew 32.11 per cent during the April-September period at 21,90,351 units this fiscal against 16,57,920 units in the year-ago period.
In the first half of the ongoing fiscal, Hero MotoCorp had posted a growth of 5.52 per cent in scooter sales at 3,52,330 units against 3,33,889 units in the same period last fiscal.
Sud said that the company’s domestic scooter sales did not reflect the actual growth as Hero MotoCorp had committed its capacity to execute a one-time export order of 45,000 units by the beginning of November.
Production capacity
Seeing further growth in the scooter segment, the company would be enhancing its scooter production capacity.
“Currently we have a capacity to produce 80,000 units per month, which we are scaling up to one lakh units by January 2015. The consideration is to take it to 1.35-1.5 lakh units in the mid-term,” Sud said.
He said the one lakh scooters capacity would come from the existing plants of the company.
“When we increase it to 1.5 lakh units a month, it could also include the scooter capacity from the upcoming plant in Gujarat,” Sud said.
Currently, Hero MotoCorp produces its scooters from Gurgaon and Dharuhera plants.
Sales growth
He said scooter penetration in India is expected to increase to around 32-33 per cent from the current 27 per cent. Scooter sales growth has been urban-led where the penetration is 40 per cent, which can go up to 45 per cent.
The company has a total two-wheeler production capacity of 7.65 million units annually from its plants at Gurgaon, and Dharuhera in Haryana, Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Neemrana in Rajasthan. By next year, it would add another 1.8 million units annually when its fifth plant at Halol in Gujarat becomes operational.
The company is planning to set up its sixth plant in Andhra Pradesh.

Luxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sitesLuxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sites
Purvita Chatterjee
Cutting edge Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand.
Believe discounts will erode image
Mumbai, October 23:  
Even as pure play e-commerce sites bend backwards to offer deep discounts, some brands have been keeping away from the action, refusing to mark down their products.
Luxury and bridge-to-luxury brands such as Celio, Swarovski and Zegna are willing to jump onto the e-commerce bandwagon, but on their own terms. These brands feel that discounting would erode their premium image among consumers.
Calling the shots
“We should be in a position to control our prices so there will be no third-party sites. There are plans to start online transactions under our own site like we do worldwide, but there will be no discounts. Prices will be similar to our brick-and-mortar outlets,” says Sukanya Dutta Roy, MD, Consumer Goods Business, Swarovski India.
Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand. Its managers feel the brand should not be seen on pure play e-commerce sites.
Reliance Brands, too, has decided to stay away from selling most if its luxury brands on third-party Websites. “Mainstream consumers do not shop from luxury sites. We have limited e-commerce operations to just two of our brands like Quicksilver and Steve Madden. We have not yet taken a decision to bring the rest of our portfolio of brands on the e-commerce platform” says Darshan Mehta, CEO, Reliance Brands.
None of Reliance Brands’ iconic brands such as Timberland, Diesel, Ermenegildo Zegna and Paul & Shark are available on any Indian e-commerce sites as of now.
Given their premium offering, luxury brands insist that they do not like the idea of being treated like commodities. However, there are some international brands present on e-commerce sites. They do not have a choice, and are not allowed to go it alone because of the laws governing single-brand retail.
“We resort to third-party online sites to sell some of our products. We have to be FDI approved to start our own e-commerce operations,” explains Rajiv Nair, CEO, Celio Future Fashions. Though the brand is present on some leading Websites, Nair says: “Ideally, we would like to bring down discounts to a minimum. Once we have our own site, it will reflect the prices are offered at our brick-and-mortar stores.”
Touch and feel
Says Anjana Sharma, COO and Fashion Director, Stylista, a fashion portal: “Luxury brands are about experience, customisation, touch and feel… unlike the rest of the brands, which prefer to go online to get volumes.
Incidentally, most brands having their own e-commerce portals prefer to have similar prices as their offline counterparts. As Nair says: “Even the website belonging to Madura Garments has similar prices as their brick-and-mortar stores.”

10 Money Things You Must Know After 50reddit
Birthdays that mark a new decade tend to prompt personal reassessment: In your 20s, starting your career may have been your focus. In your 30s and 40s, maybe it was the big goals you wanted to reach with your family.
But by 50, you may already feel like you've got it figured out. You make a good salary, you've reached many of your life goals and your kids are on their way to independence.
But there are still a lot of money truths left to learn, especially as you're approaching your retirement years. Plus, times are changing: What was a financial truism in your youth may not be the reality now.
So we asked several CFPs to reveal 10 crucial things that could affect your money once you enter your 50s, both the bright spots and the potential pitfalls. Read on to see where you might need to be better prepared.
1. The cost of long-term care insurance
While it may not be the most pleasant thing to think about, how you plan to cover potential eldercare costs like a nursing home or a home health aide should be on your radar, stat. Long-term care insurance can help pay for so-called "custodial care" services like those, which are often not covered by Medicare -- but the longer you wait to buy a policy, the more expensive it's likely to be.
"It's something to start thinking about even prior to age 50," says Chuck Roberts, CFP®, founder and C.E.O. of Financial Freedom Planners in Richmond, Virginia. "It becomes more expensive as you grow older."
According to 2012 data from the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a couple taking out a policy at age 55 will pay an average of $2,466 a year, while a couple who waits until they're 60 will pay $3,381. But some health conditions -- a stroke or metastatic cancer, for example -- can make you ineligible to purchase such a policy in the first place. So it can be wise to look into a policy now, while you're in good health.
2. You're likely not going to stay an empty nester
Got grand plans to build a wet bar in your basement? Not so fast. "Unless [your child] is a shark on Wall Street, he may need some help from his parents," says Brian Mahany, CFP®, principal at Sustainable Financial Planning in Toledo, Ohio. "I am definitely seeing some parents converting their basements for their kids to live in."
Pew Research data reveals that the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living in "multigenerational" households rose from 11 percent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2010. And only 48 percent of these so-called Boomerang kids pay rent to their parents. "A great many parents feel honor-bound to help their children," says Mahany. "They're not giving their kids any kind of lease."
3. And you may still have to pay for your children's health insurance
Recent grads are having a hard time in the job market:  One study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that 44 percent of recent grads are underemployed, meaning that they work in jobs that don't require a college degree -- which also likely means they aren't getting the perks that a good job normally brings, like insurance.
On top of that, they are graduating with a lot of debt, which tends to leave little money left to cover their bills, let alone health care. "With the student debt load kids are carrying, I have seen more instances of parents bringing kids back into the family health plan," says Mahany.
According to Healthcare.gov , children under 26 may be eligible for coverage under their parents' health insurance plan even if they're married, not living at home and attending school. Keeping your kids on your insurance may only amount to a few extra dollars a month for you, but it's still an extra cost that you'll have to budget for -- on top of the fact that they've taken over the basement.

4. You should consider making credit card debt a thing of the past
"By the time you're 50, you should be out of revolving debt, such as credit card purchases," Roberts says. That money would probably be better off helping you prepare for retirement -- plus, when you're ready to enter your golden years, you don't want a debt burden during a time when you're no longer earning a salary.
Unfortunately, debt has been steadily rising amongst people of retirement age: According to recently released  research by the National Center for Policy Analysis, in 1989 the average credit card balance for people ages 65 to 74 was $2,100, compared with $6,000 in 2010.
If paying down credit card debt is something you still need to work toward in your 50s, you can use our checklist to help you get started.

5. It's a good time to start thinking about where you want retire
Especially if you don't plan on staying in your current home, you should ask yourself where you might want to settle down, whether it's a ranch house in Tucson or a condo in Miami Beach.
That's because where you eventually relocate will likely have an impact on how you're saving for retirement now. For example, you may need to ask yourself, "Do I really have enough to take on a new mortgage 15 years down the line? Does my current savings plan take into consideration a change in cost of living? How retiree-friendly -- or not -- is the state I'm thinking of moving to?"
And get as granular as you need to, even down to the type of home. "People should [even] think about what kind of house they want to live in: Is it a single story or multiple story?" Mahany says. All those details may help you determine what you'll end up paying for housing in your dream retirement locale.
6. Your life insurance needs may change
If your children are grown and independent, and if you have enough savings to provide for a spouse in the event of your death, you may decide that you no longer need as much term-life insurance coverage as you used to have, or you may need it only for a shorter period of time.
"In [your 50s], some of the heavy living expenses that life insurance provides for families in case of a premature death are lessened at that age," Roberts says, so it may be a good time to reassess what costs you'd need insurance to cover.
That's for term life insurance. Permanent life insurance -- like a whole life policy, for example -- has an added investment component that could potentially grow in value, and which you may be able to borrow against. Whether you decide to keep that type of policy will probably depend on whether you still see value in it as an investment vehicle, says William Bregman, a CFP® who practices in New York City.
For most people, however, term life insurance may be sufficient, and you can get coverage up until age 80. Whole life insurance generally is more often used if you're concerned about estate taxes or want to leave behind a legacy for your family. Because permanent life policies are often more difficult to understand -- and usually carry higher premiums -- it's important to consult with your insurance agent or a CFP® to determine whether a permanent life policy makes sense for you.

7. You don't have to worry about Social Security collapsing
Yes, the Social Security Administration has stated that , by 2035, taxes will be able to cover only 75 percent of scheduled benefits. But older Americans have a brighter Social Security future than their younger counterparts. "Confidence that Social Security will continue to provide benefits that are at least equal to today's value is higher among workers ages 45 and older than among younger workers," according to EBRI's 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey .
Why? Because even small tweaks to Social Security [policies] could secure it well into the future, according to Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist with the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at University of California, Berkeley. "Before the first Social Security check went out, people called for its demise, said it would fail," says Allegretto. "Yet not one person has ever had a missed Social Security check."
RELATED: Will Social Security Be Gone Before I Retire?
8. Retirement doesn't mark the end of your career
Even when you call it quits from your current job, your knowledge and experience could still be in demand -- and help earn you some additional money in your later years.
"I've had some nice good-news conversations with a client in his 60s, who found out he could retire right now if he wanted," says Roberts. "He's in the engineering profession and could easily do some additional consulting, which could add to savings."
Indeed if you've had a long career in the knowledge sector -- accounting, medicine, law, etc. -- you could very well extend your working years with a consulting side gig. According to 2013 data from the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 82 percent of Americans over the age of 50 expect to work in some capacity after retirement.

9. You can contribute more to retirement than you used to
Feel a little behind in your retirement savings? The good news is that turning 50 means you're eligible to make a "catch-up contribution" of $5,500 to your 401(k) plan. That's over and above the $17,500 that the IRS allows anyone younger than 50 to contribute to a 401(k) now.
You also get to play catch-up with your IRA too -- you can contribute an extra $1,000, for a total of $6,500.
10. It's never too late to save for retirement
"At 50 you can still take great advantage of compounding interest" in your retirement portfolio, says Roberts. He notes that while you may have a different asset allocation than you would have had at, say, 30, the fact is that  compound returns  take effect no matter when you start.
In fact, many financial planners complain about clients who don't seek help mapping out their retirement until they reach their 60s. "When anyone comes to me thinking about retirement by their 50s," says Mahany, "I'm very happy."

Ericsson s India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networksEricsson's India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networks
Our Bureau
Hans Vestberg
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson has reported a 56 per cent growth in revenues from India, making it the highest growing region for the company worldwide. Sales in India grew to 2 billion (SEK) Swedish Kronor or Rs 1,685 crore in the third quarter of 2014 from 1.28 billion SEK in the corresponding quarter last year. India, which accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s global revenue, now ranks number four behind the US, China, and Japan.
“Since the end of last year, sales in the region has recovered, mainly driven by an increase in operator capital expenditure spending in response to greater data uptake. The year-on-year growth in support solutions is driven by OSS and BSS and TV & media,” the company said.
(OSS and BSS are software solutions that enable telecom service providers to manage their networks, their business and their customer relations.)
Ericsson’s Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said the investment climate in India continues to improve.
The performance in India, China, West Asia and Russia helped Ericsson to grow its global revenue to 57.6 billion Swedish kronor ($7.94 billion) in the quarter, up 9 per cent from 53 billion kronor a year ago.

These six countries will be doomed if oil prices continue to fall
The collapse in oil prices is already a major cause of concern for countries heavily reliant on exports of the commodity. For some, it could be a matter of avoiding a severe recession, says a report from Business Insider.

For governments in oil-exporting countries to meet their spending commitments they need oil to remain above a certain price. With oil prices under $87 a barrel, countries that rely on high oil prices, including Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, may have a reason to be concerned.

Lack of volunteers affects homeschoolers in MyosreUpdated: October 25, 2014 18:50 IST

Education Dept. finds it difficult to get qualified teachers in Mysore, Hassan
The State government’s decision to appoint graduates as homeschooling volunteers has affected the future of children with special needs, as the Education Department is finding it difficult to get qualified teachers.
All these years, the department appointed persons who have passed second PU to teach homeschoolers. But last year, the government made degree a minimum qualification for appointment of volunteers.
As the authorities hardly find degree holders in rural places, many homeschoolers were being deprived of training.
Following feedback from Block Education Officers, the Deputy Director of Public Instruction had written to the government a few days ago seeking permission to allow the department to appoint those who have passed second PU.
DDPI H.R. Basappa told The Hindu here on Friday that there were no volunteers who have passed degree in most villages. A few candidates who have obtained degree go to industries or other places of work. It is highly difficult to get degree holders to work as teachers for homeschoolers, he said.
Under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, special children are given free transport and escort.
There were over 270 homeschoolers in Mysore district last year and the government had spent over Rs. 25 lakh for these children. While there was no paucity of funds to help special children, the department continues to face severe shortage of volunteers in rural areas.

WHO sends expert team to Mali after first Ebola diagnosis in the West African countryBy Abby Ohlheiser October 24 Follow @abbyohlheiser

The World Health Organization is preparing to send a team of experts to Mali after the country announced that it had its first Ebola case, a WHO spokesperson said Friday.
Mali's health minister said Thursday night that a 2-year-old girl who recently traveled from Guinea with her grandmother was admitted to a hospital in Kayes this week and tested positive for Ebola.
On Friday, WHO spokesperson Fadéla Chaib told The Post in an e-mail that four experts would travel to Mali as soon as possible to provide help with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing and social mobilization. "These functions need to be deployed within the next 24 hours," Chaib said.
The group will join a team of three WHO workers already in Mali, where they have been working on outbreak preparedness in the country since Oct. 19.
According to the WHO's statement on the case, the toddler's symptoms included a 102.2-degree fever, a nose bleed, bloody stools and a cough.
Chaib said the child first saw a health-care worker in Kayes, in the western region of Mali, on Monday. The next day, she was moved to the Fousseyni Daou Hospital and admitted to the pediatric ward.
Officials took samples from the patient on Wednesday, which were analyzed at the Bamako University Lab on Thursday. (An earlier statement from Malian officials said that the patient was admitted to a hospital on Wednesday.)
The WHO said that 43 contacts of the child have been isolated, including 10 health-care workers in Kayes. Local authorities are in the process of contact tracing and training personnel at the isolation site treating the child, the organization added.
In a second statement Friday, the WHO said that, based on an initial investigation, officials believe the grandmother traveled to a funeral in southern Guinea. The grandmother then returned to Mali on Oct. 19 with the child. The pair used public transportation.
"The case history revealed that bleeding from the nose began while both were still in Guinea, meaning that the child was symptomatic during their travels through Mali," the statement said. "Multiple opportunities for exposure occurred when the child was visibly symptomatic."
WHO officials are "seeking confirmation of media reports that the funeral was for the child’s mother, who is said to have shown Ebola-like symptoms before her death."
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
Mali is now the sixth West African country to record an Ebola case during the deadliest outbreak in history . The epidemic, whose death toll is rapidly approaching 5,000, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Nigeria and Senegal have also recorded cases.
Just hours before Malian health officials announced the diagnosis, WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said to reporters that the organization had "reasonable confidence right now that we are not seeing widespread transmission of Ebola into the neighboring countries," including Mali, Guinea Bissau and the Ivory Coast.
However, WHO hadn't ruled out the possibility of an Ebola case in Mali, as it was one of 15 countries identified as a "priority" by the WHO as the outbreak spread -- due in part to its proximity to the most severely affected regions. That's why, Chaib said, there was already a small WHO team in Mali before the first case was identified.

The Kayes region of Mali, where the first case was diagnosed, borders Guinea, one of three countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic. Guinea alone has recorded 904 Ebola deaths and 1,540 total cases of the disease, according to the latest figures available from the WHO .
In all, there are 4,877 confirmed deaths and 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
Two of those countries are now considered Ebola-free: Nigeria and Senegal. Senegal, which also neighbors Mali, had a single case of Ebola, also imported from Guinea.
Also on Friday, the WHO announced that "several hundred thousand" doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine will be available by the first half of 2015.

Socialist Party Pushing $20 Minimum Wage Defends $13-An-Hour Job Listingreddit
The Freedom Socialist Party has right - wing bloggers seeing red over a job listing that paid less than the group advocates for a minimum wage.
Earlier this month, the nonprofit posted listings on Craigslist and Indeed to advertise an opening for a part-time web designer. It offered to pay $13 an hour or more, depending on the designer's experience. That's well below the $20 minimum wage the party pushes for in its platform , and lower than the $15 wage it helped pass this year in Seattle. Right-leaning sites promptly seized on what they saw as hypocrisy.
But Doug Barnes, the party's national secretary, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that the group relies heavily on donations from low-wage workers and could not afford to pay much to an inexperienced designer.
"We're practicing what we're preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage," Barnes said, making his first public comment on the controversy. "But we can't pay a lot more than $13."
He said the party's revenues would increase if the minimum wage were raised to $20 -- and he'd even prefer $22, at least in Seattle. The city will begin phasing in a $15 minimum wage in April.
"Our donor base would all be affected, and the low-wage workers who support us with $5 to $6 a month would be able to give more," he said. "That would affect our ability to pay higher wages as well."
But Barnes said he removed the $13 starting wage from the Craigslist ad on Friday in response to the online criticism.
"The right-wing attack is very hypocritical," he said. "These are the same people who fought against the minimum wage and support companies like Walmart."
He said the Freedom Socialist Party, which was formed in 1966 as a revolutionary feminist breakaway group from the United States Socialist Workers Party, does not accept donations from corporations.

India firmly on the radar for HyundaiIndia firmly on the radar for Hyundai
Murali Gopalan
Hot seller The i20 elite has caught the fancy of the market and is a heavy contributor to Hyundai's sales.
The company clocked domestic sales of 4.44 lakh units for January-September
It was at the 1998 Delhi Auto Expo when Hyundai first made known its India intent with the unveiling of the Santro hatchback. This was the year when all eyes at Pragati Maidan were on the Tata Indica.
It was also the time when Suzuki Motor Corporation and its partner, the Indian Government, were locked in a bitter war-of-words.
There was a sense of enormous excitement coupled with fierce nationalism. This was thanks primarily to Tata Motors which was keen to show that India could also make its own car even while it had thrown open its gates to multinationals. The Indica was naturally the cynosure of all eyes at the Expo but nobody could ignore Hyundai either which, apart from the Santro, also had the Accent on display.
The numbers
Many Expos have come and gone at Pragati Maidan since then, but the Korean automaker is perhaps in the most exciting phase of its India tenure. Its recent launches comprising the Grand i10, Xcent and Elite i20 have caught the fancy of the market and are clocking over 20,000 units between them each month.
The entry model, Eon, has settled to a routine of nearly 7,000 units while the old warhorse, Santro, comfortably does around 4,000 cars.
On Thursday, Hyundai declared its third quarter results in Seoul where India clocked sales of 4.44 lakh units for the January-September period.
The i10 was the largest selling model with 2.12 lakh units followed by the i20 with 82,000 and the Eon with 74,000 units. Other models including the Santro, Xcent etc chipped in with the balance 76,000 units.
Sure, Maruti continues to be the market leader with monthly numbers averaging over one lakh units thanks to a host of successful models such as the Alto, Wagon R, Swift, Dzire and the more recent Celerio. It is equally true that the company has faced no threat to its numero uno status for many years now.
Yet, what is interesting about Hyundai is a new sense of energy and determination within its system. The new products (i10, Xcent and i20) have been loaded with features which have caught the attention of the market in a big way. “In terms of styling and design, Hyundai is making a strong statement which young buyers are finding incredibly hard to resist,” a top auto executive says.
Will this be enough to upset the Maruti applecart during the course of this decade?
Very unlikely given that the Japanese automaker is not being remotely complacent even for a minute.
Aware that it is still associated with the small car imagery, Maruti has been working on ideas like AMT (automated manual transmission) on its Celerio and more recently, the Alto. The Ciaz will show if the company can make a strong mark for itself in the sedan segment.
Hyundai also has competition from Honda which has staged a strong comeback with the Amaze, new City and the Mobilio multipurpose vehicle.
“The Xcent has made a bigger impact than the Amaze and Hyundai will now have to replicate this with the Verna against the City,” an industry observer says.
Why is Hyundai making news now when it has already proved that it is Maruti’s closest rival?
After hitting paydirt with the Santro and Accent in the late-1990s, the Getz and Elantra did not quite set the market afire.
And even as numbers continued steadily, there was really no excitement on the product front.
Bad timing
As an entry-level option, the Eon was an interesting product from the Hyderabad R&D centre but was unfortunate to be launched when the country was in the mist of a diesel buying craze three years ago. With petrol back in favour now, the car has made up lost ground.
Global conundrum
Unlike Suzuki which, apart from Japan, has India and ASEAN as its key growth regions, Hyundai is well and truly a global company with a presence in the US, Europe, China and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) regions. In the process, it becomes doubly difficult for the company to focus exclusively on countries such as India when other parts of the world, especially the West, are far more profitable markets.
This is a challenge that Toyota also faces except that Hyundai has rediscovered its mojo a lot faster in India.
Going forward, the company will launch a compact SUV here while building the base for exports to West Asia and Asia-Pacific.
And even while it focuses on important global projects such as the electric vehicle (planned with Daimler) which debuts in Europe next year, Hyundai will now step up the gas in a big way in India.

The other Italian stallionItalian racer: Benelli, like Moto Guzzi and Ducati, invested heavily into competition biking, including MotoGP. SHUTTERSTOCK
One of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers comes with a legacy of competition racing
It just so happens that some of the biggest names in motorcycling have had their beginnings in other things – Ducati’s founders began with radio components and Suzuki saw its origins in a loom company. MV Agusta was the offshoot of an aviation company, and the man behind KTM first dabbled with metal works.
There are also some that started out as arms producers, such as BSA and Royal Enfield, and companies such as Husqvarna and Aprilia started off as bicycle makers. But then there are names that have always dived straight into serious motorcycling, and more often than not, these names have achieved cult status around the world.
While Norton and Triumph may be the most recognised British motorcycle brands of the yesteryears (the latter still thrives though) and responsible for shaping modern motorcycling in a big way, Italian manufacturers Ducati, Moto Guzzi and Benelli can be held responsible for making competition motorcycling big in Europe. Benelli was mostly a family affair – ‘Benelli Garage,’ as it was called in the beginning, was jointly operated by six Benelli brothers from 1911. The Garage mostly worked with repairing and manufacturing motorcycle parts, but it took just about ten years of garage-work for the brothers to come up with their own motorcycle, 'Velomotore', in 1921. It was a 75cc single cylinder that was made to fit on a bicycle frame.
But the first ‘real’ motorcycle to roll out of the Benelli Garage was the Benelli 175, the number denoting the engine’s capacity in cubic centimetres. Up to the beginning of WWII, Benelli made a lot of motorcycles, from 175cc to 500cc, mostly Turismo and Sport models. Benelli’s rich competition history began with one of the 6 Benelli brothers, Antonio, or ‘Tonino’ (also referrerd to as ‘the Terrible’). Between 1927 and 1969, with a handful of Italian and international riders, Benelli clinched more than 1000 titles in different Italian and European championships.
Right after the war, like many European automobile companies, Benelli found success with lightweight, economical and inexpensive machines that the working man could afford to own. Apart from the lightweights, Benelli also produced the Tornado, a 650cc twin-cylinder bike, known well for its massive power delivery.
But the onslaught of Japanese motorcycle companies in Europe caused many local manufacturers to shut shop, and Benelli was affected by the big-engined Hondas the same way as Triumph or Nortons. Benelli did fight back, and created the Sei, with a massive 6-cylinder, 750cc engine (which later evolved into a 900cc).
 The company made motorcycles up to the late 80s, but never really got the numbers as the other surviving European motorcycle brands. It was only in 2001 that the Benelli brand was truly reincarnated with the Tornado 899cc Limited Edition and subsequently the Tornado Naked Tre (TNT) and Tre-K. The company now offers in-line three or four cylinder motorbikes from 600 to 1131cc, including the 155bhp plus TNT1130R.

We see stronger revenue growth during the second half: Wipro CEOTweet
TK Kurien
Wipro, the country’s third-largest software services exporter, posted a revenue growth that matched the lower end of its guidance in the second quarter of this fiscal, making it the weakest performer among its peers Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech. In an attempt to bolster its performance, Wipro is trying to become more aggressive in the marketplace. In an interaction with BusinessLine, CEO TK Kurien said that the second half of FY 2015 would see better growth for the company. Excerpts:
The September quarter tends to be strong for IT players. Why has yours been weak?
For us, the strongest quarters are really Q3 and Q4, which is how it has been historically. In constant currency, we have delivered 3 per cent growth in revenue, which is not bad. Unfortunately, we got hit more because of currency than others. While others had around a 0.6 percentage point hit, we were hit by 1.2 percentage points. In the third quarter, we expect to do much better, and we have guided for 2-4 per cent revenue growth. I don’t see too many negative surprises from the currency part in the October-December period. There has been subdued growth due to our top clients in the banking and energy spaces. However, both banking and energy will bounce back in the next quarter.
Global infrastructure services have been strong for you for some time now. Where is the demand coming from?
A lot of demand is coming from transformational deals. These include data centre transformation, end-user computing transformation and network transformation deals.
You talked about execution to ensure growth. Have you augmented your hunting team, which looks for new deals?
Execution involves the entire company and many other activities. We have hired about 10-12 people in the hunting team, which now stands at 162 people, this quarter.
In which segments would you like to expand Wipro’s footprint?
The biggest challenge for us is to get accounts in some industry verticals where we don’t have a play at all. For instance, we are a two-bit player in insurance, where there are a lot of application development and maintenance deals. We need to break into it. Insurance and auto are sectors where we would like to become a much larger player. Our biggest task is to work on making sure our portfolio is balanced effectively.
How would you describe your leadership style?
My leadership style is not to get rid of people but to take people along. As the world changes outside, how quickly can the internal organisation change to deal with the external stimuli — that’s my role as a CEO. I have 2-3 critical priorities that can change the shape of the organisation. I want everybody to focus on those and am maniacal about getting those priorities in place. The rest of the time I give people plenty of flexibility to operate and do what they want.
The biggest issue large organisations have is leadership. Leadership is about vision, courage and execution. Most leaders who succeed have plenty of courage. My biggest contribution is to offer my people courage, because if you believe in something you should go ahead and do it without seeking permission to do it. Large swathes of management are extremely permission driven. I joke within the company and say, if you do something wrong, at worst, we will fire you not shoot or kill you.
The ability to take risks is what a lot of leaders don’t necessarily understand. I believe if you don’t take a risk and don’t fail, you will never succeed. I have failed hundreds of times in my life, but every time I have failed I have learnt. The only thing is not to make the same mistake twice — that is stupidity.

Honda ups ante to beat Bajaj in bike salesUpdated: October 23, 2014 23:44 IST
Honda ups ante to beat Bajaj in bike sales
G. Balachandar
company information
Even as Bajaj Auto is revamping its plans with new launches, Honda has been steadily increasing its bike volumes to reduce the sales gap with the former.
With robust growth in its motorcycle sales over the past few months, Honda threatens to dislodge Bajaj, which has been struggling with falling sales, from its Number Two position by volumes in the bike market.
Even as Bajaj Auto is revamping its plans with new launches, Honda has been steadily increasing its bike volumes to reduce the sales gap with the former.
Aided by new launches and expansion of dealerships, Honda posted 21 per cent rise in its total bike sales at 9.07 lakh units during the first-half of this fiscal, while Bajaj saw its bike volumes fall by 12 per cent at 9.52 lakh units. So, Bajaj’s sales are higher by just 45,000 units than Honda’s as of September 30, 2014. But, in a year-ago period, Baja’s bike sales were higher by 3.27 lakh units.
In the 110cc-and-below segment, Honda increased its volumes to about three lakh units from 2.55 lakh units a year-ago, while Bajaj has seen a drop to 4.58 lakh units from 5.75 units.
In the above-110cc-to-125cc segment, Honda surpassed the sales of Hero with 31 per cent rise at 4.60 lakh units and became leader in the category. Bajaj saw a significant drop in sales to 82,269 units from 1.57 lakh units a year ago.
The festive season has also brought cheer to Honda to support its dream ride in two wheeler sales. It has claimed to achieved highest ever Dhanteras sales of 1.65 lakh units when compared to 78,000 units last year. It also saw a strong rise in sales of its dream series bikes (comprise Dream Yuga, Dream Neo and CD 110 Dream) with sales of 45,000 units.
With current growth rate, Honda may surpass the sales of Bajaj in the next few months and become the Number Two player in bike segment. Honda is already a leader in scooter segment with about 55 per cent share. Hero is the leader in bike segment with a wide margin.
With festive boost, Bajaj sold more bikes than Honda in September this year though its monthly sales were lower than volumes of September 2013.

The #1 Dumb Thing Businesses Do to Hurt Themselvesreddit
If you really want to hurt your business, ignore what your customers want. Let me give you a few examples of this stupid business trick in action.
If you're a seafood fan like me, chances are you've eaten at Red Lobster. A couple years ago, I noticed the quality of service sharply decreased. It turns out, in their never-ending quest to cut costs, the owners eliminated all busboy positions and demoted many of the servers. In addition to bussing their own tables, servers now had to take on four tables at a time instead of three. The leadership did so after convincing themselves, somehow, that both the wait staff and the customers approved. Actually, they didn't. People got sick of waiting for clean tables and meals, and started voting with their feet. Less than a year later, Red Lobster rescinded the policy, and business has picked up since.
Downsizing can be deadly, and not simply because it overworks the surviving employees, but because it can lower your ability to respond to customer needs. You may have read my previous discussions of Circuit City's suicidal decision to save money by replacing commission-based sales personnel with minimum-wage newbies who didn't know the difference between a USB port and an Ethernet plug.  People stopped buying, and Circuit City died an ignominious death. Leadership forgot that while labor is your biggest expense, your employees are your greatest asset.
Borders couldn't adapt to the e-book phenomenon customers were demanding, whereas Barnes and Noble embraced it wholeheartedly. Borders eventually went the way of the buggy-whip makers who thought horseless carriages were a passing fad. Speaking of passing fads, wasn't that what the old Bulletin Board Services called the Internet? When was the last time you dialed into a BSB? (Do you even remember them at all?)
Netflix also ignored customer desires to their peril. They started out by mailing DVDs to subscribers, then added online video streaming. Eventually, Netflix decided to split the services into different two companies, despite the outcry against it. They stuck to their guns, making ready to spin off the DVD mailing as Quickster. They even hiked their fees...then, just as Quickster was almost a reality, they killed it. Those who had gotten used to the idea were outraged again. Once the brouhaha calmed down, Netflix finally stopped reloading the gun they kept shooting themselves in the foot with.
Bottom line: keep your ear to the ground, do what your customers love, and make changes that follow their desires.

The Bottom Line on Climate Change Costsreddit
The recent  report published by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , an organization aimed at helping the world's societies to combat the effects of climate change, suggests that the costs of combating climate change are considerably lower than widespread opinion has suggested. This new analysis is considered to be a real game changer in how we perceive and act on remedies for polluting the planet.
The analysis cuts to the heart of climate deniers contentious arguments that an overhaul of the fossil fuel industry will cream our economy. Not so.
The study tells us that between 2015 and 2030, nations are expected to invest roughly $90 trillion in urban, land-use and energy infrastructure. The report suggests that implementing the fixes necessary to transition to entirely sustainable sources of energy would amount to  4 trillion.  So, this amounts to 5% increase of the total amount that is estimated to be spent on new power plants, transit systems, and other infrastructure over the same period. While economically feasible, the report's recommended changes are expected to face a tough political reception.
The report outlines the plunging costs of renewable energy and point to solar technology costs which have been cut in half since 2010. Meanwhile, it paints the compelling argument, known for quite some time that limiting urban sprawl and deforestation are essential steps in combating climate change.
It's going to require the cooperation of countries to cease subsidies for fossil fuels and transition to renewable sources of energy alongside the adoption of a wide variety of initiatives to encourage--for instance-- more efficient land use and fighting forest fires.  Add to this, consistent and credible government policies  signals, which  are essential for businesses and investors to create jobs, growth and spur innovation.
Additional specifics deal with the implementation of a carbon tax and enabling the growth of alternative energies.  An investment is required of public infrastructure and is key to moving forward successfully. Another aspect is increasing the encouragement of low carbon innovators thru patents, public spending, and alternative energy research and production.
Action suggested by the report will require long years of hard work and an optimistic vision for  the future, but its authors argue that these practices currently have real world proof in major metropolitan centers all over the world. So, a greener tomorrow is just on the horizon, but it's all dependent on how willing we are to embrace it now.

After video controversy  senior Marine is now helping Chicago youthBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe
Now-retired Marine Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown here in 2007 while receiving a Bronze Star with V medal for heroism while deployed in Iraq. He retired amid controversy earlier this year after getting in an altercation that was depicted in a viral video, and says he has moved on with life. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron Rooks/ Marine Corps)
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie was a well-respected senior member of the Marine Corps when he came across something at the gates of Parris Island, S.C., that infuriated him: a man protesting while wearing the iconic “campaign cover” hat meant for drill instructors who are on base training future Marines.
The ensuing June 5 incident escalated quickly — and was captured in a video that went viral online. It showed Archie, wearing his desert tan utility uniform, going toe-to-toe with Ethan Arguello, a former drill instructor who was protesting the controversial U.S. decision to exchange five Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who went missing in Afghanistan in 2009.
No punches were exchanged, but Archie could be seen getting close enough to Arguello to knock the cover off his head. Archie snatched it as it fell, and then stormed back to his black Jeep Sahara and drove away.
“You’re about to get locked up!” Arguello yelled.
As noted in this Checkpoint post at the time , Archie resigned a short time afterward and was charged with assault. Marines and veterans, meanwhile, debated whether Archie was wrong for confronting Arguello, and whether Arguello was violating the spirit of Marine Corps tradition by wearing the campaign cover out of uniform.
There’s more to the story, however. Archie, in his first comments since the controversy, said Thursday that he was asked to retire by the senior enlisted member of the Marine Corps within days of the incident.
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown in this Marine Corps photograph in February 2014, after taking over as the sergeant major at Parris Island, S.C.
He declined to use his name, but he is Sgt. Maj. Mike Barrett. Archie added that he did not feel like his chain of command at Parris Island was inclined to keep him, either.
“He told me, ‘Paul you know you were wrong. You need to step down and resign before your chain of command needs to decide,’ ” Archie said of Barrett’s direction. “I kind of figured that was coming. I’d been let down before, but this time I was really let down.”
Barrett could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Gunnery Sgt. Chanin Nuntavong, said the contents of the conversation between the two sergeants major should stay between them, but he confirmed they spoke at the time of the video.
Brig. Gen. Lori Reynolds, then the commanding general at Parris Island, addressed the issue in an interview with the Island Packet newspaper in June. She said that Archie was a great Marine worthy of emulation by others, but that his leaving was “about a very high standard, and that’s what we’re looking for from all our Marines.”
Archie, who served more than 25 years and earned a Bronze Star with V for heroism in Iraq, has moved on. The charges against him were dropped earlier this month, and he has moved to Chicago with his family to take a job as a sergeant major with the Marine Leadership Academy , a public high school that has a military curriculum and a strong ROTC program.
“It’s a motivating environment, and you see kids grow daily,” Archie said. “I loved my time in the Marine Corps, but the writing was definitely on the wall that it was time for me to move on.”
Archie said that “it was a fall from a high-ranking billet” and that he wanted to serve a full 30 years before retiring, but that he won’t look back. He realizes he could have diffused the situation by stepping away when it escalated, he said, but felt that Arguello needed to be corrected.
“When I saw his temper going up, hindsight being 20-20, I should have just got in the vehicle and drove away before it just kept escalating,” he said. “That’s the only thing I would say. But I still stand behind, ‘I was doing something for the Marine Corps and the institution.’ I wasn’t doing something for my sole gratification. It was all about the Marine Corps, and what it stands for. I regret not cutting the conversation shorter, but I do not regret what I did.”

Power has been restored to most of IT units at Rushikonda hills
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 24:  
The IT sector in Visakhapatnam like the other sectors has suffered considerable damage due to Hudhud cyclone, but there is no need for any apprehensions on the long-term prospects and the State Government will extend full support to it in all forms, according to IT Minister P. Raghunadhra Reddy.
He said here on Friday that power had been restored to the IT units at Rushikonda hills and all the pending incentives and subsidies to the units would be quickly given. "We will also make efforts to get the insurance claims of the companies cleared as quickly as possible. We are in touch with the insurance companies," he said.
He said the IT signature tower would be built on the Rushikonda hill, as planned, and all efforts would be made to attract investments into the sector. "We invited several IT companies earlier this month and nearly 400 of them responded. Several of them are positive about setting up units and starting operations here. There is no blow to the brand image of Visakhapatnam as an IT destination," he said.
According to the IT entrepreneurs, power was restored to the units on the Rushikonda hills only on Deepavali night and still some units were waiting for it. B. Gopi, of the Sankhya Technologies, said power had been restored to his unit only on Thursday night. "We have resumed operations on a small scale on Friday. Still, some of the IT units are waiting for power restoration," he said.
He said his company had put up a claim for Rs 77 lakh and so far two surveys had been conducted and yet the damage had not been accurately assessed. "We are waiting for another qualified surveyor to arrive at the spot and make a final assessment. In spite of the Chief Minister's clear directive that the process should be expedited and multiple surveys avoided, it has not yet resulted in any concrete action," he complained.
He wanted the insurance companies to understand the gravity of the situation and respond quickly.

Rejoinder to Sherif Girgis on sex discrimination and same-sex marriageBy Ilya Somin October 24
Political theorist Sherif Girgis has written a thoughtful response to my critique of his argument that laws banning same-sex marriage should not be subject to the same heightened scrutiny as other legislation that discriminates on the basis of gender. The response helpfully clarifies Girgis’ position, but fails to fix its shortcomings.
I. Sexism and the motivation for excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage
Early in his response, Girgis disclaims reliance on the common argument that laws banning same-sex marriage are different from laws banning interracial marriage because, while the latter are motivated by racism, the former are not motivated by a desire to promote “male supremacy.” I appreciate the clarification and am sorry if I misinterpreted his earlier reference to this argument as an endorsement of it. But if supposed lack of sexist motives does not distinguish laws banning same-sex marriage from other forms of gender discrimination, this weakens the case for exempting them from heightened judicial scrutiny.
Moreover, as I noted in my earlier post, the issue of motive cuts against Girgis’ position in another way: sexism was historically one of the reasons for excluding same-sex relationships from marriage recognition in the first place. Same-sex relationships were excluded from marriage and often subjected to persecution in large part because their participants did not conform to traditional sex roles and were seen as a potential threat to male dominance. The presence this motive does not by itself prove that discriminatory marriage laws should be struck down by courts. It also does not mean that everyone opposed to same-sex marriage is automatically a sexist. But it further undermines the case for subjecting legislation banning same-sex marriage to a lower standard of review than other sex-discriminatory laws. In modern jurisprudence, even laws that are formally gender-neutral or race-neutral are subjected to heightened scrutiny if they were enacted in large part out of racist sexist motives . This principle applies with even greater force to laws that are not gender-neutral at all, because, as Girgis himself puts it , they “involve.. treating sex as Virginia’s ban [on interracial marriage] in Loving had treated race.”
II. Is there a unique “conceptual” connection between between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction? Does it matter if there is?
Girgis also tries to clarify his central argument for exempting laws banning same-sex marriage from heightened scrutiny, its connection to reproduction:
When a policy’s form triggers extra scrutiny, again, judges pivot to examining its justifications: the state’s reasons for thinking that the classification is sufficiently linked to a legitimate interest….
But my point was that in the case of a law classifying by sexual composition—by male-female pairing—the law’s form itself already points to its own link to the common good, apart from mere social conventions, or merely contingent data about men and women. So the justification of this classification begins to appear at the first, “formal” stage of analysis….
neither (a) reproduction nor (b) its social value nor (c) its link to the male-female pairing is just a social construct….
Likewise, my argument isn’t undermined by Somin’s objection that “adoption and artificial insemination” make “same-sex marriage . . . also closely connected to reproduction.” Neither adoption nor reproductive technology weakens the conceptual link tying male-female union to reproduction. So they do not justify a judicial presumption against classifications based on the male-female pairing. Even finding ways to make children out of two ova or two sperm cells wouldn’t cut that link. It would only mean that, while male-female union has a conceptual link to reproduction, other groupings could have a contingent, technologically enabled link. The latter (unlike the male-female) link would require inquiry into empirical data; and it wouldn’t be limited to same- or opposite-sex couples, but any group of adults deciding to produce and rear children.
None of this provides a good reason to treat laws banning same-sex marriage differently from other laws that discriminate on the basis of gender. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is important to emphasize that an opposite-sex relationship is neither necessary nor sufficient for reproduction to occur. Many opposite-sex couples are unwilling or unable to reproduce by standard biological means (e.g.- because of age or sterility). Conversely, reproduction and child-raising can and do occur in same-sex relationships. Girgis makes much of the fact that “male and female are defined with respect to the physical potential for… reproduction.” But potential for reproduction is not the same thing as reproduction itself. The connection between potential and actuality is, in Girgis’ terms, a merely “contingent” one.
Moreover, legal status of marriage is not and never has been limited to those couples who are willing and able to engage in conventional biological reproduction. There is of course a high correlation between marriage and biological reproduction. But that connection, although strong and important, is also “social” or “contingent” rather than “conceptual.” Or, if it can be considered conceptual despite the fact that it is not an inevitable link, then the same goes for the connection between same-sex marriage and reproduction.
It is also worth noting that, as a social good, reproduction cannot be separated from child-raising. The latter is the main purpose of the former. And even if same-sex relationships had no direct connection to reproduction whatsoever, they still clearly can and do facilitate child-raising. Including them in the institution of marriage enhances same-sex couples’ ability to raise children in a variety of ways .
Finally, even if there was a conceptual connection between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction in some strong sense of the term that does not apply to same-sex couples, this still would not justify exempting laws excluding the latter from heightened judicial scrutiny. The whole point of heightened scrutiny is to ensure that the gender classification in question really is necessary to advance the interest in question, and that there is not a comparably effective gender-neutral way of achieving the same goal. The need to conduct that inquiry is not obviated by the existence of a “conceptual” connection. In this case, the ability of opposite-sex marriage to facilitate reproduction and child-raising is in no way impaired by extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. In states where same-sex marriage exists, opposite-sex couples can still reproduce and raise children, and the institution of marriage can still facilitate those activities.

Assam Muslims for speedy  unbiased probe into jihadiactivitiesPrint

With the Assam Police widening its net to apprehend persons having links to jihadi groups including the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a group of leading Muslim citizens of Assam today urged the government to carry out speedy but unbiased investigations into such activities in the state. It also asked the government to mete out stringent punishment to those found guilty.
“The Muslims of Assam do not support any kind of terrorist activity and strongly condemns any kind of terrorist activity carried out in the name of jihad,” a resolution adopted in a meeting of leading Muslim citizens of the state said here today. The group also called upon all right-thinking Muslims and such organizations to intensify public opinion against such anti-national and terrorist activities.
Presided over by veteran journalist Haider Hussain, the meeting also asked the government to take care so that the entire Muslim community was harassed due to suspicion as an outcome of anti-national activities carried out by a handful of persons who have gone astray. “The Muslim community should also remain alert against elements that might drag members of the community into anti-national and criminal activities by taking advantage of their socio-economic backwardness,” the group in an appeal issued here today said.
Interestingly, even as the Assam Police have arrested six Muslim persons from Barpeta district on October 10 for their alleged links with JMB, a section of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) leaders have said that those arrested should not be labeled as terrorists until proven guilty in a court of law. They has also alleged that the Congress government in the state had hatched a conspiracy to brand Muslims as jihadis.

Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing businessrankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters

The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

The man suspected of shooting dead a Canadian soldier on Wednesday had sought a Libyan passport in recent days but had been unsuccessful, an official at the Libyan embassy in Ottawa said on Friday.
“Even if your father was born in Libya, there are many documents that are required in order to get a passport. It is not easy,” said the official, who refused to give his name.
The suspected shooter, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a Canadian citizen who may also have held Libyan citizenship, Canadian police said on Thursday.

Premature to talk of US troop cuts in Asia: JohnKerrySecretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops.

Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops stationed in Asia and South Korea, amid increased tensions on the heavily guarded peninsula.
The top US diplomat insisted before any such moves could happen North Korea must first show a serious commitment to rejoining six-party talks on ending its suspect nuclear program.
Asked after meeting his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se whether Washington would consider reducing its military presence in Asia if North Korea returned to the stalled nuclear negotiations, Kerry ruled out the idea.
“The mere entering into talks is not an invitation to take any actions regarding troops or anything else at this point. It would be way too premature to have any thought, or even discussion” along those lines, Kerry said.
“The only purpose of entering the talks is to come to an understanding regarding first the denuclearization and then following the denuclearization obviously whatever relationship might be appropriate.”
He also ruled out any idea of visiting isolated North Korea and meeting leader Kim Jong-un in the near term. Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic ties.
Yun said South Korea was awaiting a “clear stance” on Pyongyang’s nuclear policy and “a halt to the sophistication of its nuclear weapons.”
“All of this has to be real. It has to lead to real solutions,” Yun said.

Till a few years ago, this ancient and historic banyan tree spread over five acres at Paidimadugu village of Korutla mandal in Karimnagar district on the banks of the picturesque Godavari, was not known to many people.
Thanks to the Tourism Department, which declared it an ancient and tourist destination in the district, the banyan tree got some prominence on the tourism map of Telangana State. Though there are no adequate facilities, a huge number of visitors throng the tree, stated to be 500 years old, during weekends and vacations.
People believe that the goddess Mahalaxmi temple constructed under this huge tree brings prosperity to the visitors. This has earned the tree the name ‘Bakthuka Marri.’ Historians say the idols of Ganesha and goddess Nagini belong to the 10th century.
A rivulet flows from east to west of the tree, which, people say, is a rare thing. It is believed that devotees should first take a dip in the rivulet to be cleansed of their sins. There is also the popular belief that people bitten by rats would be cured if they take a dip in the rivulet.
Official plans to beautify the location by going for landscaping and fencing around the tree and provide other facilities for the visitors continue to remain on the drawing board. A most worrisome aspect is that the tree, the cynosure of all eyes, is withering due to lack of care.
Those planning to have a look at the tree can take RTC buses to the village. Bus services are operated from Karimnagar, Jagtial, Vemulawada and other places. From the village, one would have to trek about two or three km to reach the banyan tree.
You would enjoy the drive from Hyderabad to this village as the road condition is excellent. Anyone packing bags?
