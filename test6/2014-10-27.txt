10 rules on the art of innovation  and the  genius of Steve Jobs0
Jump to the next curve. “Most institutions define themselves in terms of what they already do,” Kawasaki said. If companies were more forward-looking, their demise would become less likely. This doesn’t mean switching industries; it means delivering the same benefit through different mechanisms. Kawasaki said telegraph companies might still be around if they’d recognized their value in delivering messages and embraced the telephone.
DICEE. Kawasaki said the best products and services are deep, intelligent, complete, empowering and elegant. As an example, he mentioned the Ford MyKey device, which parents can program to prohibit teen drivers from passing a determined speed limit.
Get shipping. “If you wait for the perfect time, if you wait for the perfect product, you will never ship,” Kawasaki said. Riffing on a certain popular song, he said innovators often “don’t worry, be crappy.” That’s not to say he encouraged creators to sell junk, but to ship products that are innovative despite imperfections.
Let flowers blossom. Despite best efforts at branding, marketing or advertising, a company sometimes attracts the “wrong” customer. Instead of freaking out, Kawasaki recommends that companies ask those people why they’re buying the product, or why they’re using it in a way other than the company intended. That can lead to a new direction or a new life for the company.
Ignore the haters. Products such as TiVo, Macintosh and Android inspire adoration and ire. “I’m not telling you that you should intentionally piss people off, but I’m telling you revolutionary products tend to polarize people,” Kawasaki said. “It’s OK.”
Churn, baby, churn. The process of churning a product from 1.0 to 1.1 all the way to 2.0 and beyond is the hardest part of innovation, Kawasaki said. “You need to ignore what the customers are telling you because they can only tell you to revise the current curve,” he said. Only the people working on the product can know how to take it to the next level.
Marketing is simple. Companies should measure their products or services on their uniqueness and value. It’s OK to be low in uniqueness if you’re high in value, because then you can compete on price, Kawasaki said. But it’s best to be high in value and in uniqueness, because then you can charge a premium.
Perfect your pitch. Kawasaki said the perfect pitch features 10 slides, lasts 20 minutes and uses size 30 font. He gave even more importance to personalization. For example, when he pitched to a company in Turkey, he opened with a picture of him wearing a fez in Istanbul’s grand bazaar, which helped forge an immediate connection.

Heli-skiing: into the wildFirst tracks: round-up of the season’s developments
“In addition to the somewhat frivolous thrill of dancing down the hill, [the ski tourer] also seeks the aesthetic values inherent in the mountain country to which the ordinary skier is completely oblivious,” he enthused. “Ski touring takes us on to those mountains and slopes which we always look at from the top of our lifts and wish we were over there instead of here. It gives us the means to manifest our, however hidden and subconscious, desires to explore the distant, the new, the unknown, to be adventurers, to be able to throw back the shackles of our physical limitations and to go wherever our fancy urges us to go . . . ”
It was stirring stuff but there was more to come. For Gmoser was developing a new type of ski touring, in which the hard slog uphill would be removed by technology. “For uphill transportation for ski touring we need something with far more versatility and mobility than the most convenient types of ski lifts,” he told the instructors. “The machine to fit the bill is a helicopter.”
Finally, after six hours on the road, we emerge from the forests to see light streaming from the windows of a large building that’s strangely reminiscent of both an alpine chalet and an airport terminal. Inside, people are sitting at a long bar, playing cards by the fireplace and table-tennis in an adjacent games room. Having not even passed another car in the previous two hours, the sudden warmth, light and human contact are disorientating.
Hans Gmoser and his adventure-hungry acolytes were driven by the desire to escape into the wilderness
This is Monashee Lodge, the world’s largest heliski lodge and the newest in the portfolio of Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH), the company Gmoser founded. The lodge offers every comfort: there is a hot tub on the roof, a team of masseuses, a large wine cellar, a climbing wall, ski shop, business centre, library and 69 bedrooms. Guests are looked after by seven guides and 26 staff. It is a huge, five-star example of how far heli-skiing has come.
Today the sport Gmoser pioneered in 1965 has spread around the world: heli-ski operations have sprung up in far-flung mountain ranges from Alaska to India, in Chile, Turkey, Georgia, Sweden, Iceland and many other countries. CMH, though, remains by far the biggest operator, employing at least 120 mountain guides at its 11 bases in British Columbia.
Gmoser had begun experimenting with helicopters to access the mountains in the early 1960s but the first commercial “helicopter ski touring” trips (the word “heli-ski” had yet to catch on) took place over two weeks in April 1965. If our journey felt long, it was nothing to that of those first heliskiers, who reached the last section of road to their camp at 5pm but took nine more hours to cover the final 28 miles (“numerous times we were stuck in the mud, got rained upon and pushed the vehicles,” Gmoser later wrote). Accommodation was basic: the guests (six the first week, 12 the next, each paying $275) stayed in the plywood cabins of a disused sawmill camp, sleeping on iron beds in their sleeping bags. The guides, cook, pilot and mechanic slept on the floor of the kitchen building.
Heli-ski creator Hans Gmoser
In the morning, the helicopter would begin to ferry the skiers up the mountain, a lengthy task given that this was a slow, piston-engined Bell 47, which could only carry the pilot and two passengers. Women were taken last, to minimise their time waiting in the wind on the freezing mountainside. Each day they would make just one or two runs, often having to bushwhack back through the forest to camp, where they would gather in the kitchen to sing, play the instruments they had brought, drink and stay warm until going to bed at 10pm.
Halfway through the second week, the helicopter crashed. It was coming in to land when the landing gear sank into deep snow, causing a rotor to strike the ground. The three people on board managed to jump out before it burst into flames; all were shaken but unharmed, and the pilot was quickly dispatched to find a replacement machine to finish the week. But the risks and hardships of that first fortnight were matched by the thrill of discovery – of unskied slopes and a new way of reaching them. The first heliskiers went home, told their friends about their adventure, and Gmoser’s company never looked back.
. . .
Half a century later, we crouch down beside the lake in front of the lodge and wait for our lift. It is -20C, cold enough to make steam rise from the water; a family of bald eagles swoops in and out of trees by the shore. Then, a low rhythmic thud carried on the wind, oddly familiar from countless Vietnam war movies; it grows louder as the helicopter approaches.
The flimsy three-seaters used in the early days have long gone; this is a twin jet engine Bell 212, which will easily swallow our group of 10, as well as the guide and pilot. There’s a surge of adrenalin as it eases down from the sky, rotors furiously beating the air, skids just feet from our huddled group, its belly close enough that I can see every rivet. The guide slides back the door and we clamber in, rushing and struggling to strap safety belts over our bulky clothes. Then the helicopter gently lifts and turns, crossing the misty lake and climbing the steep, forested slope on the far side.
Coming in as an outsider, CMH feels like a tight-knit club, if not quite a cult. The other skiers in my group – indeed 90 per cent of those in the lodge – are indistinguishable thanks to their brightly coloured Gore-Tex skiwear, all of it branded with the CMH logo. Most of them have been coming for years, if not decades, often moving between different CMH lodges before settling on a favourite.
Skiers waiting for a Bell 212 to pick them up
In part their loyalty is due to a gimmick introduced in the early 1970s. Each night, the vertical distance each client has skied that day is posted on a board in the lodge, along with their cumulated lifetime total. Perhaps it’s something to do with the alpha-personality types who go in for this kind of holiday, and who can afford it, but in the CMH club, people really seem to take pride in this (utterly meaningless) figure, a badge of how much virgin snow they have defiled. Those who hit a million vertical feet are awarded a special CMH ski suit, presented after dinner in the lodge. My total after four days was just over 80,000ft; the frontrunner in the lodge that week had notched up a lifetime total over 26 million (he is so in thrall to the experience that he keeps a room at the lodge for the entire season).
It would be easy to mock – to bemoan how the original motivation of exploration and escape has been replaced by one of consumption and competition – were the whole thing not done in such warm North American spirit. The special suits are awarded in a sort of gang show (think shaving foam and dressing-up) designed to humiliate as much as honour the recipient. Dinner is eaten around large communal tables – a concept that ordinarily strikes terror into my English heart but which is a delight here thanks to the friendliness of the mostly US guests and the club-like atmosphere that prevails. After dinner and at the bar, people stand up to tell jokes and shaggy-dog stories that have been passed down between generations of guides and guests. Some of the punchlines might have been lost along the way but it’s hard not to be charmed. By the second night, everyone seemed to know my name.
. . .
This winter there will be numerous events to mark the 50th anniversary of the sport Gmoser created, including several “nostalgia weeks”, but the connection with the past seems to run strong through the whole operation. Despite the delights of the new lodge, many of those I talk to like to remember the early days before its construction, when they stayed in a basic hostel used by workers building a nearby hydroelectric dam. They recall leaking roofs and lumberjacks swinging punches – even the day the hostel caught fire is a topic for nostalgia, as is another helicopter crash. “The machine was on its side and filling up with fuel – I thought I was a dead . . . ” one man tells me with a grin. Didn’t that put him off? “Well it was the final week of the season anyway but I was back the next year.”
Monashee Lodge
Perhaps this is the key: despite the luxury and the special suits, this remains a genuine adventure. In all, 42 people have died skiing with CMH, the most recent being last winter. Given the size of the operation, it’s not a surprising figure – it represents approximately one death per 31,000 skier days – but the presence of risk, no matter how small the chance of being involved, changes the atmosphere, making everything more vivid. Safety briefings are taken seriously, guides are respected, guests build stronger bonds, après-ski is more celebratory.
And whether it’s a club or a cult, it’s one with a total commitment to a single central tenet, one that remains the same now as it was in 1965. Our helicopter lands at the top of a run called Nagel East, touching down in a clearing surrounded by blackened tree trunks, the survivors of a past forest fire. We jump out, huddle together once more as our guide unloads the skis, then watch as the helicopter peels away off the mountainside to get the next group, its frantic noise replaced by a crescendo of silence.
I plunge downwards . . . The feeling is somewhere between falling and flying, a delicious mania found at the outer limit of control
The guide leads and we follow in line, traversing at first, poling hard to get moving in the deep snow, passing through a glade of skeletal trees, before regrouping where the mountainside starts to fall away. The guide gives a list of safety instructions, then one by one we push off.
The skis accelerate rapidly and then, like a speedboat starting to plane, rise up and come alive, floating through the thigh-deep snow. Powder like this can be more than 90 per cent air – less dense than the froth of a cappuccino – and it is the only thing supporting me against gravity’s pull. I plunge downwards, weaving between the black trunks that are the only solid, vertical reference points in a mad world tipped on its side and awash with rushing snow and plummeting skiers. Some turns send up white waves that cover my face. The feeling is somewhere between falling and flying, a delicious mania found at the outer limit of control.
This is skiing’s “rapture of the deep” – potentially dangerous because it is so all-consuming, calling skiers to go faster, to abandon restraint, do anything to prolong the sensation. But it is wonderful too, the club’s motivation and lifeblood, the ephemeral commodity that has sustained CMH for 50 years and built an industry, the siren call that draws people across the world and up long logging roads in the darkness.

Sensex gains in Diwali session; hopes high in new trading yearComments
Indian shares rose in a special "muhurat" trading session for Diwali on Thursday, led by gains in Suzlon Energy Ltd. while hopes for continued foreign fund inflows into the country also boosted sentiment.

Sentiment for stocks remains supported by hopes for more economic reforms after the government earlier this week lifted price controls on diesel and set the stage for liberalisation of the coal industry.
Investors remain hopeful for further steps after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party won two state elections earlier this month.
Foreign institutional investors have bought shares worth $13.3 billion so far in 2014.
The Sensex closed 0.24% higher at 26,851.05 points, while the Nifty rose 0.23% to close at 8,014.55 points.
Wipro Ltd. led the losers with a 3.6% drop after its quarterly earnings lagged estimates.
Muhurat means auspicious in Hindi, so the one-hour trading session was conducted during an auspicious time during the five-day Diwali festival. Markets will remain closed on Friday.
Other Asian shares had sagged on Thursday after a retreat on Wall Street and falling crude oil prices rekindled investor anxiety over slowing global growth, while a mixed picture on Chinese manufacturing failed to impress markets.
Domestic earnings and other global events will remain key for market direction next week.
Here's quick glance at the market sentiment, the year gone by and what is expected next.
Hopes high in new trading year
Muhurat session on the first trading day of the Hindu calendar year Samvat 2071 concluded on a positive note with the Sensex rising more than 63 points and Nifty regaining the 8,000-mark. A sign of good things ahead for the economy?
 
Positive start to a new year
26,851.05 points: Sensex close after the Muhurat session on Thursday
# The rally in the Muhurat session was led by stocks of oil and gas, consumer durables, capital goods, healthcare, FMCG, PSUs, realty, metal and banking
 
What's ahead
#  Investor sentiment is on a high, especially after the Modi government has unveiled a slew of measures that have opened up the coal and diesel sectors, and signalled the government’s intent to tame inflation and bring down prices
 
“The mood is very buoyant and investors are happy that the government also looks set to stick to reforms.”
Dipan Mehta, member of the BSE.
 
A good year gone by
26.37%: Sensex gained in the entire Samvat 2070
# It is the biggest gain for the BSE benchmark in the last five Samvat years
# In Samvat 2065, it had gained 8,813.26 points or 103.57%

Wal-Mart names Murali Lanka as chief operations officerThe world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday named Murali Lanka as the chief operations officer of its Indian subsidiary with effect from December 1.

Lanka will lead store operations, sales and business development, membership and marketing and asset protection functions for the Best Price Modern Wholesale stores, Wal-Mart India, the wholly owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, it said in a statement.
He will report to Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Wal-Mart India.
Announcing the appointment, Iyer said: "His depth of knowledge and global experience will bring a fresh perspective to our business. He is a veteran at Wal-Mart with almost 25 years in the company."     
He further said Lanka's experience in food and general merchandise and commitment to e-commerce will help the company serve customers even more effectively in the years to come.
Murali had joined Wal-Mart in 1989 and played various roles in its Sam's Club. In 2008, he came to India as the Head of Operations and spent five years before repatriating to US in 2013 as the developmental regional general manager in the Texas division.
Wal-Mart India owns and operates 20 Best Price Modern Wholesale stores in eight states across India. The first store opened in Amritsar in May 2009.
Earlier in April this year before the general elections, Wal-Mart had announced that it would focus only on wholesale business and decided to stay away from multi-brand retail in India.
It had announced plans to open 50 wholesale stores in the next four to five years to expand its footprint in the country.
Later when the NDA government led by BJP, which opposed FDI in multi-brand retail, came into power in May, Wal-Mart India had stated it would "engage and work" with the new government and continue to focus on the cash and carry business in the country.

China  20 others launch World Bank rival in AsiaChina, 20 others launch World Bank rival in Asia

Australia, Indonesia and South Korea skipped the launch of a China-backed Asian infrastructure bank on Friday as the United States said it had concerns about the new rival to Western-dominated multilateral lenders.
China's proposed $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is seen as a challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, both multilateral lenders that count Washington and its allies as their biggest financial backers.
China, which is keen to extend its influence in the region, has limited voting power over these existing banks despite being the world's second-largest economy.
The AIIB, launched in Beijing at a ceremony attended by Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei and delegates from 21 countries including India, Thailand and Malaysia, aims to give project loans to developing nations. China is set to be its largest shareholder with a stake of up to 50%.

Indonesia, where President Xi Jinping first spoke of the AIIB during an October visit last year, was not present and neither were South Korea and Australia, according to a pool report.
Media reports said US Secretary of state John Kerry put pressure on Australia to stay out of the bank.
However, state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: "Secretary Kerry has made clear directly to the Chinese as well as to other partners that we welcome the idea of an infrastructure bank for Asia but we strongly urge that it meet international standards of governance and transparency.
"We have concerns about the ambiguous nature of the AIIB proposal as it currently stands, that we have also expressed publicly."
The Australian Financial Review said on Friday that Kerry had personally asked Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to keep Australia out of the AIIB.
"Australia has been under pressure from the US for some time to not become a founding member of the bank and it is understood Mr Kerry put the case directly to the prime minister when the pair met in Jakarta on Monday ­following the inauguration of Indonesian President Joko Widodo," the paper said.
South Korea, one of Washington's strongest diplomatic allies in Asia, has yet to say it will formally participate in the bank.
"We have continued to demand rationality in areas such as governance and safeguard issues, and there's no reason (for Korea) not to join it," South Korean Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said in Beijing on Thursday.
Strategic choices
Earlier this month, commenting on reports that was pressure from Washington to stay out of the AIIB, the South Korean finance ministry said: "South Korea has not delayed its participation but has been negotiating with China because it thinks more consideration is necessary on details of the planned bank such as the AIIB's governance and operational principles."

The Seoul-based Joong Ang Daily quoted a South Korean diplomatic source as saying: "While Korea has been dropped from the list of founding members of the AIIB this time around, it is still in a deep dilemma on what sort of strategic choices it has to make as China challenges the US-led international order."
The AIIB is expected to begin operations in 2015 with senior Chinese banker Jin Liqun, ex-chairman of investment bank China International Capital Corp, expected to take a leading role.
Last month, China's finance ministry said Australia and South Korea had expressed interest in the AIIB.
On Thursday, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) chief said he doesn't welcome a China-backed rival bank that will have a virtually identical aim.
"I understand it, but I don't welcome it," said bank president Takehiko Nakao. "I'm not so concerned."
The ADB, created in 1966, offers grants and below-market interest rates on loans to lower to middle-income countries. At the end of 2013, its financing operations amounted to $21.02 billion.
China has a 6% stake in the ADB, and the major shareholdings are held by the United States and Japan.

Death by a Thousand Cutsreddit
It is likely that you don't realize what your state and our nation have lost in economic terms and research productivity as a result of recent cuts in the federal budget and budget instability brought on by a failure of Congress to pass a budget in a timely manner. Although some members of Congress strongly support increased funding for U.S. research, others argue that the time has come for the cost of basic biomedical research to be borne by industry and philanthropy. Those who make that argument either ignore, or are unaware, that this experiment has already been tried -- unsuccessfully.
Nearly 80 years ago, Louisiana Senator Joseph E. Ransdell failed at his efforts to get support for research through private and industrial resources. He instead determined that a federal agency, the National Institute of Health (NIH), was essential for supporting American biomedical research. It was clear in his day, as it is now, that basic research, which is an imperative precursor to cures for disease, was considered too risky for industry, whose primary goal is to turn research findings into potential therapies. At the NIH many things have changed over the last eight decades, including the addition of 26 more institutes and centers so that the research it supports addresses the full range of human disease; but the principle behind industry's role in research and discovery remains the same.
Like many taxpayers, you may think that taxes on your hard-earned money go to Washington, D.C. and stay there. In fact, 80 percent of the $29.2 billion that Congress appropriated to NIH last year was distributed through grants to scientists and public research institutions in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
Despite the proven value of, and critical need for, this research, NIH-funded scientists have experienced a 22 percent reduction in what they could buy with federal research dollars over the past 10 years. Adding insult to injury, the NIH budget was reduced by 6 percent in real (not inflation adjusted) dollars between 2012 and 2013. With the fall in federal grant support through NIH, fewer and fewer scientists are getting the funding they need to continue research. As a result, too many are closing their laboratory doors forever. If you think that a laboratory's closing does not affect you, think again. The loss of a single laboratory not only denies the U. S. the advantages of new research, but it also means a loss of three to four employees who were contributors to their state's tax rolls and three to four people who buy their groceries at your store, their gas at your station, or their services from your company. They have less (or no) money to put into the collection plate at their house of worship, and those houses then have less they can provide in humanitarian efforts in the community.
That sounds bad, but those results are not the worst of it. Hopefully you are healthy now, but imagine if tomorrow you begin to have symptoms of disease. For instance, your doctor may find that your cholesterol is very high or that you have signs of a stroke. Had it not been for NIH-funded research, your physician would not have effective drugs to treat you. Drugs called "statins," which lower cholesterol, would have never been developed; we'd have had no clue that drugs that make your blood less "sticky" (so-called antiplatelet agents) could help prevent strokes (and heart attacks); and we'd be stuck with ineffective treatments for high blood pressure, which can lead to stroke and heart attack.
Now let's conjecture that your own symptoms come from a disease that has no treatment. How do you think treatments are going to be found without research? When you need that treatment, you'll really want it, but your disease could take your life before the research engine can be restarted to find a cure. As Thomas Friedman emphasized in his New York Times column of September 24, 2013, countries that don't plan well for the future tend to do poorly when the future comes. Conversely, countries that do plan for the future tend to come out on top.
In his book, Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract with America (2005 Reginery Publishing, Washington, D.C.), former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich makes similar points when he states, "Investing in science (including math and science education) is the most important strategic investment we make in continued American leadership economically and militarily. Investing in science has also been the most consistent, powerful, single mechanism for extending life and for improving the quality of life. When developing the federal budget, the investment in science should be considered immediately after operational military requirements and before any of the traditional domestic spending programs." He went on to say, "Congress should be aware, however, of the crippling impact of a flat budget when research opportunities and needs are growing."
It is troubling to see how those warnings have been disregarded. Results of that disregard can be seen already. For example, data show that in recent years, the percentage of science and engineering journal articles based on research performed in the U.S. has fallen, while the percentage of articles from Chinese researchers has gone up dramatically.
So what can you do about it? Get the message to your elected representatives that federal funding for research is very important to you. Those in the seat of power actually listen to their constituents because they know that if they don't listen, we can vote them out of office. Information that will help you get in contact with your representatives can be found by visiting the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's (FASEB) Resource Guide to Advocating for Science on Capitol Hill and at Home. To learn more about how much NIH grant money comes to your state or district, take a look at FASEB's recently updated NIH funding map . Share your dismay that funding close to home is falling and both your health and the leadership of our country are threatened. Finally, don't forget there's an election in two weeks. You have the power to elect those who will honor your priorities.

Mahurat trading sets positive tone for year aheadMahurat trading sets positive tone for year ahead
None   October 24, 2014
The bullish sentiment witnessed during Mahurat trading day on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday has set a positive tone for the year ahead.
Mahurat trading takes place for one hour on the day of Diwali, since it is considered auspicious. 
Though the Sensex rose only 0.2% on Wednesday, there was a renewal of investor interest in old-economy stocks with cement, capital goods and power leading the way in the first half.
“The mood was buoyant and investors were happy as the government looks set to stick to reforms,” said Dipan Mehta, a member of the BSE, about Wednesday’s trading.
The markets had rallied during the four trading days that led to the Mahurat session.
Market players said foreign investors have been closely watching the India story and the government’s recent reforms moves, including lifting controls on diesel prices, have aided buying sentiment.
“The reforms momentum is gaining pace and foreign investors are keenly watching this. They are very bullish on India,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay of Destimoney Securities.
“There may be a bit of a correction, but that is how the market trades,” he said.
In a television interview on Wednesday, veteran market investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said there could be a major correction in December or only after the Union Budget in February 2015.
The Sensex has already risen 26% from Samvat 2070 to 2071, of which about 12% came after the Narendra Modi government took office after the general elections in May.

Stocks shiver in market game  but IT mood remains bullishComments
The stocks have fallen but that may hide some good news. India’s IT sector seems to be back in the robust growth game despite recent market hiccups  — if one looks beyond the obvious.
On the one hand, three of the four top software service companies — Tata Consultancy Services, HCL Technologies and Wipro  — lagged market expectations. On the other, analysts say it was a case of expectations running ahead of ground realities in a mood of optimism.
The big takeaway after the din of the July-September second quarter dies is that No.2 IT exporter Infosys is back as a market darling  under new CEO Vishal Sikka with a re-rating of its stock. TCS, which had stolen its thunder, now faces a new assault.
“It’s all well with the actual numbers. They have followed a pattern similar to the last quarter,” said Dipen Shah, head, private client group research, at Kotak Securities. “All the companies are saying both Europe and the US (two prime markets) are seeing demand.”
However, the lagging of the analyst estimates, which Shah called “half percentage point here or there” had its own impact.
In a fortnight during which top four IT companies announced their quarterly numbers, the BSE IT index shed 524 points or nearly 5%, when the benchmark Sensex gained 554 points or more than 2%, giving an indication how investors have viewed their earnings.
Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice-president, research at Angel Broking, who has a “Buy” rating on TCS, says the market fall had more to do with valuations, while Infosys was clawing back under Sikka, who took charge in August from SD Shibulal.
“Sikka came in with a 5-year plan which people wanted to hear. TCS has said it will grow faster than Nasscom’s average industry rate” she said.
 Shah said founder-chairman NR Narayana Murthy’s work over the past year in his second innings as executive chairman before handing the reins to Sikka also created some positives in cost-cutting.
Wipro’s CEO TK Kurien said his company’s moderate performance was on account of “headwinds in top accounts” but there was no contract loss to competitors as such.
“On the IT sector as a whole we are pretty bullish,” Nangra said.
Revenue and profit numbers for the quarter, and also hiring figures, seem to suggest a positive mood as well.
Nangra said each company was pursuing its own growth strategy to capitalise on an overall market rebound. While Wipro has been making niche acquisitions in new technologies,  Cognizant (India-centric but US listed), had made a major healthcare acquisition in the latest quarter.
There is, however, some room for sobriety. The downturn in Europe — which is still not behind us, pricing pressures in the face of competition, and a rise in employee wages have moderated growth.
However, companies say they are not to blame for misplaced hopes. For instance, TCS is seeing broad-based growth across sectors and regions with a healthy deal pipeline, CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran said.
 “It is a performance as per what we had planned, especially in a quarter we had wage hike,” said Anant Gupta, CEO, HCL.
Kotak Securities’ Shah said HCL Tech’s big bet on infrastructure management proved to be a dampener as the segment has been growing slower.
The Indian IT industry is most likely to meet industry body Nasscom’s estimate of 13-15% export growth for 2014-15. But the heady age of 25-30% growth may never return.

FM Arun Jaitley favours interest rate cut: Reports

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley favours a cut in interest rates to trigger demand in the construction sector, a newspaper report said on Saturday, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has signalled it will not ease policy until it is confident of lower inflation.
In May, Prime Minister Modi was elected on promises that his government would create jobs and rejuvenate the economy, but experts were disappointed by Jaitley's first budget and a lack of early progress on fixing structural economic problems.
"Currently, interest rates are a disincentive. Now that inflation seems to be stabilising somewhat, the time seems to have come to moderate the interest rates," Jaitley said in an interview with the Times of India.
Last month, the RBI sent a strong signal that it would refrain from cutting interest rates until the central bank was confident that consumer inflation can be cut to a target of 6 percent by January 2016.
India's retail inflation eased for a second straight month in September, but the risks of price shocks from weak monsoon rains and oil are expected to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon.
Consumer prices rose a slower-than-expected 6.46 percent from a year earlier, the lowest since figures were first published in January 2012.

Business Saturday
It was a strange situation during the campaigning phase of the Haryana's assembly elections. BJP alliance partner in Punjab Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) led by Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Badal went all out to support the Indian National Lok Dal. The Badals insisted they had longstanding ties with the Chautalas and had informed the BJP leadership of their support to the INLD - despite how important winning Haryana was to the BJP.
“SAD and INLD together are contesting for 90 seats. The next government will be that of Om Prakash Chautala. Haryana progressed during Chautala’s rule,” said Sukhbir Singh Badal, President, Shiromani Akali Dal
The tension between the two parties soon rose to the surface. Former BJP MP Navjot Sidhu hit out at the political positioning of the SAD in Haryana.
“These people (SAD) are the same people who hug and kiss BJP in Punjab and wrestle with it in Haryana. How can our alliance partner in Punjab support a convicted person for the post of the Chief Minister? They are stabbing us in the back,” Navjot Sidhu, Leader, BJP, said.
Other BJP leaders in Punjab have also begun to say the party should distance itself from the SAD and contest the 2017 assembly elections in Punjab on its own - powered by the Modi wave. The Punjab BJP unit though maintains that the party will decide on its alliance with the sad at the appropriate time.
According to Kamal Sharma, President - Punjab Unit, BJP, “BJP has become stronger under Modi. Our alliance with the SAD is strong. We will cross the bridge when we come to it.”
The Akali Dal has denied any rift - saying ties with the BJP are as solid as ever.
Bikram Majithia, Minister, Punjab, said: “BJP relation with SAD is a deep relationship. When it came to Modi becoming Prime Minister we were the first to support him….if you ask us a hundred times also...this relationship will stay together.”
BJP has been the minor partner in the SAD-BJP alliance in Punjab. With 12 seats in the 117 member assembly, hitting the 59 mark to form the government on its own in 2017 might be a challenge. However, the results of the Haryana elections where the BJP went from 4 seats to 47 to form a majority government - may propehsize a favourable outcome for the party in Punjab.

Delhi: Trilokpuri tense but no fresh clashes reportedA day after it witnessed riots, east Delhi’s Trilokpuri remained tense on Sunday though no new incident of violence was reported, the police said.

Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which had been clamped down on the area, are still in force with over a thousand police and paramilitary personnel still manning the area.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) reached Ground Zero on Sunday and alleged that the riots were “planned” to polarise the society on religious lines. AAP also demanded a probe into the “role” of former BJP MLA Sunil Kumar Vaidya in this connection. Making an appeal to the people of the area, AAP told them to pay no attention to rumours being spread by “vested interests” to create discord between communities.
The police had shot at five people during a communal clash on Thursday evening, who are recuperating in various hospitals.
“The situation is better and we expect things to look up soon. We have taken precautions to keep the situation under control and are ready to contain sporadic outbursts if they occur,” Sanjay Beniwal, joint CP (eastern range) told HT.
Over 30 police vans, water cannons and riot control vehicles along with several paramilitary personnel are deployed in the Trilokpuri area.

Local residents, however, argued against the police’s confidence in the uneasy calm that continues to envelop the area. 
The owner of A to Z Collection, whose showroom was gutted by fire on Saturday around 4am, claimed that the rioters used petrol to ignite his store. “We were at a wedding in Uttar Pradesh when we received a call that our shop had been set ablaze. Till the time we returned, no fire-tender or policemen had made it to the site.
We had invested our entire family savings, but now the police are not even registering an FIR,” said Israr Khan, brother of the owner.

The police have arrested 40 people for rioting since Thursday and apprehended more than 100. Many of them, the police insist, were let off after initial investigation. Following a brief period of calm, clashes had erupted again on Saturday evening.
Residents of Trilokpuri expressed anger over police action, saying that they had not caught the real accused, and were harassing innocent people. “Most people were caught from their houses. They were badly beaten up and dragged out of their houses. All of them are innocent,” a resident of Trilokpuri, Mohammad Fahim said.

Maharashtra BJP MLAs to meet on Oct 28 to elect leaderMaharashtra BJP MLAs to meet on Oct 28 to elect leader

Maharashtra BJP legislature party will meet on Tuesday to elect its leader to set the ball rolling for government formation even as backchannel talks continued with former ally Shiv Sena for a possible coalition.
BJP Maharashtra unit president Devendra Fadnavis continues to be the front runner for the post of chief minister though there are some more names doing the rounds.
The meeting to elect the legislature party leader and the chief minister designate will be held at 11 am at Vidhan Bhavan on Tuesday (October 28), senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse told reporters in Mumbai on Sunday.
Earlier, Khadse, Fadnavis and senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde had met to discuss preparations for government formation.
Union home minister Rajnath Singh and BJP in-charge of Maharashtra JP Nadda would attend Tuesday's meeting as observers. The BJP legislature party leader would meet Maharashtra governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao to stake claim for forming the next government, Khadse said.

"We will prove our majority in the house if the Governor desires," he said. BJP, which has emerged as the single largest party in the elections held for the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, winning 122 seats, has already been offered unconditional outside support by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which won 41 seats.
Counting of votes was taken up on October 19. With its 63 MLAs, Shiv Sena is the second largest party in the House.
Sources said the BJP is in back channel talks with Shiv Sena over government formation and efforts are being made to settle the differences with its oldest ally with whom it snapped ties ahead of polls. As suspense continued whether Shiv Sena will be on board, RPI chief Ramdas Athawale, whose party is a BJP ally, said Shiv Sena is ready to support BJP.
"Shiv Sena is ready to support BJP. BJP should support Shiv Sena," he said.
All the Shiv Sena MPs were also present at the high tea hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his Race Course residence. According to a senior central BJP leader, the "final call" regarding renewing the alliance will be taken by the top leadership.

Haryana govt contradicts Hoodas claim  says he was invited to Khattarswearing-inPrint
Outgoing Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda talking media in Chandigarh on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | Chandigarh | Posted: October 26, 2014 8:59 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 9:02 pm
The new Haryana government on Sunday said that outgoing chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was invited to the swearing-in of M L Khattar and a seat was reserved for him, contradicting the claim of the Congress leader that he did not receive an invitation.
The state government also said that Hooda’s name was among the dignitaries who were to receive Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Chandigarh Airport.
A Haryana government release this evening claimed that office of Deputy Commissioner, Rohtak had delivered an invitation card of the swearing-in ceremony at Hooda’s and Member of Parliament Deepender Singh Hooda’s residence at Rohtak on Saturday.
“The invitation was delivered by an official of office of DC, Rohtak at about 1 PM on October 25,” the release said. Apart from this, one chair was exclusively reserved for outgoing Chief Minister on dais, the release said, adding that Hooda’s name also figured among the dignitaries who were to receive the Prime Minister at Chandigarh Airport.
However, Hooda told reporters this afternoon, “I did not get the invite. Had I got one, I would have thought over it (whether to attend).”
A galaxy of leaders including the Prime Minister, L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, several Union Ministers, Chief Ministers of four BJP-ruled states, besides others attended the ceremony of Khattar and his Council of Ministers. Khattar was sworn-in as the 10th Chief Minister of Haryana on Sunday.

Pakistan’s internal political divisions overshadowed a march to highlight the Jammu and Kashmir issue on Sunday as an angry section of the crowd pelted Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto with plastic bottles, shoes and cans as soon as he came on the dais.
 
Angry that Bhutto was allegedly using the event as his political launch pad, the angry mob shouted slogans against him and his father, Asif Ali Zardari, and attacked him, prompting the London police to whisk him away from the dais at Trafalgar Square.
The attackers were alleged to be supporters of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf. Slogans against Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were also heard.
 
The attack on Bhutto soon led to a separate hashtag #BhagBilloBhag, as people tweeted their joy at his retreat as well as anger at the event being politicised.
 
As many expressed their frustration at the turn of events, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference submitted a memorandum to Britain seeking an early resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue at the end of a march.
 
The march covering the short distance from Trafalgar Square to 10 Downing Street was billed as a ‘Million March’, but its strength was nowhere near that mark. People had travelled from several cities in Britain for the event marked by placards with anti-India slogans.
 
The march was said to be organised and led by Sultan Mahmood Choudhry, former prime minister of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, and drew participation from leaders of other parties such as Bilawal Bhutto of Pakistan People’s Party and leaders of Muttahida Quami Movement and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf.
 
India has made it clear to Britain that such events provide opportunities to some groups to impede UK-India relations.
 
India had objected to Britain allowing the march during the recent visit of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, but London had reiterated its commitment to freedom of speech as well as its reassurance that it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir issue, without third party intervention, least of all by Britain.
 
"With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us," ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said.
 
The APHC led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq briefly recounted the state's history, mentioned allegations against India and said in the memorandum that the people of Jammu & Kashmir should be allowed the right of self-determination in the same way that the people of Scotland, East Timor and Southern Sudan had enjoyed it.
 
Unlike previous years, when such anti-India events here led to much concern in Indian quarters, there was a quiet confidence that India need not be overly rattled by them, beyond formally making known concerns. This approach was also evident during the 11 September debate on Jammu and Kashmir in the House of Commons.
 
India has made it clear to Britain that such events provide opportunities to some groups to impede UK-India relations.
 
In a significant intervention, Varinder Paul, India's deputy high commissioner, had recently sounded a cautionary note on Indo-UK relations before a London audience comprising Business secretary Vince Cable.
 
Paul had said: “From time to time, we find that there are certain tendencies in certain sections of the society, which are not in the interest of our strong relations. We need to watch out and be mindful of any such efforts. We should not allow any such tendencies to succeed. And this is our shared responsibility”.

Centre invites bids for agency to conduct spectrum e-auctiontelecommunication service
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has invited bids to select an agency to conduct e-auction of spectrum in various bands of telecom airwaves.
The department has issued a notice for request of proposal for the selection of an agency to conduct e-auction of spectrum on simultaneous multiple-round ascending auction (SMRA) pattern in the 22 telecom service areas (TSAs).
The technical and financial bids of the interested parties should reach the department by November 11.
DoT will issue the guidelines for spectrum auction in 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands shortly.
The interested parties also have to provide an Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) of Rs.10 lakh along with their proposal.

State Dept. seeks Walter Reed land swap  angering D.C. mayorBy Jonathan O'Connell October 24 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Walter Reed closed in 2011 and has become the subject of interest by the State Department, Childen’s National Medical Center and the D.C. government (Photo by ASTRID RIECKEN For The Washington Post)
D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is fighting an effort by the State Department to acquire as much as 20 percent of the land at the former Walter Reed Army Hospital where the D.C. government has been planning a town center-style development featuring housing, a charter high school, a grocery store and other amenities.
The Defense Department, which owns the entire campus, has been planning to provide about 45 acres on the western side of the campus to the State Department and 67 acres on the eastern side to the D.C. government. The campus has been vacant since 2011.
But a new request for land has prompted a possible reshuffling.
Children’s National Medical Center is seeking 13 acres of the State Department property, including a former Armed Forces Institute of Pathology building. Children’s won some support for the project on Capitol Hill, including from D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D).
State Department officials in turn — according to the mayor’s office — saw that they could lose the property and instead began jockeying to acquire 13 of acres pegged for the D.C. government.
On Oct. 23 Gray wrote to Army Secretary John M. McHugh, saying that if the Army carved out that land for the State Department it would have a “devastating impact” on the District’s ability to deliver the economic development it has promised to Congress, the Army and residents.
“Needless to say, such actions would negate years of effort, violate the trust of all stakeholders, indefinitely delay the creation of jobs, retail amenities, and housing, and waste millions of taxpayers dollars spent on the Army’s efforts to dispose of the property,” Gray wrote in the letter, obtained by The Washington Post.

A senior District official confirmed the letter and said the State Department was seeking 13 acres in the southern end of the District’s site, including properties currently pegged to house the homeless and veterans.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing relationships with federal officials, the source said State Department officials had gone to Capitol Hill with their request and that if it was approved it would force the District to re-do 18 months or more of planning. D.C. is working with a development team led by Hines Interests.
“The impact is pretty severe because we’ve been working with the development team constructing an offer that will satisfy all parties,” the source said. “Removing buildings and bifurcating the site just totally changes the economic analysis.”
The State Department is planning to use its portion of the Walter Reed property to create a “diplomatic enclave” akin to embassy row on Massachusetts Avenue. It didn’t hear about Children’s interest until this summer, according to department spokeswoman Christy Maier .
Maier said the agency plans to trade parcels of the land to foreign governments in exchange for properties abroad where the United States needs to open embassies. Not having the full acreage would cut into that mission, she said.
“We think this has a strong national security interest for us to be able to do this,” she said.
Still, Maier said the department wanted to be mindful of the District’s plans. It is now asking for just seven acres to compensate. That way the District and State would split the acreage that would go to Children’s.
“What we’ve done is take a real hard look at what would happen if Children’s did get the 13 acres,” Maier said. “We understand that they have a concern, and we realize this is sort of a new wrinkle for everybody. In a way it sort of splits the 13 acres that Children’s would get between the State Department and the District” portions.
 
Dr. Marshall Summar, chief of the genetics and metabolism division at Children’s, said the building that Children’s is seeking in particular has lab space that could accommodate medical research and would be difficult for the State Department to demolish because of its extremely thick, blast-proof concrete.
“Tearing that building down was not going to be a trivial thing or cheap, but most of those labs were renovated in 2010, so its lab space is beautiful,” he said.

Summar said that the last thing he wanted to see was for the hospital’s request to negatively affect the District’s plans. “Children’s really would not want to cause any harm to the city’s side of this or cause them to receive any less land,” he said.
In the end, Summar said he didn’t think the State Department would be able to acquire any of the District’s land.
“I really just think it was something where they were trying to see if anyone on the Hill was interested in it and I don’t think anyone really was,” he said.
This story has been updated with the State Department’s response.

science and technology
Google executive Alan Eustace broke the sound barrier and set several skydiving records over the southern New Mexico desert early Friday after taking a big leap from the edge of space.
Eustace’s supersonic jump was part of a project by Paragon Space Development Corp. and its Stratospheric Explorer team
The technology that has gone into developing the balloon, the spacesuit and the other systems that were used in Friday’s launch will be used to advance commercial space flight, namely efforts by Arizona-based World View Enterprises to take paying tourists up in a high-altitude balloon and luxury capsule starting in late 2016.
As more people head into the stratosphere, the spacesuits could be adapted for emergency rescues or other scientific endeavours, officials said.
After nearly three years of intense planning, development and training, Eustace began his ascent via a high-altitude, helium-filled balloon just as the sun was rising. It took him more than two hours to hit an altitude of 1,35,890 feet, when he separated himself from the balloon and started plummeting back to earth. Wearing his specially designed spacesuit, Eustace hit a top velocity of 1,322 km/hr during a free fall that lasted four-and-a-half minutes.
The supersonic skydive happened with little fanfare, out of the media spotlight, unlike the 2012 attempt by daredevil Felix Baumgartner and the Red Bull Stratos team.

Be a symbol of positive political entity: Modi at high tea |  NDA to chart new courseAdarsh Gram Vikas Yojna
(Modi also made appeal to…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today hosted a high tea for all NDA MPs including from Shiv Sena during which he told them to think big, far and above politics and help push government's ambitious pro-poor schemes.
In the first such event after the BJP-led alliance stormed to power in May, Modi told the 400-odd MPs to be a symbol of positive political entity, noting they represent a big force with positive energy and can help chart a new course for the country.
"Let us think big. Let us think far. Let us think above politics," Modi said while addressing the MPs at a post-Diwali high tea hosted by him at his Race Course residence.
All the Shiv Sena MPs including Union Heavy Industries Minister Anant Geete were present at the two-hour event but there was no political discussions, as suspense continued over whether the Uddhav Thackeray-led party will be part of a BJP-led government in Maharashtra.
"No political discussions took place during the meeting. It was purely an official function," Geete said.
Modi made a fervent appeal to the MPs for ensuring the success of his ambitious projects like 'Clean India' campaign , 'MP Model Village' scheme and 'Jan Dhan' project.
He urged the MPs to take to the people the work done by the NDA Government for the welfare of the poor.
The Prime Minister while dwelling on the recently launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, said the initiative has received tremendous response from all sections of society and called upon all NDA MPs to connect with people as they undertake efforts in this regard for Swachh Bharat in their areas.
He urged the MPs to visit schools in their areas over a five-day period beginning November 14, the 125th birth anniversary of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and explain to children the importance of hygiene.
This, he said, would send a positive message. The Prime Minister said that achieving 'Swachh Bharat' is a tough call but can be achieved with the same spirit as people of the country got together to eradicate polio.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu coordinated the meeting where various departments made presentations. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a presentation on the Jan Dhan Yojna while Labour Minister Narinder Singh Tomar made a presentation on the labour reforms. Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari also made a presentation on the Prime Minister's Adarsh Gram Vikas Yojna .
"There was an elaborate discussion on many issues which the government has brought to the nation. We had an address by the Prime Minister who talked about cleanliness, various issues before the government, how a common MP can turn things in this country, how a common MP can be a symbol of positive political entity and how the respectability of politicians can be enhanced in the country," BJP general Secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters after the meeting.
Besides BJP and Sena MPs, those of other NDA allies Shiromani Akali Dal, TDP, LJP, Apna Dal and other Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs were present.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hosted a high tea for all NDA MPs — the first such event after the BJP-led alliance came to power in May — and utilised the occasion to ask them to be a symbol of positive political entity.
At the event held at his Race Course residence, Modi also made a fervent appeal to all the NDA MPs to ensure the success of his ambitious projects like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan Dhan scheme, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and labour reforms. The meeting lasted for about two hours during which the MPs were given presentations on these schemes.
“There was an elaborate discussion on many issues which the government has brought to the nation.

He said the Prime Minister talked on a wide range of issues. “The Prime Minister happily endorsed the achievements of the BJP and greeted Amit Shah on his victory in Haryana and Maharashtra,” Rudy said.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu coordinated the meeting where various departments made presentations.

In furtherance of good governance
R. K. Raghavan
public officials
Civil servant independence in the country is at best nominal. Nonconformity even to spurn whimsical and arbitrary directives received from above is widely recognised as a very risky proposition
The right to judicial remedies … is a constitutional right of the subjects … Employees of the State cannot become members of a different class to whom such right is not available. — Justice J. Chelameswar and Justice A.K. Sikri of the Supreme Court of India (September 22, 2014) in Vijay Shankar Pandey vs Union of India and Another.
Amid the din raised over the case involving the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader J. Jayalalithaa, an important and recent ruling by the Supreme Court of India in an entirely different domain has gone virtually unnoticed. This judgment was in the cause of good public administration, a sector vital to economic development. The message that the top court possibly wanted to send through its order was that an honest civil servant can bank on the Court if blatant injustice has been done to him or her by an unfair executive.
Black money case
The judgment possibly took cognisance of the fact that over the years, the Indian bureaucracy has become a spineless structure that cannot stand up to unethical pressures by the Executive or the moneyed in society, thereby belying the worthy dream of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, free India’s first Home Minister. It was the doughty Sardar’s vision and resoluteness that ensured that efforts in some quarters in post-Independence India to abolish the centrally recruited and overseen All India Services did not succeed. The nation has greatly benefited from the continuance of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS) in particular. Certain events since 1975, viz., the period post-Emergency, have however been the cause for dismay among those who have been looking for a professional, honest and independent civil service that would bolster an equally dedicated political class. It is against this backdrop that one should analyse the recent Supreme Court decision.
It all began in 2010 when V.S. Pandey, a senior IAS officer, Uttar Pradesh cadre, joined hands with Julio Ribeiro, the former police chief, and a few others, under the auspices of a non-governmental organisation-styled India Rejuvenation Initiative (IRI), to file a writ petition on the need to ferret out black money owned by Indians and stashed abroad. The petition culminated in the Supreme Court decision (2011) known as Ram Jethmalani and Others vs the Union of India. Reacting to this, Pandey was served a charge sheet by the U.P. government on five counts for alleged violation of four clauses of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.
Charges, exoneration
The gravamen of the charge against Pandey was that, in being a co-signatory to the said writ petition by Ribeiro and others, he had endorsed an affidavit by one Jasbeer Singh that was critical of some senior officers of the Government of India (mainly from the Enforcement Directorate). The charge sheet added that in not having obtained the government’s permission before joining the said NGO and deposing in an inquiry where the Central and State governments were likely to be criticised, he had violated the conduct rules.
An enquiry officer appointed to look into the charges against Pandey exonerated him of all the charges on August 30, 2012. Strangely, a copy of this report of exoneration was not served on Pandey. On September 9, 2012, a selection committee that was considering cases of IAS officers in U.P. for promotion to the super timescale ignored Pandey’s case, although he had been exonerated and was eligible for promotion. The committee’s decision was in a sealed cover, a usual practice in respect of officers against whom disciplinary action was pending.
Worse was to follow. The enquiry officer’s finding was rejected by the U.P. government on September 26, 2012, on the ground that his report was cursory and that he had failed to properly investigate all relevant facts. The State government went on to invoke the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 and appoint a two-member committee to look once more into the charges against Pandey. Significantly, the State government’s action came on the same day as the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) dismissing Pandey’s appeal seeking his promotion. Following this, Pandey went to the Supreme Court on a writ that was recently disposed of by a bench comprising Justices Chelameswar and Sikri in favour of Pandey. In doing so, the judges made some comments on what was palpably an act of rancour and vindictiveness by the government. What was striking about this remarkable judicial order was the thoroughness with which the bench demolished each averment against Pandey.
Upholding an individual’s right
First, the Court held that since Pandey never disputed the charges made against him, there were no facts to be investigated by the enquiry officer. Second, relying on the decision (1971) of the Supreme Court in K.R. Deb vs Collector of Central Excise, Shillong, the bench held that a second inquiry against Pandey was untenable. There could at best be a further inquiry, but not a second one on the same facts. And, in the Pandey case, the facts were such that a further inquiry was hardly warranted. As regards violation of a stipulation of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules that an officer could not depose before an individual, or committee or any other authority without the sanction of the government, the bench held that joining in averments made in a writ petition before a court was equivalent to taking part in a judicial process for which no citizen needed to get the government’s nod. An individual’s fundamental right did not get diminished just because he was a member of the civil service.
The two judges were categorical that this was a clear case of harassment of a hapless civil servant. (“The purpose behind the proceedings appears calculated to harass the appellant since he dared to point out certain aspects of mal administration ... The whole attempt appears to be to suppress any probe into the question of black money. A part of the strategy to intimidate not only the appellant but also to send a signal to others who might dare in future to expose any mal administration.”) They did not also fail to notice that while the government chose to proceed against Pandey, it ignored the action of another official, Jasbeer Singh, who had filed an additional affidavit that was critical of the government. The bench allowed Pandey’s petition and went beyond, to award him the costs involved. In doing so it said, “The requirement of (a) democratic republic is that every action of the State is to be informed with reason. State is not a hierarchy of regressively genuflecting coterie of bureaucracy.”
The need for support
This landmark judicial order comes at a time when, in my view, an intimidated civil service needs support. In many States, public servant morale is at its nadir and it requires the oxygen of an unequivocal imprimatur from the highest court of the land that would help to halt the hands of a meddling political class. Nothing else would bring about at least a marginal improvement to what is an undeniably appalling situation. Wide publicity to its salient features would go a long way in reinstilling courage into large sections of the bureaucracy which is baulking in fear of reprisal for its legitimate actions and has been coerced into condemnable passivity.
Civil servant independence in the country is at best nominal. Nonconformity even to spurn whimsical and arbitrary directives received from above is widely recognised as a very risky proposition. Signs of defiance are fraught with such serious consequences that even the most courageous civil servant thinks many times over before turning down even a palpably unethical and illegal direction. The few mavericks who display a semblance of remonstrance are heavily penalised so as to deter potential dissenters. It is this sordid state of affairs that convinces me that Justices Chelameshwar and Sikri will have to be hailed for coming squarely to the rescue of a hapless senior official of the U.P. government for his alleged intransigence.
I view the judgment as bold and imaginative. It sends out a strong signal that the honest and upright civil servant can depend on the higher judiciary for unequivocal support. Wide publicity to the facts of the case and details of the judgment is a must.
I am not pleading here for a total licence to honest civil servants to do whatever they want or indulge in intemperate criticism of a constitutionally installed government. What is required is a freedom to speak their minds in furtherance of good governance. I am happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first meeting with the Secretaries to the Union Government exhorted exactly this and made himself available to hear them, especially when they were at loggerheads with their Ministers. There cannot be a better way to get the best out of each government official whatever be his status in the hierarchy. The Prime Minister’s Office has again to be complimented for issuing a directive to the bureaucracy that it should not act on oral instructions. I am confident that this stand would greatly promote transparency and honesty in governance.

‘The government has taken steps to destroy MGNREGA, an act that gives purchasing power to the rural poor, following prejudicial contentions of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders’
It’s no secret that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. MGNREGA is perhaps the only law in the world which guarantees 100 days of wage employment a year to one member of a rural household at the minimum wage rate. With the sole exception of the late Gopinath Munde, who on becoming the Rural Development Minister had expressed his support to expand and strengthen the programme, other BJP leaders have expressed their contempt for it.
The latest in the list is Maneka Gandhi who termed it the “most expensive failure” of the United Progressive Alliance government and went on to make the rather bizarre statement that it was because of MGNREGA that the handloom, silk and carpet weaving industry in Varanasi has been destroyed. “Labour is impossible to get,” she said, because of MGNREGA work.
Have any of the BJP leaders opposing the scheme on equally specious grounds ever been to an MGNREGA worksite? If they had, they would have seen frail men and women digging and lifting approximately 1,500 to 2,000 kilos of mud in a single day to earn a minimum wage, the national average of which was just Rs.132 last year. If anyone opts for this work, it is not out of choice but distress.
Arbitrary funding priorities
In the eight blocks in Varanasi, the implementation of MGNREGA has been quite poor. Last year, on an average in each of the blocks, 2,500 households got only two and a half days of work in a month (using the State average of 31 days last year). Clearly, MGNREGA is not the cause for weavers’ distress although the relief it could have provided is absent.
The real problem today is that such prejudicial contentions of BJP leaders are increasingly followed by government steps to destroy MGNREGA.
This started with the reduction in budgetary allocations from already low levels. UPA-II had also cut down funds for MGNREGA from Rs.40,000 crore in the budgets of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 to just Rs.33,000 crore in the subsequent two budgets.
However the difference is that whereas the previous government kept it open-ended with a proviso to meet the additional demands of the States where required, the Narendra Modi regime has virtually capped the expenditure refusing legitimate demands of the States for more allocations on the basis of demand for work by the rural poor. Given that the basis of the legal guarantee of 100 days of work is demand-driven, imposing such a cap is clearly a violation of the law.
Ninety per cent of the cost of MGNREGA is borne by the Centre. This February, the mutually agreed labour budget was 227 crore person-days, slightly higher than the 2011-12 number of 219 crore person-days. In financial terms this translates into an expenditure of Rs.61,000 crore. In addition, the Centre still owes States Rs.3,000 crore from last year’s backlog.
But instead of revising its priorities in expenditures and ensuring funds for MGNREGA, the Modi government slashed the labour budget by more than 50 per cent, allocating just Rs.33,500 crore. In an unprecedented move, it then divided the amount among States on a “pro rata basis.” All States have suffered cuts in allocations, some more than others.
Take the case of Tripura, the best performing State in the country in the implementation of the scheme. Its record in provision of work has been double than that of the national average. The agreed labour budget for Tripura amounted to a central allocation of Rs.1,406.96 crore for this year. However, the projected amount was arbitrarily slashed to Rs.660 crore by the Centre. Moreover, till October 20, the Tripura government had received only Rs.180 crore of the indicated allocation. This is the lowest in the entire country. Gujarat received 76 per cent of its indicated allocation, Chhattisgarh received 82 per cent and Kerala received 46.58 per cent.
There were no criteria for releases, just the arbitrary use of power by the Ministry. It is only after strong objections and protests by the Tripura government that another Rs.193 crore was released. But the damage has already been done. The Tripura government had projected a creation of 2 crore person-days between April and September, but has managed to achieve the creation of only 1.08 crore person-days till now. This is a direct fallout of the cut in funds.
As a result, the benefits of work and income to thousands of households, the majority of them tribal communities, are being destroyed by the Central government. Moreover, the inadequate devolution of funds and the consequent reduction in workdays created in the first six months will set into motion a vicious cycle, since the low average workdays will in turn affect all subsequent allocations which are based on past performance.
Another negative change in the making is the decision to alter the material-labour ratio from the current 60:40 to 51:49, thus increasing the proportion of expenditure on materials. This has serious implications on the very character of the programme.
First, with the overall cut in funds, any change in material labour ratio, given the increased costs of creation of workdays, will drastically cut down days of work which are already low. Second, the current expenditure on materials is just 23 per cent, well below the permissible 40 per cent, so there is enough scope to increase the material component with an expanded list of permissible projects without changing the ratio. Third and critically, the increase in the ratio of materials will automatically mean the entry of contractors and machines in much larger numbers into the MGNREGA projects. This in turn will signify the conversion of MGNREGA from a work guarantee Act into a contractor’s commission guarantee Act.
The idea of development
The attack on MGNREGA should also be seen as a reflection of the BJP’s idea of “development,” which is a deep commitment to the trickle-down theory of growth. The UPA also subscribed to this theory which is why it took steps in its second term that weakened and diluted its own legislation.
The ideological underpinning of the present assault on MGNREGA is linked to the approach regarding the use of national resources. MGNREGA, however inadequate, makes a step in the right direction by: providing a share of national resources to create work opportunities in rural India thereby directly increasing the purchasing power of the rural poor; planning projects to meet requirements at the village or area level unlike planning to build infrastructure which primarily helps corporates; having the potential to support farming by small and marginal farmers and those belonging to adivasi and Dalit households; and preventing wages from coming down below the legal level, thus stopping, at least in theory, gross exploitation of rural labour through payment of dismal wages by various sections of the rural elite.
That is why the dilution of the Act has the backing of representatives of the rural elite — the landlords and big contractors — across political parties.
The implementation of MGNREGA requires serious improvement to increase the number of workdays to its full potential. Works permissible should be more closely linked with livelihoods and work such as fodder and fuel collection, the working of Self-Help Groups and animal husbandry. Non-payment of minimum wages and delayed wage payments have to be urgently addressed, and compensation arrears should be paid along with unemployment allowances. Of what use is the ‘Make in India’ slogan when the Indian mazdoor, whose hands labour to produce, lives in destitution and distress?

Navy gets a lion’s share of the projects
The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting chaired by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley cleared deals worth Rs.47,000 crore on Saturday for the three services with a lion’s share going to the Navy. The Army’s long-pending proposal for the Anti-Tank Guided Missile system has been cleared.
Addressing the Council, Mr. Jaitley said the nation’s security was of paramount concern for the government. He added that “necessary hurdles and bottlenecks in the procurement process should be addressed expeditiously so that the pace of acquisition is not stymied.”
In a major boost to the Navy , six new conventional diesel-electric submarines under Project-75I have been approved at Rs.50,000 crore.

Xiaomi to set up local servers to address security concerns: Manu Jain  India headAmazon
(Jain told ET that the company…)
Xiaomi's India head Manu Jain intends to tackle all issues regarding security concerns, some of which have cropped up after the Indian Air Force issued a directive to its personnel, warning them against buying the popular Red Mi 1s. Jain told ET that the company that has sold over 400,000 smartphones within a quarter of launch in India plans to set up local servers. Edited excerpts:
The Indian Air Force has cautioned its personnel and their family members against buying Xiaomi smartphones, since they apparently send user information to servers China and hence be a security threat. What is Xiaomi doing to address this issue?
We do not have full information about the circular issued by IAF, however we believe that this advisory circular is based on events about 3 months back. We believe, it refers to the F-Secure test done on the Redmi 1S in July 2014 about the activation of our Cloud Messaging service by default. We immediately addressed the concerns raised by F-Secure. We scheduled a system update on 10th Aug 2014 to implement a change, which ensured that all the users had to manually activate the Cloud services, instead of being activated by default. After the upgrade, new users or users who factory reset their devices can enable the service by "settings" section. Once users have activated the services, they also have an option to turn it off at any point of time. This change was directly acknowledged by F-Secure, they confirmed that their concerns were addressed. We would be happy to talk to IAF to explain the entire situation to them. I am confident that we would be able to resolve any concerns or questions that they might be having.
Is Xiaomi planning to set up data centers in India?
Yes, we do have plans to have data centres in India - maybe in 2015. Since early 2014, we have been migrating our services and corresponding data for Indian users from our Beijing data centers to Amazon AWS data centers in Singapore and USA. This migration will be fully completed by the end of the year. This helps improve the performance of our services and also provide some peace of mind for users in India in ensuring that we treat their data with the utmost care and will always maintain the highest privacy standards.
When the MIUI 6 is coming to India?
We do not have a confirmed date yet. This might be sometime early next year.
Do you feel security concerns may impact views of potential buyers?
I would really like to clarify a few key points regarding Indian Air Force's circular - Xiaomi does not collect any information without user permission. We offer various Internet-based services such as Mi Cloud and Cloud Messaging which require data to be stored in the cloud. Mi Cloud enables users to back-up and manage personal information in the cloud, as well as sync to other devices. Cloud Messaging service allows users to exchange text messages with each other free of SMS charges, by routing messages via IP instead of using the carrier's SMS gateway. First, all these services are opt-in. Mi Cloud is turned off by default. Users must log in with their Mi accounts and manually turn on Mi Cloud. Users can also turn it off at any point of time. Second, when the data is sent to the cloud, we take rigorous precautions to ensure that all data is secured when uploaded to Xiaomi servers and is not stored beyond the time required. Strict encryption algorithms are implemented to protect user privacy. This is no different from other cloud back up services. If users want, they can use cloud services from Google , Dropbox and many others. Third, Xiaomi never uploads photos, text messages, or any other data without the user's consent. The storage of data in Mi Cloud fully respects the local laws of each country and region.

Cyclone Nilofar: Gujarats coastal districts to recieve heavyrainfallPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi/ahmedabad | Posted: October 26, 2014 10:11 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 10:15 pm
Coastal districts of Gujarat would receive isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall from October 30 as Cyclone Nilofar would intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours, India Meteorological Department(IMD) on Sunday said.
The cyclonic storm Nilofar over westcentral and adjoining southwest Arabian Sea moved slightly northwards and lay centred at 1730 hours today about 1240 kms southwest of Naliya (Gujarat), 1300 kms south-southwest of Karachi in Pakistan and 900 kms east-southeast of Salalah (Oman), an IMD statement said.
It would intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and it would move initially north-northwestwards during the next 48 hrs and then recurve northeastwards reaching north Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coast by October 31 morning.
“Under the influence of this system, rainfall at many places with isolated heavy to very heavy falls would commence along coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch from October 30 morning,” the statement said.
Squally winds speed reaching 45-55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph would commence along and off Gujarat coast from October 30 morning. Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be rough to very rough from the same period, it added.
The statement said that fishermen out at sea along and off Gujarat coast should return to the coast.

Etihad plans to take on lease Boeing aircraf...Etihad plans to take on lease Boeing aircraft from Jet Airways

(Gulf carrier Etihad tonight…)
MUMBAI: Gulf carrier Etihad tonight said it plans to take on lease two Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft from India's Jet Airways, in which it holds 24 per cent stake.
The Abu Dhabi-based carrier scotched speculation that it was not interested in leasing planes from its foreign equity partner in India.
"We already have two Boeing 777-300ERs and two Airbus A330-200s in operations under dry lease from Jet Airways and are finalising plans to introduce further two aircraft before the end of the year," Etihad said in a statement.
Earlier, sources in Jet said Etihad had indicated of not going ahead with leasing of Boeing 777-300 ERs from the Naresh Goyal-promoted carrier.
Three of Jet's Boeing 777-300 ERs were with Turkish Airlines and had recently come back to the Indian carrier after completing their lease period.
Jet was earlier planning to induct these wide-bodied planes on its international routes. However, after Etihad's proposal, it shelved the plan.
Etihad picked up 24 per cent stake in the Mumbai-based carrier for over Rs 2,060 crore last year, making it the first FDI in the Indian aviation sector.
Jet had announced in August it aims to turn profitable in the next three years and was planning a major overhaul of its fleet and products.
India's second-largest airline had reported a standalone net loss of Rs 217.65 crore for Q1 FY15, down 39 per cent from the year-ago period.
The airline has been facing a tough time from its pilots as well as the regulator DGCA for quite some time now.
DGCA recently suspended two Jet pilots after issuing notices to 131 pilots for not meeting mandatory licensing requirements.
The airline has over 1,000 pilots and its subsidiary JetLite about 190.

Centre according toModiSeveral economists have been disappointed by Modi’s first few days in office.
Written by Christophe Jaffrelot | Posted: October 27, 2014 12:04 am
Narendra Modi became prime minister on May 26, a little more than 150 days ago, after an election campaign that raised many expectations. According to some of Modi’s staunchest supporters, the modernisation of the Indian economy was set to happen because he would free the caged Indian tiger for good. Political commentator Swapan Dasgupta wrote in May that he was “an Indian revolutionary” a la Margaret Thatcher, who, according to economist Surjit S. Bhalla, “achieved the near-impossible by changing forever the mindset of a socialist, outdated England”.
But several economists have been disappointed by Modi’s first few days in office. They lamented that the Union budget was too much like previous ones, with few liberalisation measures except the relaxation of FDI caps in insurance and defence (from 26 to 49 per cent). But the “worst” was the Centre’s decision not to cut subsidies and to rollback the rail fare hike, a move, according to Swaminathan Anklesaria Aiyar, “so populist, dithering and spineless as to make Manmohan Singh look a lion by comparison”. Some of Modi’s supporters in the West were also surprised by the way his government stalled the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in the name of Indian peasants’ interests (and at the expense of the standardisation of customs procedures, which was supposed to add $1 trillion to world trade). But this decision was in keeping with the speech Modi had made as early as on May 20, before the BJP parliamentary party, in which he said: “A government is one which thinks about the poor, listens to the poor and which exists for the poor”. Subsidies for the poor may be criticised as inefficient from the opposition benches, but to cut them once in office and deprive millions is another matter.
In fact, the Modi government has opted for a gradualist transformation, which can be explained by the need to protect his supporters from the corporate sector, who may not like to be exposed to competition, constraints such as mass poverty (a “detail” the election campaign conveniently overlooked), and the weak position of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha. But if it is too slow for the neoliberals, it is too radical for the trade unions. The controversy regarding the Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2014, is a case in point. If the bill is passed, the minimum number of workers to be employed for a unit to be defined as a factory could be doubled, freeing several enterprises from having to comply with the Factories Act, which relates to safety, working conditions and welfare of employees. Such a reform is intended to please Indian entrepreneurs and also, probably, attract foreign investors to “Make in India”. While this is a contentious issue, given the relatively small number of workers in the formal sector, it is not revolutionary. And neither continued…

Letters to the editor: Missing EidgreetingPrint
Posted: October 26, 2014 11:55 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrating Diwali with defence force personnel in Siachen and with Kashmiris has immensely boosted their morale. It has also gladdened an overwhelming majority of the population. Modi is known to be a master communicator. But the fact that this year, his personal Twitter handle notwithstanding, no official Eid greeting was issued on behalf of the prime minister and no iftaar party was hosted, calls for corrective measures. In the absence of a course correction, unintended consequences could follow. This is especially true given the concerted efforts of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda to divide the Indian people. Unity must be guarded at all costs.

Reading the result
The BJP’s resounding victory in Maharashtra and Haryana rings alarm bells for regional parties. There is a need for a change in strategy. Or else, they should be ready to be swept away by the Modi wave — yes, it exists, and it is gaining momentum. The Congress needs to change its overall organisational structure. The demands to rope in Priyanka Gandhi say a lot about party workers’ faith in Rahul Gandhi. It also shows a touching confidence in the leadership capabilities of the Gandhi family. To blame regional leaders for the defeat is to hide from the real problems. As far as the NCP is concerned, it needs to rethink its policies on urban development, since its base is mostly currently rural. The MIM’s debut in Maharashtra is nothing short of impressive. By winning the Muslim vote from under the Congress’s nose, it has made a great start.

Raring to research
At the convocation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the need to boost medical research in India. Our country has to catch up with the rest of the world in many areas of scientific research. “Brain drain” is both a cause and an effect of poor research and infrastructure. Apart from in some top institutes like the Indian Institute of Science and the various Indian Institutes of Technology, scientific research is in its adolescence in India. There is a palpable lack of exposure to quality research materials and an absence of a conducive environment. Researchers are handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles and improperly rewarded for their efforts.

The downfall
After taking potshots at the prime minister, the Shiv Sena has had to take stock of reality. It can only join government on the BJP’s terms. This is a great humiliation for the stroppy Uddhav Thackeray, who was expecting to be in a commanding position after the Maharashtra elections.

Why you shouldnt get used to mobile appsDon't Get Used To Mobile Apps — Their Days Are Very Obviously Numbered
By Alyson Shontell | Business Insider –  Fri 24 Oct, 2014 3:45 AM IST
View Photo
A few years ago, everyone was creating desktop-first startups. Now you're behind if you're not building a mobile application first, and a website second. Apple blogger and Google Ventures partner MG Siegler believes the first app you open in the morning is the equivalent to the new homepage on a web browser.
But apps are very clearly not going to be around forever. Certainly not in their current, bulky square form. There isn't enough mobile homepage real estate for each of the web's 500-million-plus active websites to have its own app and for everyone to download all of them.
Mobile apps are popular right now because mobile search is terrible and they lay out content in a small-screen-friendly way. If apps do stick around, they may transform more into bookmarks, where people have only a few favorites on their home screens, and all other mobile content can be accessed some other way.
"There is no doubt what we have today — screens of apps — is going to dramatically change," former Googler and Facebooker Paul Adams writes on Intercom , where he's now vice president of product. " The idea of having a screen full of icons, representing independent apps, that need to be opened to experience them, is making less and less sense."
Intercom thinks that apps might still exist in the future but will serve as notification systems that push content as necessary — not big bulky apps that take up prime homepage real estate on our phones. Notifications are getting more interactive, too, letting you text message someone back or take an action without fully firing up the app.
Twitter Here's an example of a content card on Twitter. It has all of the information and actions stuffed in a tiny, manageable box within a stream. Cards in notifications probably aren't too far away.
How could simple notifications fulfill all the needs of current apps? Adams thinks they'll morph into content cards, which will allow users to see more information and take more actions straight from a pop-up. Adams believes you'll be able to book a table, send an email, or post to Facebook all without unlocking your phone.
The cards could eventually become personalized and ordered by favorite sources, most important contacts, etc.
This will become increasingly important as screen sizes decrease to the size of a watch face or glasses, or even jewelry.
" In a world where notifications are full experiences in and of themselves, the screen of app icons makes less and less sense," Intercom concludes. "Apps as destinations makes less and less sense. Why open the Facebook app when you can get the content as a notification and take action — like something, comment on something — right there at the notification or OS level."

Britain ends 13-year war in Afghanistandefence secretary
(The UK today handed over…)
LONDON: The UK today handed over its last base in Afghanistan to the Afghan forces, marking an official end to the 13-year-long combat operations that claimed over 450 British lives in the war-torn country.
"It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future," UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said.
The Union Jack was lowered at a ceremony in Camp Bastion in Helmand province , bringing an end to the 13-year war in Afghanistan that has claimed 453 British servicemen and women's lives.
All British troops will leave Camp Bastion within days, handing over the huge base to Afghan troops.
"Our armed forces' tremendous sacrifice laid the foundations for a strong Afghan security force, set the security context that enabled the first democratic transition of power in the country's history, and stopped it being a launch pad for terrorist attacks in the UK," Fallon added.
Camp Bastion has been the British troops' main Afghan base since 2006.
The last US Marines unit in Afghanistan also ended its combat operations with the handover of nearby Camp Leatherneck. The US has lost 2,349 personnel in Afghanistan.
Thousands of soldiers have returned to Britain in recent months, leaving only a few hundred members of the Armed Forces operating in the country. Tonnes of equipment has been repatriated, to meet the deadline of ending combat operations by the end of 2014.
A few dozen British military personnel will remain in Kabul to operate an officer training facility nicknamed 'Sandhurst-in-the-Sand,' as part of the continued support of the Afghan people. Special forces will continue to operate in the region.
Chief of the General Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter told the 'Sunday Telegraph' the handover of Camp Bastion would be significant "not least because of the sacrifice that so many people have made in Helmand".
"They are going to have challenges, but I am absolutely confident that the majority of the population in central Helmand will be secured by Afghan forces," he said.
As the American-led forces pull out of bases across Afghanistan, they have faced attack after attack, with some ground attacks being launched on the day of departure.
Some security experts believe that the Taliban is trying to establish their superiority as soon as coalition forces depart.
The Taliban have carried out a series of operations in Helmand this summer, attacking in areas such as Sangin and Nad-e Ali, where British soldiers spent months battling to maintain control.

Tie-up with Sena only without conditions: BJPstate politics
Announcement comes amid growing frustration within Shiv Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP
Even as a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit continues to lobby for a minority government in Maharashtra with the help of Independents, the party announced on Sunday that it wanted a tie-up with its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena. However, this announcement came with the rider that the Sena should come on board without any conditions.
“We are keen to take the Shiv Sena with us in forming the new government, but they should come forward without any conditions. Discussions on portfolios can come later; it is important to have a meeting of minds,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
The party’s statement came after an outburst by Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar earlier in the day: “The BJP does not want us. Their State leaders do not want the alliance.” Mr. Kirtikar was in Delhi to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high tea for NDA constituents.
There is growing frustration within the Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP ever since the election results. Many in the party feel the BJP is set to humiliate them and is not serious about striking an alliance.
However, the party welcomed the BJP’s statement. Meanwhile, the BJP has announced that its Chief Ministerial candidate will be chosen on Tuesday after a meeting of legislators and MPs. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and senior BJP leaders will be present.
The swearing-in ceremony is expected on October 30 at Wankhede stadium. Mr. Modi may attend the event.

India off Fragile Five list: IMFNew Delhi, October 26, 2014

India off Fragile Five list, says IMF

‘If government undertakes structural reforms it can achieve 7-8 per cent growth’
The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) India Mission Chief has said that among emerging markets and BRICS countries, India stands out for accomplishing the sharpest turnaround in its macro economy since the U.S. Federal Reserve started reversing its zero-interest rates monetary policy. As a result, of all these economies, India is best prepared to deal with the Fed’s monetary policy actions.
Earlier this month, the IMF raised its 2014 India growth forecast to 5.6 per cent as against its 5.4 per cent April projection while cutting its world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection to 3.3 per cent. If the new government follows through with structural reforms India can see a growth of 7 per cent to 8 per cent, IMF India Mission Chief Paul A. Cashin told The Hindu.
“India is the odd man out from the emerging markets and BRICS economies that were being called the Fragile Five last year… But the story for India changed quickly… India is better prepared for shocks today than when the U.S. Fed’s tapering started and more prepared than other emerging markets,” Mr. Cashin said.
The Fed’s initiation of the tapering of its monetary policy triggered sharp volatility in the rupee and a spike in the current account deficit. The CAD is down from the level of 4.7 per cent of the GDP to 1.7 per cent of GDP. “Three percentage points down is a lot... in the IMF’s history there are very few cases of that,” Mr. Cashin said. Substantial dollar inflows have led to India’s foreign exchange reserves rising from $270 billion in August to $315 billion.
The only red flags that Mr. Cashin raised were on retail food inflation and structural reforms in the infrastructure, labour and energy sectors. “Retail food inflation in India has been growing at a 10 per cent plus rate … Few countries have had such problems for such long periods of time,” he said.

Hardening its stand further, the BJP on Sunday told the Shiv Sena to drop all its unwarranted conditions and unreasonable demands if it wished to participate in the BJP-led government that will take oath of office on October 30.

Vinod Tawde, member of the BJP’s core committee, told media persons that his party would join hands with Sena only if it doesn’t bring any conditions on the table.
“The Sena should join us by heart,” he said, in response to Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar’s statement that the state BJP leaders did not want his party to join the alliance government.
The BJP is all set to form a minority government instead of giving the Sena a big share of cabinet berths and important departments. But Tawde said the numbers were not an issue.
“We can discuss the matter further (if the Sena is serious and unconditional in its approach),” he said, adding that the people of Maharashtra wanted a government that could deliver efficiently.

According to Tawde, the BJP’s legislative party, including members of both houses and members of Parliament would elect their leader on Tuesday. State party president Devendra Fadnavis is the top contender for the post of CM who also enjoys backing from the party brass. His selection would be a mere formality, said sources.
Central observers, union home minister Rajnath Singh, party general secretary (state in-charge) JP Nadda, state poll in-charge OP Mathur and former state in-charge general secretary Rajeev Pratap Rudy will  attend the meeting, to be held from 11 am at the Vidhan Bhavan.
The Sena had earlier sought 14 berths, but later scaled down its demand to 10. However, the BJP is not willing to give Sena more than five berths, said sources.

The NDA government has appealed to the people to participate “enthusiastically” in the events organised on “National Unity Day”, which will be observed on October 31 to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
“The birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will provide all of us with an opportunity to reaffirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity and security of our country,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in a statement here.
He appealed to the people to participate enthusiastically in the programmes to pay rich tributes to the “real national hero” who was the first home minister of the country. On Friday, the government had announced that every year, it will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day).
A function to pay floral tributes to Patel will be held on Parliament Street, while a ‘Run for Unity’ will be held in major cities, district towns and rural areas for all sections of society, particularly youths and members of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) among others.
In Delhi, the run is being organised from Vijay Chowk to India Gate on Rajpath.

Raut: Gujaratis forgot favours bestowed by Bal Thackeray onthemGujaratis forgot favours bestowed by Bal Thackeray on them, voted for Modi instead: Sanjay Raut

The Shiv Sena has criticised the Gujarati community living in Mumbai, claiming that they forgot the “favours” bestowed on them by the late Sena chief Bal Thackeray and voted for the BJP because both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah were Gujaratis.
“In Mumbai, there is a substantial Gujarati population whose votes play a decisive role. Because the prime minister and the BJP chief are Gujaratis, a majority of these votes went to the BJP. They forgot the favours granted to them by Balasaheb Thackeray on the issue of Hindutva. Inspite of staying in the state, they came together for their caste and region and voted against the Shiv Sena,” MP and editor of the party’s mouthpiece Saamana Sanjay Raut said in a signed article that appeared on Sunday.
This is not the first time that Raut has written against the Gujaratis. An editorial published on May 1 had questioned why Gujarati traders supporting Modi had never stepped out of their highrises to celebrate Maharashtra Day. Party president Uddhav Thackeray had distanced himself from the statement and there were indications that Raut was reprimanded for writing the piece.
Raut has, however, specified this time that he was not taking an anti-Gujarati stand. “We are not taking an anti-Gujarati stand. Inspite of doing major work, Vinod Ghosalkar and Subhas Desai lost from Dahisar and Goregaon. In Colaba, Pandurang Sakpal, who has done good work, lost. What do these things indicate?” Raut wrote. All these constituencies, incidentally, have a sizeable Gujarati population.
Raut also launched a diatribe against the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen. “In Mumbai and Sambhaji Nagar (the term used by the Sena for Aurangabad), the green colour was tossed with aplomb and two MLAs of a religious and fanatical organisation made an entry into the Assembly. The two… got elected due to the division of votes between the Sena and the BJP,” the article said.
He referred to the MIM as a “green snake” and said it needed to be eliminated from Maharashtra. “Maharashra’s politics has seen the ebbing of the MNS and the emergence of the MIM. However this venom needs to be finished from Maharastra’s polity without thinking about political loss or benefit,” Raut wrote.
The article also refers to the ‘threat’ of Maharashtra’s division. “Inspite of elections being over, the sword still hangs over the head of undivided Maharashtra. The clouds also seem to be darkening over Mumbai’s status,” he wrote.
The article also said that the Sena and the BJP needed to govern Maharashtra together. “If the Sena-BJP fought together, they would have got over 200 seats. But that did not happen. The electorate has placed the two at crossroads as to suggest that both should come together and form a government,” he wrote.
Raut further said that even though the BJP managed to win over 100 seats, the Sena put up an impressive performance having fought a lone battle on the issue of an undivided Maharashtra. “Seventeen of Sena’s continued…

More than a dozen European banks flunk test  need to raisecapitalPrint
By: Associated Press | Frankfurt | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:18 am
The European Central Bank says 13 of Europe’s 130 biggest banks have flunked an in-depth review of their finances and must increase their capital buffers against losses by 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion).
The ECB said 25 banks in all were found to need stronger buffers but that 12 have already made up their shortfall during the months in which the ECB was carrying out its review. The remaining 13 now have two weeks to tell the ECB how they plan to increase their capital buffers.
The ECB checked the worth of banks’ holdings and subjected the banks to a stress test that simulates how their finances would fare in an economic downturn.
The exercise is aimed at strengthening the banking system so lenders can provide more credit to companies, boosting the weak European economy. The economy has been plagued both by banks’ unwillingness to lend at affordable rates and by weak demand from companies that see no reason to risk borrowing. ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said the stress test and asset check were “quite strict’’ and that “the results guarantee that going forward the economic recovery will not be hampered by credit supply restrictions.’’
ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said the stress test and asset check were “quite strict’’ and that “the results guarantee that going forward the economic recovery will not be hampered by credit supply restrictions.’’The bank with the biggest shortfall was Italy’s Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which was found to have a capital shortfall of 2.11 billion euros. Most of the other banks that failed were short amounts less than 1 billion euros and in several cases less than 200 million euros. Eurobank and National Bank of Greece had no or practically no shortfall due to later measurements, while Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka had no need to raise more capital due to restructuring this year. Dexia is already being restructured with a state guarantee and does not need to raise more capital despite failing.

As gold smuggling rises  DRI calls for lower importdutyPrint
The 330% rise in smuggled gold comes even as imports have jumped by around 450 per cent year-on-year in September touching $3.75 billion.
Written by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:16 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 1:21 am
Seizures of smuggled gold by the directorate of revenue intelligence has risen by an unprecedented 330 per cent during the April-September period as compared to last year, prompting the directorate to call on the finance ministry to bring down the import duty on the yellow metal and make smuggling less lucrative.
This development comes even as gold imports have jumped by around 450 per cent year-on-year in September touching $3.75 billion, which calls into question the effectiveness of the high import duty of 10 per cent.
Experts say that import duty has failed to as a deterrent and demand for gold has only gone up.
“There were 2,150 seizures of gold made by the DRI across the country worth over Rs 600 crore in the last six months. This is huge when compared to 500 seizures worth Rs 150 crore made last year during the same period,” a government official told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.
According to a report by the DRI, gold seizures made up for 24.58 per cent of the total seizures last year compared to 8 per cent of the total seizures in 2012-13. It seized 1,267.26 kg gold in 2013, 200.75 kg in 2012 and 153.26 kg in 2011, according to available figures.
“DRI director general Najib Shah has written to revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das pointing out that the imports have gone up drastically despite high duty. Gold smuggling has emerged as a huge menace for the country. In view of the current situation, the finance ministry should take some decision on high duty rate. Also, it is resulting in huge foreign exchange outgo,” the official added.
In the Budget 2014-15, the government did not reduce the import duty on gold despite the current account deficit (CAD) coming down to 1.7 per cent in 2013-14 from a high of 4.8 per cent in 2012-13.
Last year, the government had taken a slew of measures, including raising the import duty to 10 per cent in phases and restrictions on import, to cut down gold imports. However, the measures led to a rise in smuggling.
Ajay Sahai, director general, Federation of Indian Exports Organisations (Fieo), said that smuggling is on a rise duty due to high duty and not due to supply shortages.“Availability and price are the two factors which contribute to gold smuggling. Clearly, there is no supply shortage as evident by high imports in the last few months. High duty is now becoming counterproductive.

Delhi Confidential: RahulscounselPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:16 am
Rahul Gandhi has been receiving hundreds of suggestions, both directly and indirectly, from scores of leaders and party well-wishers on how to revive the Congress and lift the morale of the workers. But one gets to hear former Union minister Srikant Jena has an interesting advice which stands out. He wants the young Congress V-P to move out of Delhi for some time and camp in a rural location. Rahul should work from that location and meet leaders and workers there, Jena says. He believes party workers would flock to that location, creating a buzz and energising the cadre. It would apparently help Rahul in connecting with the grassroots workers and get a sense of their feelings and aspirations. One doesn’t know what Rahul thinks about this suggestion.
SPACE CRUNCH
The existing office infrastructure for the Home Minister at North Block was proving to be insufficient for the large number of visitors that come to meet Rajnath Singh every day. Therefore, a new guest room has been constructed adjacent to his corner office. The minister’s security has also blocked an open space in the gallery leading to the elevator that the minister uses. And to further control access to the minister’s room, a door frame metal detector (DFMD), which was earlier placed beyond the elevator’s door, has now been right ahead of it.
LEARNING TRACK
Given the responsibility to restructure the Railway Board and overhaul the functioning of the Railway Ministry, the high-level committee headed by Bibek Debroy has set out to learn a thing or two about how the Railways operate. During its first interaction with members of the Railway Board, the committee was ‘advised’ to go out in the field and witness the complexities in the functioning of the Railways. The committee, only one member of which has a Railway background, is therefore said to have decided to take an outstation trip and go to Chhattisgarh to familiarise itself with the coal loading operations in a bid to understand the freight business of Railways.
POWER EQUATION
There was no attempt to hide the new power equation in the BJP when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to the party headquarters for his first media interaction over the weekend. The ‘Diwali Milan’ had been hosted by party president Amit Shah and he seemed to have made sure that the reigning power structure was made as obvious as possible. Special chairs, bigger in size with shimmering upholstery, were kept for Modi and Shah on the dais. The chairs for other BJP leaders, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Prakash Javadekar, J P Nadda and Shrikant Sharma, were smaller and of a different colour.

Car safety  design to get priority under newbodyA file picture of the crash test done by the UK-based Global NCAP in January.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:12 am
Carmakers in India would be forced to recalibrate their focus on safety, with the Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India — an independent agency proposed in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill — expected to wield the stick on issues such as standards for the design and construction of passenger cars.
Also, from next year, the Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program is expected to be rolled out, under which the safety of passengers would be assessed by testing cars in front-on and side-on crashes.
India currently does not have a new car assessment programme to provide buyers with independent reports of vehicles’ crash safety and vehicle makers are not required to meet the United Nation’s basic crash-test standards, something that is mandatory in markets across the world.
The two measures assume significance in light of a random crash test conducted by an independent agency in January this year, where three cars out of the five cars failed the front impact crash tests on account of basic structural deficiencies in the body.This is even as a variant of one of these car models that is sold in the European market was found to be carrying the highest rating safety certification offered by the same agency in similar crash tests conducted on cars sold in the European Union.

Belief: An Underutilized Toolreddit
There are many life lessons taught every day, such as ways to deal with others, subject matter expertise, and learning basic survival skills.  However, there isn't enough time allocated to teach individuals about the power of belief.  This is surprising because belief is often a cornerstone of success.  Moreover, if individuals don't believe in themselves, then the reason that others should believe in their activities or causes might not be as great.
Belief is a thought, feeling, or an internal drive that can be used to overcome an obstacle, advance toward a goal, or move beyond past challenges --- sometimes in spite of overwhelming odds.  Belief isn't required to move forward; although, it's an important tool to help summon the energy to persevere during difficult moments or challenging times.  Furthermore, the biggest benefit of possessing belief is that it supports something that is significant to someone --- even if nobody else agrees with it.
Belief is something that is true to an individual, very personal, needs to be developed, and can be a powerful tool for personal development.  It's also a characteristic that can help individuals move forward, solve an issue, or to achieve a goal.  Nevertheless, everyone doesn't have belief in themselves or may choose not to leverage their belief system to maximize their potential.  Some reasons that belief might not be fully utilized are: self-doubt, fear, others' opinions, etc.  Notwithstanding, a significant reason that belief isn't used more often is that life experiences greatly influence an individual's ability to "believe."
Things that happen during someone's lifetime effect their perspective and outlook. If an individual has had positive experiences associated with their beliefs, then their outlook is usually more positive. Conversely, if an individual has had bad experiences associated with their beliefs, then their outlook might be more negative. Although, a single bad experience won't always impact someone's future outlook, unless an individual learns to SEE; that is, the individual experiences a (S)ignificant (E)motional (E)vent.
Once an individual begins to SEE, there is a realization -- temporary or long-term -- that something that was once believed to be unimportant is actually important or something that was believed to be important might not be as significant.
There are several components of belief:
concept - an individual envisions a way to accomplish a task, activity, or project, which doesn't need to be fully understood for an idea to be developed;
consideration - something is evaluated as a possibility, but hasn't been selected as a viable option;
convenience - something that is used, done, or believed only if there is a potential benefit to an individual's position, situation, or desired outcome.
Oftentimes, belief might not be used sufficiently because of a lack of confidence, questionable arrogance, or a negative roadblock. Therefore, belief must be developed and maintained to achieve an internal balance that will support their goals, which includes an ability to be positive in their actions, to not be confident in a condescending manner, and to prevent any self-defeating activities that might prevent themselves or others from making forward-progress.
Belief can be a challenge because no matter the amount that someone wants something to be true. There aren't any guarantees that a belief is correct, achievable, plausible, possible, reasonable, or viable. As a result, belief requires faith in something that -- many times -- cannot be proven to be achievable or attainable at the time it's pursued.
Other challenges with the development of belief are that individuals:
have doubts;
aren't confident in their own capabilities;
have a need for approval;
haven't solidified their belief;
have a fear that prevents a pursuit of something that might be true.
Belief helps to provide energy to complete something that someone wants to achieve; however, anyone who doesn't believe in something that is thought, done, or pursued can give-up long before the desired outcome is achieved.  For this reason, individuals must understand that belief isn't required to accomplish something; although, belief can be a significant factor between experiencing success or failure.
Activities that can help develop belief:
Work on a dream despite fears, which sometimes requires moving past personal limitations and barriers to develop an idea or to achieve a desired outcome.
Consider an idea to be in-progress and build on it.
Act as if there isn't a possibility of failure.
Continue to be self-motivated --- even if there are setbacks.
Minimize doubts and worries to maximize opportunities for success.
Learn a lot from each effort --- even if the outcome isn't as desired or expected.
Beliefs might not always be realized; however, individuals who don't pursue their positive beliefs can limit opportunities, options, and possibilities for a better future for themselves and others.
Remember ... no matter the length of your journey, always be your best.
Additional information on the development of belief can be obtained from Mr. Young's presentation about " belief " and his solution-oriented book " Management Spotlight: Belief ".

A Letter to Consumers  Travelers and Humans...reddit
Dear fellow guests, shoppers, travelers, and customers in general,
I hope you don't mind me mentioning this to you. I mean, you don't even know me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, and I just felt compelled to speak up. You see, your flight was delayed, but it wasn't that poor man's fault working the check-in counter at the gate. He had nothing to do with the flight being delayed. It's not like he went out and unscrewed some nuts and bolts or removed the airplane's left wing as a joke. So why are you yelling at him? He doesn't deserve to have you all up in his grill over something that is completely beyond his control.
Or how about you, degenerate gambler who brought his paycheck to the casino? Did the cashier who just broke your last $50 FORCE you to spend it all in that slot machine? Why do you feel the need to give her a mean and nasty attitude? Why did you spend all your money? Just because YOU had a bad day, that doesn't mean you have to make everyone around you just as miserable.
I was at the social security office the other day, applying for a replacement card for my oldest. And as they called each person in the queue up to be waited on, I continued to hear complaint after complaint. "Why didn't anyone tell us this??" "We didn't know we had to fill out THAT paperwork." And no amount of sweetness or kindness from the customer service rep would appease these unhappy folks. So I made a point, when it was our turn, to try to be as nice and genuinely kind as I possibly could. I figured, I wasn't going in to solve a problem, I just needed a new card. And the woman who waited on us probably needed a smiling face to deal with, for a change. I also made it a point to explain this to my 17 year old so that she, too, can see that it's always better to try to make someone's day better instead of worse. Why add to their stress?
People working in the customer service industry don't deserve to be treated like doormats. They're doing a job. Sometimes it's a thankless job, sometimes they have to deal with real assbags. And they usually have to smile and take all the crap that's being dished out to them. After all, 'the customer's always right.' Well I call bullshit. Let me fill you in on a little secret. When your grandmother said "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar," she wasn't talking out the ass of her granny panties. She was telling the truth.
I worked in the customer service industry for many, many years in the casino biz. I worked around people who were at all-time highs, winning jackpots, and all-time lows, losing everything. I paid out winning Keno tickets to people who had to scrape together pennies to afford the $2 cost, and I watched millionaires lose thousands of dollars in slot machines, sometimes hundreds of thousands. It sometimes broke my heart to watch people, who I knew could not afford to be at the casino, continue to spend dollar after dollar, chasing a jackpot that would never come. And some of those people were absolutely beautiful on the inside AND on the outside. Always with a smile, win or lose. And I cringed as I watched people who could afford to light their cigars with $100 bills show nothing but disrespect to cocktail waitresses or dealers. Why?? Why can't people be nicer to folks who are just doing a job?
My point is this: The people who are waiting on you are NOT getting paid extra to take shit from you. A simple smile and a kind word go SO much farther than a bad attitude and a scowl. Are there customer service reps out there that aren't very nice? Sure there are, and they usually don't hold those jobs for very long. But for the ones who DO try to make your experience as quick and painless as possible, take a moment to smile. Take a second to say "thank you, I really appreciate that." You'd be absolutely amazed at how good not only you'll make that person feel, but yourself as well. You'll come away feeling a little better, and that's never a bad thing.
Warmly,

Cyclicals  financials to outperform in 1-yr: ExpertFinancial Services
("I am in agreement with this…)
In a chat with ET Now, Nilesh Shah , MD & CEO, Axis Capital, shares his views on some sectors. Excerpts:
ET Now: We did a poll of market participants and majority felt that cyclicals and financials are going to outperform. Would you agree with that?
Nilesh Shah: Definitely, I am in agreement with this hypothesis that financials and cyclicals should be two outperformers over the next Diwali. I would also like to add that the technology sector and a few companies within the technology sector will also be outperformer.
ET Now: Give us more details on the sectors that you like and would your choice be between midcaps and large caps?
Nilesh Shah: Broadly, I believe midcap valuations are almost nearer to the large cap valuations and historically, we have seen that when valuation gap between midcap and large cap is narrow, the midcaps do not deliver that kind of performance. So going forward, we do believe that it is worth overweighting large cap rather than midcap and small cap. Secondly, from a sector point of view, we believe it is going to be more of a stock play rather than sector play.
Within banking and financial services , where we are bullish as a sector, those banks which are reasonably valued and which are delivering better return and better performance than market expectation will continue to do well, and those banks which are highly valued they may not be able to deliver similar kind of performance or similar kind of return. Similarly, in cyclicals also there are companies which are leveraged, there are companies which are non-leveraged. A non-leveraged company should be in a better position to outperform a leveraged company. So while it is a top-down market in cyclicals, in banking and financial services, in technology, a lot of returns will come by picking up stocks at the right price.
ET Now: What is your view on gold, currency as well as interest rates going forward?
Nilesh Shah: We believe the rupee is in a fair value zone. It is unlikely to depreciate or appreciate big time. But it will continue to gradually depreciate over the next Diwali. So in the currency, try to play on the volatility rather than on the direction. On the interest rate side, we believe interest rates are poised for a policy rate cut and that policy rate cut will be reflected into the market yields as well. Now over last Diwali to this Diwali, market yields have not come down as much as was expected at the beginning of the year, but this year we believe it will be different and market yields and policy rates both will come down as expected by the market.
On the gold, I mean global gold prices are on the softer side and there might be a better opportunity to enter into gold when the US Fed is in the rate increase mode. Clearly, today there is no point investing in gold because of the import duty differentia as well as the potential impact on gold prices due to US interest rate hike. So our recommendation will be to be long on gilt funds and income funds, be underweight on gold and be neutral weight on the currency.

FRANKFURT: Twenty-five banks including Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA failed a stress test led by the European Central Bank, which said almost half of them must act to raise more capital. The central bank in Frankfurt identified a 25 billion-euro shortfall ($32 billion) for the region's lenders, and said 12 of them have now raised enough funds. Eleven banks need more capital, including Monte Paschi with a gap of 2.1 billion euros.
"Although this should restore some confidence and stability to the market, we are still far from a solution to the banking crisis and the challenges facing the banking sector," Colin Brereton, economic crisis response lead partner at PwC, said in an e-mailed statement. "The Comprehensive Assessment has bought time for some for Europe's banks." That two-part exam, comprising an Asset-Quality Review of balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2013, and a stress test, forms one pillar of the ECB's drive to move the euro zone forward after half a decade of financial turmoil by making its impact on the banking system transparent.
Banks will have from six to nine months to fill the gaps and have been urged to tap financial markets first. The ECB's stress test was conducted in tandem with the London-based European Banking Authority. The EBA's sample largely overlaps the ECB's, though it also contains banks from outside the euro area.
ITALIAN BANKS
The ECB assessment showed Italian banks in particular are in need of more funds as they cope with bad loans and the country's third recession since 2008. Monte Paschi, Italy's third-biggest bank, Banca Carige SpA and two other smaller cooperative lenders have a combined 3.3 billion-euro gap that must be replenished because the measures taken this year weren't sufficient, the Bank of Italy said in a statement today. "The minister is confident that the residual shortfalls will be covered through further market transactions and that the high transparency guaranteed by the Comprehensive Assessment will allow to easily complete such transactions," Italy's finance ministry said in a statement. Of the 13 banks that the ECB identified as having not raised enough capital, two Greek ones are exempted because their repair plans are already in progress.
BUSINESS MODELS
"The Comprehensive Assessment allowed us to compare banks across borders and business models," ECB Supervisory Board Chair Daniele Nouy said in a statement. "The findings will enable us to draw insights and conclusions for supervision going forward." The ECB said lenders will need to adjust their asset valuations by 48 billion euros, taking into account the reclassification of an extra 136 billion euros of loans as non performing.
The stock of bad loans in the euro-area banking system now stands at 879 billion euros, the report said. Italian banks will have to implement the largest asset-value adjustments according to the findings of the review, equivalent to 12 billion euros. Greek banks will have to revalue by 7.6 billion euros, and German banks by 6.7 billion euros, the report showed. Italian lenders were buffeted by the stress test, suffering a hit to capital of 35.5 billion euros, followed by French banks with 30.8 billion euros.
 
German banks would see capital reduced by 27 billion euros in the stress scenario, the report said. Under the simulated recession set out in the assessment's stress test, banks' common equity Tier 1 capital would be depleted by 263 billion euros, or by 4 percentage points. The median CET1 ratio --a key measure of financial strength --would therefore fall to 8.3% from 12.4%. Nouy has said banks will be required to cover any capital shortfalls revealed by the assessment, "primarily from private sources."

Heavy rain disrupts normal life in Andhra; crops submergedBy: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:48 am
Normal life was thrown out of gear at several places in Andhra Pradesh Sunday with incessant rain lashing the state under the influence of north-east monsoon.
The heavy rain led to water logging and submergence of low-lying areas in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Kadapa and Prakasam, among others, according to reports reaching here.
Several rivulets and other water bodies were in spate following the downpour, which flooded agriculture crops and disrupted road traffic at several places.
The north-east monsoon has been vigorous over south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema. Under its impact, rain occurred at most places in the two regions and at a few places over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Macharla in coastal Andhra received 29 cm rainfall.
Moderate to rather heavy rain or thundershowers would occur at many places over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema till Monday, it added.

CM Rawat trumps BJP with Ramdevs Kedarnath visitNext to Ramdev is Ranjit Rawat, aide of CM Rawat. (Source: Express photo by Virender Singh Negi)
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:44 am
A visit by Baba Ramdev to the Kedarnath shrine last week appears to have handed the aces to the Congress government in Uttarakhand against the BJP.
Ramdev praised Harish Rawat as “an able CM” after his return from a visit on which he was accompanied by one of the chief minister’s closets aides, former MLA Ranjit Singh Rawat. Apart from sending out the message that the politically influential yoga guru is no longer out of bounds for the Congress in Uttarakhand, it also allows the Congress to steal a march on the BJP.
The same Congress government, then under CM Vijay Bahuguna, had registered a series of revenue-related cases against Ramdev’s Patanjali Yogapeeth just before the Lok Sabha elections.
What has caused the BJP all the more cause for consternation is Rawat’s latest move to invite Haridwar-based priests to Kedarnath so that they can see for themselves the reconstruction work undertaken by the government after the June 2013 flash floods. Those who have already visited include Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanand Brahamchari, Satpal Brahamchari, Swami Mohandas and Swami Shivanand Bharti.
Morari Bapu, too, recently visited Kedarnath to offer prayers. Although the trip was planned by Morari himself, the CM was with him at Kedar valley’s Agastyamuni town where the bapu distributed cheques to a number of the disaster victims, apart from donating Rs 1 crore to the Badri-Kedarnath temple committee. “We want spiritual leaders to look at the reconstruction work and make suggestions. They have a large number of followers and can spread a positive message about the state,” Chief Minister Rawat told The Indian Express over the phone. Next among Rawat’s planned invitations are Sudhanshu Maharaj and the Art of Living’s Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

“The CM should focus on welfare schemes. The government has done nothing to generate jobs for people in areas hit by the disaster,” said the BJP’s Uttarakhand president Tirath Singh Rawat. “The trek route to Kedarnath is not yet in proper shape.”
Former CM Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, now BJP MP from Nainital, has demanded that the state hand over Kedarnath’s infrastructure development to the centre.
Such criticism explains the way Rawat is dealing with Kedarnath. “He has given special focus on highlighting the reconstruction work. His decision to hold a cabinet meeting in Kedarnath was part of a strategy to stop the BJP from using against the government their allegations of mishandling of of the situation ,” a Congress source said.Last week, Rawat held an all-party continued…

Between BJP and power bid  Hemant evolved and assuredLooked uncertain when he took over, now even Congress backing him as leader of alliance in polls.
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:41 am
Its confidence high after the Lok Sabha and two assembly election victories, the BJP will inevitably target emerging the single largest party in the Jharkhand assembly too. That will leave the other parties with the objective of thwarting the BJP by cobbling together alliances that will possibly inch them past the majority mark in the 81-member House.
With that objective, the Congress has announced that it would fight the elections under the leadership of the JMM’s Hemant Soren. At the time of one of its worst crises, the Congress has placed its trust in a debutant MLA who had been CM for just 15 months. “He has no ego and is easy to negotiate with. He is transparent and has evolved into a good leader,” said Congress leader Ajay Kumar, who was involved in the talks leading to the announcement.
This October is a far cry from January 2013 when Hemant, 39, who had pulled down the Arjun Munda government, was made to wait six months by the Congress before it lent its support. Back then, even those within the JMM knew very little of someone they respected only because he was Shibu Soren’s son. Hemant, a bespectacled, slight man, could not match the stature of his brother Durga Soren, who was the de facto chief of the party until his death in 2009.
Even as recently as April, a senior BJP leader had noted, “Guruji wants to be CM still. Wait and see, Hemant will fail; Guruji will take over to save the party.” His father’s old aides were up in arms over their reduced role in the decision-making process; Hemant had allied with the RJD, which had opposed the creation of Jharkhand.
Signs of Hemant’s evolution began to show before the Lok Sabha elections. He fired Congress leader Chandrashekhar Dubey from his cabinet for personal attacks, and did nothing to stop senior leader Hemlal Murmu from joining the BJP, for it removed one of the party’s power centres out of his way. And in the elections, Hemant was the only one who stood between the BJP and a clean sweep, with the JMM winning two of the four seats it had contested. Hemant had micro-managed his father’s campaign in Dumka; in Rajmahal, he handpicked Vijay Hansdak and made sure he won against Murmu.After the elections, Hemant fired another cabinet colleague, Simon Marandi, who used to boast that he had mentored Shibu Soren. Last month, he fired the Congress’s Yogendra Sao. “We are the only party that has dared to fire ministers for incompetence. Guruji fired two; Hemant has fired three,” said JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.

7 arrested in Bengal clash  remanded in 5-day custodyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Bhangor (wb) | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:40 am
Four more persons were arrested in connection with Saturday’s clash between two factions of the Trinamool Congress at Bhangor in South 24-Parganas district, taking the number of persons held to seven, police said on Sunday.
All the seven accused were produced in the SDJM’s court at Baruipur and remanded in five days’ police custody.
Two youths were killed in the clash at Deota village in Bhangor on Saturday, which is a Trinamool Congress stronghold and the local gram panchayat is also controlled by the party. Among those arrested since Saturday were Baonta gram panchayat pradhan Panchu Gopal Mondal, police said.
One Bapan Mondal was gunned down by some people, following which the rival group shot dead Rajesh Mondal in retaliation during the clash.
Villagers and opposition CPM claimed that the intra-party clash took place because of rivalry over control of the local panchayat.
The Opposition alleged that panchayat chief Panchu Mondal had been removed by the group claiming allegiance to TMC leader Arabul Islam.

Jarawa film: Lookout notice against French duo soonBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:38 am
A lookout notice would soon be issued against two French filmmakers who allegedly trespassed into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve and secretly filmed a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe in the Andaman islands.
“We are cross-checking the records of their arrival in India with the immigration office. Once we have the exact dates we will send a lookout notice against them through the Ministry of External Affairs,” North and Middle Andaman Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Meena told PTI from Port Blair.
Last week, an FIR was filed against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert under various sections of the Protection of Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012 and Foreigners Amendment Act 2004.
Police have since then arrested two locals of Karen community and is looking for two others who had helped the filmmakers meet Jarawa tribals.
The filmmakers had uploaded details and photographs on a website and a Facebook page which were removed after the filmmakers were sent a notice by the Union Territory’s administration, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
Extremely vulnerable to diseases, the 400-strong Jarawa tribe live as nomadic hunter gatherers and till as recent as 1998 they had hardly any contact with the outside world.
“Making any contact or shooting photos, videos with them is illegal. The filmmakers have violated the law of the land and will have to face trial as per law once we are able to catch hold of them,” the SP said.
Andaman and Nicobar’s tribal welfare secretary Theva Neethi Dhas said the Jarawas have also confirmed that two foreigners and a translator had visited them during March-April period. Members of the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti are authorised by the administration to talk to the Jarawas who can speak in their native language only.
On their website, the filmmakers claimed to have gathered huge material — photos, films and interviews  — about the Jarawas. The film ‘Organic’, which is currently in post-production stage, is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.
“In order to finish it we will launch a crowd-funding campaign at the end of 2014. We hope to release Organic in theatres in 2015,” the filmmakers had said. They said they found a way to meet and interview the Jarawas several times during the last three years.
Officials said it is not easy to man the tribal area and ensure that no unauthorised person meet the Jarawas. “We have a police lookout post outside the tribal reserve, but since the area is too big it is a tough task for us,” the SP said.
Jarawas, among the four major tribes including Great Andamanese, Onge and Sentinelese, are believed to have lived in their Indian Ocean home for nearly 55,000 years.

Hardening its stand further, the BJP on Sunday told the Shiv Sena to drop all its unwarranted conditions and unreasonable demands if it wished to participate in the BJP-led government that will take oath of office on October 30.

Vinod Tawde, member of the BJP’s core committee, told media persons that his party would join hands with Sena only if it doesn’t bring any conditions on the table.
“The Sena should join us by heart,” he said, in response to Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar’s statement that the state BJP leaders did not want his party to join the alliance government.
The BJP is all set to form a minority government instead of giving the Sena a big share of cabinet berths and important departments. But Tawde said the numbers were not an issue.
“We can discuss the matter further (if the Sena is serious and unconditional in its approach),” he said, adding that the people of Maharashtra wanted a government that could deliver efficiently.

According to Tawde, the BJP’s legislative party, including members of both houses and members of Parliament would elect their leader on Tuesday. State party president Devendra Fadnavis is the top contender for the post of CM who also enjoys backing from the party brass. His selection would be a mere formality, said sources.
Central observers, union home minister Rajnath Singh, party general secretary (state in-charge) JP Nadda, state poll in-charge OP Mathur and former state in-charge general secretary Rajeev Pratap Rudy will  attend the meeting, to be held from 11 am at the Vidhan Bhavan.
The Sena had earlier sought 14 berths, but later scaled down its demand to 10. However, the BJP is not willing to give Sena more than five berths, said sources.

Modi may send Mamata tough message on Burdwan blast probeModi may send Mamata tough message on Burdwan blasts probe
Shishir Gupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 27, 2014

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to send a stern message to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday over her perceived inaction on the Burdwan blasts: Shape up or the Centre will intervene in a bigger way.
Authoritative official sources said that Modi’s message will be delivered by national security adviser Ajit Doval, who is due to visit the terror site before he meets Mamata in Kolkata. Doval, a counter terrorism expert himself, is armed with a National Investigation Agency (NIA) report into the October 2 blast in the southeastern Bengal town that have been linked to the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).
Doval will tell Mamata that the Modi government is intent on fighting both homegrown and externally sponsored terror groups, and that the PM feels that central and state forces should work together. Modi is seriously concerned about linkages of the Burdwan blasts with pan-Islamic terrorism and political developments in Bangladesh, Mamata will be told.
Read: With Doval in Bengal, spotlight back on Mamata
The Modi government is acutely aware of the potential embarrassment that could result from not being able to root out from its soil a terror outfit that plans attacks against a friendly neighbour.
The two people killed while making bombs in the Burdwan house were found to be JMB operatives who intended to transport the devices into Bangladesh and the NIA report says that the JMB, a shadowy organisation formed in 2005, has plans to establish an Islamic state that encompasses Bangladesh and Murshidabad, Nadia and Malda districts of Bengal. 
The Centre ordered the NIA, its terror investigation body, to take over the probe into the blasts a week after the event. Mamata, whose government faced a barrage of criticism for its alleged mishandling of the investigation, opposed Delhi’s intervention.
Now, if Modi senses that the state is not cooperating, there is every possibility that the Intelligence Bureau’s counter-terror wing and the National Security Guard hub in Kolkata also get involved in a more proactive way, the sources said.
Doval, on the basis of NIA investigation report, will convey that the Burdwan JMB module was fabricating eight to ten improvised explosive devices (IEDs) per month since late 2011 — around the time that Mamata came to power in the state.
The NIA report states that already five to six consignments of 30-40 bombs have made their way to Bangladesh through a certain Kausar Kadir, who was known to the Burdwan blast accused.
The NIA has also come across mobile phone calls from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and UAE to the accused during investigations and point to possible terror linkages with these countries.
Formed in 2005, the JMB, according to the NIA report, has plans to establish an Islamic state that encompasses Bangladesh and Murshidabad, Nadia and Malda districts.
Until now, the NIA has recovered 95 bombs from Burdwan and Birbhum, and four persons have been held in Bengal and a further six in Assam. As many as 12 persons are absconding and are suspected to have fled to Bangladesh. Investigators believe that this is just the beginning.
India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RA&W) is sharing all details with Bangladesh through institutionalised channels. On September 24, Dhaka gave India names of three JMB men—Sohail Mahfuz alias Nasrullah; Zahid-ul-Islam and Salauddin—who were seeking shelter in Bangladesh.
While none of the three have been picked up, Indian agencies have identified Nasrullah as the leader of the JMB in Bengal on the basis of statements from one of the Burdwan accused, who identified him by his missing left hand.
It is learnt that Nasrullah had taught bomb making to Burdwan module after earlier losing his hand in an accidental explosion. Called “Haath Kaata” in Bangladesh, Nasrullah along with Sajjjid and Sadiq have been identified as the main terror trainers who held classes in madrasas in Burdwan, Murshidabad and Birbhum.

Goa announces e-auction of 19 L MT of iron oreGoa government
(Goa Mines and Geology Department…)
PANAJI: Goa Mines and Geology Department has put 19 lakh metric tonne of iron ore on the block through e-auctioning, to be held on November 6 and 7.
In its notification uploaded on its website today, the department has announced two phase e-auctioning on November 6 and 7, through which 10 lakh and 9 lakh metric tonne of iron ore would be auctioned respectively.
The department has announced a detailed schedule of the iron ore e-auctioning which would be monitored by a Supreme Court appointed committee.
While lifting its two-year long ban on export of iron ore from Goa, the Supreme Court had allowed e-auctioning of iron ore which was extracted during the 2007-2012 period.
The state has a total of 15 million metric tonne of iron ore lying at various jetties, stacking yards, mining leases and the Mormugao Port Trust .
During the Goa government's earlier four e-auctioning events, five million metric tonne of iron ore were already sold to various buyers.
The Supreme Court appointed committee which is closely monitoring the e-auctioning had said that it was satisfied with the action of the Goa government.
"We are quite satisfied with the process adopted by the Goa government to electronically auction the ore," the committee member U V Singh had told to PTI.
The committee which recently visited Goa had conceded that the e-auctioning process is moving at a slow pace due to inappropriate prices of iron ore in the international market.
"There are several factors responsible for the slow pace of e-auctioning. The state witnessed rainy seasons since April till date. Also iron ore prices in the international market are low," the committee member U V Singh had told PTI.
He had said that the Goa government is the owner of the iron ore and hence it must rationalise the sale in such a way that it gets a better price.
The slowdown in China's economy, along with a reduction in steel production in that country had proved detrimental to iron ore export, Singh added.
He stated that the percentage of Goa iron ore which is consumed domestically is very marginal.
"Very little iron ore is consumed in the domestic market. I know that there is only one buyer in Karnataka which takes the ore, but for that too, there are constraints in transporting the ore. Because of this, the buyer purchases the ore from Karnataka itself," he had said.

Home for Diwali  Lakhan back at bus stop  tied topoleLakhan Sawant Kale is tied to a pole in Mumbai on Saturday. His grandmother is also seen. (Source: Express photo by Vasant Prabhu)

By: VASANT PRABHU & DIPTI NAGPAUL D’SOUZA
On Saturday, while the streets were abuzz with festivities, nine-year-old Lakhan Sawant Kale sat on the pavement near Mantralaya, one hand tied to a pole of the bus stop. The long strip of cloth used to bind him allowed the boy — suffering from cerebral palsy and seizure disorder — to move about, but ensured he doesn’t stray too far from where his grandmother, a pavement dweller, sat.
Ironically, the boy was in the same situation that The Indian Express had found him in May this year. Following this newspaper’s reports dated May 20 and 21) revealing his plight, Lakhan had received help and had been admitted to a school for special children in Satara, Samata Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, in July (The Indian Express edition dated July 2).
Lakhan’s 66-year-old grandmother, Sakkubai Shiva Kale, says that the boy was brought back to Mumbai on October 21, ahead of Diwali. “It’s a festive season and we wanted him back with the family for a few days. He will be returning to school soon,” she said. Partha Polke, who heads the Satara school, confirmed the same, adding Sakkubai had applied for leave for Lakhan until November 7.
Asked why the nine-year-old had been once again tied, Sakkubai cited her inability to run after Lakhan as the reason. “Given his condition, he doesn’t understand the risk of being run over by a vehicle when he plays on streets. I am too old to chase after him all the time. I am left with no option but to tie him up,” she said.
While this can be viewed as a one-off incident until Lakhan returns to school next month, it throws light on the larger problem. In a country where disabilities such as cerebral palsy or even mental disorders are rarely understood and considered a taboo even by the educated and the well-to-do, the poor find themselves dealing with it with their limited means and no support from the government.
After The Indian Express wrote about Lakhan’s situation in May, it was a private NGO, Manav Foundation, that came to his aid, ensuring that he was temporarily admitted to the Dongri shelter and then finding him a place in Polke’s school-and-hostel facility.
Talking about the challenge she had faced, Manav Foundation’s Meena Mutha had said, “It wasn’t easy to find a suitable place for the boy. The city is lacking in facilities for people who suffer from disorders like Lakhan. And the ones that are already there were either full to capacity or were demanding a high admission fee.”
Polke, however, says Lakhan has improved ever since his admission to the school in July. “He can now eat on continued…

Taking terror totaskPrint
Written by Soli J Sorabjee | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:15 am
Hafiz Saeed was the brain behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured during the 26/11 terror strike, acknowledged meeting Hafiz Saeed in a training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, where he and other terrorists were given commando training.
The US state department formerly has designated Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) as a foreign terrorist organisation. However, after the original designation, the LeT repeatedly changed its name in an effort to avoid sanctions. More specifically, the LeT created the Jama’at-ud-Dawa (JuD) as a front organisation for the preaching of Islam, politics, and “social work”. Consequently, the US state department placed the Hafiz Saeed-run JuD in the list of banned foreign terrorist organisations and designated Hafiz Saeed as a global terrorist. In 2012, the US offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Despite these measures, Hafiz Saeed roams freely in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s abject failure to proceed against Hafiz is sought to be justified on two grounds. Firstly, the difficulty of proceeding under preventive detention laws in the absence of evidence which can withstand strict judicial scrutiny. Secondly, according to Pakistan’s criminal jurisprudence, guilt has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and there is a paucity of requisite evidence for Hafiz’s arrest and conviction.
Apart from the legal untenability of these excuses, the critical point is that Section 153-A of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 is conveniently ignored. This section inter alia prohibits any person from making speeches which promote or incite feelings of enmity or hatred or ill-will between different communities and countries on grounds of religion or any other ground. Hafiz Saeed is neither preaching Islam nor is he a person who is engaged in social work as Pakistani authorities would have us believe.
There is ample incontrovertible evidence of Hafiz Saeed regularly spewing venom with great gusto against India and its citizens with impunity. Pakistan authorities are surely aware of the same and perhaps they are not unhappy about it. I do not favour Pakistan-bashing and believe that there is no option but dialogue between the two nuclear-armed countries. However, Pakistan’s alibi for not prosecuting Hafiz Saeed is specious. It raises serious doubts about Pakistan’s sincerity about having friendly relations with India because the people of India find it impossible to accept Pakistan’s favoured hospitable treatment of Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Is Hafiz Saeed more important to Pakistan than friendly relations with India? The ball lies in Pakistan’s court.

Woman Maoist surrenders inChhattisgarhBy: Press Trust of India | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:14 am
A dreaded woman Maoist, carrying a reward of Rs 8 lakh on her head, surrendered in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district Sunday, police said.
Sita alias Jagarbati (23) turned herself in before police citing atrocities and exploitation of female cadres by senior rebels, Dantewada SP Kamlochan Kashyap told PTI.
Associated with the outlawed CPI(Maoist) since 2010, Sita was working as a member of 2nd battalion of Mad Uttar Bastar Division in Naxal-den Abhujmad, he said, adding that she had been involved in several crimes in the region.

Alcohol warning not to apply to all films  says CBFCchiefPrint
Written by Dipti Nagpaul | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:12 am
Following the furore over statutory warnings during drinking scenes in Happy New Year, CBFC chairperson Leela Samson said the warnings were included not as a ‘rule’, but to give the film ‘U’ (universal) certificate.
Samson said the certification guidelines specify that a film ‘glorifying’ consumption of alcohol cannot be given a ‘U’ certificate, but a ‘U/A’ certificate that implies an adult should accompany a minor to the movie.
“Shah Rukh Khan was keen on a ‘U’ certificate for this film. Since there was a drinking scene, he voluntarily accepted to put the ticker warning,” Samson said.
A source from Red Chillies Entertainments, not willing to be named, accepted the CBFC chairperson’s claim, saying: “We have very happily included the warning in the film.”
The statutory warnings had triggered a furore among film personalities, with speculations that the ‘rule’ will now apply to all films.
This, at a time when the industry is protesting the existing mandatory warning that pops up when characters are shown smoking.
Samson, however, said it was not a ‘rule’, but “a warning for children”.
“This does not amount to any new diktat on part of the government or the CBFC. This will not apply to all films,” she explained.
However, CBFC’s new Regional Officer for Mumbai Rahul Vaidya’s suggestion to show the ticker has set off speculation. Two 2014 releases, Yaariyan and Kick, have scenes showing alcohol consumption, but both were cleared with a ‘U’ certificate.
In fact, never before in Hindi films has a message against drinking been included. Guests sipping from glasses was a common sight in films from the ‘60s and ‘70s. And who can forget Keshto Mukerjee, rarely seen playing sober characters, the inebriated Veeru (Dharmendra) in Sholay or the alcoholic protagonist played by Amitabh Bachchan in Sharaabi. Both Sharaabi and Sholay, ironically, have a ‘U’ certificate.
On being pointed out such points, Samson said, “You are talking about different times and different panels. Like everything in this country, variance is the name of reality.”
She added that the media unnecessarily criticised the recent move. “Vaidya thought it would be right to carry the warning, it was supported by the panel as well as Khan. Khan had the option of refusing and writing to me. But time is of the essence, so I can understand his haste,” she added.

China tells Nepal what todoChina has brazenly told Kathmandu that it is not happy about the presence of activists fomenting trouble in Tibet.
Written by Yubaraj Ghimire | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:12 am
China has sent a clear message to Nepal that it is keen to invest in the country but would like a secure environment for that. It has candidly prescribed some bilateral and internal arrangements. Chinese authorities recently told Nepal’s visiting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam that a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement (BIPPA) would encourage China to invest more, and with confidence, in Nepal.
Nepal had signed a BIPPA with India about two years ago. The least China wants is the same priority treatment from Nepal, where political instability and the prolonged transition have taken a heavy toll on development. In recent years, China has been more assertive with Nepal and has sometimes brazenly told Kathmandu that it is not happy about the presence of international activists fomenting trouble in Tibet. “They want to have an extradition treaty along with the BIPPA,” Gautam said on his return.
China is increasing its presence in Nepal, even as most Nepali citizens see very little chance of their current political leaders delivering a meaningful constitution by the January 22 deadline. Beijing is also worried that a campaign of 22 parties, led by Maoist chief Prachanda, for identity- and ethnicity-based federalism will have a direct bearing on Tibet. China has been repeatedly warning against such a federal state being endorsed during the constitution-writing process.
However, those involved in constitution-making have, till date, not discussed how the identity issue can be addressed without making it the basis of federating the state. The proponents of federalism fear that a fresh review of the issue may also reopen for debate two other crucial agendas — a republican and secular Nepal. But these issues are already being debated and a section of the Nepali Congress is set to launch a campaign for a “Hindu Nepal”.
Many political leaders, including Maoist ideologue and former PM Baburam Bhattarai, called on former king Gyanendra in hospital, where he was admitted after a heart attack. There is reliable information that representatives of other countries too have seen Gyanendra and shared their worries about Nepal’s fate. Gyanendra has displayed statesmanship, wished all parties success for the constitution-writing, while ignoring the humiliation he has been subjected to. Such conduct has made him arguably more popular than most political leaders today.
There are reports that Indian PM Narendra Modi was keen on meeting Gyanendra during his visit in August. But that might have sent a different message, since the Indian establishment treated him as persona non grata through the April 2006 transfer of power. But Modi seems to have grasped that India is being linked with the political chaos in Nepal. During the SAARC summit, Modi plans to visit to Janakpur (Sita’s birthplace), Lumbini (Buddha’s birthplace) and Jomsom, site of the Muktinath continued…

CBI arrests 3 officials of another OrissafirmPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:09 am
Close on the heels of arrests of Bollywood model Preeti Bhatia in Artha Tatwa chit fund scam, the CBI Sunday arrested three officials, including CMD Anjan Kumar Baliarsingh, of another chit fund group Nabadiganta Capital Services.
The public limited company had raised huge sums from people assuring good returns, but cheated them. Apart from Baliarsingh, CBI arrested two directors of the company — Kartikeya Parida and Pradeep Patnaik. The trio were taken to Capital Hospital for a medical check-up after which they were produced in the CBI court.
However, CBI officials were mum over the fate of BJD’s Mayurbhanj MP Ramchandra Hansda and two ex-MLAs Subarna Nayak of BJD and Hitesh Bagarti of BJP who were interrogated Sunday for the second time in a week over their role in the Nabadiganta scam. All the three were directors with the company.
Incidentally, Hansda during the questioning Sunday, said the Rs 28 lakh in cash found from his house during a raid in July belonged to his supporters. In the previous round of interrogation, Hansda had said it was his own money and not the deposits of Nabadignata investors.
The BJD MP said he had been persuaded to join Nabadiganta Capital Services as a director by its CMD Baliarsingh, but resigned once it became a public limited company in 2013. He said he had neither invested money with the company, nor received any remuneration as a director. Nayak, too, said he had did not get any money as a director. Former Nuapada MLA Hitesh Bagarti, on the other hand, said he invested Rs 3-4 lakh in the company, but didn’t get a return.

A way out ofalienationComprising 10.6 per cent of the state’s population, Muslims have never had more than 12 MLAs.
Written by Jyoti Punwani | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:08 am
Many seemingly contradictory conclusions have emerged from the recent assembly polls. Self-styled spokesmen of the Muslim community may have railed against the Congress’s continuous treatment of their community as a captive vote bank. Yet, according to the Lokniti-CSDS poll published in The Indian Express (‘Behind BJP, Upper Castes, OBCs and Rich’, October 21), 53 per cent of Muslims voted for the party. If the figures are to be believed, these “spokesmen” need to get in touch with their own community at the grassroots. Again, notwithstanding the continuing arrests of Muslims on terror charges under the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-controlled state home ministry, Sharad Pawar’s party got the second highest percentage of the Muslim vote: 16 per cent. Five candidates from the Congress and one from the NCP got elected.
What explains this continuing trust among almost 70 per cent of Maharashtra’s Muslims in the two parties that have ruled them for 15 years, but done little for them? Could it be the enduring legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru, seen as the architect of our secularism? Or of Indira Gandhi, still remembered by elderly Muslims as a friend of the poor, thanks to her rural welfare schemes? Could it be the fear of the Sena-BJP, which the “secular” parties, especially the oldest of them, the Congress, have always invoked to keep Muslims under their wing? For the average Muslim in Maharashtra, Narendra Modi invokes the same fear and loathing that former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray did.
This fear was played up to the hilt during the Lok Sabha campaign, again by self-styled Muslim “leaders” (with generous Congress backing), who were alarmed at the way their youth was deserting its “secular protectors” and turning to Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party in droves. But six months later, many of the same “leaders” were rooting for Modi and Uddhav Thackeray, to “teach the Congress-NCP a lesson that they can’t take us for granted”. For the first time, the BJP won 13 per cent of the Muslim vote, even more than the Shiv Sena’s 11 per cent. Even the strident “love jihad” and “Hindutva-is-India’s-identity” campaign by the BJP/ RSS in the four months of Modi’s rule at the Centre didn’t drive Maharashtra’s Muslims away completely.
Why did one-fourth of them vote for the saffron parties?
The Congress is primarily responsible. It has ruled the state since its formation in 1960, except for two brief intervals. Recurring communal riots, benevolence towards both Hindu rioters and the partisan police, and arrests, torture and prolonged imprisonment without trial of young Muslims for alleged acts of terror, have left the community seething. Indifference of and discrimination by the state, especially the bureaucracy, have led to 59 per cent of them living below the poverty line, in ghettos, lagging behind in education and employment — findings of the Mehmood-ur-Rehman Committee, continued…

At least nine persons were killed – five of them women – and 26 others injured when a night bus run by the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) went off the highway and fell into a small river in Nagaon district in central Assam late last night.
Nagaon district SP Arabinda Kalita said the ill-fated bus was on its way from North Lakhimpur in eastern Assam to Guwahati when the accident occurred. Majority of the passengers were on their way to catch a train in Guwahati today morning en route to Lucknow and other places for visiting some places of pilgrimage.

“The bus which had also picked up some other passengers on the way must have lost control following which it hit the railings of a bridge and fell into a small river. While eight persons had died on the spot, one person died on being shifted to a hospital,” SP Kalita said. The accident occurred at village Uluwoni under Kaliabor police station at around 1:30 AM, after having traveled about two kilometers after crossing the Kaliabhomora bridge on the Brahmaputra.
Eight of the dead have been identified as Pranita Dutta, Jogen Barua, Padumi Barua, Nila Bora, Dhanada Saikia, Kusha Gogoi (driver), Ananda Bora and his wife Nilima Bora. While 26 others who were rescued by local villagers and sent to local hospitals at Kaliabor and Nagaon, 10 of them were later shifted to Guwahati Medical College Hospital here.
Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is currently in New Delhi, has ordered an inquiry to be conducted by the secretary of the state transport department. The state government also announced ex-gratia to the next of kin of those killed and announced free treatment to those who sustained injuries.
 

China tests new generation of military aircr...Liberation Army
(China is testing a new generation…)
BEIJING: China is testing a new generation of military aircraft which includes the country's first and most advanced stealth fighter believed to form the backbone of its air force.
The photos of fourth-generation stealth fighter J20, Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&CS) aircraft KJ-500 and Y-20 large military transporter, reportedly conducting tests flights, were published on a popular military forum, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
The internet user who uploaded the images identified the plane models and said "these pictures were taken recently at Yanliang Flight Centre ", a military airport in Xian, Shaanxi province.
The photos appeared to have been taken from some distance outside the airbase's exterior fences.
Military enthusiasts often take photographs of People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft and share the images on internet, the report said.
Previous media reports have said that the aircraft supposedly featured in the photographs are still in the testing phase and could be a few years away from deployment.
However, they are projected to serve as the backbone of the PLA Air Force once they are given the green light.
The J20, designed and built in China, is the country's first stealth fighter and the PLA's most advanced military jet.
It is reportedly capable of covering the vast South China Sea within its combat range, the Post report said.
The Y-20, China's biggest self-built military transport plane, is expected to serve the air force's need to transport large amounts of heavy military weaponry, while the KJ-500 is the nation's new generation of AEW&CS that provides early radar warnings to combat troops to give them an edge in potential future battles.

1 000-hr Assam district bandh: Nagaland seeks CentreshelpPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:29 am
The 1,000-hour bandh in Karbi Anglong district of Assam beginning Monday has caused serious concern in Nagaland with its Chief Minister TR Zeliang seeking Centre’s intervention so that the road communication to the adjoining hill state is not cut off.
Zeliang has written a letter to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh saying the proposed bandh would cut off road communication and affect supply of essential items, including foodgrain, medicine, petroleum products to Nagaland as well as Manipur. A 23-km stretch of NH 29, which is the only lifeline for Nagaland and Manipur, passes through Karbi Anglong district where bandhs and incidents of violence take place frequently.
The 1,000-hour bandh has been called by Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State (JACAS) of Karbi Anglong demanding creation of an autonomous state out of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, the two hill districts of Assam.
Zeliang said frequent bandhs in the Assam district has always caused endless problems to Nagaland and Manipur, and the affected states are not even remotely connected to the issues raised during most of these bandhs.
In a meeting of the Northeast chief ministers held in Guwahati on August 21, Nagaland had specifically raised the issue of frequent bandhs in Assam. Zeliang had also called upon Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju to take up the issue of frequent bandhs seriously.
Meanwhile, Karbi Anglong Deputy Commissioner PK Buragohain said the district authorities would ensure free movement of vehicles, including those bound for Nagaland and Manipur, by providing armed escorts on the national highway. “We will ensure that no disruption occurs on NH 29,” he said.
A spokesman of JACAS said the 1,000-hour bandh has been called in order to press for resumption of talks with Centre on the issue of creating an autonomous state encompassing the two 6th Schedule hill districts of Assam and introduction of a Bill in Parliament for creation of the autonomous state in the Winter Session. “We want the Government of India to finalise the structure of the autonomous state on the basis of the proposal submitted by JACAS on November 6, 2013 to the Ministry of Home Affairs,” JACAS said.

I first met Lucian in 1990 at his home in Holland Park. I had just started working for James Kirkman, Lucian’s dealer at the time. The studio, where he lived, was on the top floor. After that first meeting he would phone me every morning. A couple of weeks later he invited me round again. He always kept the door from his flat to the actual studio closed but he asked me in. Two rooms had been knocked into one and a skylight had been added. There was something both worldly and grand. Because it was still and quiet, there was the feeling that something was going on with a definite sense of purpose – something to be taken very seriously. For me, the studio had relevance and vitality. It was a place that made you reflect.
More
Air-conditioning that’s cheap. Cool!
When I first spent time there I thought I would never need to travel anywhere else because in this place I could find everything. It offered a perspective on one’s own circumstances.
There were two easels with large paintings on them of a naked man, Leigh Bowery, and an iron single bed with the green-and-white-striped mattress. In the corner was the sink, which I had only seen before in paintings. Two trolleys were stacked high and overflowing with tubes of paints. Cotton rags for cleaning brushes and palettes, made from discarded hotel linen, lay in mountainous piles on the studio floor beside boxes full of new and used brushes. The room smelled of genuine turpentine and linseed oil. The walls were covered in semi-dry, clotted paint scraped from his palette when he cleaned. The paint was left to dry, building up over many years like deposits of guano on rock. He also used any bare wall to scribble reminders about a particular painting, phone numbers or paint colours that were running low. I would come to check the walls as a kind of ongoing diary.
You have to trust what you see and what you feel . . . I never put anything into a painting that I don’t actually see when I’m painting . . . I am always reacting to what is there. You have the person in front of you and you are trying to relay something of who the person is as a physical and emotional presence
- Lucian Freud
Portrait of David Dawson Holland Park, 1996
I had been seeing Lucian every morning for six years before he asked me to sit for a painting. At the first sitting Lucian said he would prefer it if I was lying on the bed and naked. His initial idea was to make the painting a group portrait and he had asked Henrietta, another painter, to sit. He also wanted to include his whippet, Pluto. He chose a tall, thin portrait canvas. When he started drawing he placed me across the canvas and asked Henrietta to stand at the foot of the bed. Within a short time he decided to paint us individually and began a fresh canvas for Henrietta. He then concentrated on my head and shoulders. Pluto was curled up under my arm and the painting became a double portrait. Lucian loved fur and skin. He always tried to catch a scene rather than compose it.

Speaking to [Freud’s friend, the art critic] Bill Feaver, Lucian had said, “If I’m putting someone in a picture I like to feel that they’ve fallen asleep there, or they’ve elbowed their own way in. They are there not to make the picture easy on the eye or more pleasant . . . ” He liked things to look awkward in the way that life looks awkward. The idea of a story didn’t bother him as he thought “everything’s a story”.

To paint the portrait of the Queen we set up an easel in a small restoration studio used for the Royal Collection in St James’s Palace. Lucian thought the light was lovely. He felt it created a sympathetic atmosphere. The Queen was very generous and cleared her calendar for the amount of time that would suit Lucian and give him every chance to complete the painting. Henrietta Edwards, a courtier, stepped in as the model when it came for the diadem to be painted. The following year he painted Henrietta’s portrait, “Woman with Eyes Closed”.

[The art dealer] Jay Jopling and [Rijksmuseum director of collections] Taco Dibbits arranged for Lucian to come to Amsterdam to see the Rembrandts at the time when the Rijksmuseum was closed for renovation. We also saw the Van Gogh self-portrait out of its frame, which was an extraordinary moment, but Lucian was back in his studio painting that evening.

He painted with an intense determination to get things right. Cautious in every statement he made, Lucian’s truthfulness was precise, always surprising, stimulating, deeply felt and thoughtful. He would fight firmly for every point he believed in and for what he asked from a work of art, never making any concession to help his painting. As a sitter you held the position of being passive, with Lucian continually encouraging you. He made you feel that you were understood by him. He could not be shocked by any confession or by anything said. He was immensely interested in other people. There was always a sense of balance around Lucian.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today appreciated Hrithik Roshan for participating in 'Swachh Bharat' campaign, saying the actor's "significant effort" will inspire people to join the ambitious campaign.
"Am sure you all will get inspired by @iHrithik's efforts! He has made a significant effort towards creating a Swachh Bharat. #MyCleanIndia," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
Modi also re-tweeted photographs showing the actor leading a group of people in clearing garbage at a street in Juhu in Mumbai.

(Gulf carrier Etihad tonight…)
MUMBAI: Gulf carrier Etihad tonight said it plans to take on lease two Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft from India's Jet Airways, in which it holds 24 per cent stake.
The Abu Dhabi-based carrier scotched speculation that it was not interested in leasing planes from its foreign equity partner in India.
"We already have two Boeing 777-300ERs and two Airbus A330-200s in operations under dry lease from Jet Airways and are finalising plans to introduce further two aircraft before the end of the year," Etihad said in a statement.
Earlier, sources in Jet said Etihad had indicated of not going ahead with leasing of Boeing 777-300 ERs from the Naresh Goyal-promoted carrier.
Three of Jet's Boeing 777-300 ERs were with Turkish Airlines and had recently come back to the Indian carrier after completing their lease period.
Jet was earlier planning to induct these wide-bodied planes on its international routes. However, after Etihad's proposal, it shelved the plan.
Etihad picked up 24 per cent stake in the Mumbai-based carrier for over Rs 2,060 crore last year, making it the first FDI in the Indian aviation sector.
Jet had announced in August it aims to turn profitable in the next three years and was planning a major overhaul of its fleet and products.
India's second-largest airline had reported a standalone net loss of Rs 217.65 crore for Q1 FY15, down 39 per cent from the year-ago period.
The airline has been facing a tough time from its pilots as well as the regulator DGCA for quite some time now.
DGCA recently suspended two Jet pilots after issuing notices to 131 pilots for not meeting mandatory licensing requirements.
The airline has over 1,000 pilots and its subsidiary JetLite about 190.

electricity production and distribution
The Centre’s plans to supply electricity 24/7 to all parts of India in five years has opened up vast opportunities for power and automation companies such as ABB, GE, Schneider Electric and few others. These companies have expertise in setting up micro grids that have emerged as a practical solution to provide electricity to off-grid and inaccessible areas.
The opportunity is so huge that ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer at a recently held global analysts’ conference mentioned about India, the only country he named in his two-hour presentation, as an attractive market where the company can play a larger role as a micro grid solution provider. He said sill thousands of villages across the country remained without power and micro grid was the answer to this problem.
Globally, ABB has designed and delivered solutions for more than 80 micro grids, for a wide range of applications including one at Kodiak Island in Alaska, the second largest island in the United States, which operates a micro grid that generates 28 MW of electricity from hydropower and wind for a population of 15,000. The same could be implemented in India to provide power in remote areas in a time bound manner, experts said.
The notation of micro grids came from the availability of renewable power and due to demand of electricity from remote areas. These are grid-independent self-sufficient grids in remote areas where one uses diesel together with renewable energy to generate power for a targeted population.
Typically, a micro grid of 2-3 MW capacity could cater to 5,000 households, experts said, adding that a micro grid comprised power generation system, energy storage facility and the load management system.
A micro grid can cater to a cluster of 2-3 households (10 kilowatts) to up 10 MW, which can feed power to 25,000 households.
“When we look at India you can have several benefits. You actually get power in remote areas and secondly you increase the availability of power through micro grids.
“Nano grids, which comprises a water pump and solar panels, are already up and running in India but micro grids will come up soon. We are pretty confident about the Indian government’s vision to provide power to all,” said an expert.
Micro grid as a concept may be young, but it holds the key to lighting and digitally connecting millions of lives.

It s Not IQ Versus Emotional Intelligencereddit
The CEO of one of the world's largest financial companies told me, "I hire the best and brightest -- but I still get a Bell Curve for performance." Why aren't the smartest MBAs from top schools all highly successful on the job?
The answer lies in the interplay between IQ and emotional intelligence -- and explains why you need both for high performance.
More than a century of research shows IQ is the best predictor of the job you can get and hold. It takes a high ability level in handling cognitive complexity to be in a profession like medicine, a C-suite executive, or a professor at a prestigious business school.
Then why the dismay of that CEO?
The more your success on the job depends on relating to people -- whether in sales, as a team member, or as a leader -- the more emotional intelligence matters. A high-enough IQ is necessary, but not enough, to be a star performer.
Just as is true for IQ, there are many models of emotional intelligence . In mine there are two main parts: self-mastery and social intelligence. The purely cognitive jobs require self-mastery -- e.g., cognitive control, the ability to focus on the task at hand and ignore distractions.
But the second half of emotional intelligence, social adeptness, holds the key to that CEO's question. As long as those super-smart MBAs are working by themselves, their IQ and self-mastery makes them high performers. But the minute they have to mesh on a team, meet clients, or lead, that skill set falls short. They also need social intelligence.
Claudio Fernandez-Aroaz , former head of research at Egon Zehnder International, spent decades hiring C-level executives for global companies. When he studied why some of those executives ended up being fired, he found that while they had been hired for their intelligence and business expertise -- they were fired for a lack of emotional intelligence . Though they were smart, they were bullies or otherwise inept at people management.
Along the same lines, my colleague Richard Boyatzis , professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western University, has found that the vast majority of leadership competencies that predict the performance of sales leaders are based on emotional and social intelligence -- not cognitive intelligence (like IQ).
Then there's a brand new meta-analysis of 132 different research studies involving more than 27,000 people, which I heard reported on by a co-author, Ronald Humphreys, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. That yet-to-be published analysis concluded emotionally intelligent leaders have the most satisfied employees -- if you like your boss, you're more likely to like your job ( just contemplate the opposite, morbid reality ).
And reviewing all peer-reviewed research to date, the same study says emotional intelligence has been found to boost:

Raising a glass to the business of wineStudents raise a glass to the business of wine

The wine industry is becoming increasingly complex
A glass of wine is a way to relax after a day’s studying for many MBA students. But at Sonoma State University, which has been building links between its campus, north of San Francisco, and the wineries of Napa Valley, the business of producing the fermented grape is a growing opportunity for executive training.
Sonoma is one of a handful of business schools around the world to offer specialist wine industry MBAs. Other programmes are run in France, Germany and Australia.

MBA pair finds way to save clients’ money
Such has been the demand for these courses at Sonoma that the business school is to run a new executive MBA programme from its main campus and expand its wine industry research operation. The plan is to build upon Sonoma’s existing wine executive MBA programme, run in partnership with Napa Valley Vintners, creating places for an additional 100 students.
Sonoma is creating a wine institute building with classrooms that are designed for more flexible learning and video conferencing with experts around the world. It is looking to appoint a wine business chair and to fund more research into the changing shape of the global wine industry.
Demand for executive training is being driven by growth in wine production, especially in Asian markets, according to John Stayton, executive director of graduate programmes at Sonoma. “Over the last 20 years the wine industry has become increasingly global and increasingly complex,” he says.
China is the fastest growing market for wine consumption and the sixth largest wine producer, according to International Wine and Spirits Research. It estimated that 2.2bn bottles of wine were sold in China in 2013, making it the fifth-largest wine market by sales and the largest market for red wine.
Sonoma’s aim, says Mr Stayton, is “to become the global wine business programme”. Its existing wine MBA programme has attracted students from Chile, China and Argentina, Mr Stayton notes. They work with Kokomo Winery and Timber Crest Farms to learn how to market and sell wine. The hope is that the new programme will attract more students from outside the US.
Among those who have taken up the wine MBA programme at Sonoma is Christian Ahlmann, whose parents own the Six Sigma winery in California. Mr Ahlmann was keen to follow in his parents’ footsteps but his first instinct was not to get an MBA but a bachelors degree in agriculture. “I figured, it’s about learning to grow things. That was obviously a true assumption, but growing plants is only half of the game.”
While he mastered the production of the grape, he found himself woefully short on commercial knowledge. He resorted to ploughing through business books to communicate with his accountant and to understand best practices on human resources and marketing.
“Soon I realised that an MBA would give me a serious competitive advantage in the wine industry,” he says.
Sonoma’s focus on the wine industry is a big deal, Mr Ahlmann notes, because the market has some unique aspects. For example, wine producers only receive stock once a year, so it is no use if the sales team exceeds expectations because doing so will only mean a company runs out of inventory before the next vintage is ready.
“I got a real appreciation for the value of financial statements and how to interpret them,” adds Mr Ahlmann. “It was like being handed the rule book on a game and the MBA programme was able to decode it.”
After completing the financial statement class, Mr Ahlmann replaced his company’s accountancy firm.
“I found that I communicated much better with them,” [the new firm], he says. “We have become considerably more profitable since I learnt the value and application of numbers.”
A big selling point of Sonoma to Mr Ahlmann, apart from its relative proximity to his family’s winery, was the fact that it incorporates several instructors from nearby Silicon Valley. Although Mr Ahlmann’s family has been running Six Sigma’s 4,000-acre estate since 2000, he claims the business is still in “start-up” mode.
He also liked the way that the teaching staff used real-world examples. One professor, a consultant to Napa Valley wineries, presented the students with a handful of his own consulting jobs. The students then solved these case studies and presented their findings to the proprietors, with supervision from the professor.
“Another professor scratched out the names on an $800m acquisition his company was considering, presented the details to the class and led us through a lively debate evaluating the pros and cons of making the deal,” Mr Ahlmann recalls. “It doesn’t get more real than that.

Tharoor lauds PM again for bringing sanitation toforefrontPrint
Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:35 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 2:39 am
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appreciating the clean-up campaign he launched in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram a day ago. He also lauded Modi for catapulting the sanitation programme to the “forefront of the national consciousness.”
Tharoor was recently removed from the post of Congress spokesperson after the Kerala unit of the party sought action against him for his praise of Modi and his support to Swachh Bharat initiative.
Disregarding the opposition he faced, Tharoor launched the cleanliness drive at Vizhinjam coast on Saturday, which was promptly acknowledged by Modi who called Tharoor’s effort a “great effort” and tweeted that Tharoor’s “active participation in the Swachh Bharat mission is very encouraging”.
On Sunday, Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive. “Thank you narendramodi ji. Here’s a video of my clean-up & a request to you,” he tweeted. The request was for central assistance to clean up a polluted water body — Parvathy Puthanar — in Thiruvananthapuram. Tharoor, however, said that his action has no political significance.
“To my mind there is no political significance to this event. I didn’t see it as a political activity. But rather to me it was part of a national mission. After all, it was Mahatma Gandhi who declared before Independence that sanitation was more important than Independence… The first Congress government of India led by Jawaharlal Nehru gave the nation its first rural sanitation programme.
The NDA under (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee turned it into a total sanitation programme. The UPA government under Manmohan Singh expanded and enlarged this progamme. And I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has continued the UPA’s good work by re-baptising it as Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and raising it to the forefront of the national consciousness,” Tharoor said in his video message.
His Twitter bonhomie with Modi has once again raised the hackles of his partymen.
Senior Congress leader from Kerala K Muraleedharan said: “It could be because of his (Tharoor’s) political immaturity. He could have done all this before Modi’s announcement. He ceased to be a minister four five months ago. He could have led the cleanliness drive immediately after that. He could have done it when the Kerala government launched the clean Kerala mission.”

India set to install cameras along border withChinaPrint
Written by Vijaita Singh | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:32 am
India is set to install high resolution surveillance cameras along the “unmanned pockets” on its border with China in a bid to to guard its territory better. This comes in the wake of a recent face-off with the Chinese Army. The cameras will be put up at 50 locations along the border with China in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh.
A senior official said the cameras would provide live-feed in a range of 20-25 km, and plans are afoot to live stream the footage at the Delhi headquarters. “We recently did a trial run of these surveillance cameras at Thakung (in Ladakh). It was successful and it provided us video footage of a wide area,” said Subhash Goswami, DG, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). He also said the ITBP had approached the Ministry of Home Affairs for approval to set up 54 more border outposts in Arunachal Pradesh.
The DG said that incursions by China into Ladakh during President Xi Jinping’s visit were “uncommon” as they had gone on for a fortnight. “It was uncommon as normally such incidents do not last for more than 10-15 minutes. When they come, we show them a banner telling them that the territory is India’s and ask them to go back. They normally do. But this time the incident lasted for long,” Goswami said.
“The incidents in the past occurred due to the difference in the perception regarding the border,” he said. He added that lack of infrastructure and surveillance equipment were “challenges” they faced regularly in the areas.

Rift in Apna DalwidensPrint
Written by Hamza Khan | Lucknow | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:32 am | Updated: October 29, 2014 1:45 pm
The rift in Apna Dal created due to a family feud seems to have widened with Anupriya Patel, one of the two party MPs, deciding to skip the party’s upcoming foundation day celebrations in Varanasi on November 4. Anupriya will, instead, attend a separate programme in Allahabad to mark the occasion.
The simmering rift in the party had surfaced earlier this month when Mirzapur MP Anupriya had called a press conference in Lucknow and had questioned her mother and party’s national president Krishna Patel’s decision to elevate her elder sister Pallavi Patel as party vice-president. She had termed the decision as “illegal and arbitrary”.
Krishna, however, has said Pallavi remains the party vice-president. “Yes she is the party vice-president and will remain so,” said Krishna, who is overseeing preparations in Varanasi. “Pallavi, national general secretary Seth Jagdish, national treasurer Kailash and other senior party functionaries will be present in Varanasi rally where we are aiming to bring at least 50,000 supporters,” Krishna said. On Anupriya’s participation in Varanasi rally, Krishna said “she hasn’t confirmed her presence”.
Anupriya, meanwhile, confirmed to The Indian Express that she will be participating in the programme at Allahabad and will not be attending the one in Varanasi.
“I have been visiting Varanasi but haven’t visited Allahabad for some time, which is a significant place for the party. So I have chosen to attend the programme there,” she said.
“The programme will be organised at Allahabad’s K P Community Centre on November 4 and Anupriya will be present there as the chief guest,” said Jawahar Lal Patel, who is one of the two claimants to the post of party’s Allahabad district president.
Party’s state general secretary Asharam Verma, national general secretaries Neel Ratan Patel, Rajendra Pal, national committee members Chandra Pratap, Awadh Naresh Verma, Dharm Raj Patel and others will also attend the Allahabad programme. Party state president and Vishwanathganj MLA R K Verma too said he has chosen Allahabad over Varanasi.
However, Phoolchand Patel, the other claimant to the post, said that “Krishna Patel has called a rally in Varanasi and has asked the district units to be there, so we are preparing to take several buses of supporters there”.
Founded in 1995 by Anupriya’s father Sone Lal Patel, Apna Dal rose to prominence in recent parliamentary elections by allying with the BJP and winning its first two parliamentary seats Mirzapur and Pratapgarh. After Sone Lal’s death in 2009, Krishna was made national president of the party, while his younger daughter Anupriya was made national general secretary. She had won 2012 assembly election from Rohaniya seat in Varanasi, which she vacated this year after getting elected to Lok Sabha. Her mother unsuccessfully contested the Rohaniya assembly bypolls.

Letters that tell story of Bapu and Miras troubledrelationshipPrint
Written by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:29 am
January 24, 1929, Muzaffarpur: Beloved Bapu — And now today I have your long Monday letter! How spoiled I am!!
October 27, 1928, Sevashram, Benares: But after all, my beloved Bapu knows everything that is in my head — he knows even better then I know myself!
April 7, 1933, Sabarmati Central Prison, Ahmedabad: “I hear you have got a telescope now-a-days! I once looked at the stars and planets through a very small one of my uncle’s & even that was a wonderful sight. Every night as I look at the starts I think how you, too, must be looking at them from Yervada — and I feel, in my mind’s fancy as if I saw you in the reflection of their light.”
These are excerpts from ‘Beloved Bapu: The Gandhi-Mirabehn Correspondence’, a book by Tridip Suhrud and Thomas Weber that claims to bring out for the first time letters between Gandhi and Madeline Slade or Mira, the daughter of a British admiral who became the Mahatma’s disciple.
The book, on this companionship of 23 years, says on the flap, “Mira and Gandhi shared a connection that was as close and loving as it was troubled. She was a woman of tremendous industry and drive, a quality that Gandhi grasped and admired greatly. However, he was also deeply ambivalent about the obsessive nature of her love — indeed, her infatuation — chastising her sharply for her “idolatry” on the one hand, and apologising for his harshness and keeping her close on the other.”
Suhrud is director, Sabarmati Memorial Trust and a Sahitya Akademi winner who is known as a new age “authority” on Gandhian studies. Weber is an Australia-based author who teaches political science and has written several books on Gandhi.
The letters from Gandhi published in the book are already in public domain while those from Mira are being revealed for the first time; they are under the custody of Sabarmati Ashram.
Most of the letters are a mundane detailing of their daily life — from their trips to a number of places and even the problems that this causes to their diet, some inducing constipation — and yet the book reveals some intimate moments, especially the “unfulfilled” wish of Mira who had longed for a “life in the Himalaya with her dearest Bapu”.
In one letter, Gandhi tells Mira that he prefers to write “love letters” on Mondays, which Mira awaits impatiently.
There are even some Hindi lessons for Mira. “The negative participle should always go with the verb, when the verb is to be negative and when the subject has to be qualified by a long phrase, the qualifying phrase should precede the subject,” Gandhi writes from Bangalore on July 17, 1927.
In a chapter in the book titled, “A Catch-22 relationship” the editors note: “Some may argue that there could have been some element of latent or repressed sexuality involved. Certainly some of his letters to Mira do sound like love letters as hers to him undoubtedly were.”
The letters of Mira are more revealing than continued…

One Man s Weakness Is Another Man s Strengthreddit
If we ask the people closest to us to name our unique qualities, we may or may not be surprised by what they say. The reason they adore us may be the very same reason others criticize us. What one person defines strength, another defines weakness.
No one loves to admit weakness. That's because we've been conditioned to view strengths at one end of the spectrum and weaknesses at the other. One positive and one negative. One an area of excellence, and the other, an area of improvement. When did these become polar opposites?
We're taught to isolate our weaknesses and associate them with failure; we believe that unless we change, this failure is inevitable. So we conform and part with our authentic self, only to meet disappointment.
Do these examples sound familiar? The kid that couldn't sit still and disrupted class becomes a successful entrepreneur. The socially awkward loner, who annoyingly sets the exam curve, becomes a world-class scientist.
These people are the lucky ones. Instead of downplay a quality to "fit in," they embrace it. However, many of us choose the path to conformity. It is easier, more accepting, and unfortunately, less rewarding.
It's natural to label people a certain way in a certain situation, but weaknesses and strengths are words we use to disguise arbitrary borders we set. We take these labels too literally. To do so is both ignorant and one-dimensional. Thankfully, our world is multi-dimensional, and so are we.
The moment we shift our view, we realize that our biggest "weakness" has the greatest potential to become our defining strength.
Many of us are asked this popular behavioral question during an interview: what is your greatest weakness? We take said "weakness," flip it upside-down, and highlight it as a vital benefit for the team and the company. If we actually applied this mentality to our everyday life, we'd begin to see our lives play out differently.
Sometimes we need to take a step back and ask ourselves are we unrealistic or imaginative? Lazy or uninspired? Confrontational or vocal? We all share the same collection of traits; we just call them different things.
Weaknesses are both subjective and situational. Under the right circumstances, our abilities are close to limitless. The question becomes not how to change ourselves, but rather where we can thrive.
Once we answer this question, it's like a domino effect. One success after another begins to practically fall in our laps; this is the moment we learn to effectively harness our natural abilities in the right situations.
Whether we apply this concept to our personal or professional lives, it's a powerful one. Do you have a shortcoming or an opportunity? It's up to you.

Xiaomi to set up local servers to address c...Amazon
(Jain told ET that the company…)
Xiaomi's India head Manu Jain intends to tackle all issues regarding security concerns, some of which have cropped up after the Indian Air Force issued a directive to its personnel, warning them against buying the popular Red Mi 1s. Jain told ET that the company that has sold over 400,000 smartphones within a quarter of launch in India plans to set up local servers. Edited excerpts:
The Indian Air Force has cautioned its personnel and their family members against buying Xiaomi smartphones, since they apparently send user information to servers China and hence be a security threat. What is Xiaomi doing to address this issue?
We do not have full information about the circular issued by IAF, however we believe that this advisory circular is based on events about 3 months back. We believe, it refers to the F-Secure test done on the Redmi 1S in July 2014 about the activation of our Cloud Messaging service by default. We immediately addressed the concerns raised by F-Secure. We scheduled a system update on 10th Aug 2014 to implement a change, which ensured that all the users had to manually activate the Cloud services, instead of being activated by default. After the upgrade, new users or users who factory reset their devices can enable the service by "settings" section. Once users have activated the services, they also have an option to turn it off at any point of time. This change was directly acknowledged by F-Secure, they confirmed that their concerns were addressed. We would be happy to talk to IAF to explain the entire situation to them. I am confident that we would be able to resolve any concerns or questions that they might be having.
Is Xiaomi planning to set up data centers in India?
Yes, we do have plans to have data centres in India - maybe in 2015. Since early 2014, we have been migrating our services and corresponding data for Indian users from our Beijing data centers to Amazon AWS data centers in Singapore and USA. This migration will be fully completed by the end of the year. This helps improve the performance of our services and also provide some peace of mind for users in India in ensuring that we treat their data with the utmost care and will always maintain the highest privacy standards.
When the MIUI 6 is coming to India?
We do not have a confirmed date yet. This might be sometime early next year.
Do you feel security concerns may impact views of potential buyers?
I would really like to clarify a few key points regarding Indian Air Force's circular - Xiaomi does not collect any information without user permission. We offer various Internet-based services such as Mi Cloud and Cloud Messaging which require data to be stored in the cloud. Mi Cloud enables users to back-up and manage personal information in the cloud, as well as sync to other devices. Cloud Messaging service allows users to exchange text messages with each other free of SMS charges, by routing messages via IP instead of using the carrier's SMS gateway. First, all these services are opt-in. Mi Cloud is turned off by default. Users must log in with their Mi accounts and manually turn on Mi Cloud. Users can also turn it off at any point of time. Second, when the data is sent to the cloud, we take rigorous precautions to ensure that all data is secured when uploaded to Xiaomi servers and is not stored beyond the time required. Strict encryption algorithms are implemented to protect user privacy. This is no different from other cloud back up services. If users want, they can use cloud services from Google , Dropbox and many others. Third, Xiaomi never uploads photos, text messages, or any other data without the user's consent. The storage of data in Mi Cloud fully respects the local laws of each country and region.

Pro-Pak protest march on Kashmir in UK fizzl...Bilawal Bhutto
(The so-called 'Million…)
LONDON: A protest march by a UK-based pro-Pakistan group on the Kashmir issue in the heart of London today fizzled out as barely a few hundred protesters gathered to wave placards and flags.
The so-called 'Million March' from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street descended into chaos as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stepped on to the makeshift stage to speak.
The crowd began booing and throwing empty plastic bottles and refused to let him speak.
"This march was to be about Kashmir and for the welfare of Kashmiris. Bilawal has no business being here," said a group of angry protesters who had travelled from Derby in the East Midlands region of England.
The march was led by Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, referred to as a former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was supported by Mirpuri-origin British parliamentarian Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham.
While the group had claimed overwhelming support from various communities for the march, others had dismissed it as against the "national interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir ".
A counter-protest held by a rival group yesterday ended with memorandums submitted for the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their high commissions here.
The memorandums urged both India and Pakistan to "respect the fundamental human rights of all citizens of Jammu and Kashmir".

A news report  a murder  a cops arrest: Keralas gripping crimestoryPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Kollam | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:49 am
It started with a news report that targeted a few police officers, took a nasty turn with an assault on the journalist who wrote it, hit the headlines with the murder of a gangster, and continues to make news with the recent arrest of a DySP who was once a former UN peacekeeper in Kosovo.
In news-hungry Kerala, this is one crime story that simply won’t get over.
The sequence of events triggered by a report published in a leading Malayalam newspaper in 2009 about an alleged party thrown by a liquor contractor and attended by police officers has also exposed the nexus between law enforcement officers and criminal elements in the state.
Today, the case is being probed by the CBI which has arrested two officers. And in a final twist, investigators now believe the original report that triggered it all may have been a false one.
The latest arrest was that of DySP S Santhosh Nair, on charges of conspiring to kill gang leader “Happy” Rajesh, who allegedly led the attack on V B Unnithan, the journalist.
Based on interviews with police and CBI officials involved in investigating the case, here are the primary facts:
October 13, 2009: The Kollam edition of Mathrubhumi publishes a report filed by Unnithan which alleges that a few police officers, including Nair, attended a party hosted by a liquor contractor at a government guesthouse the night before. The report alleges that the party, also attended by a few TV actors, witnessed “immoral activity” by guests. The report led to a probe by state police following which Nair, then a circle inspector, was shunted out of Kollam for a few months.
December 2010: Mathrubhumi publishes another report by Unnithan, alleging that another DySP N Abdul Rasheed, then the president of the Kerala Police Officers Association, had pulled the emergency chain of the Rajdhani Express in which he was travelling back from Goa so that he could alight at Kollam where the train did not have a stop. The report alleges that Rasheed was travelling with his family, his friend DySP Nair and family, and their common businessman friend S Santhosh Kumar alias Container Santhosh.
April 16, 2011: Unnithan is attacked in Kollam while returning from work. The attackers break Unnithan’s legs, hands and a few ribs. They abuse Unnithan for filing a “wrong report” about the assets of a UDF candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections.
April 27, 2011: Rajesh, the leader of a criminal gang, is found murdered inside his autorickshaw.
The thread connecting these incidents is being probed by CBI in the form of three investigations: the attack on Babu Kumar, the assault on Unnithan, and the murder of Rajesh. The CBI was called in to investigate these cases by the Kerala High Court following two separate pleas, by Kumar and Rajesh’s wife Bindu.
The latest headline was created by the arrest of Nair, 46, who is under suspension, having already been arrested by Kerala police in connection with the attack on Unnithan. CBI had earlier arrested Rasheed, who was in fact continued…

Membership drive exposes friction in ChhattisgarhCongressPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:37 am
Power tussles among Chhattisgarh Congress leaders has again come out in the open, thanks to the state unit’s membership drive. The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) is set to hold elections to its various posts, including those of president and general secretary, next year. So, senior leaders are looking to rope in new members under their wing so that they can influence the selection of the new PCC leadership.
Leading the pack is former chief minister Ajit Jogi, who has asked the PCC to provide him as many as 20,000 booklets of membership forms, each booklet containing 25 forms. The present PCC, led by state party chief Bhupesh Baghel has refused to give him the booklets, causing an open confrontation.
During the last Congress membership drive in Chhattisgarh a few years ago, the party had only enlisted 3.95 lakh members. Jogi, who has been sidelined by the party over the years, now seeks to make as many as 5 lakh members on his own and capture the PCC next year. Also, taking a cue from Jogi, other leaders like Mohammad Akbar have also asked for a huge number of booklets.
The PCC has pointed out that Jogi’s demand is untenable as according to the party constitution, a leader can be given a maximum of 100 booklets or 2,500 forms. A leader can be given more forms only when he has submitted details of the booklets he had earlier obtained from the party.
Jogi, PCC claims, obtained just 150 booklets during the previous drive but has not submitted any detail of the members he roped in. “It is a crisis related to the party’s constitution. I will approach the high command and seek their guidelines” Baghel said.
Jogi, on his part, said he had submitted all details of the previous memberships and the refusal to give him booklets violated his rights as a Congress member.

Health Ministry wants oxytocin details after ManekaletterPrint
Written by Abantika Ghosh | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:17 am
Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has taken up the issue of the use of oxytocin on cows to increase milk production. In her communication to Health Secretary Lov Verma, Maneka, who has worked as an animal rights activist for many years now, has written about how the illegal practice has caused loss of livestock in the country and continues unabated despite several government measures to stop it.
Reacting to Maneka’s concerns, the Health Ministry, through the director general (health services), has asked state drug controllers for details of the manufacturers of oxytocin along with detailed information about the seizures conducted for the illegally produced hormone, the number of persons arrested in connection with these seizures, prosecutions filed and reports, if any, of sub standard quality seized. State governments are required to furnish the information within the next 30 days.
In his letter to the state drug controllers last week, Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh wrote: “Not only does this drug make cows barren sooner, but also lowers the life span of the animal, thus causing economic loss to the owner in the long run. It is being widely used in the dairy industry despite there being a ban on its sale.”
The Health Ministry has also formed an inter-ministerial committee to look into the issue of oxytocin misuse.

UP govt scraps one moreschemePrint
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:14 am
The Akhilesh Yadav government in UP has scrapped a highly successful scheme under which financial assistance was provided to those belonging to backward classes during illness and also for marriage of girls.
This is yet another in the line of popular schemes like unemployment allowance, Kanya Vidya Dhan and free laptop that have been scrapped for several reasons, including funds crunch.
Under the scheme that has been scrapped, the state government was giving a financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to the girls belonging to poor backward classes and an assistance of Rs 5,000 to backward class people suffering from illness. The amount was not high but the scheme was successful with applicants numbering at least 10 times the target in every district.
“It is true that budget has been curtailed for the scheme and it has been deferred. The reason may be that there are several similar schemes being implemented by the state government which are covering a larger section of society,” said Ambika Choudhary, Minister for Backward Class Welfare.
He claimed that a large number of people are being covered under Samajwadi Pension Scheme.
Choudhary had, however, no answer for the state government not allotting funds to the scheme, which led to its closure. “Now it is the reality,” he said. The move to scrap the scheme assumes significance as the beneficiaries were poor people from Backward classes who are considered traditional voters of the SP.
Choudhary defended the move. “The amount (Rs 5,000) given for illness is of no consequence when we are providing free treatment for serious ailments. For the marriages, an amount of Rs 10,000 was fixed but we could not reach out to a larger section of the people,” he claimed.

Yechury waves a red flag over partyresolutionCPI(M) leaders at the party office in New Delhi on Sunday. (Express photo by Amit Mehra)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:14 am
The CPI(M)’s bid to change tactics to meet present day political challenges has brought out divisions within the party, with senior leader Sitaram Yechury opposing the stand taken by the Politburo and, by extension, general secretary Prakash Karat. The CPI(M) central committee, during a four-day brainstorming session which started on Sunday, was attempting to revise its political-tactical line, adopted at the party’s Jalandhar Congress in 1978.
During the session, Yechury moved an “alternative document” to the draft review report finalised by the Politburo. He is learnt to have repudiated the conclusions made in the draft report, presented by Karat.
Yechury’s five-page document, circulated among members of the central committee, is learnt to have questioned the Politburo’s opinion that the political-tactical line adopted in 1978 had many shortcomings, which hampered its expansion outside Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, and its consolidation in the three states. This comes in the wake of a drubbing received by the party in the Lok Sabha elections.
One of the key directives of the Jalandhar Congress, held in the aftermath of the Emergency, was to forge the unity of Left and democratic forces to defeat the Congress. The party applied the “united front tactics” with what it called “various bourgeois-landlord parties” in several states and at the national level over the years fairly successfully.
The draft finalised by the Politburo is learnt to have concluded that the effort to mobilise the regional parties into a third front has proved to be unrealistic and erroneous.
Yechury, on the other hand, believes that there is nothing wrong with the 1978 line and argues that it failed because of shortcomings and “subjectivism” in implementation in the last decade. He further argues that this, along with organisational weaknesses, is to blame for the electoral setbacks.
Yechury’s repudiation of the official draft is the latest incident in the tug of war between him and Karat. His stress on shortcomings in implementation in the last decade is significant, given that Karat succeeded Harkishan Singh Surjeet as general secretary in 2005. Karat’s stint at the CPM’s helm comes to an end next year and the latest tiff comes in the backdrop of a succession war.
Sources said that Yechury had conveyed his point of view in the Politburo meeting held on October 13 and 14, but the Karat camp had the upper hand, because of which the draft was accepted for consideration by the central committee. Yechury, however, did not relent and moved his objections in the form of a note.
What complicated the exercise is the decision of another Politburo member, B V Raghavulu, to place his “views” in the form of a separate note. It is rare for Politburo members to present such notes before the central committee after the Politburo reaches a conclusion on an issue.

Govt plans first corporate takeoverpost-SatyamJignesh Shah FTIL promoter
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:10 am
The government is considering a proposal to supersede the management of Jignesh Shah-promoted Financial Technologies (India) Ltd, a company that develops software for stock and commodity exchanges. If undertaken, this would be the second such takeover forced by the government in recent corporate history after Satyam Computer Services Ltd in January 2009.
Jignesh Shah and FTIL are currently being investigated by the Mumbai Police Economic Offences Wing for their role in the Rs 5,600-odd crore default by FTIL’s subsidiary National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).
According to the proposal, post-management takeover, the company may be handed over to financial institutions during a transition phase when the government can consider bringing in new promoters. Jignesh Shah owns/ controls 45.63 per cent in FTIL as on June 30, 2014.
The management takeover has been proposed by commodities market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry too has favoured the proposal and has observed that NSEL was effectively controlled by the key managerial persons of FTIL, and was fully in the know of NSEL affairs.
The NSEL merger with FTIL proposed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs last week, if followed by a management takeover, would dramatically expedite the recovery process, said government sources. In the last year or so, NSEL has been able to honour payments of only Rs 362.43 crore as against dues of Rs 5,689.95 crore involving around 13,000 investors.
According to sources, the proposed management takeover can be seen as Part II of the government’s plan to clear the mess NSEL landed itself in in August 2013. Part I of the plan was given effect through the Corporate Affairs Ministry’s draft order on October 21, 2014 that proposed merging NSEL with FTIL in public interest. “Ideally, FTIL should have been superseded first. NSEL merger with FTIL should have been the second step,” said a government source.
While FTIL’s minority investors argue about limited liability of the company in challenging the government’s merger order — which effectively requires FTIL to take on NSEL’s liabilities — sources in the government said this was a case of lifting the corporate veil. “Last August itself, FTIL paid up about Rs 177 crore towards meeting NSEL’s payment obligation. NSEL is held almost entirely (99.9 per cent) by FTIL. FTIL has all along been in the know of NSEL activities,” the source said.
In September 2013, a committee under then Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram submitted a report to the government recommending a management takeover of all three exchanges floated by FTIL — MCX, MCX-SX and NSEL. No action was, however, taken on this report.
Later, in an order dated December 17, 2013, FMC declared FTIL and Jignesh Shah among others as “not fit and proper” to be shareholder/ director in the management or board of any exchange. It also pointed out that NSEL cannot be said to be independent since 99.9998 per cent of its continued…

Modi message to NDA MPs: Take ownership of our keyschemesPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Written by Liz Mathew | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:59 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 10:54 am
Amid the continuing suspense over the contours of a BJP alliance in Maharashtra, the spotlight was on the Shiv Sena MPs. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi shifted it away, choosing to focus on his government’s welfare schemes, at his Diwali Milan for NDA MPs on Sunday
“Let’s think big. Let’s think far. Let’s think above politics,” Modi told the gathering at the high tea hosted at his official residence at 7 RCR — his first such meeting with the coalition MPs after taking over as PM. Like the Diwali Milan with the media hosted by BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday, it was Modi’s show once again. The event, which was initially planned only for BJP MPs but later included all NDA MPs, was the PM’s idea — a bid to keep MPs in the loop about the government’s initiatives.
The message was clear: each MP belonging to the ruling coalition should be deeply involved in the implementation of around 64 welfare programmes of the government and ensure that the benefits, as well as the political message, filter down to every village
“The schemes should reach the grassroot level in a more planned manner so that they have some impact on the lives of the people. The implementation should be more focussed and organised,” said a source. “The PM is of the view that MPs’ taking direct initiatives and their involvement in every programme will check corruption also,” he added.
The MPs were also asked to give special attention to skill development programmes. Modi also asserted that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan would be the flagship programmes of the BJP-led government.
“There was an elaborate discussion on many issues which the government has brought to the nation. We had an address by the Prime Minister who talked about cleanliness, various issues before the government, how a common MP can change things in this country, how a common MP can be a symbol of positive political entity and how the respectability of politicians can be enhanced in the country,” BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters after the meeting.
While Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed the gathering on the Jan Dhan scheme, coal, gas pricing and diesel deregulation, Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari spoke about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and Labour Minister Narendra Singh Tomar briefed them on various initiatives under the Shramev Jayate Karyakram.
Pointing out that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan had received tremendous response from all sections of society, Modi urged the MPs to use it to “connect” with people in their respective areas. He asked them to visit schools in their areas over a five-day period beginning November 14, the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, to explain the importance of hygiene. “This will send a positive message,” he said.
Echoing the same message, BJP chief Amit Shah also urged the MPs to “go and explain to the people” continued…

G-20 plan to boost growth in sync with PM Modi s agendaBarack Obama
(This will be Modi's maiden…)
NEW DELHI: The G-20 Summit on November 15-16 at Brisbane is expected to draw up an ambitious action plan to boost global economic growth and creation of millions of jobs, which is interestingly in sync with PM Narendra Modi's plan to create domestic jobs and improve country's fiscal health over the next five years.
The Brisbane Action Plan, to be discussed by leaders of 20 key nations including India at the ninth Summit, will put in place short and medium-term actions to raise the level of G-20 output by at least 2 per cent above the currently projected level in the next five years. This has the promise of creation of additional jobs worldwide, official sources said, but cautioned that to deliver on this ambition, this collective commitment needs to be translated into specific actions by each country.
This will be Modi's maiden foray at the G-20 Summit where he will share stage with Presidents Barack Obama , Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping besides heads of state and governments from virtually all continents. The PM had given a glimpse of his vision on global economy at the July BRICS Summit at Brazil where he called for reforms of international financial bodies that are largely dominated by the West.
Modi is expected to reiterate this position at the G-20 meet besides outlining his vision for global economic recovery and showcasing India as an attractive investment destination imperative for its growth, sources indicated. Interestingly this G-20 Summit is taking place in the backdrop of the decision to create BRICS Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank seen as a challenge to the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank - all backed by the West. India is a member of both these banks.

Endless vigil: Uncertainty engenders insecurity, and it's getting worse - Reuters
That’s the only way to contain the terrorist games escalating on Pakistan’s borders with Iran, Afghanistan and India
October 24, 2014:  
Just over a year ago, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was swept back to power, prompting expectations that he would tackle Pakistan’s security and economic crises, and improve relations with India. But, one year is an eternity in the politics of Pakistan! The US is refusing to pledge additional aid beyond what was promised earlier under the Kerry-Lugar Legislation. Even all-weather friend China has expressed disappointment that Sharif’s government has not done the requisite preparatory work for utilising the aid that Beijing had promised for the development of Pakistan’s ailing power sector. The only silver lining has been increased remittances from Pakistan’s workers in the Gulf, despite calls by Imran Khan for workers to halt such inward remittances.
Instead of acting circumspectly in such a situation, Pakistan has chosen to escalate tensions on its borders with Iran, Afghanistan and India. The tensions have arisen because of support to cross-border terrorism resulting from state agencies backing extremist Sunni groups, ranging from the Lashkar-e-taiba to the Afghan Taliban and the Jaish-e-Adl.
On the Iran front
Tensions with Iran escalated last year, when the Jaish-e-Adl mounted cross-border ground and missile attacks in Iran, resulting in Iranian casualties. This prompted an Iranian spokesman to warn that Iranian forces would enter Pakistani territory if the latter “failed to act against terrorist groups operating on its soil”.
More or less coinciding with this, the Jaish-e-Adl kidnapped five Iranian border guards and moved them into Pakistan. Iran not only warned Pakistan of cross-border retaliation, but also brought to the notice of the UN Security Council, in writing, the repeated incursions from Pakistani soil. Ever since the pro-Saudi Nawaz Sharif, whose links with radical Sunni extremist groups is well documented, assumed power, Pakistan has moved towards rendering unstinted support to Saudi Arabia, even in the Syrian civil war. It has also unilaterally annulled the Pakistan-Iran oil pipeline project, prompting Iran to seek compensation.
The Afghan story
While Sharif was commencing negotiations for a peace deal with the Tehriq-e-Taliban in the tribal areas of North Waziristan bordering Afghanistan, army chief General Raheel Sharif launched a massive military operation, involving over 50,000 military and paramilitary personnel, backed by artillery, tanks, helicopter gunships and fighter jets. An estimated one million Pashtun tribesmen have fled from their homes. They are now homeless and facing barriers preventing their entry to the neighbouring provinces of Punjab and Sind. Not surprisingly, ISI ‘assets’ like the Mullah Omar-led Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network have been quietly moved out from the battle zone, quite obviously into ISI safe houses.
Unrest is brewing amidst the displaced Pashtun tribals, as the army is unable to coordinate its operations with civilian relief agencies. One can expect that the displaced and homeless Pashtun tribals will, in due course, resort to terrorist violence across Pakistan.
The special treatment meted out to ISI assets like Mullah Omar and the Haqqani Network would have been carefully noted by the new Ashraf Ghani dispensation in Afghanistan, as a prelude to more serious attacks by the Afghan Taliban acting out of ISI and army protected safe havens in Pakistan. Pakistan’s western borders are not going to be areas of peace and stability in coming years. Unfortunately for both Nawaz Sharif and Raheel Sharif, the escalating tensions with Iran, the partisan stance on Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalries and the military action in North Waziristan have invited criticism within Pakistan.
The India bogey
The promotion and escalation of tensions with India across the Line of Control and the international border have to be seen in this context. What better way for the army to divert attention from its misadventures in the west, than to revive the ‘India bogey’ in Pakistan? Such an action would also test the resolve of the Narendra Modi dispensation in India to deal with cross-border terrorism.
Moreover, with Assembly elections due in J&K in December, the Pakistan army would strive to ensure that the credibility of these elections is questioned by ensuring a low turnout. Hurriyat leaders such as Shabir Shah and Yasin Malik had already been commissioned to stir up discontent and discredit the Indian army, during the floods. Three successive and successful Assembly elections in the State would erode the credibility of Pakistan’s propaganda.
What Pakistan had not bargained for, as it attempted to test India’s resolve from August onwards, was the robust response it received not only from the Indian army, but also from the paramilitary Border Security Force. This was accompanied by an ill-advised diplomatic effort to seek UN intervention in J&K. Both Sharif and his otherwise realistic national security advisor, Sartaj Aziz, seem to forget that the world changed dramatically after 9/11.
The western world led by the US has come to realise that Pakistan-backed terrorist groups are as much a threat to their security as to that of India.
Pakistan also seemed to ignore Modi’s unambiguous stance that dialogue and terrorism cannot go hand in hand, signalling that there would be no repetition of the diplomatic ineptness that India manifested in Sharm-el-Sheikh. Pakistan also seems to have misread the significance of the Obama-Modi Joint Declaration averring action for “dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for terrorist and criminal networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis”.
Pakistan’s military adventurism on three fronts across its borders with India, Afghanistan and Iran has created just the right environment to turn the heat on Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Apart from mounting a media offensive across print, electronic and social networks, it is time for India to get world attention focused on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and the plight of Baluchis, Shias and other minorities in that country.
In any case, there should be no question of a sustained dialogue process till Pakistan fulfils its January 2004 assurance that territory under its control will not be used for terrorism against India.

Compensation and Benefits High Schools
A bachelor's degree is often thought to be the key to financial success. After all, while the median salary of high school graduates 25 years and older is $29,766 a year, the typical college grad with a BA makes $50,281. Unfortunately, many young people have to dig themselves deep into debt for a shot at those future returns. Among the 70% of 2012 college grads who took out student loans, the average amount borrowed was $29,400.
Here are 10 thriving careers you can pursue without a college education. The occupations we identified promise generous salaries and long-term job security, based on 10-year employment projections. None of the jobs require a college degree, though some call for a post-secondary nondegree award, typically earned from a trade school or vocational training program. As a bonus, many of the jobs boast below-average stress levels.
Take a look at the 10 best jobs you can get without a college degree.
Data on number of workers, employment projections, education requirements and income comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment-growth projections cover the 10-year period between 2012 and 2022. Salary ranges reflect annual pay for workers from the 25th to the 75th percentiles, which weeds out the lowest and highest earners. Job stress is also based on BLS data, analyzed by career information expert Laurence Shatkin. Overall stress scores range from 0 (no stress) to 100 (most stress).
Dental assistant
Total number of U.S. workers: 309,540
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.5% (All occupations: 10.8%)
Annual salary range: $28,820 to $41,980 (All occupations: $22,670 to $56,860)
Stress score: 49.0 (All occupations: 53.1)
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award

Smiles all around for jobs in dentistry. With studies showing the close relationship between oral health and general health, people are taking better care of their pearly whites and providing more business for those working in the industry. Aging boomers are also adding to the high demand for professional dental care. To meet those growing needs, the number of dentists, dental hygienists (among our best jobs for the future ) and dental assistants is expected to increase rapidly--making the field a good bet in terms of job security.
The quickest way into the specialty is to become an assistant, which doesn't require a professional degree (required to be a dentist) or an associate's degree (required for hygienists). Some states require dental assistants, who perform routine tasks such as updating patient records and sterilizing equipment, to pass an exam and get certified, which can take a year through programs offered by community colleges; otherwise, you can get to work straight out of high school. (Check your state's requirements at http://www.danb.org .) Even if it's not necessary, you might consider going for that certification. According to the Dental Assisting National Board, dental assistants who are certified earn about $2 more per hour than those who are not.
Health information technician
Total number of U.S. workers: 180,760
Projected 10-year growth rate: 22.1%
Annual salary range: $27,520 to $45,260
Stress score: 42.9
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award
Thanks in large part to the aging population, health care is America's fastest-growing industry--and all those medical charts aren't going to track themselves. Health information technicians manage medical records, including patients' symptoms, diagnoses and insurance claims, ensuring their accuracy, completeness and security. As the shift from print to electronic recordkeeping increases, the demand for people with these specialized organizational skills grows, too.
Most employers would prefer to hire a technician with a professional certification, which you can obtain through several programs. For example, you can be certified as a Registered Health Information Administrator through the American Health Information Management Association and a Certified Medical Coding Specialist with the Professional Association of Healthcare Coding Specialists . Throughout your career, you'll need to regularly renew your certifications. If you later want to advance in this field and go for a bachelor's degree, you can become a health services manager--a job with an annual salary range of $70,960 to $117,740.
Elevator installer
Total number of U.S. workers: 21,270
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.6%
Annual salary range: $62,060 to $91,240
Stress score: 59.0
Typical education requirement: High school diploma or equivalent
Going up? Job prospects for elevator installers and repairers certainly are. Construction of new office buildings, stores and other nonresidential projects has gradually risen as the economy has improved and lifted demand for elevators and the people who work on them. The aging population may also add to the need for stair lifts and elevators in both homes and nonresidential buildings.
Despite the rapid growth, the total number of workers remains small--the lowest on this list. People may be deterred by the job's level of danger and physical demands, as well as its high-stress nature. But the happy few who brave this work enjoy the highest median pay on this list: $78,640 a year. If you want to join their ranks, you can start learning the trade right after high school through a five-year paid apprenticeship, offered by unions and individual contractors. You may also need to be licensed, depending on your state.
Massage Therapist
Total number of U.S. workers: 79,040
Projected 10-year growth rate: 22.6%
Annual salary range: $24,380 to $51,820
Stress score: 37.8
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award
Massage therapists can relax knowing that they are in high demand. Baby boomers coping with more aches and pains as they age will increasingly need their services. Plus, with massage-clinic chains proliferating and making the practice more affordable, even younger folks will be able to indulge themselves for greater relaxation.
An added perk: Massage therapists, of course, know how to keep calm. They boast the lowest stress score of all the jobs on this list, well below the 53.1 average for all workers. Part of their chill existence--besides the constant exposure to incense and soothing sounds--may be due to being boss-free, with a whopping 46% reporting as self-employed. To become a massage therapist, you'll likely need to complete a postsecondary education program requiring at least 500 hours of classroom study and hands-on practice. You may also need a license or certification, depending on your state's regulations.
Carpenter
Total number of U.S. workers: 580,570
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.2%
Annual salary range: $31,550 to $55,340
Stress score: 52.1
Typical education requirement: High school diploma or equivalent
A whole lot of people have already figured out that they can build a solid career, without a college degree, in carpentry. This field sports the highest number of workers on this list and--due in large part to the country's population growth and the need for new-home construction --expects another 218,000 people to be needed over the next several years. In particular, entrepreneurial types tend to flock to this occupation; 36.1% of carpenters are self-employed, compared with just 6.5% of all U.S. workers.
Most carpenters get their starts in three- or four-year paid apprenticeships, which you can find through unions and contractor associations, such as the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and the Home Builders Institute .

From icy heights of Siachen  Modi wishes happy DiwaliSrinagar: Wrapped in thick woollens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew to the icy heights of Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir Thursday where he lauded the armed forces and promised a national memorial for Indian soldiers.

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 23, 2014
The Siachen halt marked the start of a visit on Diwali day to the state where he later met victims of the recent floods - the most destructive in 50 years - at the Raj Bhavan, an event boycotted by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
"I am fortunate that as a servant of the nation, I got to see in what circumstances the soldiers have to live here," Modi said, addressing troops in Hindi in freezing temperature at the world's highest battlefield.
Dressed in battle fatigue woollen jackets, a red scarf and goggles to protect the eyes from blizzards, Modi promised to enforce a one-rank-one-pension scheme for the armed forces during his tenure.
"It is my duty to see that you and your family live in pride."
The Siachen conflict between India and Pakistan has reportedly claimed more than 2,000 lives on both sides since 1984, with most soldiers falling victim to inhospitable weather and altitude problems.

"Everyone is aware of the extreme conditions at Siachen. Overcoming every challenge our soldiers stand firm, protecting our motherland," Modi earlier tweeted.
"Be it the altitude or bitter cold, nothing deters our soldiers. They stand there, serving our nation. They make us truly proud."
He said he had "a message from each and every Indian to our soldiers: that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you...
"We realise how and in what difficult conditions you are deployed here."

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 23, 2014
From Siachen, Modi extended Diwali greetings to everyone -- including President Pranab Mukherjee, the commander in chief of the armed forces.
"Perhaps this is the first time a prime minister has got the wonderful opportunity of spending time with our jawans on this auspicious day... Am sure this would be among the most unique greetings Pranabda received."
Every Indian stands "shoulder to shoulder" with soldiers in Siachen, he said.
As Modi flew to Siachen, Pakistan Rangers fired at Indian paramilitary positions on the international border in Jammu region 365 km away while a strike called by separatists hit life in Srinagar.
A police officer told IANS that Pakistan Rangers fired at the Narain border post of the Border Security Force at Ramgar in Samba district. The firing started at 10.30 a.m.
Indian and Pakistani forces have been routinely firing at and shelling each other in recent times.
"We sleep peacefully because you are awake night and day," Modi said in his speech. He added that all three wings of the armed forces -- army, air force and navy -- were the nation's pride.
"This is my first Diwali after becoming the prime minister... I am very happy to be with these bravehearts."
After underlining that soldiers always helped people during disasters, Modi said he wanted to build a national war memorial for the military.
Meanwhile, buses went off the roads in Srinagar but some private vehicles and autorickshaws plied during a shutdown called by separatist groups that are opposed to Modi's visit.
Most shops and businesses were shut in Srinagar, the urban hub of a dragging separatist campaign that has claimed thousands of lives in Jammu and Kashmir since 1989.
Police and paramilitary personnel were deployed in visibly large numbers all across Srinagar.
Separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani accused Modi of rubbing "salt on our wounds" by visiting Kashmir on Diwali but not extending Eid greetings to Kashmiri Muslims.
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader Yasin Malik said Modi was "politicising a human tragedy" -- a reference to Modi's meetings with the flood victims.

Sikka fans the winds of change in InfosysSikka fans the winds of change in Infosys
SANGEETHA CHENGAPPA
Change agent: Vishal Sikka, CEO and MD, Infosys
The reinvention plan: more devolution, greater engagement and an atmosphere of informality
Bangalore, October 24:  
Glasnost seems to be sweeping through India’s most talked about IT company, Infosys.
With former SAP AG Director Vishal Sikka taking over as CEO, purse strings have been loosened, unnecessary controls have been done away with and even the mandatory tie has been made optional for male employees.
Sikka, through various e-mails since he took over in August, is driving home the point that engaging with employees more intensely is the key to re-inventing Infosys and if it is to return to the high-growth path and become the IT bellwether again.
Apart from the fact that all employees will now have access to social media sites like Facebook (one of the first things Sikka did after assuming office), he has now allocated a separate budget for employee engagement, to sharpen the focus on team-building efforts.
Team building efforts
“Sikka is putting far more emphasis on re-training, re-skilling employees instead of trying to hire a newer set as it would consume more time and effort — something Infosys can ill afford at this point,” an analyst with a brokerage firm said in a note to investors.
Sikka recently hired Michal Reah, a former SAP executive, to head Finacle, a banking product unit, as he believes that the product business will be the key focus area for the company going forward, and indicating that Infosys will not just stick to its core business of being a software services company.
SWAT team
Sikka had, in an e-mail, sought feedback from employees to improve the company’s all-round performance. He has now decided to act upon the feedback by setting up a SWAT team to review processes and systems on an ongoing basis. Infosys has also decided to allocate unit-level discretionary funds.
An employee who did not wish to be named said that while these steps are welcome, Infosys should start increasing salaries through special incentives for better performance as well as bring down bureaucratic controls bogging down productivity.
BS Murthy, CEO of executive search firm Leadership Capital, said thechanges were bound to happen given that Infosys made the biggest hiring decision in its history by bringing in an external candidate as its head.
“Invariably, the new leader will start by re-defining the character of the organisation — including the way they work, interact with customers, price services, etc.”

Serena thrashes Halep to win fifth WTA FinalsWilliams beats Halep to win WTA Finals title
By CHRIS LINES | Associated Press –  Sun 26 Oct, 2014

Serena Williams of the U.S. holds her trophy aloft after defeating Romania's …
SINGAPORE (AP) — The lead-up to Sunday's championship match at the WTA Finals suggested Serena Williams would face a major challenge to beat Simona Halep, but then, the No. 1-ranked player has made a career out of performing at her best when it matters most.
She did it again in Singapore, dispatching Halep 6-3, 6-0 just four days after a group-stage game between the pair in which the Romanian player dropped only two games and handed Williams her heaviest defeat for 16 years.
Coming into the tournament after having to withdraw from the China Open and Wuhan Open with illness and a knee injury, and just a day after a grueling three-set classic against Caroline Wozniacki, there was plenty of reasons to believe the 33-year-old could be vulnerable.
The doubts, though, were quickly swept aside as Williams overpowered her opponent in an imperious performance.
She won 11 of the last 12 games in the match to join Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf as the only players to have won five titles in the season-ending championships.
"I just started training, because I had such a bad knee in Beijing I didn't know if I'd be able to play here, and now I have won the Billie-Jean King trophy — I am so excited," Williams said.
Williams changed her approach from the group-stage contest, attacking Halep's second serve with fierce ground strokes, and regularly rushing the net to cut the points short and prevent her opponent from playing her preferred style.
"I had to play more Serena-style tennis and just do what I do best," Williams said.
"I was expecting a much better player than I was in the earlier round. Being ready for that really was able to help me out."
Halep's run in this tournament capped a remarkable rise, having gone from No. 64 in the rankings to No.4 in the course of 17 months, with a French Open final appearance along the way.
However, her relative lack of experience of big occasions compared to the 18-time Grand Slam champion proved telling.
"I was nervous before the match that I had to play this big final," Halep said. "I couldn't manage very well the situation.
"I knew that she would be more motivated during this match because we played a few days ago and I won."
The irony of Sunday's match was that Halep had it within her power to deny Williams a place in the final. Halep went into her final group-stage game knowing that if she lost in straight sets, Ana Ivanovic would go into the semifinals at Williams' expense. Instead, Halep lost in three and Williams made it in.
"I have no regrets because I did my job on court against Ivanovic," Halep said. "That was the chance but she deserves to win the title. She's much better."
Williams said she would have done the same thing if in Halep's shoes, namely try to win the group game despite the temptation of knocking out her most dangerous rival.
"No one on the tour thinks like that," Williams said. "She definitely gives her all so I don't think that went through her mind at all."
Halep got the first break of the match in the third game and was up 40-0 on serve in the next and looked capable of repeating the surprise 6-0, 6-2 victory over Williams on Wednesday. However, Williams broke back in that fourth game and the course of the match was changed.
Halep won only three points fewer than Williams in the opening set but clinched just seven points in the entire second set — including only two on return. The set was over in just 25 minutes.
Halep's victory in the group stage ended Williams' 16-game winning streak at the WTA Finals, but the American built her career win-loss record in the championships that feature the top eight players to 29 wins and five losses. Williams also retained the season-end top ranking, taking that honor for the fourth time.

LONDON (Reuters) - Robin Van Persie scored a dramatic stoppage time equaliser to earn Manchester United a deserved 1-1 draw at home to Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday.
Didier Drogba, 36, playing from the start because Diego Costa was unfit, headed the visitors in front in the 53rd minute from a corner conceded when David De Gea was forced into a fine save from Eden Hazard.
Chelsea seemed likely to hold out but just before the final whistle Branislav Ivanovic was sent off for a second yellow card and from the free kick Thibaut Courtois saved from Marouane Fellaini but could not keep out Van Persie's fierce follow-up.
The draw extended Chelsea's lead to four points over second-placed Southampton and six over champions Manchester City.

Fiat planning to make premium Jeep in IndiaTweet
 Production of the C-segment vehicle will begin by the end of 2016, four people close to the development told Economic Times.
MUMBAI: Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted global manufacturers to 'Make in India', Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has put in motion plans to manufacture a premium sports utility vehicle under the Jeep brand as part of a Rs 1,500-2,500 crore investment in the country and export it to key markets including the UK , Australia and South Africa in the next two years.
The development work for the first premium SUV to be made in India has begun under the project code-named M6 or 556 and production of the C-segment vehicle will begin by the end of 2016, four people close to the development told ET, adding that the strategy to use India as an exports hub will help the company reduce its losses in the country. Experts say that Fiat Chrysler's move will further enhance the brand image of India.
The country is gradually transforming itself from a manufacturing hub for small cars into a base for the entire range of vehicles as companies including Renault-Nissan and Volkswagen have exported mid-sized sedans and compact SUVs to global markets from the country. An email sent to Fiat India did not elicit any response. One of the persons referred to earlier, however, said on condition of anonymity that the C-segment Jeep SUV is expected to be priced at Rs 20-25 lakh in the domestic market and will be produced in "tens of thousands".
"The announcement will be made shortly," another person said about the company's investment plans for India. "The company was waiting for the Fiat-Chrysler merger in the global markets. Now that the listing is out of the way, the funds will be channelled into the country." The investment is likely to go into expansion of capacity and Fiat may set up a new manufacturing line at its Ranjangaon plant after discussing the possibilities with its joint venture partner Tata Motors, a person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that a significant part of the investment will go into developing new products including engines.
Apart from the completely localised C-segment Jeep, Fiat Chrysler is also said to be working on a modular platform 326, which will churn out replacements for Punto and Linea cars in the next two to three years under the Fiat brand. However, the Italian carmaker's volumes in the Indian market remain a matter of major concern, according to these people, who said the company is hoping that export volumes along with new models will help the brand make a comeback in the country.
While Fiat announced a major comeback plan for the Indian market two years ago, its protracted merger with American automaker Chrysler kept it from making major investments in India. But now the company is readying to launch the Jeep brand with the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee models next year, followed by the locally produced C-segment Jeep at the end of 2016 or early 2017. Fiat has been selling just 1,000-1,500 units a month on average in India despite the launch of new Linea and Punto and expansion of its dealer network.
Its capacity in Ranjangaon plant is getting utilised by Tata Motors, though, for its Indica, Vista and recently launched Zest models. The move to manufacture a premium SUV signifies that Fiat is recognising the potential of Indian manufacturing, said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at consultancy firm IHS Automotive.
"The future is in India whether it is for domestic market or for export manufacturing. Renault-Nissan, Ford, Hyundai and Maruti all have accepted this fact that manufacturing in India gives strong top and bottom numbers. Exporting a luxury brand from India will definitely be a strong image booster for Indian manufacturing in mature markets, where India always remains popular with small hatchbacks," added Vangaal.

Why Isaacson s Rewrite of Tech History Is So TimelyBy Alison van Diggelen, Host of Fresh Dialogues
Last Tuesday was the kind of evening when you just want to snuggle up with a good book and a warm mug of Earl Grey. But I rallied and zipped up my winter boots to go to Silicon Valley's geek mecca, The Computer History Museum. The guest of honor was Walter Isaacson, the author of Steve Jobs' biography and the bible for entrepreneurs around the world.
Isaacson's latest book is The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution . I knew that learning more about Silicon Valley's history would be good for me, but after reading the humdrum Financial Times review , my expectations were low.
But my fears were unfounded. In the parlance of modern movies, Isaacson had me at "Ada Lovelace." She's the woman who outlined the very first computer algorithm, and envisioned computer programs that could make art, even music. All this back in 1843.
Instead of a discussion about the male-dominated heroes of computing, Isaacson rarely strayed from the topic of women in computing. He chronicled the shocking neglect of the female programming team that completed the Eniac project, the first electronic general-purpose computer, only to be excluded from the high-profile public launch. Many times men got the credit and women were invisible.
"We have to put women back into the history of computing," Isaacson said.
Hear, hear!
Isaacson also has his finger on the pulse of Silicon Valley. Like automatons who've been asleep at the wheel, the tech world -- widely considered the ultimate meritocracy -- is waking up to the huge gender bias that's prevalent here.
With some prodding from influential journalists, companies like Google , Facebook, and Yahoo have recently published their stats.  On average, a paltry 15 percent of the tech workforce is female.
Why does this matter?
Gender-balanced teams make better products, companies, and communities -- and make them more economically valuable.
A recent study from Dow Jones VentureSource found that companies with the highest representation of women on their top management teams achieved better financial performance than other companies.
Sadly, despite Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean in" movement and Warren Buffet urging people not to hold women back, least of all themselves, the number of women going into computer science has actually dropped by half in the last 20 years.
The dearth of prominent geeky role models like Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and Kim Polese is part of the problem. Some say there's still a boy's club atmosphere in tech and that it's "hostile to women."
Some women, like those involved in the misogynistic "GamerGate" even fear for their lives.
Isaacson's book and its rewriting of tech history, with innovating women front and center could not be more timely.
Everyone needs role models, says Isaacson. Three cheers to that. Ada Lovelace is now mine.

But now the Marathi manoos has seen that the BJP offers a better alternative.
A London friend of mine was irritated by his bank manager telling him to clear his debts. So he stormed into his office and said ‘If you don’t stop writing me such rude letters, I shall take my overdraft elsewhere’. It seems to me that the Shiv Sena is in this situation. They first tried to play Big Brother to the BJP and wanted Uddhav Thackeray to be the chief minister-designate. Then they broke the alliance. Now having been shown as the weaker partner, they are still expecting the BJP to come and beg. This is not just misreading the situation, but being deluded.
But what the Congress has shown is that Dynasty does not work. It took three generations for the Congress to run out of talent. With the Shiv Sena, the memory of Balasaheb is the only asset. Raj Thackeray has done even worse. There is no point even in the two parties merging now. They will only destroy one another.
With the double victory in Maharashtra and Haryana, Narendra Modi has confirmed that his victory in May was no flash in the pan. Voters like his aspirational message. They admire his energy and they trust him to work hard for them. The Marathi manoos has been patronised by the Shiv Sena, who think that setting up a pav bhaji stall should be the limit of his ambition. It is the relative deprivation of the Marathas which gives the Shiv Sena the edge in its rhetoric against all outsiders. But now the Marathi manoos has seen that the BJP offers a better alternative. He doesn’t have to be backward forever. Just as the Congress wanted to preserve its BPL families with infinite care lest they escape poverty, the Shiv Sena wants its clients to remain bitter failures. This politics lost out last Sunday.
Once again, the contrast in the style of the BJP and Congress was striking. The BJP immediately began organising for the next cycle of elections and deciding who would be in charge. The Congress has not yet managed to analyse its May defeat, much less the October one.
Sonia Gandhi and Rahul gave up on Maharashtra by keeping their presence at a minimum. The inevitability of decline is starkly obvious to Congress leaders. What they lack is an exit plan. Ideally, the family should give up the party completely and bid goodbye. This may yet give the Congress some hope of reconstructing itself as a  modern democratic party. But perhaps that is asking too much. Their sense of destiny and family ownership will prevent a decent exit and we shall see pursuit of mirages such as Priyanka Gandhi as leader.
We have only one national party left — the BJP. You can see this by the way the NCP is behaving. continued…

It’s called PDS. Not the Public Distribution System that is meant to feed the have-nots, but the Post Diwali Syndrome that afflicts the haves. In India, we have more festivals than there are days in the year, but Diwali is really when indulgence violates the urban ceiling act. That is, till the bills come and PDS sets in. Here’s how you can recognise the symptoms of PDS.
Newspapers: Things are back to normal, with the regular-sized daily in your hand as opposed to the obscenely bloated versions that land with a loud thud outside your door in the days leading up to Diwali. National newspapers become unrecognisable because of the radical jump in advertisements, making it difficult to decipher where the front page begins, or whether Samsung or Haldiram have somehow made national headlines. The real news could begin on Page 10! That’s not to mention the shower of leaflets that drown you the moment the paper is opened. The medium as the message is a heavy load to bear.
Air quality: Also shows a dramatic increase, pollution levels that is, thanks to the millions of firecrackers which only increase each year, unaffected by minor issues like an economic crisis, inflation or austerity measures. Some say it’s a Chinese conspiracy to flood the Indian market with cheap firecrackers so Beijing is no longer the most-polluted capital on the planet. Pollution experts, always in great demand for sulfurous TV debates post Diwali, will fume and fret and predict our collective descent into the valley of fear, reminding us of the TV debates about Deepika Padukone’s cleavage.
Black money: The black smoke we see receding in the distance is highly symbolic of the colour of the money spent on Diwali all going up in smoke. We can all salivate over the names of Swiss bank account holders, promised to us by successive governments and Baba Ramdev, but there’s no time like Diwali to see whether the Indian government’s white paper on black money has any currency.
Swachh Bharat: The Prime Minister has pledged to remove the dirt in public life, and it’s never needed more than post Diwali when the public makes the roads look like a war zone in Iraq or Syria. The warmongers refer to it as collateral damage, something Shashi Tharoor will testify to, but collecting the collateral is a mammoth task, requiring all hands to the broom, and not just members of AAP, who are busy posting photographs of garbage like a bunch of drain inspectors instead of putting their party symbol to some use.
Spirit of generosity: It has a historical association with continued…

Fifth column: Real change pleaseNot even in a bizarre companies law that gives officials more powers of interference in routine business matters than ever before.
Written by Tavleen Singh | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:54 am
The Prime Minister makes it clear whenever he speaks that he understands well the need for urgent changes in governance and laws. He talks of ending “inspector raj” and repeats that the government has “no business to be in business”. But his ministers either do not understand what he is saying or do not understand the need for urgency.
This week, in which the whole country worshipped the Goddess of Wealth, is an appropriate one to talk of changes that should already have happened if we want the economy to start growing again at more than 8 per cent. It is a good week to remember that Narendra Modi was given a full mandate because Indian voters wanted radical changes in the way things are. And yet, not even baby steps have been taken so far to rid us of bad policies inherited from the Sonia-Manmohan government.
An example. Every time Arun Jaitley gives an interview, he admits that the land acquisition law bequeathed us by Sonia Gandhi makes it impossible for even private buyers to buy land. He admits that land cannot be acquired easily even for purposes of national security, but instead of ridding us of this misguided law, he announces only plans to tweak it. Has he not noticed yet that tweaking bad policies will get us nowhere near the ‘parivartan’ that the Prime Minister wants? Has he not noticed that investors continue to shy away from investing in big infrastructure projects because, on the ground, they notice no real changes? Not even in a bizarre companies law that gives officials more powers of interference in routine business matters than ever before.
The Prime Minister has repeated often that he believes the government has “no business to be in business”, but his ministers are not listening.
From the Finance Minister’s junior colleague, Nirmala Sitharaman, there have been so many angry statements against private companies that she is beginning to sound like a Marxist professor from JNU.
Most ministers show no signs at all of making the big reforms that are needed desperately if we want India to come closer to developing her enormous potential for being a rich country. They show no signs even that they understand that India counts among the poorest countries in the world because of bad economic policies. Labour laws prevent jobs from being created instead of doing the opposite. But again, they are only being tweaked. India imports vast quantities of coal despite having the largest reserves of this vital resource, but instead of a new policy for coal mining, we get just a bit of tweaking.
As someone who believes that India’s biggest failures have been in the social sector, I wait eagerly for continued…

Inside track: Uplifting desireDuring her brief stint as governor of Kerala, she resided in the Raj Bhavan at Thiruvananthapuram.
Written by Coomi Kapoor | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:03 am
It is  after 15 years that Sheila Dikshit is again staying at her two-bedroom first-floor flat in Nizamuddin East, central Delhi. As Delhi chief minister, she stayed at 3, Motilal Nehru Marg, on a 3.5-acre compound with four bedrooms. During her brief stint as governor of Kerala, she resided in the Raj Bhavan at Thiruvananthapuram. It is therefore quite a change for the former chief minister to return to her old modest quarters. The biggest problem Dikshit is facing is climbing the stairs. She wanted to install a lift, but her neighbour downstairs, IAS officer and author Upamanyu Chatterjee, was not agreeable to the idea as it would block his living room view. His landlady in Dubai too had not signed a No Objection Certificate to permit a lift. For now, the 76-year old Dikshit has to necessarily continue to climb the stairs.
Three in a row
Once is happenstance, twice is perhaps coincidence, but when a minister changes her press information officer thrice in the space of five months, there is clearly something wrong with her media relations. But the question is whether the three hapless information officers transferred out — R N Mishra, Nanu Bhasin and Maushumi Chakravarty — are really to blame if HRD Minister Smriti Irani is not getting the kind of coverage she expects in the media. No minister can get good publicity all the time, especially when she heads such a controversy-prone ministry. One reason for Irani’s poor relationship with the media is that she remains largely inaccessible to journalists. This is in contrast to when she was simply an MP and president of the party’s women’s wing. Then she was charming, thoughtful and interacted freely with the media. Before Irani recruits a fourth information officer, maybe she should consider changing her new standoffish approach with the press.
55-year rule
If politicians are upset at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule of no jobs for those over 75, senior bureaucrats are put off over another unofficial diktat: that plum foreign postings at the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank not be reserved for Government of India secretaries nearing retirement at 60. Modi’s new rule is that such foreign postings be assigned to additional secretaries around the age of 55. His logic is that the additional secretaries can gainfully utilise their three-year experience at international agencies to the country’s advantage on their return. While the post-retirement sinecures simply swell the officials’ bank balance, they provide no material benefit to the government.
Old understanding
The NCP’s offer of unconditional support to the BJP in Maharashtra was no last-minute decision. Nor was it aimed, as a senior NCP leader claimed jokingly, to simply “set the cat among the pigeons”. An understanding of sorts between Sharad Pawar and Narendra Modi had been continued…

From the discomfort Zone: Digital skeletonPrint
Written by Shombit Sengupta | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:13 am
It has started raining on digital technology. Arriving for an early morning flight, I started rubbing my eyes at the airport. Am I sleeping or dreaming? No, it’s real! The famous Walkman inventor is cooling his newly-launched mobile phone in water inside a display box to prove its unique rainproof character.
Yester-generation’s Japanese sultan of electro-mechanical Walkman device, who was upstaged by American burger digi-tech Emperor, is trying to avoid showing commoditised digital images. Instead, with rain falling on mobile phones, the sultan is bringing back Gene Kelly’s 1950s tap dance idea, ‘I’m singin’ in the rain’. Apart from shapely Bollywood heroines getting drenched in the rain, I don’t know whether people require phones in water. Although Slvio Berlusconi would love it for his bunga-bunga underwater sex parties. However, throwing cold water on digi-tech reinforces my digital skeleton idea.
Another airport wait —three hours in Heathrow for connection to Paris — was enough to compare oversize digital screen advertisements of perfume cosmetics brands such as Dior, YSL and Estee Lauder, among others. Through a dreamy route, they’re taking women to planet hedonism. What was disturbing me was identifying the excessive digital effects in every advertising image: The same lighting style and the same post-production digital retouching on the computer. From the technical embellishment perspective, all the different ads resembled one another. Lots of global enterprises have still not understood that digi-tech is just a skeleton. Their digital interface is commoditising the inner value of entertainment that the masses experience, making it all look similar.
Advertising that creates make-believe by manipulating or stretching a subject earlier needed some artistic sense and multiple craftsmanship.
The physical shooting stage involving set designers, light-men, sound creators is getting obsolete now. The other day, I met an old Parisian friend who makes background sound effects for films — a profession he inherited from his father. I loved his surprising magical sessions with different illogical instruments on the floor of a huge room. In front of a projection screen he’d watch the soundless movie and integrate sound into it as per the film’s action. The numerous instruments created by him looked really spectacular, much like installation art today. Watching him skilfully chafe ultra-violet coated satin to produce a recordable swish or strangely pull wire-string on some hollow instrument to emit an obtuse howl was itself an entertaining movie. This was his livelihood and passion, which, he sorrowfully narrated, is fading. His two children are not interested, so his collection of sound effects instruments has rusted and become antique. He said with digital technology, everything’s readymade in the digital disk so anybody can make sound effects. Just imagine, films now have no background sound differentiation.
So many artistic domains are getting massacred due to the over-usage of digi-tech, the killer of human passion, craftsmanship, knowhow and creative distinction.
At the same time we cannot ignore the advantage of digital content vs the celluloid film, which was cumbersome, extremely costly and you had to wait a couple of days to develop the film. With continued…

ISI shifts underworld don Dawood Ibrahim to Pakistan-Afghanistan borderDawood Ibrahim
(Top sources in country’s…)
NEW DELHI: Sustained joint efforts by Indian and US security agencies seem to have driven underworld don Dawood Ibrahim into hiding close to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border .
Top sources in country's security establishment, involved in tracking the activities of the D-Company, said that Dawood had been whisked away from his high-security mansion in Karachi's Clifton area by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and shifted to an undisclosed location close to the Af-Pak border.Indian intelligence agencies, keeping close tabs on movement of Dawood and his men, received specific inputs over the past few days about the gangster shifting base.
"Dawood seems to have gone completely underground. He has not been seen or even heard of interacting with his close aides. The Inter-Services Intelligence and Dawood appear under a lot of pressure," sources in the intelligence community claimed. Sources added that Inter-Services Intelligence appeared extremely wary of the new Indo-US cooperation to fight terrorism, with special focus on targeting the D-Company network.
This had come up during he extended dialogue between National Security Advisor AK Doval and state department officials in the US earlier this month. Sources said that cooperation on Dawood would be the first test of the partnership between the two countries with US playing a crucial role in choking the funds to the DCompany. The mastermind of 1992 Mumbai terror attacks and many more subsequently has business interests around the world, including in UAE, Africa and Pakistan. It is suspected that Dawood has been using money raised by smuggling narcotics to fund terror activities in Afghanistan and India .

SC panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas near SariskaPrint
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:27 am
The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. However, a decision on the issue was put on hold in March 2013.
In December 2013, the government decided to withdraw the ban imposed by the state forest department in March 2012 and grant “consent to operate” to all mines falling beyond 100 metres of the sanctuary boundary. Other than Rajan, officials who cleared the decision included former chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, former mining secretary Sudhansh Pant and additional chief secretary (forest) O P Meena.

Good news from textile sector: exports to US  No. 1 single market  hit record highThe pick-up in performance, visible in the export of Indian apparel and textiles, is also matched by a revival of sorts visible in domestic sales.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:22 am
The Centre’s ‘Make in India’ pitch seems to have already found resonance in the country’s textile and garment industry, with India’s exports to its largest single market, the US, headed for a record surge this year.
While a renewed buoyancy in textile and apparel exports is helped by a sharp improvement in raw material supplies, the strong performance by India this year is also a reflection of a combination of global factors — a steady improvement in demand as the American economy picks up, a progressive decline in Chinese exports to major markets such as the US, currency appreciation in  Indonesia, labour unrest in Asian competitor Cambodia and safety concerns after a major factory fire in Bangladesh last year.
Indian textile and apparel exports have risen nearly 7 per cent during January-August 2014, according to the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) data, compared with an average 2 per cent annual growth in the last five years. The growth in exports this year is being seen as significant as it happened despite the sharp strengthening of the Indian rupee since September 2013 (a stronger domestic currency results in a loss of competitiveness for exporters and vice versa).
While the steady pick in US demand is a major factor, larger domestic cotton supplies are also helping India push textile and apparel exports, Ajay Sardana, vice-president of Aditya Birla group firm Grasim said on the sidelines of a recent conference. India is projected to be the world’s top cotton grower this year, ahead of China for the first time in over three decades, according to a September 12 US Department of Agriculture forecast that has been corroborated by the Cotton Association of India.
Virender Uppal, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said, “We (Indian exporters) have leveraged our raw material strengths and followed sustained better compliance practices, which attracted the buyers and international brands across globe to source from India.”
Added to this is a series of problems encountered by India competitors. Cambodia, in June this year, saw labour unrest as angry workers rampaged through a textile plant that supplied US sportswear company Nike Inc, clashing with police over their demands for a pay hike. The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last year has had a continuing impact in terms of orders being diverted to India and other markets because of concerns over Bangladeshi workshop safety while textile manufacturers in Vietnam, one of the fastest growing supplier base, have been weighed in by the high cost of credit.
Both Bangladesh and Cambodia have seen a contraction in exports to the US, continued…

Looking at govt s policy decisions optimisticallyCIO
("We definitely look in the…)
In a chat with ET Now, Sunil Singhania, CIO Equity, Reliance Mutual Fund, shares his views on economy, his expectations and more. Excerpts:
ET Now: Politics was a theme that dominated your recent note. From what we are reading right now, you have talked about the principles that the Modi government follows under the leadership of Narendra Modi. What is your driving principle as you approach your strategy with the markets?
Sunil Singhania: One thing is very clear that not only in India but everywhere in the world, politics does play a big role and it is not about the markets but it is definitely about the economy. Anything specifically in a country like India which has so much potential and somewhere that potential has not been exploited to the fullest because of whatever we have gone through in terms of policy action; it becomes all the more relevant. That is the reason why most of the market investors would be looking at politics much more closely than they would say in the past.
ET Now: Do you think that from this year to the next, India is pretty much on track to get rerated because we have seen a part of the rally already play out and this has been a great Diwali. I am sure everybody is celebrating with a lot of gusto given the energy and enthusiasm there is overall. So do you think that is just going to build on over the next 12 months?
Sunil Singhania: Definitely, from our perspective with a little bit of luck which also is shining on India given that we have recovered as far as rainfall is concerned and with the way oil prices and commodity prices are falling, we do have luck. We are entering into a phase which is making India stand out. I have repeated it earlier also in various forums that last four-five years, India was the reverse of the world. So in the world we had prices falling, inflation falling, interest rates falling and India was among the very very few countries where interest rates and inflation was rising. Now if you see, the last 10-15 days of volatility in the world was largely because of concerns that growth is slowing down, interest rates are rising.
India on the contrary we have wholesale price index fallen to 2.5 per cent. I do not remember in the near past when that has happened. So in India we are seeing a big sort of standing out as far as macro economic factors are concerned and on the policy front itself you have diesel prices which have been deregulated, you have gas prices which was long overdue as far as increase is concerned and the biggest thing is the direct subsidy transfer or the direct benefit transfer that can revolutionise a lot of things. As you move forward, there are talks about lot of things happening on the coal front, on the power front, the railways front, the defence front and on GST front. So we definitely look in the near future as well as medium term with lot of optimism as far as policy decisions are concerned.
ET Now: So the note that we read which is essentially what you guys are reading and among the other things that came out I will quote, one of the points is "break your final target into a set of smaller target and milestones". I believe this is something that you have written now or is something that you are reading. So now let us put this in context with how you relate to things generally and with regards to market I leave the option to you as to how do you want to choose. What is the milestone over the next 12 months, say for the markets or on the personal front and how are you breaking into smaller targets?
Sunil Singhania: Very clearly as you rightly said, you do have a longer term sort of thought process and long term visions as far as the market is concerned. But obviously you will have to break it up into smaller targets.

By Mike Collett
LONDON (Reuters) - West Ham United and Southampton maintained their unlikely but impressive starts to the season when the Hammers beat champions Manchester City 2-1 and Saints moved up to second with a 1-0 win over Stoke City on Saturday.
Chelsea, who visit Manchester United on Sunday, lead the Premier League title chase with 22 points from eight matches while Saints are second with 19 from nine games.
Manchester City are third on 17 after losing at West Ham through goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho. The champions could trail Chelsea by eight points on Sunday night if Jose Mourinho's men triumph at Old Trafford.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Arsenal won 2-0 at Sunderland, Liverpool were held to a goalless draw at home by Hull City, Swansea City defeated Leicester City 2-0 and West Bromwich Albion fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home to Crystal Palace.
West Ham did not have it easy against Manchester City who dominated possession but hit the bar twice through Yaya Toure and only scored once through David Silva.
Frenchman Amalfitano put the Hammers ahead with a tap-in after a brilliant low spinning cross from Enner Valencia after 21 minutes.
Senegalese Sakho became the first West Ham player to score in six successive Premier League games when he made it 2-0 with a goal given after goalline technology showed his header had crossed the line in the 75th.
Silva pulled one back for City with a great solo effort as he weaved through the defence two minutes later.
"It wasn't a lucky victory by any stretch of the imagination today because our commitment and desire to play against the big boys and the present league champions was there for all to see," West Ham manager Sam Allardyce told BT Sport.
"After David Silva scored their outstanding goal, for me it was about the squad's determination to make sure of what is a famous victory for us."
City manager Manuel Pellegrini denied he was under any more pressure after his side also let slip a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow to draw 2-2 in the Champions League in midweek.
VERY UNLUCKY
He said: "I always feel the pressure exactly the same from the first day to today.
"West Ham played very well especially in the first half and they did not allow us to move the ball but we were very unlucky because we had a lot of chances."
Southampton's fairytale start to the season is turning into a credible challenge for a top-four finish after they beat Stoke.
Although they were never likely to reproduce last week's 8-0 win over Sunderland, Sadio Mane's 33rd-minute strike separated the teams at St Mary's as Southampton won for the sixth time in nine matches.
"The first half was fantastic," said manager Ronald Koeman.
"We played very well and dominated the game, scored a good goal and had other good opportunities in the first half but we did not kill the game and it was difficult to the last seconds." Last week Southampton scored their biggest league win since 1921 when they thrashed Sunderland but Koeman said: "Maybe this win is more important than last week's because it's not always that easy and you have to fight for it". Arsenal won for only the second time in eight league matches, beating Sunderland with Alexis Sanchez scoring twice.
Liverpool's woes continued when they were held by Hull with Mario Balotelli missing an open goal with almost the last kick.
West Brom rallied against Palace who led at halftime thanks to a volley from Brede Hangeland and a penalty by Mile Jedinak.
Albion hit back in the second half with a header from substitute Victor Anichebe and a stoppage-time penalty by Saido Berahino.
Swansea ended a run of five league games without a win when they beat Leicester at the Liberty Stadium with a goal in each half from Wilfried Bony.
They are now sixth while Leicester, without a win in four matches since a 5-3 defeat of Manchester United a month ago, have slipped to 16th, two points above the relegation zone.

How to avoid pitfalls in retirement planningRepairing the damage
By Teena Jain Kaushal and Renu Yadav | India Today Group –  Thu 2 Oct, 2014 8:10 PM IST

You have been saving diligently for retirement. That's good. But in all likelihood, you have just a vague idea about what you want, not a concrete plan. That's bad, for this means you will make several mistakes as you set out on the road to gifting yourself a comfortable life after retirement.
For example, many of you think that whatever you save during your working life will be sufficient for your sunset years. But have you accounted for the demon that goes by the name of inflation, which nibbles away the value of your money 24X7? Probably not. This means you will not save enough to be able to continue your present lifestyle in old age.
Lack of clarity, say experts, may also lead you to set unrealistic goals. Sudipto Roy, business head, Principal Retirement Advisors, gives an example. He says a man, less than 30 years old, once sought their advice. He wanted to retire at 45 and buy an Audi car. He also wanted to go on a foreign trip every year.
The problem was that his annual salary was Rs 5 lakh. "We made him realise that it was impossible to meet these goals taking into account his salary. He understood."
Due to increased life expectancy, with people living 20-25 years, even more, after retirement, it is imperative to ensure that your finances are in a good shape when you retire. So, we talk about the most common mistakes that people make while saving and investing for life after retirement. For good measure, we also discuss how these mistakes can be corrected through timely action.
STARTING LATE
Retirement usually comes at the end in the list of financial goals of most people. They usually start saving for it when they are near the end of their working life. The focus, instead, is on intermediate goals. They save for the car they want in the next three-four years or the house they plan to buy in the next 10 years. They forget retirement as it is far away. They think they can start saving for it after other big obligations such as home loan and children's education/marriage are over. This is a wrong approach.
Starting early has many advantages. If you do that, your money gets more time to grow. Each gain generates further returns. As time passes, you miss out on this benefit, called compounding, which can grow money exponentially over time.
For example, if you start saving Rs 5,000 per month at 20 and earn 12% returns every year, you will have Rs 5.94 crore when you retire at 60. But if you start at 30, you will be able to accumulate just Rs 1.76 crore. The 10 additional years that you give your money to grow can do wonders for your financial well-being.
The more you delay, the more you will have to save per month. For example, if your age is 20 and you want Rs 5 crore by the time you are 60, you will have to save just Rs 4,207 a month for the next 40 years, assuming that the rate of return is 12%. If you delay till 25, you will have to almost double your savings (Rs 7,698 every month for the next 35 years). "Starting early can help you build a larger fund and give you flexibility for taking up entrepreneurial or other pursuits close to your heart," says Anil Rego CEO & founder, Right Horizons.
Experts also say that people who don't start saving early generally make riskier investments decisions later in life. So, start saving as soon as possible.
What to do: As a first step, we explain how you can calculate the money you will need for your post-retirement years.
After you arrive at the figure, finalise the investment plan. Take help from a financial advisor if you think you cannot do it on your own.
If you are starting saving for retirement when you are in your 40s or 50s, it is advisable to delay retirement by a few years. "Revisit your investment plan and see if you can allocate more to equities instead of bank fixed deposits, as it is the only way to earn a higher rate of return," says Rohit Shah, a Sebi-registered investment adviser and founder & CEO of GettingYouRich.com, a financial planning website. But remember that investment in shares has to be for at least five years.
"If you have bought expensive products such as unitlinked insurance plans, or Ulips, and traditional insurance products like endowment plans, check their surrender cost. If it is not high, surrender these products and invest the money in higher-yielding products like equity mutual funds."
If you have already retired but do not have enough savings, take up a job. "Alternatively, shift to a smaller city and give your house on rent. You can also sell your house if it is in a big city and buy a smaller one in a Tier-II city and use the money saved for life after retirement."
Also, retired people usually keep funds in conservative instruments such as bank fixed deposits. You can allocate a small part of savings to equities depending upon your risk appetite. The aim is to earn higher returns to bridge the gap between required and actual cash flow. Another option is investing in monthly income plans of mutual funds that invest 10-25% money in equities.
IGNORING PRICE RISE
Inflation is a demon that comes down hard on anyone who ignores it. "Since retirement is a long-term goal, it is important to understand the impact of inflation on your financial goals," says Feroze Azeez, director, Investment Products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth.
Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. It reduces purchasing power substantially. Assuming 7% inflation, Rs 1,00,000 today will be worth Rs 13,000 after 30 years.
In simple terms, this means that things will become costlier and years later you will be able to buy much less with the same amount of money.
Ignoring inflation means you will save much less than what you will need years down the line. If you spend Rs 50,000 every month at 30, you will need Rs 3.81 lakh a month at 60 assuming that prices rise at the rate of 7% every year. You have to invest in such a way that you beat inflation, that is, earn returns that are at least a couple of percentage points above the inflation rate.
Taking inflation into account will not only tell you how much you have to save but also help you decide the most appropriate investing strategy. "The assets that you choose should return more than the inflation rate," says Rego of Right Horizons.
What to do: If you ignored inflation while doing the maths, revisit the numbers. Always take the real rate of return (rate of return minus inflation) while doing the calculation. Also, use a realistic rate of inflation. You can take an average of the past few years. Lastly, don't underestimate inflation. It's better to err on the side of caution.
CASHING OUT EPF MONEY
Many people withdraw money from their provident fund account. This, say financial experts, is wrong as instruments such as the Employee Provident Fund, or EPF, have been designed to provide financial security after retirement. These are highly useful for retirement planning, especially due to their tax-free status.
Experts say it is not good to withdraw money from the EPF, even if it is to make a big-ticket purchase such as a house. Instead, it is better to dip into other savings; EPF should be only for post-retirement years.
Tanwir Alam, CEO, Fincart, a New Delhi-based financial advisory company, says, "Many people ask me if it is okay to withdraw money from the EPF for buying a house or it's better to take a loan. My advice is to let the EPF rest."
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that you save Rs 44,300 a year by choosing home loan over EPF (assuming 20-year loan of Rs 40 lakh at 10.25%), he says. Over five years, the saving is Rs 2,21,500. This takes into account the tax that you save on principal (up to Rs 1,50,000) and interest payments (up to Rs 2,00,000) for the home loan. We have not taken into account the rise in price of the house over time.
What to do: Do not withdraw from the EPF account. "If you have already done so, keep paying back through systematic investment plan," says Gaurav Mashruwala, a Mumbai-based financial planner. If you are short of cash, delay the purchase till you are able to save more.
IGNORING PPF
You may get attracted by high interest rates offered by fixed deposits. But keep in mind that while you pay tax on interest earned on fixed deposits, gains from the public provident fund, or PPF, account are tax-free. Also, PPF investment is eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Currently, PPF pays tax-free returns of 8.7%.
"A good retirement plan should have many instruments. The PPF should definitely be there because of its tax advantages. But the composition of the portfolio should depend upon the individual's situation and risk appetite. While the PPF is a good product, diversification is strongly advised," says Jayant Manglik, president, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.
One can invest Rs 1.5 lakh in a year. Till last year, this limit was Rs 1 lakh. By investing Rs 1.5 lakh every year, one can save Rs 46.75 lakh in 15 years. In 30 years, the amount will be Rs 2.10 crore.
The account can be kept open for as long as you want. You can also use the account for regular income as you are free to withdraw money after the end of the 15th year.
However, remember a few points. You can open an account with Rs 5 but have to deposit at least Rs 500 every financial year. There is an option for part-withdrawal from 7th year onwards. Plus, one can take a loan against the account after the end of the third financial year.
What to do: Open an account as soon as possible. The 15-year lock-in ensures that you save just for old age without getting swayed by intermediate goals.
DELAYING HEALTH INSURANCE
Medical expenses rise as a person ages. Experts say many people don't buy individual health plans during their working life as they are covered by employers. This is wrong as most employers give the cover only till you are employed with them.
You also have the option of porting the employer's policy to individual cover at retirement. But experts say do not depend on group policies after retirement as employers keep changing insurers and so you may miss out on benefits accumulated in the earlier policy such as waiver of waiting period for pre-existing diseases.
It is good to buy an individual health policy early in life. It is not only cheaper but also helps you cover preexisting illnesses after completion of the waiting period. Moreover, it covers you even after you leave the job or your company curtails the benefits under the group plan to cut cost. It also earns tax benefits upto Rs 15,000 for individuals and Rs 20,000 for senior citizens.
What to do: A single hospitalisation can wipe out your savings. Buy health insurance early in life. It will help you save a lot of money. Second, ensure that the cover is adequate. Estimate your needs on the basis of cost of treatment and inflation. If you cannot afford a large cover, buy a regular plan with low sum insured and add a top-up cover. Top-up plans are cheaper than regular plans. In a regular plan, the insurer pays up to the sum insured. A top-up plan covers you after a fixed amount, called deductible, is crossed.
NOT PLANNING FOR CONTINGENCIES
Your long-term investments are not for meeting contingencies. "Hence, all people, irrespective of age and employment status, must build a contingency fund," says Fincart's Alam.
"Ideally, your savings should guarantee you a lifestyle after retirement which is the same as you enjoyed in your working years. This involves high-level contingency planning as your income streams dry up as you retire," says Religare's Manglik.
What to do: A contingency fund should be able to meet at least six months' expenses. In later years, it should take into account possible medical emergencies as well.
NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY FOR EARLY RETIREMENT
Stress is nowadays burning out people at a young age, making them think of retiring early. Financial planners say they come across many people who want to advance their retirement age. But most of the time they advise them to delay the plan if they do not have enough funds to last their lifetime. "Early retirement requires rigorous planning for meeting life's goals," says Fincart's Alam.
To help you ascertain how much money you will need at retirement, we have prepared a table, How much do I need to save for retiring rich?
What to do: "Compounding is a powerful tool (the longer the period, the more the money will grow). If you think you will start saving later when your income rises, you may not be able to save enough. Therefore, enlist a financial advisor, start immediately, evaluate the available savings and protection instruments, calculate the funds required and get down to executing the plan," says Manglik of Religare.
PAYING HIGH FEES
Before investing in a financial product, look at costs such as the agent's commission and fund management charges. This is because these fees are paid from the money that you will invest. The higher they are, the lesser will be the amount invested. You can lose lakhs if you are not careful.
Consider this. You will end up losing Rs 5.82 lakhs over a period of 30 years if you invest Rs 1 lakh in a mutual fund scheme with 1% extra fund management charge, at an assumed rate of return of 12%. "Low cost does decide returns. Hence, the best investments on the basis of cost are mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, PPF and tax-free bonds. One must avoid traditional insurance products such as endowment & money back and Ulips," says Manglik.
What to do: Look closely at costs. For instance, for mutual funds, compare fund management charges. One option is to go for direct plans. In these, instead of going through a distributor, you invest directly with the fund house. Since there is no distribution fee, the expense is lower. A comparison of annual returns given by direct and regular plans shows that direct plans of diversified equity funds outperform the regular ones by more than 1%. Similarly, while buying insurance, go for online plans. The National Pension System is also a cost-effective retirement tool.
NOT HAVING ADEQUATE INSURANCE
When a bread earner dies, the whole family suffers a setback. A life insurance policy can take care of the family's well-being in such a case. The question is, how much cover one should have?
The ideal figure, say experts, is at least 10 times the annual salary. This will give the family a cushion of ten years to adjust to the new financial reality. For example, if your salary is Rs 10 lakh a year, the cover should be at least Rs 1 crore.
Another approach is calculating the human life value, that is, the present value of your future income. Don't forget to factor in liabilities such as home loan while doing the calculation.
What to do: Buy a term insurance policy as soon as you can. Buy online to save on premium. And do not forget to increase or decrease the cover as your liabilities change.
WRONG ASSET ALLOCATION, IGNORING EQUITY
It is important to invest in the right assets. "Asset allocation is to investment what oxygen is to human life," says Shah of GettingYouRich.com.
"As per a study, 91% performance of a portfolio is linked to asset allocation. Selection of securities, timing and others account for the rest 9%," he says. Right asset allocation is important as every asset goes through different cycles of boom and bust and has a different risk-return profile. Diversification is needed to optimise returns.
Another mistake is being conservative and ignoring stocks altogether. Keep in mind that to beat inflation one does not have any option but to invest in a growth asset like equity, which can give good returns over the long term. For example, Rs 100 invested in the BSE Sensex in 2000 had become Rs 422 by the end of 2013. Don't forget that this period covers both the dotcom bust and the 2008 financial crisis. The same investment in G-secs or government securities would have become just Rs 242.
Stocks can also help you reach your goals before time. Experts, in fact, say that those who have already retired should also have some exposure to stocks to support their cash flow as it is not possible to earn inflationbeating returns with debt investments.
"Most retired people think that as they do not have a big income stream, they should focus on capital preservation and invest in fixed deposits. However, they must appreciate that they have 25-30 years ahead of them. Some exposure to stocks can shore up returns," says Raghvendra Nath, MD & CEO, Ladderup Wealth Management Pvt Ltd.
What to do: We are not saying that you should invest all the money in stocks. Debt plays a very important role in the portfolio by providing it stability. Gold, too, has delivered good returns in the past decade. The key, according to experts, is to go for the right asset allocation.
The allocation between debt and equity will depend upon one's risk appetite. Generally, the older the person, the lesser risk he must take. One thumb rule to decide the equity allocation is "100 minus age". But this may not work in many cases. For instance, a retired person with no obligations and sufficient funds to meet his day-to-day expenses can consider a higher exposure to equities.
Age must not be the only parameter. Risk appetite, liquidity, inflation, liabilities and goals should also be taken into account. But one thing is clear. Equity investment has be for the long term.
So, the more time you have to retire, the higher exposure you can have to equity.
ASSUMING EXPENSES WILL GO DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY
Many people assume that their expenses will fall drastically after retirement. While they may indeed go down, don't expect the fall to be substantial. "Expenses after retirement are usually 80% of pre-retirement expenses," says Shah of GettingYouRich.com.
While you may not have to spend on children's education, loan equated monthly instalments and daily travel, some expenses such as medical and payment to domestic helps are likely to rise as you grow old. Your travel expenses may also rise substantially as you may visit friends and family members frequently.
What to do: "One should prepare a break-up of one's current expenses and then map the same to a postretirement scenario and then add inflation to get an accurate estimate," says Shah.
NOT HAVING A HOUSE
House is a basic necessity and accounts for a big share of expenses. If you are living on rent, your monthly outgo will generally be 20-30% of monthly income. So, having your own house during sunset years will reduce your expenses substantially. "It will also provide a sense of security," says Rego of Right Horizons.
In the worst scenario, go for reverse mortgage of the house. Reverse mortgage is the opposite of home loan. The lender makes monthly payments to the owner till he is alive. After death, it sells the house, recovers its dues and gives the rest to legal heirs. "Reverse mortgage can be a good strategy after the person enters his 70s. Reverse mortgage annuities are now taxfree. Leveraging the house can be helpful in tackling the problems of inflation and taxation," says Shah.
What to do: Start saving for a house now. If you can't afford it, consider buying in some other city where prices are within your budget and where you can spend your sunset years. The ideal location can be your native place.
UNDERESTIMATING TAX OBLIGATIONS
The pension you receive is taxable. If you fall in the highest tax bracket of 30% while you are working, it is unlikely that your income after retirement will not be taxable. Also, after retirement, people generally opt for conservative investments such as bank fixed deposits whose returns are taxable. If your annual interest on bank fixed deposits is more than Rs 10,000, the bank will deduct 10% tax at source. If you fall in the higher tax bracket, you will have to pay the differential to the tax department. So, it is better to take post-tax returns into account while working on the retirement plan. For instance, if you are investing solely in debt and earning 9% interest, your post-tax returns will be in the range of 6.3-8.1% depending upon your tax slab.
What to do: Invest in options with lighter tax obligations. Feroze Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "You must look at avenues that can provide you income that is exempt from tax on maturity/withdrawal such as provident fund or attract less/no tax if redeemed after a long period."
For instance, monthly income plans, which have equity exposure up to 25-30%, are taxed like debt funds. One can also look at investing 25-30% money in equity diversified funds as returns from equities are not taxed if sold after one year.
UNREALISTIC RETURNS
Those who invest in shares expect very high returns. Experts believe it is better to be conservative in your expectations. This is because how your investments perform is not in your hands, especially in case of assets like equities. Stocks have the potential to deliver amazing returns, but the risk of losses is also high.
For example, a Rs 100 investment in the Sensex would have doubled between 2005 and 2007. But next year, it would have been reduced to Rs 75. So, be realistic.
"Returns from shares depend upon earnings growth of companies. One can assume 15% returns a year for periods of 10 years or more," says Raghvendra Nath of Ladderup Wealth Management.
Exposure to stocks is likely to go down substantially after retirement. So, you should not assume high returns while doing your calculations.
"Equity investments should always be for the long term, ideally more than three years. One can assume returns of 12-15% a year over the long term. But after retirement, expect 12% returns as one will usually prefer conservative or balanced funds at this stage," says Rego of Right Horizons
What to do: Take a different rate of return while doing calculations for pre- and post-retirement periods. Also, people may approach you with risky schemes which offer unrealistic returns. Risk and returns are related. The higher the returns, the higher the risk. So, always double-check before investing in any scheme which is promising unrealistic returns. Start saving for retirement and avoid hitting the above-mentioned roadblocks for a smooth journey.

Mutual Fund investments in IT stocks hit all-time high in Septmfs
(The MF industry is betting…)
NEW DELHI: The mutual fund industry is betting big on software companies as its equity exposure to the sector climbed to a fresh all-time high of around Rs 32,000 crore at the end of September.
This also marks the fourth consecutive rise in mutual fund (MF) industry's exposure to software stocks.
Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
The funds' investment in software stocks stood at Rs 31,834 crore as on September 30, 2014, accounting for 10.83 per cent of their total equity assets under management (AUM) of Rs 2.94 lakh crore, according to data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ).
At current levels, the MF industry has the highest exposure to software sector since August 2009. Data is not available for sector-wise exposure before August 2009, when the equity funds had deployed Rs 11,913 crore (6.71 per cent) in software shares .
The previous high was in August this year when investment in the sector rose to Rs 29,668 crore.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in software stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market.

Tata Motors raises $750 million in bond sale; gets better pricingTata Motors raises $750 million in foeex bond sale; gets better pricing
PTI Oct 27, 2014, 01.37AM IST
(It had sold $300 million…)
MUMBAI: The country's largest auto maker Tata Motors has raised $750 million from Asian and European investors by selling a dual tranche bond issue which got an over subscription of six times at $4.5 billion.
The company has priced the 5.5-year benchmark senior unsecured notes of $500 million at 4.625 per cent, while the coupon for the 10-year $250 million notes is fixed at 5.750 per cent per annum.
It had sold $300 million worth bonds in April at a coupon of 5.53 per cent for a five-year money, indicating better operating environment for the company.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to refinance external commercial borrowings, capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes, the company said in a statement.
"We are pleased to have completed this transaction successfully and we thank the investors for demonstrating their confidence in us," said Vijay Somaiya, vice-president for finance and head of treasury & investor relations at Tata Motors.
Global rating agency Standard & Poors has assigned BB long-term issue rating to the issue while highlighting Tata Motors' increased dependence on JLR, while rival Moody's has assigned Ba2 to the notes with a stable outlook.
"The ratings on Tata Motors reflect the company's small size and narrow product suite compared with many global peers', and its likely negative free operating cash flows because of high capital expenditure. JLR's established and improving market position in the global premium automotive segment and its strong operating performance temper these weaknesses," S&P said.
S&P further said it believes that the good operating performance of JLR, if sustained, can improve its consolidated financial strength.
Moody's also based the ratings to the continuing good show by its British arm JLR which has contributed over 90 per cent of group operating profit in FY14. "The phenomenal success of JLR continues to buy time for Tata Motors' weak domestic operations to turn around, and these are now showing some improvement."
The stable outlook on the bond reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core domestic business of the company to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating, Moody's said.
However, Moody's added that the current fiscal is critical as JLR's sales slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations.
Tata Motors is likely to list the benchmark issue on the Singapore exchange, according to merchant banking sources who worked on the issue. They added that Asian investors dominated the 5.5-year issue cornering 61 per cent, while the 10-year issue was lapped up by European and West Asian investors cornered 78 per cent.
Mutual funds have reportedly bought close to 70 per cent of the 5.5 year bond and also bought 50 per cent of the 10-year bonds; insurers bought 40 per cent of the 10-year bonds, said sources at i-bankers which included ANZ Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and StanChart.
Tata Motors had a consolidated revenue of Rs 2,32,834 crore or $38.9 billion in 2013-14. Through subsidiaries and associate companies, it operates in Britain, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.

The Cabinet has given the go-ahead to deregulation of diesel price and also came out a new gas pricing formula. Besides, government has promulgated ordinance for e-auction of coal blocks.
Since the beginning of the year, the net investments by overseas investors into Indian equity markets stood at Rs 79,938 crore ($13.3 billion) so far this year, while the same for debt markets was at Rs 1.3 lakh crore, taking the total to Rs 2.10 lakh crore ($ 35 billion)
Since the beginning of June, FIIs ( Foreign Institutional Investors ) along with sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by market regulator Sebi to create a new investor category called Foreign Portfolio Investors .
Strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of foreign investors into India to over $ 206 billion since 1991. In rupee terms, their investments are at Rs 10 lakh crore level during the period.

Polls: Pro-Western parties leading Ukraine voteRating Group exit poll
(The public mood has turned…)
KIEV: Two exit polls indicated that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's party will secure a narrow win in Sunday's parliamentary election, falling substantially short of an outright majority.
The vote, which aimed to overhaul a legislature tainted by its association with the ousted former president, Viktor Yanukovych, was expected to usher in a contingent of largely pro-Western lawmakers.
The Rating Group Ukraine exit poll said the Poroshenko Bloc won 22.2 per cent of the vote and that Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's Popular Front party came second at 21.8 per cent. A recently formed pro-European party based in western Ukraine, Samopomich, was seen in third with 14.2 per cent of the vote.
Another exit poll, organized by three Ukrainian research groups, saw the Poroshenko Bloc with 23 per cent of the vote and Popular Front in second with 21.3 per cent.
Although they lead rival parties, Poroshenko and Yatsenyuk share pro-Western postures and have campaigned on reform agendas aimed at pulling Ukraine back from the brink of economic ruin. Poroshenko Bloc and Popular Front are likely to form a coalition together with other pro-European parties.
Preliminary official results are expected Monday.
While around 36 million people were registered to vote, no voting was held on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March, or in parts of Ukraine's easternmost regions, where unrest is still rumbling and armed pro-Russia separatists have taken a firm hold.
The election marks a closing chapter in the legacy of Yanukovych, who was ousted in February after months of street protests following his November 2013 decision to put ties with the European Union on hold in favor of deepening trade relations with Russia. The protests broadened into a mass uprising fueled by rage at Ukraine's pervasive corruption and culminated in snipers shooting dead dozens of demonstrators.
The outgoing parliament was previously dominated by Yanukovych's Party of Regions, which had its main base of support in the heavily Russian-speaking industrial east.
Some supporters of the Party of Regions were viewed as likely to back the Opposition Bloc party, which both exit polls showed with almost 8 per cent of the vote, well above the 5 per cent threshold needed to enter parliament.
Nongovernment watchdog Opora estimated that 2.8 million people in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east _ more than half the potential 5 million voters there _ were unable to cast their ballot.
Tamara Shupa, a 62-year old retiree in Kiev, the capital, said she hoped incoming lawmakers would put an end to the war.
``We are very tired of the war,'' Shupa said at a polling station. ``To bring about change, we need peace.''
Andrei Voitenko, a 40-year old teacher casting his ballot at a school in the capital, Kiev, said a new parliament would have to work toward repaying the high price paid by his fellow Ukrainians.
  ``We are overhauling the government because Ukraine and Ukrainians have made a European choice,'' Voitenko said. ``We need a new parliament to make a European future. We have drawn a line under our Soviet past.''
After voting at a polling station in Kiev, Yatsenyuk said the time had come to ``reset'' parliament and government.
``This is a first tremendous and crucial step to make Ukrainian politics more clear, more transparent, more responsible and more accountable,'' he said, speaking in English.
Poroshenko visited the eastern town of Kramatorsk, which was wrested from separatist control in July. Speaking at a polling station, he paid tribute to the soldiers who have been fighting separatists for six months.
Voting later in Kiev, Poroshenko said no major polling violations had been recorded.
``We are holding elections that correspond to all European democratic standards,'' he said.
Poroshenko said he regretted, however, that more than 25,000 troops serving in locations other than their place of official residence were unable to vote.
Ukraine's woes have been compounded by a conflict against armed separatists on the border with Russia that has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people. Ukrainian security authorities said border troops were fired upon Sunday by rebels in the Luhansk region.
The public mood has turned sharply against the leadership in Moscow over what is widely seen as its direct role in fomenting separatist unrest.
``Russia cannot interfere with Ukraine. We will become part of Europe,'' said 30-year old economist Anton Rushailo, after voting in Kiev. ``Sooner or later, we will join NATO, and today we are taking an important step in that direction.''
Igor Seleznev, a retired 65-year old economist, said he cast his ballot for Opposition Bloc as he believed it was the only party willing to resist the emerging pro-reform consensus.
``For now, I see only change for the worse. Standard of life is getting worse, we are at war with Russia and there is economic chaos,'' Seleznev said.
In Volnovakha, a government-controlled town 60 kilometers (38 miles) south of the main rebel-held city of Donetsk, voting took place under heavy security.
``Nobody wants what is going on now,'' said Nadezhda Eshtokina, a retiree in Volnovakha. ``I think everything will be good with time, and our grandchildren will live well and live like Europeans.''

Crude oil s slide a blow  not a boon to Asia...Crude oil's slide a blow, not a boon to Asian refiners

A 25 per cent slide in crude prices since June should mean a windfall for Asian refiners, but instead they are facing a major drag on profits.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL/SINGAPORE: A 25 per cent slide in crude prices since June should mean a windfall for Asian refiners, but instead they are facing a major drag on profits.
Although benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate crudes are just off multi-year lows, many refiners have previously agreed to pay higher prices for deliveries through to the end of this year and can not pass those costs on to fuel buyers.
Forecasts that crude prices will remain weaker-than-expected into next year have also raised the spectre of big writedowns on crude and product inventories on year-end earnings reports.
"As (the falls were) unexpected, they are causing earnings shocks," said Andrew Yoon, a senior analyst at Daishin Securities, noting the knock-on impact that cuts in oil inventory values would have on end-of-year results.
Brent dropped to less than $83 a barrel on Oct. 16, its lowest in almost four years after falling from this year's high of $115.71 in mid-June. The front-month contract has recovered some lost ground and has held mostly above $85 since then, but it is not clear its four-month downtrend is finished.
"In terms of an impact on our inventories, cheaper oil price is a minus as it will lead to appraisal losses," said Yasushi Kimura, head of the Petroleum Association of Japan and chairman of Japan's biggest refiner JX Holdings.
A source at a Southeast Asian refiner said his company started the year with an oil complex based on a $106 price for Brent, and even if the benchmark recovers to $90, it is looking at a $16-a-barrel loss on oil in tanks.
The refiner holds about 3 million barrels of crude at any time, yielding a paper loss of around $48 million under this price scenario.
South Korea - with the fourth-largest refining capacity in Asia Pacific at 2.9 million barrels per day - held 29.5 million barrels of crude inventory by end-September, customs data shows.
That means every $10 drop in crude represents a $295 million loss in South Korea's inventory values.
South Korean refiners could also take a hit on lower values for more than 52 million barrels of oil products that state-run Korea National Oil Corp says they held at the end of last month.
MARGINS AND RUNS
SK Innovation Co Ltd , which owns SK Energy Co Ltd, South Korea's largest refiner, said it is looking into ways to minimise position risks against falling crude prices.
Asian refiners usually do not hedge crude imports.
"We have already bought all the crude to be delivered through the year-end, considering it takes two months for most shipments," said a Seoul-based refining source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Although margins at a complex refinery in Singapore - the benchmark value for Asia - have rebounded to above $5 a barrel from an average of $3.66 a barrel in August, with refiners still waiting for high-cost crude shipments to arrive, those improvements may not hold.

NASA has said the haul of 1.5 tonnes of experiment results and other materials should reach the space agency by late Monday for scientists to pick apart.
In Pic: The Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, is raised at launch Pad-0A, Saturday, October 25, 2014, at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.

WASHINGTON: Orbital Sciences Corporation's unmanned Cygnus cargo ship is preparing to launch to the International Space Station Monday, aiming to carry some 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms) of materials for space experiments.
The planned supply mission, the third for the private company to the orbiting lab, is set for 6:45 pm (1045 GMT), from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is supposed to arrive at the space station November 2.
The US space agency said on its web site there is "a 98 percent chance of favorable weather at the time of launch."
The space craft will be carrying nearly 5,000 pounds of cargo, almost a third of which will be supplies for ongoing and new experiments to be conducted on board ISS.
New experiments include "Drain Brain," an experiment aimed at investigating how blood flows from the brain to the heart in the absence of gravity, to help scientists mitigate headaches and other neurological complaints from scientists on the space station.
The results could also have implications for treating neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, on Earth.
Other experiments have been designed and built by students, ranging from one investigating the rate pea shoots grow in space to another aiming to determine the impact of microgravity on spoiling milk.
The Cygnus capsule will also be equipped with a specially designed re-entry recorder, that will be able to wirelessly transmit data as the craft breaks up as it moves back into Earth's atmosphere.
Monday's planned launch falls during a heavy traffic period for the International Space Station.
On Saturday, SpaceX's unmanned Dragon spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, carrying a heavy load of NASA cargo and scientific samples from the International Space Station that experts hope could yield significant results.
NASA has said the haul of 1.5 tonnes of experiment results and other materials should reach the space agency by late Monday for scientists to pick apart.
Dragon is currently the only spacecraft capable of returning from the ISS with cargo.
Wednesday, the Russian cargo ship Progress is set to take off for the ISS, replacing a sister vessel due to break away from the orbiting station and return to Earth on Monday.
Three of the six ISS crew members are also preparing to leave the lab after 165 days in orbit. They are set to ride in a Russian Soyuz craft on November 9.
Their three replacements, a Russian and two Americans, should arrive on November 23.
NASA lost its ability to reach the space station alone when the shuttle program ended in 2011 after 30 years.
The US space agency has helped fund private companies in the race to restore US access to the ISS.

Delhi realty stuck in no mans landUrban areas in and around Delhi constitute 40% of unsold real estate in top eight cities

India
(The NCR has a total of 303.48…)
NEW DELHI: Guess who probably had a terrible Diwali? The capital's builders. Just look at one simple statistic. Urban areas in and around Delhi account for a stunning 40% of unsold real estate in India's top eight cities. So, why is it so gloomy in NCR? Why does Bangalore and even Mumbai look better?
THE PROBLEM
The NCR has a total of 303.48 million sq ft (about 303,000 apartments) of unsold real estate, according to property research firm Liases Foras. At the current pace of sales, this stock requires another 53 months to be completely sold off. In comparison, for the Mumbai region, the figure is about 48 months while it is the lowest for Bangalore at 19 months. For the top eight cities combined, the 765 m sq ft of unsold space will require at least 35 months to be sold.
The festive season this year has failed to bring cheer to builders despite many of them doling out offers which include ones where buyers have to pay 10% of the apartment cost upfront and the rest at the time of possession. Brokers say they are getting a lot of enquiries from buyers but not too many conversions.Riding on improved sentiments, home sales in the NCR are up about 10% over the previous quarter, but sales are still not happening at the pace that is usually associated with the festive period. In good years, builders were able to garner almost 30-40% of their sales for the entire year during this threemonth period.
BUILDING NOWHERE
But it's not just the size of the unsold 'inventory' that makes Delhi the worst off among the real estate markets of larger cities. 56% of the unsold real estate in NCR is in areas which are currently uninhabitable. In other words, while the apartments have come up, the other essential infrastructure — roads, sewage systems, or water connections — have not. In comparison, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 168 m sq ft (168,000 apartments) and Bangalore has 113 m sq ft (113,000 apartments) of unsold space of which just 2% of the inventory is in undeveloped areas in each city. While sales have slowed down in Mumbai as well, the real reason is more to do with high prices.
"NCR is a very inefficient market where a lot of projects were launched in undeveloped areas," says Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras. Take for instance the Dwarka-Manesar Expressway. Its location in Gurgaon is closest to Delhi and several projects were launched here a few years back but work on the expressway has not been completed yet though some builders are close to giving possession to buyers.
"As the level of sales dropped, the interest of developers in creating social infrastructure also reduced," says Samarjit Singh, managing director of IndiaHomes, a real estate brokerage firm. Over the last few years, a number of scams and project related issues that have cropped up across NCR have also scared buyers. While project delays are a big issue, cases against developers such as the one where the Competition Commission of India slapped a fine of Rs 630 crore on DLF for unfair trade practices in a few of its Gurgaon projects, or environmental concerns such as those around development near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, have added to the gloom.
SPECULATORS
And while the real estate market in every city has its share of speculators - investors who don't really want to live in the flats they buy and essentially see them as an investment they can flip quickly to other buyers — the NCR has far more than its fair share. In NCR, well over 50% of those who buy property think of it as a short-term investment, pushing builders to launch hundreds of projects over the last few years without so much as a thought to the main premise of real estate — location. "The problem in the NCR is peculiar," says Mudassir Zaidi, national director - residential at Knight Frank India.
"Prevalence of investors is compounding the problem as they are also selling their inventory, undercutting developers on price as they do not have the holding capacity." When the economy was riding high, these investor-buyers flipped properties at ease within six months of buying them, thus making a killing and raising prices. But the same market is now gasping for breath as actual buyers started to pull back in an uncertain market.
 
"There is a logjam in NCR because the trust deficit about the builder community here is the worst compared to other cities," says Singh, pointing out that the list of developers still maintaining their reputation is now very small in the NCR. Buyers, he says, now prefer buying apartments in completed projects or in ones that are at a very late stage of construction.
Kapoor of Liases Foras says in locations where social infrastructure is in place and the price too is compelling, home sales are still robust.

(In 2009, President Barack…)
In 2009, President Barack Obama became the first US President to celebrate Diwali - the festival of lights - officially at the White House and last week, US secretary of state John Kerry, celebrated the Indian festival for the first time at the state department in Washington DC. "As the days grow shorter, Diwali reminds us that spring always returns — that knowledge triumphs over ignorance, hope outlasts despair, and light replaces darkness. Diwali is a time for the revitalisation of mind and spirit," Kerry said to the guests, who included Indian ambassador to the US S Jaishankar, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asia Nisha Desai Biswal and USAID administrator Raj Shah.
Hindu priest Narayanachar L Digalakote from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple presided over the ceremonial lighting of the lamp. Earlier, President Obama had sent out Diwali greetings to all those who were celebrating. Official Diwali celebrations and messages from the top brass in US government are a clear signal that the 1.9 million Indian American community is growing not just in numbers but also becoming more visible in public life.
"It shows that the political activism of the community is growing rapidly considering that the White House, house of representatives, different states and local governments all issue official proclamation for Diwali," says Sanjay Puri, chairman of the US Indian Political Action Committee. USINPAC is now working with the US House of representatives and has done an outreach to the White House and several state and local governments to issue proclamations and allow their Indian American employees casual leave for Diwali.
Across different geographies, people of Indian origin have been highlighting Diwali among the mainstream communities as a festival that showcases the diversity of India. Deepak Obhrai, a Conservative member of parliament in Canada and parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs, was responsible for putting Diwali on the cultural map of the Canadian government way back in 1998.
"When we first celebrated Diwali at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, it was a small event with only a few guests attending. Now it has become so big with thousands of people wanting to attend that we have moved the official event to a large auditorium in Toronto from last year to give more people the opportunity to witness and appreciate Canada's National Diwali Celebration," Obhrai said.
"We have come a long way from the days when as new immigrants here we got together with a few friends and had dinner at someone's home in the evening after work for Diwali," he adds. Early last week, Canada's PM Stephen Harper along with many of his colleagues from government and Indo-Canadian community leaders celebrated Diwali at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton. British Prime Minister David Cameron also hosted the annual Diwali party at his official residence in London extending greetings to over 8,00,000 Hindus living in the UK and thanking them for their contribution to the country, even as UK's Opposition Labour party, had its own Diwali celebrations where party leader Ed Miliband expressed the hope that he would be celebrating the festival as Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street next year.
"The message that the UK government is sending is that this is a tolerant, inclusive and multi-cultural country. Also, Diwali is amongst the biggest religious festivals in the world, and the UK government continues to honour the festival's enduring traditions of light over darkness, prosperity and happiness," says Londonbased executive chairman of Topsgrup Diwan Rahul Nanda.
 
Sarosh Zaiwalla, founder of London law firm Zaiwalla & Co Solicitors, too agrees that the UK is signaling that it is a tolerant, fair and inclusive society for all faiths and cultures. "The bigger Diwali celebrations also reflect the increasing number of NRIs moving to the UK, as it becomes a hub for attracting quality intellectual talent from across the world. The Indian community is now one of the largest communities in all parts of the UK," he adds.

Advanced Tax Strategy to Avoid State Income Taxesreddit
While corporate tax inversions are getting all the press lately, there is another tax strategy - call it a " personal tax inversion " - that can help individuals avoid taxes. However, similar to corporate tax inversions, the personal version is becoming just as controversial. Earlier this year New York state, which was losing an estimated $150 million a year through tax avoidance, effectively closed this tax loophole for New York residents. Other states may follow, but until then, if you expect a windfall from a one-time gain or an investment account that you anticipate to produce significant income over the coming years, a personal tax inversion might make sense.
The personal tax inversion strategy is not right for every situation, but under the right circumstances, it can be an effective way to pay less state income tax. The technique, which works best if you live in a state with a high income tax - requires the use of an Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust. The Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust allows you to shift assets to another state with a lower or no state income tax such as Nevada or Delaware. These structures are also referred to as NINGs or DINGs to reflect the state (Nevada and Delaware, respectively) in which the trust is located. As Neil Schoenblum, Senior Vice President at First American Trust in Las Vegas, Nevada, explains, "The NING affords certain persons with significant investment income a rare opportunity to reduce their total tax cost by avoiding all state income taxes that might otherwise be imposed."
How a NING/DING Works
There are grantor trusts and non-grantor trusts. A grantor trust is established by an individual called the grantor. With a grantor trust, the grantor (i.e., you) is treated as owning the trust assets for income tax purposes, and as such, is responsible for any income tax due on the assets within the trust. For example, if you live in California and simply have a trust administered in Nevada, you will still be taxed as a California resident.
On the other hand, a non-grantor trust is where you place assets into the trust and give up enough tax strings so that you are no longer considered the "owner" for tax purposes. So now the trust itself and not you is responsible for paying the income tax. If the trust is administered in a tax-free state such as Nevada, the trust pays no state tax, but don't celebrate too soon. If you transfer assets outside of your control, you run the risk of having to pay gift taxes. So while you may avoid state income tax, you would most likely have to pay federal gift tax or at least use up your gift/estate tax exclusion if the drafting attorney isn't careful. A non-grantor trust isn't going to work well if that were to happen.
The solution is to use a NING or DING. The "secret sauce" of this structure is the careful drafting of the documents. The goal is to keep enough control that you don't get accused of gifting the assets and having to pay gift tax, but not retain so much control that you are responsible for state income tax. This is an advanced strategy that requires the guidance of a good estate or tax attorney. Estate planning and asset protection attorney, Steve Oshins, of Oshins & Associates in Las Vegas, Nevada says, "Nevada has become the go-to state for this technique. I have done more NING Trusts this year than ever before given the favorable NING Trust Rulings that the IRS has recently issued. People love to save state income tax."
An added benefit is that NINGs and DINGs not only provide tax minimization but also asset protection. If you are interested in minimizing state income taxes, have your advisers run an analysis to see if a Nevada Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust (NING) or a Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust (DING) will work for you.

Why China s property slowdown isn t so scaryView Photo
Photolibrary | Getty Images
China's property market looks to be on shaky ground with home sales flagging and prices declining, but Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS - News ) isn't fretting about a sharp downturn in the sector.
"Our bottom line is that the Chinese housing market has some clear signs of 'froth'," Andrew Tilton and Hui Shan, economists at the bank, wrote in note. "But with several sources of pent-up demand, policymakers have a broad array of tools to deploy (and have even started to deploy some) to help support the housing market," they said.
The bubble in the housing market has been generated more from the supply side - overbuilding by developers- rather than the demand side whereby households leverage up to purchase beyond their means, Tilton and Shan said.
Read More China home prices fall for fourth straight month
This means there is still scope to stimulate demand should policymakers desire to do so, they said, noting that rapidly-rising incomes and continued urbanization ensure a large pool of potential buyers in the country.
"Chinese policymakers are attentive to the risks and can avail themselves of a particularly broad array of tools to smooth the adjustment path and limit risks," they said.
Plenty of policy tools
In late-September, policymakers took bold steps to prop up the housing market, allowing a broader range of home buyers access to lower down payments and mortgage rates.
Read More China relaxes mortgage rules for second home buyers
There's further scope to ease mortgage lending conditions, the bank said.
"The mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio is still low in China, so easing mortgage credit would be highly likely to increase sales, prices and construction activity, with minimal incremental financial stability risk," it said.
Alternatively, the government could provide liquidity to distressed developers or even purchasing inventory directly in order to prevent them from cutting price aggressively to liquidity inventories.
However, the bank acknowledges that managing the property slowdown won't be an easy task.
"Policy must be restrictive enough to rein in shadow banking activity and limit future excesses in construction. But it must be loose enough to support demand and avoid a sharp credit crunch that could lead to liquidation of housing inventory and large price declines," Tilton and Shan said.
"Compared with the previous two housing slowdowns in 2008-09 and 2011-12, debt is higher and growth is slower, so policymakers face more constraints today in designing and implementing effective policy changes to steer the housing market away from an eventual hard landing," they added.
The housing sector - which is linked to some 40 sectors in the country from cement to furniture - is regarded as the weakest link in the world's second-largest economy.
Read More China GDP beats, but growth rate slowest since crisis
Growth in real estate investment slowed to 12.5 percent in the first nine months of 2014, from 13.2 percent in the first eight months, while property sales and new construction tumbled, helping to drag broader economic growth to a near six-year low in the third quarter.
"We expect the contribution of housing activity to real GDP growth to wane significantly by 2015, although it is still a net positive," Tilton and Shan said.
"Spillovers to the financial system will not have large negative consequences, because of low household leverage, the lack of complex financial products that can amplify systemic risk, and policymakers' demonstrated ability and willingness to limit the degree of credit stress on the system and to support key institutions," they said.
Near-term outlook brightening
Alvin Wong, China property analyst at Barclays (London Stock Exchange: BARC-GB), expects the government's recently announced property measures will begin to boost sales as soon as the fourth quarter.
"With the effect of the more preferential mortgage environment to kick in, including a lower down payment ratio for upgrade demand, the cheaper lending rate for first mortgages as well as more supportive housing provident fund loan policies, we believe this should bode well for the continued improvement in the sales momentum in the fourth quarter," he wrote in a note.
Read More China's property rescue package: Will it work?
Different from the historical pattern of September sales generally being better than October sales - sales for the first three weeks of this October - across 30 major cities tracked by the bank - have exceeded the level recorded in the same period of September, he said.
With a better October likely, this should translate into the first year-on year increase in national property sales in 2014, he noted.

Printing dept. bid to retain redundant posts
N. J. Nair
Tweet
While the State government is embarking on a drive to do away with obsolete posts in various departments as part of its austerity measures, the Printing Department is reported to be making efforts to retain more than 200 posts that have become redundant over the years.
Official sources told The Hindu that contrary to the government directive to identify such posts, a conscious effort is on to amend the service rules and retain posts that have become outdated following fast-paced changes in the printing sector during the past few decades. The posts of forms officer, compositors and supervisors in various sections in government presses and a legion of proofreaders are just some among them.
Outsourcing
With a lion’s share of the government jobs, including printing of textbooks, being outsourced to the private sector, the state-of-the-art printing facilities in all the 11 presses and the workforce are largely left to idle.
Still, no attempt has been made to audit their output. The revenue drain on this score too has not been estimated so far, sources said.
The post of forms officer, which was created decades ago to distribute government application forms, as well as offices and supporting staff, still exists in 11 districts. Proposals to set up the offices in Wayanad and Idukki were turned down.
Filing of online applications has rendered the posts outdated.
A large number of posts such as compositors and proofreaders are still being retained.
In the wake of the financial crisis, the Finance Department had issued a directive to end the system of officials going on deputation as it entailed financial commitment to the government. Officers on deputation from the Secretariat were being posted as the Director of Printing in violation of such directives. As the officers who held the post were unfamiliar with the nature and functions of the department, many anomalies often went unnoticed, sources said.
The government had proposed to scrap insignificant posts and form a pool of employees occupying such posts. But no efforts were being made either to identify the posts or re-train the employees to make them relevant in the current context, the sources said.

Diwali gains political patronage as NRIs hef...Diwali gains political patronage as NRIs heft grows in US, UK

(In 2009, President Barack…)
In 2009, President Barack Obama became the first US President to celebrate Diwali - the festival of lights - officially at the White House and last week, US secretary of state John Kerry, celebrated the Indian festival for the first time at the state department in Washington DC. "As the days grow shorter, Diwali reminds us that spring always returns — that knowledge triumphs over ignorance, hope outlasts despair, and light replaces darkness. Diwali is a time for the revitalisation of mind and spirit," Kerry said to the guests, who included Indian ambassador to the US S Jaishankar, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asia Nisha Desai Biswal and USAID administrator Raj Shah.
Hindu priest Narayanachar L Digalakote from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple presided over the ceremonial lighting of the lamp. Earlier, President Obama had sent out Diwali greetings to all those who were celebrating. Official Diwali celebrations and messages from the top brass in US government are a clear signal that the 1.9 million Indian American community is growing not just in numbers but also becoming more visible in public life.
"It shows that the political activism of the community is growing rapidly considering that the White House, house of representatives, different states and local governments all issue official proclamation for Diwali," says Sanjay Puri, chairman of the US Indian Political Action Committee. USINPAC is now working with the US House of representatives and has done an outreach to the White House and several state and local governments to issue proclamations and allow their Indian American employees casual leave for Diwali.
Across different geographies, people of Indian origin have been highlighting Diwali among the mainstream communities as a festival that showcases the diversity of India. Deepak Obhrai, a Conservative member of parliament in Canada and parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs, was responsible for putting Diwali on the cultural map of the Canadian government way back in 1998.
"When we first celebrated Diwali at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, it was a small event with only a few guests attending. Now it has become so big with thousands of people wanting to attend that we have moved the official event to a large auditorium in Toronto from last year to give more people the opportunity to witness and appreciate Canada's National Diwali Celebration," Obhrai said.
"We have come a long way from the days when as new immigrants here we got together with a few friends and had dinner at someone's home in the evening after work for Diwali," he adds. Early last week, Canada's PM Stephen Harper along with many of his colleagues from government and Indo-Canadian community leaders celebrated Diwali at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton. British Prime Minister David Cameron also hosted the annual Diwali party at his official residence in London extending greetings to over 8,00,000 Hindus living in the UK and thanking them for their contribution to the country, even as UK's Opposition Labour party, had its own Diwali celebrations where party leader Ed Miliband expressed the hope that he would be celebrating the festival as Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street next year.
"The message that the UK government is sending is that this is a tolerant, inclusive and multi-cultural country. Also, Diwali is amongst the biggest religious festivals in the world, and the UK government continues to honour the festival's enduring traditions of light over darkness, prosperity and happiness," says Londonbased executive chairman of Topsgrup Diwan Rahul Nanda.
 
Sarosh Zaiwalla, founder of London law firm Zaiwalla & Co Solicitors, too agrees that the UK is signaling that it is a tolerant, fair and inclusive society for all faiths and cultures. "The bigger Diwali celebrations also reflect the increasing number of NRIs moving to the UK, as it becomes a hub for attracting quality intellectual talent from across the world. The Indian community is now one of the largest communities in all parts of the UK," he adds.

Srinagar: Every Indian stands "shoulder to shoulder" with soldiers posted in Siachen Glacier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday as he began a visit to Jammu and Kashmir.
"Everyone is aware of the extreme conditions at Siachen. Overcoming every challenge our soldiers stand firm, protecting our motherland," Modi said in a tweet.
"Be it the altitude or bitter cold, nothing deters our soldiers. They stand there, serving our nation. They make us truly proud.
"Am going to Siachen with a message from each and every Indian to our soldiers: that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you," he said in tweets from his personal Twitter account.
Siachen glacier is the world's highest battlefield at a height of 5,400 meters. Its ownership is disputed by Pakistan.
Modi will visit Srinagar from Siachen to meet victims of the recent unprecedented floods that ravaged the Kashmir Valley and the Jammu region.

Smallcaps  midcaps to shine in 5 yrs: ICICI Pru s NarenIn an interview to CNBC-TV18, S Naren, CIO- Equities, ICICI Prudential AMC shares his view on the equity market and his outlook for the next few years.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.
Sonia: Do you think that from now until next Samvat as well a lot of money to be made will be in midcaps and small caps rather the large caps?
Naren: If you take a very long period of time it is always the small and midcaps which tend to do the best but if I look at the next one year for us, I have a simple formula, there are three things which I put as a filter to decide which asset class we should actually tell people to invest in; one is bad past returns, second is fear and third is attractive valuations and today the combination of bad past returns, fear and attractive valuations that combination actually goes to debt mutual funds and not to small caps because in small caps as you know the past returns have been very high.
So if you take a one year view it clearly looks to us that small caps are going to be a higher risk, moderate return kind of investment but of course if you have a three to five year kind of view always small caps and midcaps tend to do very well and if you are willing to bear the risk of small caps the five year experience should be very good.
Anuj: From index point of view how should one position portfolio because we have seen IT and pharma do well. Intermittently we have seen domestic cyclicals do well and for the last one month we have seen banks make a big return. Going forward what two or three sectors do you think would give best returns as far as the large caps space is concerned?
Naren: If you see at this point of time the public sector companies which are likely to do disinvestment in the next six months that would be one good investment opportunity. The second investment opportunity if you see there has been so much of fear which is there in the entire mining related stocks at this point of time. If you go back a year the biggest fear was actually in the oil marketing companies and you know the returns that sector has given.
So if you take a two year period clearly another sector which really looks good are all the stocks which have been badly hurt by whatever has happened in mining in the last six months to one year. That would be another interesting pack.
The third pack which I am very scared about but I see potential upside but I don’t have the guts to invest is these leverage stock pack. If you see the leverage stock pack most of them corrected. In May they all ran up but after May till now they have actually corrected 30-50 percent and again they have become very cheap but to have guts to buy them you need to have confidence that each of these individual companies will get deleveraged and that appears to be a bit of a challenge but if you are a very high risk investor that is the other pack which looks good.
Other than these three areas I don’t think there is any pocket of the market which I can call cheap. People put words into my mouth and say does it mean it is costly, I say, it is not costly but it is not cheap. So, that is where the market is at this point of time.

The paradox of being TabuUpdated: October 25, 2014 17:51 IST
The paradox of being Tabu
Sudhish Kamath
arts, culture and entertainment
Did you know the queen of arthouse prefers mainstream? That’s what the writer discovers to his surprise on meeting the charming Tabu
If you didn’t watch her films, you could easily mistake her for Farah Khan. For she shares Farah’s spirit and love for commercial cinema and is almost dismissive of anything arthouse or indie because her idea of cinema is ironically the opposite of the films she is in. “Maybe that’s why we have been best friends for years,” she laughs out loud.
“There’s a dichotomy, I agree,” she laughs in the middle of our interview when I confront her after sensing that she prefers entertainment to art.
We are talking about the queen of arthouse here. Tabu. Of Haider. Of Life of Pi. Tabu. Of The Namesake. Of Chandni Bar.
“People have created this perception of me in their own heads because they take it for granted that I am only going to do these (art) kinds of films and that I have a great opinion only about these films. Aisa kuch nahin hai,” says Tabu, talking to me at her Lokhandwala flat.
Maybe that’s why she did Jai Ho? A Bhai film to make a statement.
“It was homecoming for me. It’s the fourth film I did with Salman,” she laughs. “I may prefer comedies or Farah Khan kind of films but people who are offering me these roles are not thinking whether I’m endorsing that kind of films. They approach me if they feel I suit the role and the character.”
"Every film is a different offer. It should be worth my time if I have to get out of comfort zone to do a film"
What doesn’t she like about arthouse films then?
“Well, most of the people can’t or don’t want to pay money. Probably, they come with the presumption or notion that I believe in art more. I don’t know. Maybe they think I have no right to ask for money because they have given me a good role.”
How could they think that the actress who did multiple-Oscar-winning Life of Pi andThe Namesake would be affordable, I ask.
“People can think anything, no? I can’t show them my repertoire. Most of the time, it’s that or sometimes, I think it is not worth my time. I have to spend six months or a year away from home. In any case, I don’t think everyone does everything offered to them. How many actors or my contemporaries are doing ten films a year. Why is this question posed to me?”
So she is a reluctant actor because the kind of films she loves watching don’t approach her and the films that want her can’t afford her?
“I don’t know what to answer. With every film, the priority is different. With every film, the reason for me to say ‘No’ is different. It’s not like a blanket thing. It’s not like a desk job. Every film is a different offer. I’m not able to understand. It should be worth my time if I have to get out of comfort zone to do a film.”
What’s her comfort zone? “My home. Lokhandwala. My friends. And my family. And it’s not a once and for all choice. You are making choices as and when the options are coming. Depending on what you are getting offered, irrespective of who the director is. You are picking or rejecting whatever comes along the way. Life of Pi and The Namesake were worth spending time away from home.”
“It’s a huge leap in your own experience with people. You meet new people. You get so much fodder. The friends I made in The Namesake — I still have my New York and LA friends. That way, it opens up my life. So if it translates to work, then great.”
So how does she evaluate artistic merit in projects? What is good cinema to her?
She pauses to think for a moment and explains hesitantly. “Enjoying the experience of watching the film. I can’t get away from being an audience from my childhood association with movies. That’s why it’s difficult for me to become critical, analytical or judgmental about movies and cinema. As an actor, your life has changed, your relationship with the movies has changed. But when you were not an actor, your relationship with movies was totally different. So somewhere you were caught between that and this. So I am not able to get a handle on what is my take on movies and what is my relationship with it.”
She never went to acting school. She picked up acting along the way, on the job, she says. When Vishal called her for Haider, she did have her reservations about the odd pairing. She knew it was a layered, complex role. There was just one reading before they left for Kashmir and that was it.
I ask her about that moment when a grown up Haider kisses her sensuously on her neck and her reaction at that exact point. Did she know she was getting into incestuous territory?
“I didn’t see it like that. It’s definitely not incestuous. If there was, it was not deliberate. That’s what came at that time. There are too many layers, too many things going on in her mind,” she explains how she approached Vishal’s interpretation of Hamlet’s Oedipal relationship with his mother.
Torn, conflicted, complex. Classic Tabu.

Focus on flagship schemes; Anant Geete leads Sena team
Ahead of the crucial winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the NDA’s close to 400-odd MPs on Sunday evening that he expected them to take his government’s “pro-poor” initiatives pro-actively to the people, as these were not the exclusive property of some political parties/governments (a snide reference to the predecessor UPA dispensation). He also said he expected them to conduct themselves in a “righteous” manner, never indulging in any activity that may bring them into disrepute.
Mr Modi’s pointed message to his flock was delivered over high tea — attended, interestingly enough by the entire Shiv Sena contingent — on the lawns of 7 Race Course Road. It was the first such gathering of NDA MPs, but Mr Modi promised that this would become a regular feature.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, playing master of ceremonies, urged MPs to contribute to enhancing the quality of debates in Parliament, explained the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s objectives, and announced that Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 would be celebrated annually as Ekta Diwas, when all government servants will take the unity pledge. BJP veteran L, K. Advani congratulated party president Amit Shah for the election victories in Maharashtra and Haryana, while presenting him with a shawl.
For two hours, from 4 to 6 pm, the focus was on the importance of all ministers and MPs being fully briefed on key programmes so that, as a government source put it, “elected representatives are empowered to become effective political communicators” both inside and outside Parliament.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed MPs on the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana, the recent ordinance on coal and Union Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari on the Adarsh Gram Yojana; among other presentations.

SANAA (Reuters) - Around 10 civilians were killed as Shi'ite Muslim Houthi fighters backed by Yemeni government fire fought into strongholds of al Qaeda and its Sunni tribal allies in the centre of the country on Sunday, local tribesmen said.
They said the Yemeni army pounded fighters of al Qaeda's local wing, Ansar al-Sharia, and local tribes with air strikes, artillery and Katuysha rockets in al-Baydah province, about 160 km (100 miles) southeast of the capital Sanaa.
"Around 10 civilians were killed and a number were injured, including women and children," one tribal source said. "But because it is dark and due to the continuing clashes, we were unable to retrieve all the victims," he told Reuters, adding that dozens of families had fled the fighting.
There were no details of casualties among the fighters.
The northern-based Houthis established themselves as power brokers in Yemen last month by capturing Sanaa against scant resistance from the administration of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, angering al Qaeda and Sunni Muslim tribal allies.
Another tribal source said heavy fighting was underway in the Khobza area, another stronghold held by Ansar al-Sharia and its allies, in al-Baydah.
"The Houthis are advancing to control the rest of Qaifa (tribal) areas and the night could see even more violent confrontations," the tribal official, who declined to be named, told Reuters by telephone.
The Houthis, with Yemeni army backing, earlier battled their way to al-Manasseh, a small town regarded as the main Ansar al-Sharia stronghold in the area.
Tribal sources said the Ansar al-Sharia fighters withdrew to another district called Bakla, about 3 km (two miles) away.
IDEOLOGY
Al Qaeda, which follows a hardline Sunni Muslim ideology, views the Houthis, who hail from the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam, as heretics.
The Houthis began advancing into central and western Yemen this month after an al Qaeda suicide bomber killed at least 47 people, mostly members of the group, as they prepared to stage a rally in Sanaa earlier this month.
Fighting has flared up in several provinces, alarming neighbour Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter.
Until now the Yemeni army had avoided supporting the Houthis in their advance on al Qaeda. But Hadi considers Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as the main threat facing the country.
One tribal leader said the Houthis exploited old rivalries between two wings of one of the main tribes in the area, the al-Dahab tribe, and managed to enter the area, which had long been the main stronghold of Ansar al-Sharia.
Houthi officials made no comment but the group's television station said Houthi fighters and their allies have "reached the home of the leader of the criminal gangs" in al-Manasseh, referring to Ansar al-Sharia.
A U.S. drone struck al Qaeda targets in al-Manasseh on Friday, killing at least three people, tribal sources said.
Local sources said on Sunday that Abdel-Ra'ouf al-Dahab, the local leader of Ansar al-Sharia, and a number of Saudi members of the group were killed in the strike. Officials could not confirm the report.

Sena can come on board without conditions: BJPstate politics
Announcement comes amid growing frustration within Shiv Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP
Even as a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit continues to lobby for a minority government in Maharashtra with the help of Independents, the party announced on Sunday that it wanted a tie-up with its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena. However, this announcement came with the rider that the Sena should come on board without any conditions.
“We are keen to take the Shiv Sena with us in forming the new government, but they should come forward without any conditions. Discussions on portfolios can come later; it is important to have a meeting of minds,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
The party’s statement came after an outburst by Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar earlier in the day: “The BJP does not want us. Their State leaders do not want the alliance.” Mr. Kirtikar was in Delhi to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high tea for NDA constituents.
There is growing frustration within the Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP ever since the election results. Many in the party feel the BJP is set to humiliate them and is not serious about striking an alliance.
However, the party welcomed the BJP’s statement. Meanwhile, the BJP has announced that its Chief Ministerial candidate will be chosen on Tuesday after a meeting of legislators and MPs. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and senior BJP leaders will be present.
The swearing-in ceremony is expected on October 30 at Wankhede stadium. Mr. Modi may attend the event.

(Will Dalal Street extend…)
MUMBAI: Will Dalal Street extend its newly-found strength to Samvat 2071 — the new traditional financial year that started on Thursday? With foreign institutional investors (FIIs) buying shares worth Rs 1,700 crore in three of the last four trading sessions and US equities showing signs of strength over the weekend, traders and investors are betting on the stock market showing gains early next week.
But, the momentum may lose steam as weekend nears as traders may book profits. Global financial markets will also watch the twoday US Fed meeting ending on Wednesday for comments on the direction of interest rates. "The fact that FIIs are buying into India despite the global uncertainty is a good sign. But, crisis in euro zone and possible interest rate hike in the US may decrease the pace of market rise," said Motilal Oswal, CMD at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
The benchmark indices —Sensex and Nifty — have risen in the past five trading sessions after a sell-off. The indices, which gained 3% last week, had fallen 2.25% between September 29 and October 17. But, the BSE Mid-cap index continues to be under pressure, declining over 3.25% since mid-September. Most of the optimism in the domestic markets last week was due to the strength on Wall Street. On Friday, US stocksclimbed, ending a four-week slide with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining about 127 points.
At home, volatility in the market may heighten with the October series futures and options (F&O) set to expire on Thursday. "Markets may extend gains but traders may opt for profit-booking at higher levels. Nifty may find resistance at 8,100 and support at 7,900 for the week," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. The Nifty closed at 8,044 points in the special 60-minute Muhurat trading session on Thursday.
"Global markets rallied towards the end of last week when Indian markets were closed. Thus, we expect markets to extend gains in the first half of the week, but may weaken towards the end, as market participants may take profits considering Sensex has rallied nearly 1,000 points in the past few trading sessions," said Kunj Bansal, executive director & chief investment officer at Centrum . Stock-specific action is likely with companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank , and Maruti Suzuki expected to announce second-quarter results.

IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Tokyo: Tokyo stocks opened 0.74 per cent higher on Monday, helped by a stable dollar against the yen and gains on Wall Street last week.
The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 112.64 points at 15,404.28 at the start.
The euro was stable early Monday after a large majority of eurozone banks were given a clean bill of health Sunday by the European Central Bank.
The common currency bought $1.2676 and 137.10 yen against $1.2666 and 136.97 yen in New York Friday afternoon.
In the most in-depth and stringent audit of eurozone banks ever undertaken -- aimed at preventing a repeat of the crisis that nearly led to the euro's collapse -- the ECB found that 25 out of a total 130 banks had a combined capital shortfall of 25 billion euros ($31 billion) at the end of 2013.
As for Tokyo shares, Takashi Matsumoto, senior strategist at Okasan Securities, said they "should have further room to rise, as long as overseas stocks and the currency market remain stable."
The dollar was at 108.18 yen early Monday compared with 108.14 yen in US trade Friday afternoon.
US stocks Friday capped a strong week on a high note as good earnings from Microsoft and others overshadowed a poor report from Amazon.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.76 per cent while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.71 per cent.

After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Consulting, feels the current uptrend in the market is driven by global liquidity and not just dependant on Indian factors. He advises to buy sensibly if one wishes to make money, as “wrong purchases, wrong timing could end up into losses in spite of a point-to-point rally”.
Though he agrees we are in a bull phase and things are looking positive, yet he believes is the market is also equally expensive at this point of time. “It is not a cheap market where rally is for a given in terms of share price. It can be a rally for the broader market but for individual shares everything is at PEs of 30 and above,” he said.
Below is the transcript of Ajay Srivastava's interview with CNBC-TV18's Sonia Shenoy, Latha Venkatesh and Anuj Singhal.
Latha: Do you feel as good, has any Samavat felt as good in terms of a longer term hope for the economy and for the markets, I can't remember one probably 1991 felt like that I wasn’t around covering markets then.
A: Things are looking pretty good at this point of time. Things are looking fine. I keep saying the caveat is that even in the boom rally it is not easy to make money. It is not like you splurge on equity and you are going to make your money here. So, even in this rally which we expect to continue, we expect lot of good things from the government to happen, I think there is a flip side.
The flip side is that we are so dependent on international flows that you saw what happened two weeks back or less than 7 days back. So, let us put a caveat to ourselves saying international flows make a difference to us irrespective of what we do. Number two is, the local demand. Local demand needs to get up to something which is sensible. It is not automatically that the demand is going to go up because you are having a fiscal deficit problem where you are compressing the expenditure. So, things are looking good, government is saying nice things but this is a rally driven by global liquidity not just by Indian factors. You have seen what has happened last week, it is a testimony to that. So, I would put a caveat to say buy sensibly if you have to make money even in this rally. Wrong purchases, wrong timing could end up into still losses in spite of a point to point rally that you see.
Latha: Do you think the global cues which looked fairly negative two weeks ago look a little less, Europe has just pulled back from recession, expectation of the PMI was 49.9, that would be contraction but it has actually come at 50.7 compared to 50.3 in the previous month that is September. So, are we just about not as bad as we thought we were 2-3 weeks back?
A: Things change so fast, in a weeks time we were like in despair, less than a week back we were fine and naturally hopeful. Let us not forget that the Indian markets are at a very expensive inflection point today. None of the stock that you can pin point are cheap at this point of time which means that they have to generate earning disappointment. You saw what happened with Infosys , TCS  etc could lead to a great amount of discomfort in the market. So, yes there is a bull rally, yes things are positive but I also believe that market is also equally expensive at this point of time. It is not a cheap market where rally is for a given in terms of share price. It can be a rally for the broader market but for individual shares everything is at PEs of 30 and above.
Sonia: We were speaking with Ramesh Damani yesterday in fact Latha was speaking with him and he said that the Japanese bull market lasted for 25 whole years. It is very difficult to predict how long this bull market will last but are you getting a sense that with all the cues stacked up this could be at least half a decade bull market for India now?
A: I see no reason. Ramesh is right absolutely, there is no doubt that we should see the onerous burdens of the last few years, one of the biggest onerous burden was corruption in the system, it seems to be prima facie under control or getting under control at this point of time. I think that should give us lot more resources to play with, lot more efficiency in the government etc. However it is all untested at this point of time to say that we have a 20 year rally. I would still say yes India should grow. At the end of the day half a billion of the people don’t even have full food to eat.
So, if they want to eat and have clothes and housing etc we should be growing at 6-7 percent for next 20 years, there is no doubt in my mind. However I would still put a caveat there to say that we still need to find a way to become a more efficient producer. We are a high cost economy at the end of the day. So, intentions are good everything is good but to get the bull run, Japanese were the most efficient producers if you look at the bull run they were the lowest cost producers in the world for 20 years that you are talking about, we are not today. So, analogy is good but we have lot more challenges to us than perhaps the Japanese had at that point of time.

ML Khattar takes oath as Haryana s first BJP CMML Khattar takes oath as Haryana's first BJP CM
Hitender Rao , Hindustan Times  Chandigarh, October 26, 2014

Comments
Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana's first chief minister from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), took oath at a high-profile event attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Panchkula on Sunday.

Alongside the 60-year-old former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activist, nine ministers -six holding cabinet ranks and three ministers of state (independent charge) - were also sworn in.
Haryana governor Kaptan Singh Solanki administered the oath of office and secrecy to Khattar at the Mela Ground in Sector 5 of Panchkula town, adjoining Chandigarh.
Apart from Modi, the high-profile event was attended by some of his cabinet colleagues, chief ministers of BJP-ruled states and RSS leaders.  Senior BJP leaders such as Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi were also present.
Khattar is the 10th chief minister of the state, which was created November 1, 1966.
It is after 18 years that a non-Jat was sworn in as the Haryana chief minister. Before Khattar, the last non-Jat CM was Bhajan Lal, a Bishnoi. He had been in power from 1991 to 1996.
Since 1996, successive Jat leaders — Bansi Lal of the HVP-BJP, Om Prakash Chautala of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress — have ruled the state.
The BJP had scripted history in the recently held Haryana assembly elections, winning 47 of the 90 seats in the state that helped the party form the government on its own.  The party's vote share, too, had galloped from 9% to 33%.
The six cabinet ministers sworn-in on the occasion were Ram Bilas Sharma, Abhimanyu, OP Dhankar, Anil Vij, Rao Narvir Singh and Kavita Jain.
The ministers of state (MoS) who were administered the oath of office and secrecy were Bikram Singh Thekedar, Krishan Bedi and Karan Dev Kamboj. They all will hold independent charges.

Who is Khattar?
Khattar - a Punjabi - is a sworn bachelor. He has the backup of the RSS and is seen as close to Modi, who endorsed his name for the CM's post in Haryana.
Khattar's selection silenced his critics, who said he lacks administrative experience as well as a popular base.
Khattar, often dubbed an "outsider" by rivals, also outdid the Jat-Punjabi rivalry that runs deep in the northern state.
"The majority view is in favour of having a non-Jat as chief minister," a BJP leader had said earlier.
Khattar, who had been an RSS pracharak for the past 40 years and an active BJP member for more than 20 years, won the Karnal seat with a big margin of more than 63,000 votes in his debut election.
He belongs to Rohtak's Nindana village.
Khattar has worked as an organising secretary in Haryana BJP when Modi was the in-charge of party affairs in the state.
The very fact that the BJP fielded him from Karnal, considered a rather safe seat for the party, gave ample indication of its plans for the Punjabi leader.

Challenges ahead
The new chief minister has no previous administrative experience. He will have to take care of his greenhorn cabinet team as well.
Khattar, who is known in the BJP circles as a strategist, will be tested for his administrative acumen and the ability to deliver.
All in the stars?
Planetary positions seem to have decided the day and the time of Khattar's oath-taking.
It was evident from the official invite to the swearing-in ceremony, where the time of oath-taking was printed as a precise 11.23am.
"The date and the time seem to have been chosen carefully," said Chandigarh-based astrologer Prem Kumar Sharma, adding: "Tritiya tithi and Anuradha nakshatra fall on October 26, which are quite favourable (star positions)."
Another astrologer said that at the time, Mangal (Mars) would be in lagna (ascendant).
"Mars is a planet of aggression, which shows that the new chief minister would be an assertive individual. During this period, Sun will be in the 11th house, which is a house of gains but associated with enemy planets Venus and Saturn, indicating loss of sheen in governance," said the fortuneteller.

Real Madrid come from behind to win the ClasicoNo joy for Suarez as Real beat Barca in 'Clasico'

Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (rear) celebrates after scoring with a penalty …
By Iain Rogers
MADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid trimmed Barcelona's lead at the top of La Liga to one point when they recovered from letting in an early goal to secure a stirring 3-1 comeback win in the 'Clasico' on Saturday.
There was no dream return for Luis Suarez, making his Barca debut after a four-month ban for biting an opponent at the World Cup.
The Uruguay forward looked reasonably sharp and had a hand in Neymar's opening goal but did not come close to scoring himself before being replaced by Pedro midway through the second half.
Neymar stunned a packed and hostile Bernabeu with a superb fourth-minute effort before Cristiano Ronaldo levelled with a penalty in the 35th, the first goal the Catalan side had conceded in nine league outings this term.
Pepe made it 2-1 to the European champions five minutes into the second half and a misunderstanding between Andres Iniesta and Javier Mascherano led to Real's third after the hour when Karim Benzema finished off a swift break with a clinical strike.
"The team was incredible across the board," Real defender Sergio Ramos told Spanish television.
"We had very clear ideas, we dominated and we not only controlled possession of the ball but we were very good on the counter attack," added the Spain international.
"Football is about phases of a match and you have to know how to read them. We fought for the ball and they are not used to that and we did them damage."
Barca are top with 22 points and Real, who had an early-season wobble but have been in scintillating form in recent weeks, second on 21. Sevilla, who host Villarreal on Sunday, are third with 19.
Four-times World Player of the Year Lionel Messi had a quiet night for Barca and remains one goal short of the league scoring record of 251 set by former Athletic Bilbao forward Telmo Zarra six decades ago.
"We played a very good first half," said Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.
"We had some good chances to unbalance them but the 3-1 caused us a lot of damage and we struggled," added the former Barca and Spain goalkeeper.
FIRST BLOOD
In a match watched by millions around the globe and showcasing many of the world's best and most expensive players, Barca drew first blood through Neymar, the Brazil captain's ninth league goal of the season.
Suarez picked him out on the left wing with a raking pass and Neymar skipped past challenges from Dani Carvajal and Pepe before firing into the corner past keeper Iker Casillas.
Real immediately upped their game and Benzema came close when he headed against the crossbar before smashing the rebound off the corner of the goal frame.
Casillas pulled off a superb save to deny Messi in the 23rd minute after Suarez had sent over a teasing low cross and Pepe cleared just as Neymar was preparing to nod home before Real were awarded a penalty.
Barca centre back Gerard Pique slipped and handled a Marcelo cross and Ronaldo sent Claudio Bravo the wrong way for his 16th La Liga goal in eight appearances this season.
It was the 11th consecutive game the Portugal forward has scored for Real, his best run since joining from Manchester United in 2009.
Real edged ahead when Pepe was given too much space at a corner and headed powerfully past Bravo before Barca shot themselves in the foot with a bizarre blunder by Iniesta and Mascherano near the edge of the pitch that gifted possession to Isco.
The Spain playmaker raced clear and the ball eventually found its way to Benzema who smashed it past Bravo off a post.
It was no more than Real deserved and although Barca pressed hard to force a way back into the game they barely troubled the home goal again.
It was Real's 71st victory in 169 La Liga 'Clasicos' since the arch rivals first clashed in the top flight in 1929. Barca have won 66 with 32 draws.

Modi may send Mamata tough message on Burdwan blasts probeModi may send Mamata tough message on Burdwan blasts probe
Shishir Gupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 27, 2014

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to send a stern message to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday over her perceived inaction on the Burdwan blasts: Shape up or the Centre will intervene in a bigger way.
Authoritative official sources said that Modi’s message will be delivered by national security adviser Ajit Doval, who is due to visit the terror site before he meets Mamata in Kolkata. Doval, a counter terrorism expert himself, is armed with a National Investigation Agency (NIA) report into the October 2 blast in the southeastern Bengal town that have been linked to the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).
Doval will tell Mamata that the Modi government is intent on fighting both homegrown and externally sponsored terror groups, and that the PM feels that central and state forces should work together. Modi is seriously concerned about linkages of the Burdwan blasts with pan-Islamic terrorism and political developments in Bangladesh, Mamata will be told.
Read: With Doval in Bengal, spotlight back on Mamata
The Modi government is acutely aware of the potential embarrassment that could result from not being able to root out from its soil a terror outfit that plans attacks against a friendly neighbour.
The two people killed while making bombs in the Burdwan house were found to be JMB operatives who intended to transport the devices into Bangladesh and the NIA report says that the JMB, a shadowy organisation formed in 2005, has plans to establish an Islamic state that encompasses Bangladesh and Murshidabad, Nadia and Malda districts of Bengal. 
The Centre ordered the NIA, its terror investigation body, to take over the probe into the blasts a week after the event. Mamata, whose government faced a barrage of criticism for its alleged mishandling of the investigation, opposed Delhi’s intervention.
Now, if Modi senses that the state is not cooperating, there is every possibility that the Intelligence Bureau’s counter-terror wing and the National Security Guard hub in Kolkata also get involved in a more proactive way, the sources said.
Doval, on the basis of NIA investigation report, will convey that the Burdwan JMB module was fabricating eight to ten improvised explosive devices (IEDs) per month since late 2011 — around the time that Mamata came to power in the state.
The NIA report states that already five to six consignments of 30-40 bombs have made their way to Bangladesh through a certain Kausar Kadir, who was known to the Burdwan blast accused.
The NIA has also come across mobile phone calls from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and UAE to the accused during investigations and point to possible terror linkages with these countries.
Formed in 2005, the JMB, according to the NIA report, has plans to establish an Islamic state that encompasses Bangladesh and Murshidabad, Nadia and Malda districts.
Until now, the NIA has recovered 95 bombs from Burdwan and Birbhum, and four persons have been held in Bengal and a further six in Assam. As many as 12 persons are absconding and are suspected to have fled to Bangladesh. Investigators believe that this is just the beginning.
India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RA&W) is sharing all details with Bangladesh through institutionalised channels. On September 24, Dhaka gave India names of three JMB men—Sohail Mahfuz alias Nasrullah; Zahid-ul-Islam and Salauddin—who were seeking shelter in Bangladesh.
While none of the three have been picked up, Indian agencies have identified Nasrullah as the leader of the JMB in Bengal on the basis of statements from one of the Burdwan accused, who identified him by his missing left hand.
It is learnt that Nasrullah had taught bomb making to Burdwan module after earlier losing his hand in an accidental explosion. Called “Haath Kaata” in Bangladesh, Nasrullah along with Sajjjid and Sadiq have been identified as the main terror trainers who held classes in madrasas in Burdwan, Murshidabad and Birbhum.

Hardening its stand further, the BJP on Sunday told the Shiv Sena to drop all its unwarranted conditions and unreasonable demands if it wished to participate in the BJP-led government that will take oath of office on October 30.

Vinod Tawde, member of the BJP’s core committee, told media persons that his party would join hands with Sena only if it doesn’t bring any conditions on the table.
“The Sena should join us by heart,” he said, in response to Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar’s statement that the state BJP leaders did not want his party to join the alliance government.
The BJP is all set to form a minority government instead of giving the Sena a big share of cabinet berths and important departments. But Tawde said the numbers were not an issue.
“We can discuss the matter further (if the Sena is serious and unconditional in its approach),” he said, adding that the people of Maharashtra wanted a government that could deliver efficiently.

According to Tawde, the BJP’s legislative party, including members of both houses and members of Parliament would elect their leader on Tuesday. State party president Devendra Fadnavis is the top contender for the post of CM who also enjoys backing from the party brass. His selection would be a mere formality, said sources.
Central observers, union home minister Rajnath Singh, party general secretary (state in-charge) JP Nadda, state poll in-charge OP Mathur and former state in-charge general secretary Rajeev Pratap Rudy will  attend the meeting, to be held from 11 am at the Vidhan Bhavan.
The Sena had earlier sought 14 berths, but later scaled down its demand to 10. However, the BJP is not willing to give Sena more than five berths, said sources.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Crude oil prices eased in early Asian trade on Monday on better than expected results from stress test exercises for European banks.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for delivery in December traded at $81.20 a barrel, down 0.13%.
Brent oil futures, the global benchmark, fell 0.8% to $86.13 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe on Friday.
Roughly one in five of the euro zone's top lenders failed landmark health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank said on Sunday.
Painting a brighter picture than had been expected, the ECB found the biggest problems in Italy, Cyprus and Greece but concluded that banks' capital holes had since chiefly been plugged, leaving only a modest 10 billion euros ($12.7 billion) to be raised.
Italy faces the biggest challenge with nine of its banks falling short and two still needing to raise funds.
The test, designed to mark a clean start before the ECB takes on supervision of the banks next month, said Banca Monte Dei Paschi Spa (OTC:BMDPY) had the largest capital hole to fill at 2.1 billion euros.
Last week, oil prices dropped on Friday after markets dismissed Thursday's news reports that Saudi Arabia trimmed output in September to support the market.
Oil prices shot up on Thursday on news reports that Saudi Arabia cut crude oil production by about 328,000 barrels in September to a total of 9.36 million barrels, though by Friday, clarifications that supplies were not cut though some barrels went into storage sent futures falling, especially on report overall output actually increased last month.
Meanwhile, reports that a doctor tested positive for the Ebola virus in New York City added to the selloff amid concerns that fears of a broader output could weigh on U.S. recovery and dampen demand for fuel and energy.
Soft U.S. housing data kept prices in negative territory as well.
The Census Bureau reported earlier that U.S. new home sales rose 0.2% in September to 467,000 units, missing expectations for an increase to 470,000 units.
The August figure was downwardly revised to a 15.3% climb to 466,000 units from a previously estimated 18.0% jump to 504,000 units.

(The new data centre in Mumbai…)
BANGALORE: IBM is setting up its first cloud data centre in India to gain a bigger share of the cloud computing market in the country. The company has built a 30,000 sq ft data centre facility in Airoli, on the outskirts of Mumbai. The new Mumbai IBM Cloud Center is part of a 15 cloud center expansion, and a $1.2 billion investment by IBM Cloud to grow its cloud presence around the world.
"With the new data centre, IBM will be able to tap into BFSI , telecom and government sectors, which haven't been able to move to cloud in a big way due to regulatory requirements," said Lingraju Sawkar, director, Integrated Technology Services, Global Technology Services at IBM India/South Asia. According to Gartner, public cloud services market in India is expected to grow from $423 million (Rs 2,550 crore) in 2013 to $1.3 billion (Rs 7,800 crore) in 2017. Gartner expects India to be the fastest growing market for cloud adoption globally.
IBM recently partnered with SAP to host SAP's HANA Enterprise Cloud on IBM cloud. The new data centre in Mumbai would allow SAP to offer its cloud-based platform to Indian customers who have been wary about their data residing in other countries. IBM is also providing resiliency services through the new facility to let enterprises continue with their business during a disaster.
Enterprises across the world have started demanding cloud providers to host their data locally to meet requirements for data sovereign. About 100 nations and territories have already adopted laws that dictate how governments and private enterprises handle personal data. This demand is especially high in banking & financial, telecom and government sectors and is pushing large cloud players to set up local data centres.
Microsoft, for whom India is the fastest growing cloud computing market, announced last month that it will set up cloud data centres in India by the end of 2015. CEO Satya Nadella called cloud computing services in India a $2-trillion market opportunity while announcing the plans in Delhi. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also talked about the possibility of local data centres in India during his visit last month.
Despite this, none of the large cloud computing companies, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, has so far built a local data centre. Unpredictable power supply, patchy Internet connectivity, limited bandwidth and unreliable optical fibre connectivity between different parts of the country have so far prevented these companies from setting up data centres in the country.
However, with cloud adoption rapidly increasing, companies are finding ways around this problem. "Getting redundant power supply is still a challenge in India and also one of the largest costs for a data centre," said Sawkar. "We are, therefore, using multiple sets of power equipment, multiple bandwidth providers and redundant security monitoring systems to ensure reliability."
The new IBM data centre in Mumbai will primarily focus on private cloud services for enterprises and small and medium businesses. However, the company is expected to announce another data centre in India, which will cater to IBM's public cloud service called SoftLayer .

( Retail investors, known…)
MUMBAI: Retail investors, known to aggressively buy in the stock market at the top of a bull market, repeated the behaviour again. In the quarter ending September 30, when the rally that started in mid-February had more or less petered out, retail investors bought more shares than they sold. Interestingly, this investor category bought 'momentum' shares — shares that move rapidly when the sentiment is good — at their highest prices, and sold many steady performers of recent years. According to data compiled by ET, retail investors increased their stake in 590 companies and trimmed holding in 375.
Titan, Axis Bank, Jaiprakash Associates, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Power, Havells India, Jain Irrigation, GMR Infrastructure, Bhushan Steel, JP Power and Jindal Steel were among the top buys of retail investors in the three months ending September 30. These shares corrected in the quarter after rallying sharply since the beginning of the year.
Jaiprakash Associates, for instance, added 77,493 retail investors during the quarter. The stock has plunged 65% after surging 42% from January 1 to June 30. Over 62,000 new retail investors bought Larsen & Toubro shares in the quarter, when the stock declined 15% after rallying 60% during the January-June period. Tata Power,which fell 23% in the July-September quarter after surging 22% since the beginning of the year, has seen an addition of 30,000 retail investors.
Brokers said many retail investors were sellers in April-June when the stock market rally was fuelled by election euphoria. They saw the upside as an opportunity to get out of those shares they had held for many years. But, with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) lapping up everything coming their way and small-caps, along with penny shares, rallying aggressively well into August, many investors felt they were missing out on opportunities, prompting them to buy. In the bargain, they ended up buying duds, too.
"It's a general tendency of the retail investor to buy cheaper stocks instead of stocks with cheaper valuations whenever the market gains momentum. However, this strategy has backfired on them many times in the past and they are buying large mid-cap stocks with lot of news flows," said G Chokkalingam, founder & CEO, Equinomics Research & Advisory. Sensex rose 4.79% in the July-September quarter, while the BSE Mid-cap and Smallcap indices gained 1.61% and 4.69%, respectively.
The BSE Mid- and Small- cap indices had a spectacular run the April-June quarter, surging 32% and 44%, respectively, against Sensex's gain of 14%. But the participation of retail investors in this phase is lower than on previous occasions. This is because retail investors who burned their fingers in the stock market crash of 2008-09 are still wary of putting money in the market.
"Despite the sharp rally in the benchmark indices, it is the more seasoned and mature retail investors who are taking part in the stock market and are buying falling large-cap or large mid-cap stocks," said Prashant Prabhakaran, president - retail broking, IIFL . Retail investors sold conventionally-strong shares because they lost patience after their underperformance for a couple of quarters, said brokers. About 10,000 to 20,000 retail investors exited large companies like Infosys, Bharti Airtel, ITC , Reliance Industries and Hindustan Unilever. Idea Cellular lost 27,000 retail investors.
"Investors who held these fundamentally strong companies for 4-5 years sold them to reinvest in buzzing sector stocks like infrastructure, power, etc," said Rahul Rege, business head —retail, Emkay Global Financial Services. "These buzzing stocks outperformed the fundamentally strong stocks in the past year," he said.

Delhi s realty estate sector stuck in no man...Urban areas in and around Delhi constitute 40% of unsold real estate in top eight cities

(The NCR has a total of 303.48…)
NEW DELHI: Guess who probably had a terrible Diwali? The capital's builders. Just look at one simple statistic. Urban areas in and around Delhi account for a stunning 40% of unsold real estate in India's top eight cities. So, why is it so gloomy in NCR? Why does Bangalore and even Mumbai look better?
THE PROBLEM
The NCR has a total of 303.48 million sq ft (about 303,000 apartments) of unsold real estate, according to property research firm Liases Foras. At the current pace of sales, this stock requires another 53 months to be completely sold off. In comparison, for the Mumbai region, the figure is about 48 months while it is the lowest for Bangalore at 19 months. For the top eight cities combined, the 765 m sq ft of unsold space will require at least 35 months to be sold.
The festive season this year has failed to bring cheer to builders despite many of them doling out offers which include ones where buyers have to pay 10% of the apartment cost upfront and the rest at the time of possession. Brokers say they are getting a lot of enquiries from buyers but not too many conversions.Riding on improved sentiments, home sales in the NCR are up about 10% over the previous quarter, but sales are still not happening at the pace that is usually associated with the festive period. In good years, builders were able to garner almost 30-40% of their sales for the entire year during this threemonth period.
BUILDING NOWHERE
But it's not just the size of the unsold 'inventory' that makes Delhi the worst off among the real estate markets of larger cities. 56% of the unsold real estate in NCR is in areas which are currently uninhabitable. In other words, while the apartments have come up, the other essential infrastructure — roads, sewage systems, or water connections — have not. In comparison, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 168 m sq ft (168,000 apartments) and Bangalore has 113 m sq ft (113,000 apartments) of unsold space of which just 2% of the inventory is in undeveloped areas in each city. While sales have slowed down in Mumbai as well, the real reason is more to do with high prices.
"NCR is a very inefficient market where a lot of projects were launched in undeveloped areas," says Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras. Take for instance the Dwarka-Manesar Expressway. Its location in Gurgaon is closest to Delhi and several projects were launched here a few years back but work on the expressway has not been completed yet though some builders are close to giving possession to buyers.
"As the level of sales dropped, the interest of developers in creating social infrastructure also reduced," says Samarjit Singh, managing director of IndiaHomes, a real estate brokerage firm. Over the last few years, a number of scams and project related issues that have cropped up across NCR have also scared buyers. While project delays are a big issue, cases against developers such as the one where the Competition Commission of India slapped a fine of Rs 630 crore on DLF for unfair trade practices in a few of its Gurgaon projects, or environmental concerns such as those around development near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, have added to the gloom.
SPECULATORS
And while the real estate market in every city has its share of speculators - investors who don't really want to live in the flats they buy and essentially see them as an investment they can flip quickly to other buyers — the NCR has far more than its fair share. In NCR, well over 50% of those who buy property think of it as a short-term investment, pushing builders to launch hundreds of projects over the last few years without so much as a thought to the main premise of real estate — location. "The problem in the NCR is peculiar," says Mudassir Zaidi, national director - residential at Knight Frank India.
"Prevalence of investors is compounding the problem as they are also selling their inventory, undercutting developers on price as they do not have the holding capacity." When the economy was riding high, these investor-buyers flipped properties at ease within six months of buying them, thus making a killing and raising prices. But the same market is now gasping for breath as actual buyers started to pull back in an uncertain market.
 
"There is a logjam in NCR because the trust deficit about the builder community here is the worst compared to other cities," says Singh, pointing out that the list of developers still maintaining their reputation is now very small in the NCR. Buyers, he says, now prefer buying apartments in completed projects or in ones that are at a very late stage of construction.
Kapoor of Liases Foras says in locations where social infrastructure is in place and the price too is compelling, home sales are still robust.

UK trade union GMB has asked Tata Steel to protect the interest of workers in case it sells its European assets and to refrain from any move that has impact on their pension, warning of industrial action if the company fails to address these concerns.
The steel giant earlier this month announced that it is in talks with the Klesch Group to sell its long products business in Europe which employs about 6,500 people, including those at its distribution facilities.
"Following a meeting of Tata Steel trade union representatives from across the UK at the TUC in London, steel unions? Community, Unite, GMB and Ucatt - are calling on Tata Steel management to enter into a period of meaningful consultation to examine all the options to secure the future of the whole business and the steel industry in the UK," GMB has said in a statement.
Union representatives from all Tata Steel sites were clear that they are not convinced that selling Long Products is the best way forward in the interests of the members they represent, it said.
It added that during the meeting, union representatives also raised concerns about the implications for their pensions, should a sale proceed.
"Unions have reaffirmed position to ballot their members for industrial action, should Tata Steel make any moves against the British Steel Pension Scheme," the statement said.
Tata Steel's memorandum of understanding with global industrial commodities business firm Klesch Group covered talks for selling several UK-based assets including Scunthorpe steelworks, mills in Teesside, Dalzell and Clydebridge in Scotland, an engineering workshop in Workington and a rail consultancy in York, and operations in France and Germany.
"There are 20 associated distribution sites which are part of the potential sale," the Union said.
About 6,500 people are employed at Long Products Europe and its distribution facilities. Tata Steel employs 30,500 people across Europe, including 17,500 in the UK.
GMB said the unions have engaged Syndex consultancy as expert advisers to provide in-depth economic and industrial research on the alternatives and to test the rationale for the sale, adding, "We want Tata Steel to co-operate fully with that process".
"We understand that this process could take weeks or months and that there will be continuing uncertainty for our members, which is why we were so disappointed that Tata Steel failed to consult the unions prior to making their announcement last week. However, we have a duty to examine all the options in the interests of UK steel making," it said.
Tata Steel has invested 1.2 billion pound in its UK operations since acquiring Corus in 2007.
Tata Steel stock price
On December 05, 2014, Tata Steel closed at Rs 460.85, down Rs 1.45, or 0.31 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 578.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 332.20.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 84.86 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 5.43. The latest book value of the company is Rs 629.60 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 0.73.

BJP set to inform SC it is seeking fresh Delhi pollsBJP set to inform SC it is seeking fresh Delhi polls
Mail Today –  Fri 24 Oct, 2014

The Centre is expected to inform the Supreme Court on October 28 that it is ready to hold elections in Delhi. Sources in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not in favour of forming the government with the current mandate.
Buoyed by the outcome of Assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra where Modi led from the front, the Delhi BJP leadership feels that the same feat can be repeated in Delhi.
The BJP leaders are set to meet Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung after Diwali to inform him about the decision. It will also have the bearing on Lieutenant-governor's rule in Delhi which will complete the stipulated one year in February. Unlike other states where governor's rule gets renewed after six months, the Lieutenant governor's rule in the Capital lasts a year.
A section of BJP leadership has been in favour of government formation in Delhi. But party sources said that even before the results of the Assembly polls were declared, the prime minister had told the party leaders that forming the government by engineering defections or desertions is not good and the party should seek proper mandate in Delhi.
Thereafter, Delhi BJP leaders have also been informed that they should begin preparations for the polls. Senior party leaders also believe that any statement on government formation will benefit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been demanding fresh elections in Delhi.
After the city's top BJP leader Dr Harsh Vardhan joined the Union Cabinet, the party did not find anyone to project as the potential chief minister. But the party's victory in Maharashtra and Haryana has firmed up the belief that the BJP can bank on Modi magic and it won't be difficult to win similarly in Delhi.
Earlier, in the first week of October, some Delhi BJP leaders had met Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders, including Bhaiyaji Joshi. A party leader said that RSS leaders clearly suggested that government formation in the present circumstances will not send a good message to people and the party should prepare for Assembly polls in Delhi.
"RSS leaders also referred to the party's position in Maharashtra and Haryana, where the BJP was expecting victory. They were of the view that the situation is in favour of the party in Delhi as well. Now, there is no doubt about this," a party insider said.
The BJP had emerged as the single largest party after the Delhi Assembly polls in December last year with 32 seats, including ally Akali Dal's one MLA, in the 70-member House.
In the prevailing situation, the BJP cannot form the government on its own in Delhi. The party's strength in Delhi Assembly has been reduced to 28 after three of its MLAs- Harsh Vardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma-were elected to the Lok Sabha.
On August 5, the apex court had given five weeks' time to the Centre to take a decision on dissolution of the Delhi Assembly "one way or another", questioning it for continuing to keep the House in suspended animation, with no party coming forward to form the government.

US stocks closed out their best week in nearly two years on Friday, helped by earnings from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble and as concerns eased over the possible spread of Ebola in the United States.
The S&P 500 .SPX was up 5.5 percent from its low on October 15 and had its best weekly gain in nearly two years, boosted by solid corporate earnings reports.
News of the first case of Ebola diagnosed in New York City hit futures late on Thursday, but the markets shook off those concerns on Friday. A doctor being treated for Ebola in a New York City hospital is in stable condition, the city's health commissioner said, while the World Health Organization set out plans for speeding up development and deployment of experimental Ebola vaccines.
"I am encouraged by the fact that the market seems to be having a cooler head about the most recent Ebola news," said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers. "It feels like a market that's trying to consolidate some very sharp moves."
Shares of Microsoft (MSFT.O) rose 2.5 percent to USD 46.13, after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue while keeping profit margins largely intact.
Fellow Dow component Procter & Gamble (PG.N) gained 2.3 percent to USD 85.16. The world's largest household products maker said it would split off its Duracell battery business into a separate company.
On the downside, Amazon (AMZN.O) plunged 8.3 percent to USD 287.06 and was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 .NDX after the online retailer's sales projections for the crucial holiday quarter disappointed Wall Street and third-quarter results missed forecasts.
According to Thomson Reuters data through Friday morning, of 205 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings, 69.8 percent have topped analysts' expectations, above the 63 percent rate since 1994. On the revenue side, 59.8 percent have beaten expectations, slightly below the 61 percent rate since 2002.
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 127.51 points, or 0.76 percent, to 16,805.41, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.76 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,964.58 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 30.92 points, or 0.69 percent, to 4,483.72.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,905 to 1,150, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,501 issues rose and 1,151 fell for a 1.30-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 38 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 48 new lows.
About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 8.1 billion October average, according to BATS Global Markets.

The Appointment
While the sentiment surrounding the Indian economy has revived considerably, the economic circumstances being faced by the former government in power-UPA – were very different says former Finance Minister P Chidambaram.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18’s Shereen Bhan, Chidambaram said all the headlines that the Modi government is making today is on the work that was earlier laid out by the UPA.
“The Modi government has the advantage of a successor government, but it doesn’t mean that they should run down the successes of its predecessors,” says Chidambaram .
In a free-wheeling interview, Chidambaram also highlights that the new gas price will be deemed an accomplishment only if it ushers in newer investors.
"The Finance Minister posed to himself the wrong question and therefore came up with an answer which appears right but not quite there. He said there is a choice between reasonable profit and windfall profit. We have chosen a price which will give them reasonable profit. Please remember, even at USD 4.2 they were making a profit. The question was wrong therefore the answer is wrong," he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview to CNBC-TV18.
Q: Let me start by asking you about what you make of the finance ministers comments? He says there was a loss of confidence, the world was losing interest in India, we were falling off the global radar as far as investments were concerned, and decision-making had slowed down. Wouldn’t you agree that there has been a dramatic improvement as far as sentiment is concerned, as far as business confidence is concerned? We can quibble or argue about the fundamentals and whether the parameters have changed dramatically or not but you can't argue about the fact that confidence has returned, that sentiment has improved.
A: If you want to answer your question that way I have no objection. The test is eventually if sentiment improves does it reflect in investment? Does it reflect in more investment proposals coming say to the RBI or the FIPB? Does it result in joint ventures; does it result in more bidders when gas or oil blocks are auctioned? Does it result in more bidders when power projects are put up for bidding? I don’t think we have reached a point where we can say all that has happened.
It appears that thanks to the efforts of government and other factors there is a greater interest in India today than what it was say a year ago. A year ago we were battling very difficult circumstances. When UPA left government we had brought in a considerable degree of stability, a considerable degree of assurance but may be the new government is built on that, I must concede that.
Q: You are being charitable. I don’t think this government would also be charitable and say that the measures that were taken under your tenure as the finance minister specifically in the last year between August 2013 and the time that you vacated office did help stabilize the economy. In fact you said when the GDP Q1 data was announced that it vindicates the UPA’s position and your position specifically that economic growth had been halted 2013-2014 and that an upturn will take place in the beginning of 2014-15. However, unfortunately it was too little too late. At the end of the day people don’t care about who started the process, they care about how is at the finish line and it is not you today.
A: That's right, that is the advantage of a successor government but that doesn’t mean you should run down the previous government.
Suppose we lay the Jammu-Katra line, the new Prime Minister inaugurates it obviously the headline will be Prime Minister inaugurates Jammu-Katra line. No one will ask when was the line laid, when was the project cleared, who allocated the money, those questions will not arise. However the fact remains that the UPA government laid the Jammu-Katra line. I would give you any number of examples, Mangalyaan, Chandrayaan, Aadhaar, DBT, obviously the successor government will reap the benefits and when we succeed the BJP government if they have started something we will reap that benefit.
Q: I want to pick up on a comment that you made in July of this year when the economic survey was released by the government. You said I would urge the government that has absolute majority in the Lok Sabha to show greater degree of urgency and spell out specific steps that it will take according to a definite timetable. Let us talk about some of the measures that have been undertaken, diesel decontrol – even this control acknowledges that it was a decision that was taken by the UPA, they are benefiting from the fact that globally crude oil prices have collapsed and this is perhaps the best opportunity for this government to decontrol diesel prices and they have gone ahead and done that.
A: No they have not. Nobody has said yet diesel equals petrol in terms of decontrol.
Q: The finance minister has said so. He said diesel prices will be market linked from hereon.
A: No. Thereafter he said there is some absorptive capacity we hope they will be able to absorb it and if it goes beyond that they may raise prices. But why hedge? Why not say simply hereafter diesel is decontrolled. It will be according to market prices the way petrol is. I have not seen that statement. If they make that statement or if they have implied that they should make it explicit. I urge them to make that statement.
Q: There is confusion and we have tried to elicit a comment from both the Oil Minister as well as the Finance Minister on whether there is any kind of cushion were crude oil prices to move back up, is there the possibility that the government will bring in some sort of cap? We don’t have absolute clarity on that but at this point in time what we do have is the government saying very clearly that diesel prices are going to be linked to the market like petrol.
A: I hope so.
Q: Let me talk to you about gas and what the Finance Minister has said as far as gas is concerned is that the formula that has bow been arrived at is a fair formulation which balances incentives to exploration companies with moderate impact that will have to borne by the consumers. Would you agree that the formula that has now been arrived at is perhaps as the Finance Minister is pointing out a fair formula because even under your regime you had concerns about the impact for power producing companies, for the fertilizer sector there was talk about subsidizing power and the fertilizer sector, different pricing of gas as far as those two sectors were concerned or the end consumer was concerned. Isn’t this a more legitimate, fair way of going about it?
A: No formula is full proof. In any formula you can always pick a hole and I am not going to do that with the NDAs formula. However, Finance Minister posed to himself the wrong question and therefore came up with an answer which appears right but not quite there. He said there is a choice between reasonable profit and windfall profit. We have chosen a price which will give them reasonable profit. Please remember, even at USD 4.2 they were making a profit. The question was wrong therefore the answer is wrong.
The correct question to pose to oneself is at this price will there be new investment or will there be no investment? The test is if the top 10 oil and gas exploration companies come to India, apart from British Petroleum (BP) which is in a joint venture with  Reliance Industries (RIL) there is no other company among the top 10 which is India exploring for gas or oil. So, the test is the price that you offer will it bring new investors, new explorers. I don’t know, if they come at USD 5.61 they said and some re-corrected it to USD 5.06 – I don’t know. If at this price new investment will take place I would commend the government. However, we will have to wait and see whether at this price new investors will come.
Q: Wouldn’t you agree that this is perhaps the right approach? On the gas price issue for instance and let me link this back to the acquisition of policy paralysis that plagued the UPA in its second tenure, you waited till the election code of conduct virtually came into existence before notifying the gas price decision. So, a lot of what you are now talking about, this test could have been undertaken a year or two years before if you had gone ahead with the decision. The Rangarajan Committees formula was pending for over 11 months.
A: I have already said that The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas was wrong in referring the question to the Election Commission. There was no need to refer the question at all. The Rangarajan Committee gave its report; it went through a review because objections were raised. After going through a review the Rangarajan Committee broadly reiterated its recommendation.

Market veteran Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services , expects the auto pack to lead the Nifty in the coming days on the back of staggering Dhanteras sales.
“If you have 100 percent growth in a one day sale it is just a sample of things to come,” Agrawal said, adding that the numbers show that consumer confidence is coming back at least in two-wheelers. He expects it to extend to four-wheelers too.
According to Agrawal, predicting markets in the shorter run could be tough, and he feels that if one wants to really invest, he/she should do it for a longer-term, at least for the next four-and-half to five years.
Below is the transcript of Raamdeo Agrawal’s interview with CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh, Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy.
Latha: As we stand on the threshold of a new year what is your best pick in the Nifty for the next one year. What might be the leader or the leaders for the Nifty?
A: All auto companies, because if you look at the Dhanteras sales they have been quite staggering I would say. If you have 100 percent growth in a one day sale it is just a sample of things to come. So, all the pent up demand and the consumer confidence is clearly visible in the demand for at least two wheelers and I am sure it is going to spread to cars and even with a little delayed kind of thing the four wheelers and trucks and other things will also pick up.
The good thing about this sector is that it is very consolidated and a lot of growth is there because penetration levels are very low. So, all of it in Nifty, whether it is Hero , Bajaj , TELCO, Mahindra ; Eicher  is not part of it. So, I would be very heavily relying on to auto as a sector.
Anuj: Since you have been tracking the market for so long last Samavat was one of the best that we have had in many years. Do you get a sense that this time we could actually better it or would this year be more about consolidation as far as the index level is concerned?
A: There is expectation since earnings growth is picking up and still the buoyant mood and Modi wave is still very strong and now Mr Jaitley has also come back from the hospital looks very thin, handsome and energetic. So far you had only Modi wave, now you will have Mr Jaitley wave also. So, a combination of these two could be big at least till the Budget and then we will see the Budget and what happens but I would be surprised if you don’t make about 15-20 percent but predicting markets in the shorter run is tough but if you want to really invest you should invest for the next four and half to five years at least till Mr Modi’s last year comes because at that time the economy will be in the pinkest of the health hopefully.
Sonia: For a retail investor this has been one of the best years. We have heard a lot of comments in this year, something that we haven’t heard for a long time in terms of positive sentiment. Do you think equities will outperform all other asset classes, be it gold, real estate, at least for the next three to five years?
A: It looks like because last five years has been very flat and if you look at gold it has been dead and out and in any case it was not a big asset class per se. The real competition is in the fixed income and real estate. I don’t know much about real estate but people are stuck with no liquidity and still there is no panic in the real estate market but there is no liquidity, no exit from the market. So, forget about old money but new money is not going to flow there in a big way.
So I would think that as the interest rate cycle goes down and the attraction for equities will become even better and hopefully Raghuram Rajan is going to come here to fight the inflation once and for all and he wants to see inflation dead and out. So, in a world which is full of deflation if we have a low inflation of 3-4 percent instead of 7-8 percent equity will be one way.

Be patient in this mkt; 20% returns in 5 yrs likely: MehtaThe Indian equity market is in a long-term bull market, but a deep correction is on its way, says Dipan Mehta, member, NSE, BSE.
Mehta says investors have continued to be loyal to realty and gold despite having underperformed.
“This is a long term bull market and we should get easily 15-20 percent kind of returns on a compounded basis over the next 4-5 years may or may be longer depending upon how the reforms unfold and what growth rates we are able to achieve, where the interest levels are. However, one has to build conviction and be patient in stocks. Those who are able to master these two aspects will turn out to be true winners in this bull market,” he adds.
Below is the transcript of Dipan Mehta's interview with CNBC-TV18's Sonia Shenoy, Latha Venkatesh and Anuj Singhal.
Latha: Give us a Diwali gift, what would you invest in, what is your best Nifty case or even if it is a non-Nifty set of stocks, what Diwali gifts would you give your investors, your clients?
Mehta: I will give you a list of stocks in various sectors. We are very bullish on the NBFC sector and over there I think microfinance company SKS Micro , housing finance companies like  LIC and  Repco and consumer finance like  Bajaj Finance they appeal to us and I think they have a good shot at being outperformers. Within Tech our favourite is Tata Elxsi . In pharma we prefer  Glenmark and in the FMCG sector  Jyoti Labs and  Emami could be outperformers as far as the peer group is concerned.
In the large cap I think the preference has to be for telecom stocks. We saw Idea Cellular 's numbers and looking forward to  Bharti Airtel as well, I think these two stocks could really outperform apart from of course the private sector banks. So, that is where I think we are kind of seeing our exposure sectorwise. We may be little bit underweight in the large cap tech stocks and a bit cautious on the large cap pharma companies considering a lot of investors are overweight over there and base effect may mean that the performance year on year may not be that appealing.
Sonia: For a lot of retail investors who are watching us right now what would your advice be to them at what stage are we in in the bull market and is this still a time to be buying in the market now?
Mehta: I cannot say at what stage of the bull market we are in. I think it is a long term bull market. As we go on ahead I think targets will be met and new targets will be set per se. My only advice would be that you have to stick into stocks, into equities. Anytime over the next 6-12 months or so there will be a deep correction and your conviction in stocks will be tested.
The only thought which comes to my mind is that gold and real estate have underperformed over the past 12 months or so but you do not see investors selling gold or getting out of real estate.
I think the same kind of expectation or strategy should be there for equities as well that when there are corrections not to get flushed out, not to get scared and sell off but to remain invested and may be increase exposure to equities. So, that is going to be the big test for investors and traders as well.
My sense is that this is a long term bull market and we should get easily 15-20 percent kind of returns on a compounded basis over the next 4-5 years may or may be longer depending upon how the reforms unfold and what growth rates we are able to achieve, where the interest levels are. However one has to build conviction and be patient in stocks. Those who are able to master these two aspects will turn out to be true winners in this bull market.

Survey: Majority of men want flexible workBy Brigid Schulte October 21 Follow @BrigidSchulte
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
For decades, flexible work arrangements have been seen as an accommodation to working mothers … and often, in high-octane work environments, as a sure way to sideline careers on the “Mommy track.” But a growing body of surveys, polls and research is showing that having a measure of control over when, where and how work gets done is something nearly everybody wants these days. Including men.
In a new survey of 1,000 men released Tuesday, Working Mother Media found that nearly 80 percent said they not only worked flexible schedules but that they felt comfortable doing so.
The survey, How Men Flex, found that more than half of the men said their employers supported flexible work. About one-fourth said their employers could but chose not to. Close to 60 percent of working fathers said they would prefer to work part-time, if that meant they could still do meaningful work and rise in their careers. But one-third said part-time work was looked down on at their workplaces, and would cost them.
Jennifer Owen, director of the Working Mother Research Institute, said the report comes on the second annual National Flex Day that they created to highlight flexibility in the workplace. Last year, they looked at working mothers. This year, she said, they wanted to look at the other side of the story.
“I was expecting, because of conventional wisdom, that we’d see a hesitancy, a big gap in men’s comfort level with flexibility and how they’re using it. And the survey showed that’s completely not true,” Owens said. “Men are very confident using flexibility. It’s almost a mirror image of what we found with women. They’re all looking for the same thing.”
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
The report is one more indicator of the sea change underway in gender roles, workplace cultures and caregiving responsibilities. In recent years, reports by the Pew Research Center and Families and Work Institute, among others, have found that working fathers are feeling more stressed than working mothers from the conflicting demands of work and family responsibilities. Surveys have shown that younger fathers particularly see being hands-on caregivers as being as important as succeeding in their careers.
And the Families and Work Institute has found, in nationally representative surveys of employers and employees, that more men than women tend to work flexible schedules, particularly those in more senior positions.
“Men are too often an afterthought in conversations about working parents and workplace flexibility,” Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer for the financial services company Ernst & Young, said in a statement. Ernst & Young sponsored the survey. “Everyone wants to have meaningful work and personal lives and flexibility is a great equalizer, helping men and women to achieve their professional and personal goals.”
With changing social norms and demands in mind, several companies are opening up flexible work arrangements to more employees, offering paid parental leave for mothers and fathers and other programs to ease work-life conflicts, with some high-tech and financial services companies taking the lead.
Deb DeHaas, who heads diversity and inclusion programs at Deloitte, said that work-life issues have become “center stage” issues for the company, as young workers put a premium on work-life balance, dual-income career couples struggle to juggle it all, and as Baby Boomers are delaying retirement but no longer want to work intensive hours. Flexibility and work-life integration are no longer seen as for mothers or parents only, she said, but as critical for recruitment, retention, morale, engagement, productivity and the long-term health of the company.
Leaders now openly talk about their vacations, she said, the hot yoga they do to stay healthy, the marathons they run. Pilots, called “Small Things, Big Differences,” are underway to give employees more predictability over their schedules and e-mail-free weekends.
“We’re trying not only to have the work-life policies, but to make sure our culture supports it,” she said. “That people know it’s every bit as important to allow that parent time to pick up a child from day care as it is for another person to play sports or get an advanced degree.”
The How Men Flex survey also found that most men preferred a mix of working from home and the office. Men who worked remotely five days a week reported more stress than men with no flexibility in their schedules at all. A majority of these telecommuting men reported feeling isolated, that they could never get away from work, and that their commitment to the job was constantly called into question.
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
That, social scientists say, may be because our workplace cultures have long expected men to work nonstop for 40 years, and for women to be primary caregivers.
Laurie Rudman, a psychologist at Rutgers University, has researched workplace cultures and found that men are often rewarded for occasionally flexing their schedule to coach children’s sports teams, but that their commitment is often questioned if they take on more regular caregiving duties. Using identical resumes of men, one with overt caregiving duties and one without, Rudman found that both men and women judged the man with caregiving duties more harshly.
In the How Men Flex survey, authors also found that more than half of fathers said they would reject a job with frequent overnight travel.
And, in an interesting twist, nearly 80 percent of the male managers in the survey said they supported flexible work arrangements for all employees, but about half said they wished they didn’t have to manage those flexible schedules.
The men surveyed by Working Mother Media were, on average, 39 years old and earned an average of $67,000. Only 65 percent were married or partnered with at least one child living in the household.
Other findings include:
88 percent said partners should equally share child care
83 percent said partners should share housework equally
74 percent agreed with the statement, “A parent should be home with children after school.”
65 percent said a working mother sets a positive example for children
Eight of 10 men say they would be comfortable with their spouse as the primary breadwinner
39 percent said they would prefer to be a stay-at-home parent

One company gives workers $7 500 for vacationBy Brigid Schulte October 23 Follow @BrigidSchulte

Earlier this year Jaclyn Pickard went to Costa Rica and snorkeled, visited cocoa farms and rafted 18 miles down the Pancuare River. Her colleague, Lauren Wiper, went to Italy with her sister for 10 days, hiking in the Cinque Terre, wine tasting in the Piedmont and visiting friends in Milan.
Karlis Lauva backpacked through southern France, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. David Fitzgerald bought a bike and rode around Colorado for two weeks following the USA Procycling Challenge.
Their boss, Bart Lorang, went to Bora Bora for his honeymoon.
And their company, FullContact, a high-tech firm in Denver, paid for it all.
It’s called the Paid Paid Vacation. All you have to do is promise not to check work e-mails, texts or calls, to totally unplug, and the company will pay you $7,500 every year to go on vacation, in addition to drawing your full salary.
“We are all really passionate about technology, but at the end of the day, I don’t think anyone’s dream is to just have a job,” said communications director Brad McCarty. “You’re not going to remember the 20 extra hours you put in every week when you’re 90. But you will remember the trip to Venice.”
You can go for as long as you’d like. The company, which organizes peoples’ contacts and stores them on the cloud, has an open vacation policy. “The standard rule is, don’t screw over your team,” McCarty said.

(The standard for most American workers: as the only advanced economy with no national paid vacation policy, one-fourth of all U.S. workers have no paid vacation. Those that do tend to get 10 to 14 days, say they feel too guilty or busy to take them all, and, when they do take off, often take work along or check work e-mails and texts regularly, prompting the travel industry to dub the United States the “No Vacation Nation. “)
Perks like the Paid Paid Vacation landed the company at No. 61 on Outside Magazine’s recently released 2014 100 Best Places to Work list . Outdoor clothing company Patagonia, with its famous “Let My People Go Surfing” motto, came in at No. 94. And at No. 1, Seeley Lake Elementary in Montana, which stores bikes, Nordic skis and showshoes for both students and staff and closes early on Thursdays, the better for everyone to get a start on an outdoor weekend.
As worker well-being, work-life balance, mindfulness classes and even happiness ratings are gaining traction in corporate America, FullContact’s Paid Paid Vacation originated about two years ago, McCarty said, when Lorang traveled to Egypt with his then-financee and someone snapped a photo of him, on a camel, at the pyramids, with his head down staring at his smartphone, checking his e-mail.
It was one of those light bulb moments, McCarty said. “Bart said, ‘this is just ludicrous. If I don’t pull myself away and force myself to have a life, then what am I working for?’”
Now, McCarty said, just about every one of the 41 employees at the four-year-old firm has taken a Paid Paid Vacation. FullContact, which now tracks about 1.3 billion contacts, or 20 percent of the world’s population, views the Paid Paid Vacation as a way to attract and retain top talent in the highly competitive tech world.
Jaclyn Pickard in Costa Rica. (FullContact)
“The cost is actually pretty minimal. It’s not at all uncommon to see $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 bonuses paid for people to come to work at tech companies,” McCarty said. “For us, whatever your salary is, add $7,500 to it every year. That’s a great retention tool for us.”
As are the powder days – meaning, when the snow has dumped and you’re itching to ski, go for it and take a paid day off. Or in McCarty’s case, since he works remotely out of Nashville, when spring fever hits, the hiking begins.
“It’s worked incredibly well,” he said. “The really big names in tech all focus on the same idea, that employee happiness has to come before everything else. While it’s really difficult to measure that return on investment from a dollar standpoint, it’s not difficult to measure what happens when someone returns from a Paid Paid Vacation: you see, without fail, people shining brighter, working harder and more excited to get back into the swing of things.”
And if someone doesn’t unplug on the Paid Paid Vacation?
“If you are on the grid and working and get caught, you have to pay it back. That’s the agreement,” McCarty said. “But so far, no one’s had to.”
McCarty said he hadn’t taken vacation for five years himself before coming to FullContact. Since then, he’s taken a Paid Paid Vacation and gone with his wife and two kids to Disney World for two weeks and spent a long weekend in the Smoky Mountains with his wife, he said.

“The bus which had also picked up some other passengers on the way must have lost control following which it hit the railings of a bridge and fell into a small river. While eight persons had died on the spot, one person died on being shifted to a hospital,” SP Kalita said. The accident occurred at village Uluwoni under Kaliabor police station at around 1:30 AM, after having traveled about two kilometers after crossing the Kaliabhomora bridge on the Brahmaputra.
Eight of the dead have been identified as Pranita Dutta, Jogen Barua, Padumi Barua, Nila Bora, Dhanada Saikia, Kusha Gogoi (driver), Ananda Bora and his wife Nilima Bora. While 26 others who were rescued by local villagers and sent to local hospitals at Kaliabor and Nagaon, 10 of them were later shifted to Guwahati Medical College Hospital here.
Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is currently in New Delhi, has ordered an inquiry to be conducted by the secretary of the state transport department. The state government also announced ex-gratia to the next of kin of those killed and announced free treatment to those who sustained injuries.
 

How to deal with the 7 worst types of bossesHow To Deal With The 7 Worst Types Of Bosses
By Emmie Martin | Business Insider –  Fri 17 Oct, 2014 2:45 AM IST
> class="p1">
The Internet Movie Database Donald Sutherland, Colin Farrell, and Jason Sudeikis in "Horrible Bosses."
National Boss Day, on Oct. 16, offers a chance for you to thank your boss for all their hard work.
However, there's a chance your boss is a terrible leader — not exactly the type of person you want to celebrate. 
While you can't change how your boss acts, you can control your own reactions. "When your boss is incompetent, you step up," says Nicole Williams , LinkedIn's career expert. "You're not going to play the victim or the martyr, you're going to see this as an opportunity to take a leadership role, and compensate for whatever your boss is doing."
Dealing with a difficult boss comes down to figuring out where they're failing and making up for it through your own work. "It's not going to help you to play the martyr and complain about your boss," Williams says. Instead, figure out ways you can work your behavior into that boss's style so you'll both succeed. 
Williams walked us through the worst types of bosses and how to deal with their shortcomings. Here are the top seven:
1. The ice block
Some bosses like to keep a divide between their personal and professional lives, making it difficult to form a genuine connection. "This boss seems to be very cold, aloof, and hard to get to know," Williams says.
In this case, you need to be the one who takes the first step. Find out where they went to school, who they know, or where they've worked before — any common ground you can connect over. "Chances are, he or she won't try and initiate conversation, but if you ask great questions, especially smart ones, they're more likely to answer," Williams says.
2. The serial innovator
This boss is always jumping from idea to idea, making it difficult to fully focus on one project. "They always have a new idea and expect the same from the rest of the team," Williams explains. "Even while you're in the midst of working on a project, he's already on to the next." 
The best way to deal with a boss who is all over the place is to stay on top of new ideas as well. Constantly check LinkedIn, know what similar companies are doing, and keep your ear to the ground for any new innovations in your industry. "If your boss walks in and asks if you saw that article in The Wall Street Journal, you have to know it," Williams says.
3. The boss who plays favorites 
The people this boss likes seem to get all the benefits, from attending an out of town conference to earning a coveted promotion. If you're not one of the lucky few, shift your focus elsewhere. "Get the attention of other people within your organization, and he or she will see that someone else — someone they respect — like and appreciate you, and that's going to give them pause and give you a second round of consideration," Williams advises.
However, favoritism can be tough from both sides. If you're the boss's pet, your colleagues likely think that you receive opportunities solely because of your relationship, and not your talents, Williams warns. In this case, do your best to stand out separate from your boss and prove yourself as an individual.

Micromanagers have trouble relinquishing control, and constantly bombard you with emails and reminders, no matter how many times you promised to follow-up on a project. "It's such a competitive workplace, and people are afraid to delegate opportunity because they're afraid it's going to go wrong," Williams says. 
The best way to deal with a controlling boss is to over-communicate until you earn their trust. Williams recommends asking questions to prove that you're competent. "This person wants to answer a lot of questions, so do that," she says.
5. The "talker, not a walker"
This type of boss is all talk, no action."The problem is that their ideas are essentially great, but nothing in terms of the development of your experience and talents will happen unless they're executed," Williams says. 
If you're dealing with this boss, you need to be the one who steps up and takes charge. "Be the one who gets the ball rolling, who takes the first step to build the momentum," Williams suggests. Your boss and teammates will appreciate the effort.
6. The thunder thief
This type of boss not only steals everyone's ideas and takes credit, but also tends to put down other people in the process. "It's hard to sneak around and get credit because a lot of time they're having conversations that you're not privy to," Williams says. "You have no way of defending yourself."
If your boss is petty enough to take your ideas and go over your head with them, it's best to keep your distance. Rather, focus on ways you can make yourself known independently. Williams recommends posting pictures and updates on a site like LinkedIn, so others can see your involvement in a project. 
7. The indecisive boss
Similar to the "talker, not a walker," this boss gets nothing done because they're afraid of making decisions. "This is the person who isn't usually experienced at managing, and doesn't know how to delegate," Williams says. 
An indecisive boss leaves you a chance to take on a surrogate leadership role by stepping up and pushing them to make a decision. "Give them options where they feel some source of empowerment and control, but essentially you're presenting the options to them and limiting the scope," Williams suggests. By asking them to choose between two things, they feel like they're making the decisions, but you've already done the work to narrow things down. 

Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister meets Governor on power sharing with TelanganaPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 26, 2014 4:55 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 5:02 pm
Amid a raging row between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on sharing of electricity, the AP government on Sunday petitioned common Governor ESL Narasimhan on the issue.
“…The water level is going down to 856 ft (at Srisailam project). The ayacuts of SRBC in Rayalaseema needs to be protected. We tell Telangana as well, let’s protect and save water. Up to 70,000 cusecs of water is going into the sea through the Prakasam barrage. We should not be hardening out stance,” AP Irrigation Minister D Umamaheswara Rao told reporters.
“Farmers need to be protected both in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Our goal is to see that water is not lost,” he said.
Rao said he has explained “all the facts” to the Governor who will go through the relevant material concerning the issue.
“Our leader (AP Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu), as TDP president, tells us and also the Krishna river board chairman that farmers should be protected. I have told Governor about the facts, because water needs to be saved carefully,” he said.
There is a scarcity of 73 TMCs of water to existing levels in Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar (reservoirs) and that huge quantity of water is going into the sea, he said.
Observing that water needs to be saved, the minister said power can be purchased from other states, but even a single TMC of water cannot be obtained.
The current dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is about power generation at Srisailam (project).
Andhra Pradesh wants Telangana to stop power generation at the Srisailam project as continued power generation would lead to water scarcity in AP in the future.
However, Telangana has refused to stop power generation in view of the prevailing acute power shortage, especially to agriculture.
The two state governments are involved in a bitter war of words over the issue.
In a no-holds-barred attack, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had alleged that Naidu was denying the rightful share of electricity to Telangana.
Alleging that Naidu was not honouring the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, Rao had said on Friday that Telangana would move the Supreme Court and also sought the Centre’s intervention.
Rao had alleged that the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister sought to defame the TRS government and “he is a cheater”.
Taking exception to Rao’s criticism, AP’s communications advisor Parakala Prabhakar said on Saturday that the former’s remarks against Naidu were “unbecoming” of his stature.
“He has crossed all limits. Being a chief minister, it is highly unbecoming of KCR to use such intemperate language. Moreover, what else he spoke is blatantly false,” he said.
Prabhakar alleged that the Telangana chief minister seemed to have not understood the substance of government orders (GOs) 69 and 107 that regulate the use of water at Srisailam reservoir.

Well-literate MLAs with modest financial backgrounds inducted in Manohar Lal Khattar s CabinetAmong all the ministers sworn-in, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar is the poorest with merely Rs. 8.6 lakh worth assets. (Source: Jaipal Singh)
Written by Varinder Bhatia | Chandigarh | Posted: October 26, 2014 5:27 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 8:32 am
Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s Cabinet comprises of well-literate Ministers. While four out of the nine ministers are post graduates, three are law graduates and two graduates.
The four ministers sworn-in on Sunday who hold post graduation degrees include  Kavita Jain (MLA from Sonipat), who holds a post graduation degree in  Commerce (M.Com) with a Bachelors degree in Education (B.Ed); Krishan Kumar  (MLA from Shahbad) holds a post graduation degree in Sciences (M.Sc); Karan Dev Kamboj (MLA from Indri) holds a degree of post graduation in arts (M.A) and a law degree; and Om Prakash Dhankar (MLA from Badli) holds a post-graduation degree in Arts and Education (M.A and M.Ed).
Capt. Abhimanyu (MLA from Narnaund) is pursuing a business management course from Harvard University and holds a law degree, and Ram Bilas Sharma (MLA from Mahendergarh) also holds a law degree. Ambala Canontment’s MLA Anil Vij is a graduate in sciences (B.Sc), while Bikram Singh Thekedar (MLA from Kosli) is a graduate in arts (B.A.).
Capt. Abhimanyu is the richest among all the ministers with declared assets of more than Rs. 74.8 crores. Interestingly, he owns eight vehicles in his  name and three in his spouse’s name. Among all the ministers sworn-in, Khattar is the poorest with merely Rs. 8.6 lakh worth assets.
The other Ministers including Kavita Jain has declared her assets at Rs. 2.5 crores, Anil Vij Rs. 86 lacs, Rambilas Sharma Rs. 3.15 crores, Bikram Singh Rs. 1.34 crores, Om Prakash Dhankar Rs. 58 lacs, Narbir Singh Rs. 42.8 crores, Krishan Kumar Rs. 22.62 lac and Karan Dev Kamboj Rs. 4.3 crores.
Infact, before Khattar’s name was cleared as Chief Minister in the BJP’s  legislature party meet, four out of the six Cabinet Ministers were being considered as front-runners for the CM’s post. These include Capt Abhimanyu, Rambilas Sharma, Anil Vij and Om Prakash Dhankar. However, the party chose Khattar, an RSS pracharak and Modi’s close confidant, as its Chief Ministerial candidate and the rest were accommodated by giving them cabinet berths.

Nifty May Extend Outperformance Amid Weak CrudeIVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Indian stock markets are likely to extend their winning streak after a holiday-truncated week saw the Nifty gain 3 per cent amid poor volumes and participation.
Weak crude prices and reform measures such as diesel decontrol, gas price hike and opening up of the coal sector to private companies should see Indian equity outperformance continue globally.
One can now say with conviction that Indian markets are "de-coupled" from their global counterparts as far as a secular rally is concerned. The domestic economy is rebounding. Commodity prices are near four-year lows, inflation has hit three-year lows, bond yields are falling, interest rates have peaked and reform measures are coming. All these developments augur well for the economy and stock markets.
The GDP is likely to rise to 6.5 per cent in a years' time. A real GDP between 6-8 per cent with inflation pegged at 6-7 per cent would imply a doubling of the nominal GDP within a five-year time frame. That would mean higher equity market capitalisation too.
Industrial activity is likely to pick up and will not be a drag on GDP like in the past few years. Significant reduction in fiscal and current account deficits are likely to act as tailwinds for the markets. Foreign exchange reserves are slated to improve given the strong FII and FDI flows.
This week, global markets recovered sharply with the Dow Jones making its sharpest weekly rally since January 2013 and gaining 4.1 per cent. Oil continued to weaken as supply/demand mismatch reached its highest levels in recent times. Gold prices also softened this week after seeing their best rally in the last 2 months.
Global markets may continue to be a concern for domestic investors. Europe and China slowdown, geopolitical issues and a hike in interest rates in US could result in some volatility, but they are unlikely to stall the India story.
Recap of last week's performance:
The Nifty gained 3 per cent this week, while the Bank Nifty ended up 3.4 per cent. The star outperformer was the auto sub-index on the NSE, which saw gains of 5.7 per cent amid strong festive sales.
Weaker-than-expected results from IT heavyweights saw tech stocks lagging the market rally. The CNX IT index ended the week up marginally by 0.33 per cent. The rupee was also range bound and fluctuated between 60.75 & 61.3, while the 10 year bond yields also were traded between 8.35-8.45 per cent.

Digboi refinery executive director goes missing in AssamPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 26, 2014 9:13 pm
Kaushik Bora, an executive director of Assam Oil Division (AOD) of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd has gone missing on Sunday from near the Digboi Refinery in upper Assam, about 530 kms from. His personal car was found abandoned about 10 kms from Digboi.
Bora, currently Number 2 in the 114-year old Digboi Refinery, had gone out from his official residence in the refinery township at around 10:30 AM and was later reported missing by his family at around 4 PM, Tinsukia district SP Akhilesh Kumar Singh said over the telephone.
“The officer’s personal car was found abandoned near Pengeri on the Digboi-Pengeri-Bordumsa Road, about 10 kms from Digboi. While his mobile phone has remained switched off, no group of organization has claimed responsibility for any abduction,” SP Singh said.
Bora (57), who is provided with an official vehicle and a driver by the public sector oil company, had no business whatsoever to go towards Pengeri and that too on a Sunday, the SP said. The Digboi-Pengeri-Bordumsa Road however is infested by both dacoits as well as ULFA militants.

ECB faces test as Europe braces for landmark banking reviewECB faces test as Europe braces for landmark banking review
Reuters
Tweet
FRANKFURT, Oct 26:  
After putting the euro zone's top 130 banks through their paces, the European Central Bank will face a test of its own on Sunday - will its landmark health check succeed in convincing investors the region's lenders are safe?
The ECB will announce the names of 25 banks that held too little capital at the end of last year, along with details of around 10 banks that have not yet made up the shortfall. The announcement is due at 1100 GMT.
As well as the number of failures, Reuters has already reported details of several banks' performance, including that Germany's Deutsche Bank and Greece's Alpha Bank passed the tests while Ireland's Permanent TSB failed.
Other media outlets have also reported how some banks and countries' banking systems have fared.
With much of the news revealed in advance, the major remaining question is whether the exercise will be judged credible enough to banish lingering fears about euro zone banks, freeing them up to lend again and tempt U.S. investors back to European banking shares.
The ECB has staked its reputation on delivering an independent assessment of the euro zone banks before it takes over as their supervisor on Nov. 4.
The European Banking Authority (EBA), which will include the ECB results in an announcement of EU-wide stress test results at the same time on Sunday, is hoping its exercise will prove more convincing than previous rounds in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The euro dipped on Friday amid uncertainty about the results, while euro area banking stocks were volatile as rumours swirled about who had passed and who had not. Initial comments from investors on Sunday and trading in banks on Monday will be the first real indication of how the tests are judged.
"At least we will get a true picture of what the banks have genuinely in their books," said Alan Lemangnen, Europe economist at Natixis in Paris. "We see that the solvency of the European banking sector will improve and has already improved."
ASSET VALUATIONS KEY
Sources familiar with the tests say the ECB's findings on whether banks have overvalued their assets, and what kind of corrective action it demands, will be at least as significant as who passes or fails.
A forensic review of how banks value their assets marks these health checks out from three previous EBA tests. While just 20 percent of banks have failed the ECB tests, most lenders are expected to be found to have overvalued their assets.
If the ECB judges banks' assets to be worth far less than the banks do, it will not force a bank to immediately take additional loan losses.
However, banks will have to hold more capital to reflect the ECB's assessment of their likely future losses as asset values fall to what the ECB believes they are now. This will leave banks with less flexibility to expand, lend or pay dividends.
Any outcome that depresses lending would be at odds with the ECB's objective of getting banks to pump more credit into the euro zone economy to revive much-needed growth.
"Banks shied away from taking on new risks in order to look as safe as possible," Berenberg analysts said. "Their uncertainty slowed the credit cycle over the last year, and prevented job-creating business investments from going ahead. This uncertainty should fade now."
France's central bank governor, Christian Noyer, said on Friday the exercise was "more rigorous than what was done in other big countries" and would restore credibility in the sector.
The results will be closely watched for any sign of political favouritism. Sources told Reuters on Friday that the checks found that banks in Greece, Cyprus, Slovenia and Portugal had fallen short of the capital benchmarks at the end of last year, while lenders in Spain and France had fared, by and large, better than expected.
In Germany, the president of the association of German private-sector banks, Juergen Fitschen, said on Thursday the results would probably give German lenders a clean bill of health, something that may raise eyebrows given widespread concerns about some areas of German banking like shipping lending.
Fitschen is also co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank . Sources told Reuters on Friday that the lender passed the stress test by a wide margin, showing balance sheet strength well above the minimum requirements.
NEXT STEPS
The ECB review is running in parallel with an EU-wide stress test, and the results for both will be announced simultaneously. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio and chief supervisor Daniele Nouy will brief the media at 1130 GMT on Sunday.
The ECB's passmark is for banks to have high-quality capital of at least 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets in the most likely economic scenario for the next three years, and capital of at least 5.5 percent in an adverse scenario.
The assessment is based on banks' positions at the end of 2013. Since the end of last year, however, banks have already strengthened their balance sheets by issuing new shares, retaining earnings or selling assets. This may mean that even if banks fail, they may have already dealt with their problems.
Since mid-2013, efforts by banks to boost their balance sheets have amounted to 203 billion euros, the ECB said.
Banks with a capital shortfall will have to present the ECB within two weeks with a plan that details how they intend to close the gaps. They will then be given six to nine months to do so, depending on where in the review the shortfalls occurred.
"We expect the capital solutions to be found within the private sector and see extremely limited requests for public funds," Lemangnen of Natixis said.

Think big  think far: PM Modi tells allies over high teaPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held a gathering for the 400-odd MPs of the National Democratic Alliance, the first such event since taking power at the Centre.

His message to the allies was clear: “think big, far and above politics” and be a “force with tremendous positive energy” while helping the government achieve its goals.
The Diwali Milan, at the PM’s residence, was seen as an exercise to dispel any impression of a gap between the government and the alliance. And Modi sought to take the MPs on board as he discussed his government’s recent initiatives.
All Shiv Sena MPs, including Union heavy industries minister Anant Geete, were present but there were no political discussions, as suspense continued over whether the party will be part of a BJP-led government in Maharashtra. “It was a purely official function,” Geete said.
Modi urged the NDA MPs to visit schools in their areas over a five-day period starting November 14 — the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru — and explain to children the importance of hygiene. “Achieving Swachh Bharat (clean India) is tough but just as the people of this country got together to eradicate polio, Swachh Bharat can also be achieved,” he said.
Making a detailed presentation on the economy, finance minister Arun Jaitley explained the reasons behind the government’s gas pricing and diesel deregulation moves.
He argued that the decision to let the market determine petroleum product prices had helped bring down diesel rates. And he pointed out that while the Centre was committed to pushing growth, it was mindful of the people and had taken the end user price into consideration while determining gas pricing.
The minister also said the government had managed to curb inflation to some extent, and briefed MPs on the Pradhanmantri Jan Dhan Yojana, calling the ‘banking for all’ mission a big success.
Similarly, labour minister Narendra Singh Tomar made a presentation on recent reforms undertaken by the government while rural development minister Nitin Gadkari briefed MPs about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, under which parliamentarians would adopt and develop model villages .
Modi urged his guests to convey to the masses that these initiatives were not aimed at curbing the interests of workers but, rather, were an exercise to ensure their rights were protected.
To an enquiry from the audience on the progress in the black money case, Jaitley said investigations in some cases were nearing conclusion and the government would soon file a charge sheet in court and also bring the names of foreign account holders in the public domain.
The event also saw the PM felicitate BJP president Amit Shah for the party’s victory in the Haryana and Maharashtra elections.

From Vijay to Ganeshan  south bug bites Delhi zooComments
Eight-month-old Saravanan leaps, plays and runs around his new home at the Delhi zoo, displaying agility and enthusiasm similar to the popular Tamil actor the white tiger cub is named after.
His father and the zoo’s most famous resident Vijay, who made headlines last month after killing a man who jumped into his enclosure, also shares his name with a Tamil superstar.
This new trend of giving animals south Indian names at the Capital’s National Zoological Park – usually a north Indian hub – is because of the zoo’s veterinary head Dr Panneer Selvam, who hails from Tamil Nadu.
Dr Selvam takes care of animals born in the zoo or brought to the institution before releasing them to their respective enclosures and is responsible for naming them.
At present, more than 10 zoo animals have names with south Indian meanings. Some of them include Rajalakshmi (Indian elephant), Ganeshan (African elephant), Maheshwari and Anjuha (rhinos) and Sendil (wild bear).
Uma, a rhino he had named after goddess Parvati, is Selvam’s favourite.
“I treat these animals as my own children and therefore the names I give them are derived from the social background that I have. There is a story and a meaning behind every name given,” added Selvam.
Though naming animals in any zoological park in the world is a practice necessary for identifying the animal and keeping a record of its ancestry, it generally becomes a ritual that officials undertake with a lot of love and care.
“When a new animal comes into the zoo from outside we generally keep it at the hospital for 10 to 45 days depending on the need. If the offspring is born here, we keep them in for at least six months. It is natural to develop a certain bond with the animal in this period,” said Selvam.

Euro comes safely through ECB stress testDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.
8
Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.
0
Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

Asian Shares Up as Upbeat Earnings, Data, Sharpen Risk Appetite
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 08:13 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Tokyo: Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased recent global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite.
The euro ticked higher but financial markets largely showed a muted reaction to Sunday's health check results of euro zone banks, which painted a slightly brighter picture than expected.
Of the euro zone's 130 top lenders, 25 failed the health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank said on Sunday.
Still, the test results were a sombre reminder that much work still remained, with the euro zone bank sector's long-term attractiveness damaged by revelations of extra non-performing loans and hidden losses that will dent future profits.
"Banks face a significant challenge as the sector remains chronically unprofitable and must address their 879 billion euro exposure to non-performing loans as this will tie-up significant amounts of capital," accountancy firm KPMG noted.
The euro was up 0.1 per cent at $1.2699, edging away from a two-week low of $1.2614 hit last week in wake of concerns about the bank tests.
Asian equities advanced, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 0.1 per cent and Tokyo's Nikkei gaining 0.5 per cent.
"Stable housing starts in the US and solid Q3 GDP in the UK are likely to give the market some comfort after the recent concerns about global growth," strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.
Data on Friday showed new US home sales rose to a six-year high, while Britain's economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, still on track to outpace other advanced economies.
US stocks, recovering from a battering earlier in the month on worries about global growth losing momentum, gained on Friday on upbeat earnings from blue chips Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Easing worries over the possible spread of Ebola in the United States also helped.
The dollar traded at 108.08 yen after touching a three-week peak of 108.38, with a rise in US Treasury yields and improving risk appetite shoring up the greenback.
The Brazilian real's non-deliverable forwards showed muted response so far after leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff's interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, but some traders think her re-election is already priced in as the real has fallen nearly 10 per cent since early September.
In commodities, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $85.81 a barrel, continuing a months-long rout as signs of rising global supply threatened deeper losses.
Iraq increased its oil supply in October and Libya's output remains high, despite instability in both countries.
Gold edged lower as robust equity markets and strong US economic data dented demand for the precious metal.
Spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $1,230.97 an ounce.

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

Five common ways you can lose money
Oct 27, 2014, 08.00AM IST

(If you are suffering monetary…)
By Bindisha Sarang
If you are suffering monetary losses due to laziness and ignorance, have an ECS arrangement in place or set up phone reminders to ensure that you don't.
1. Missing the insurance premium date
How you lose: Irrespective of the reason for missing the payment date for your insurance premium, you stand to lose a lot of money. Insurers usually give a 15-30 day grace period, but if you miss even this, your policy can lapse. Depending on the time lapsed, you have to pay the premium, along with the revival charges, to retain the policy after the grace period is over.
What's your loss? The revival charge varies among different insurers. Typically, it is a flat fee of around Rs 500 or an interest on the outstanding premium, which is usually around 0.75% per month. The revival charges also depend on the type of policy.
2. Forgetting your credit card payment
How you lose: Among financial products, there's nothing as easy to use and as complicated to understand as a credit card. If you miss a credit card payment, you stand to suffer losses in three ways. You will be slapped with a late payment fee; you will have to pay interest on the outstanding sum, and you will have to pay more for any purchases that you make in the next billing cycle.
What's your loss? Usually, the late payment fee ranges between Rs 300 and Rs 700, depending on the payment due. The interest charged is 2-3% on the outstanding bill. You will have to pay an extra 2-3% for the purchases made in the next billing cycle. Your credit score will also suffer.
3. Ignorance about depositing advance tax
How you lose: Advance tax is required to be paid in three instalments. At least 30% of the tax by 15 September, 60% of the tax by 15 December, and the remaining by 15 March. If you fail to pay advance tax, you will have to pay interest on the defaulted amount.
What's your loss? Penalty is 1% simple interest per month on the defaulted sum for three months. The penalty is the same (1%) if you missed the 15 December deadline. If you miss the final date of payment, you will have to pay 1% simple interest on the defaulted amount for every month until the tax is fully paid.
4. Delay in paying utility bills
How you lose: A family of four easily pays 6-8 utility bills a month, which includes mobile bills, electricity bills, Internet charges, among others. If you manage to miss these, you have to shell out the late payment fee. What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
5. Forgetting the loan EMI payment
How you lose: This is again a double-edged sword. If you miss home or car loan instalment , not only are you slapped with a penalty, but your credit score also suffers.
What's your loss? A late payment fee for a missed EMI on a personal loan with HDFC Bank is 24% per annum on the outstanding sum from the date of default. A late payment charge for a missed EMI on a home loan with ICICI Bank is in the range of Rs 500-5,000.

Despite Swachh Bharat  taking Poo to loo isnt easyDespite Swachh Bharat, taking ‘Poo to the Loo’ isn’t easy
Zia Haq , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:57 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:02 IST(27/10/2014)
Comments
Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, last year launched a public service advert in India through a character called Poo, with the tagline — ‘It’s time to take Poo to the Loo’. The target was open defecation, a serious problem.
 
Taking Poo to the toilet, it turns out, is a formidable task before the Modi government.
 
About 40% of rural households in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana that have a functioning toilet still have a “revealed preference” for open defecation, a new study has found.
Unicef estimates close to 600 million Indians practise open defecation, piling up more than 143 million pounds of solid human waste and putting the public at risk for “life-threatening infections, diseases and epidemics”.
Just giving people a toilet, as announced by Prime Minister Modi, isn’t going to work unless appropriate strategies are drawn up, researchers associated with the study point out.
Nearly 47% of those surveyed said defecating in the open was “pleasurable, comfortable, or convenient”. Some considered open defecation as a way to a “wholesome, healthy virtuous life”.
 
Experts say strategies have to go beyond mere campaigning and include surveys to track changes in open defecation. “The government cannot credibly claim to be attempting to end open defecation by 2019 or any year if it is not measuring and monitoring it,” Princeton economist Diane Coffey, lead researcher of the study, told HT.
India has increased access to toilets since 1990, when 75% of the population defecated in the open, mainly through government-built toilets.
 
That doesn’t mean people are using them. According to Unicef’s 2014 Drinking Water and Sanitation Update, “India continues to be the country with the highest number of people (597 million) practising open defecation”.

Burdwan blast: With NSA Doval in Bengal  spotlight back on Mamata BanerjeeNSA Doval visits Burdwan, pressure on Mamata
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:58 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 15:26 IST(27/10/2014)
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and top intelligence chiefs of the country on Monday visited the blast site in West Bengal's Burdwan and assessed the progress of investigations.
 
NIA director general Sharad Kumar, NSG director general Jayanta Narayan Chowdhury and Intelligence Bureau director Syed Asif Ibrahim accompanied him during the over 30 minute visit to the house at Khagragarh where the blast took place on October 2, police said.
 
Doval and the three top officials visited the room where the blast occurred, during which two suspected terrorists were also killed.
 
They also went to the room which had served as the laboratory of the suspected terrorists and climbed the roof top of the house to check the visibility of surrounding areas.
 
Doval also inquired where the two children of the suspected terrorists stayed in the house.
 
The children, who are toddlers have since been taken into custody along with their mothers, one of whom is the widow of one of the suspected terrorists who died in the explosion.
 
Later, Doval met the district officials and asked about the progress of inquiry into the blast, the police added.
 
The four top officials then left for Kolkata to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat 'Nabanna'.
 
Earlier, the security and intelligence chiefs flew in to Burdwan by a chopper from NSC Bose International Airport. They had reached Kolkata in a IAF special aircraft this morning.
 
The present visit was the second in four days by the NIA director. Kumar after his first visit to Burdwan and Murshidabad on
Friday had said that the arrested persons in connection with the blast and their associates were members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and were making IEDs to be transported to the neighbouring country for possible terror attacks.
 
The visits by top security and intelligence chiefs come ahead of the union government's move to send a report to Bangladesh following a request from that country.
 
Three persons, including the two women were arrested in connection with the blast and were interrogated by the NIA.
The PMO is giving utmost importance to the terror issue in Bengal after the Burdwan blast and subsequent revelations of a well-oiled terror network using madrasas.
On the other hand, the Trinamool-led government came under heavy fire from the opposition for trying to keep the NIA at bay after the Burdwan blasts. It was CID, which was entrusted with the investigation, until NIA suo moto took up the case.

Super Six: Top chart picks for Monday08:00 am
On CNBC-TV18's show Super Six, market gurus Kunal Saraogi, Hemen Kapadia and Manav Chopra share, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.
Kunal Saraogi of Equityrush
One may buy  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation with a stoploss of Rs 515 and target of Rs 540.
One may buy  LIC Housing Finance with a stoploss at Rs 338 and target of Rs 355.
Hemen Kapadia of KR Choksey Securities
Bharat Forge  has reflected near term strength by staging a smart recovery. The stock has entered an intraday uptrend and the mechanical indicators are supporting the move indicating the stocks intention to appreciate further from here. One can buy Bharat Forge at its closing of around Rs 768, stoploss of Rs 764 and target of Rs 776.
Axis Bank  has reflected near term weakness by giving a downward key reversal on the daily chart. The stock looks heavy and overbought on the intraday chart. Mechanical indicators have signalled a sell indicating near term pressure. One can sell Axis Bank at its closing of around Rs 424, stoploss of Rs 428 and target of Rs 416.
Manav Chopra of Nirmal Bang
Bharat Forge  has recently seen a very sharp decline from its recent highs and looking at the overall momentum and the long-term parameters there is not much of limited downside. So this stock has also formed a strong support cluster around the levels of Rs 760-765 which also coincides with its long-term moving averages. We recommend a buy on this stock with a stoploss of Rs 750 and expect an upside target of Rs 850.
Arvind  has breached its falling trend line drawn from its recent highs which has come from a short-term to medium term trend reversal. The overall momentum indicators still remain very strong and we expect a higher high formation probably in the next few weeks. So at the current levels Rs 294 is a strong support cluster and we recommend a buy with a stoploss of Rs 292 and expect an upside target of Rs 320.

Equity investing tips for those looking to retireStory
Adding muscle
Stocks are not out of bounds for those who are near retirement. Let's see how they can use equities to shore up returns.
Rahul Oberoi      Follow @iamrahuloberoi    Edition: October 2014

It is believed that stocks, due to their unpredictable nature, are only for the young and daring. The old, it is said, should do their best to stay away from this risky asset.
This belief, like many others, is not without its set of challengers. Stocks, say several financial planners, are indispensable for every investor, young or old, as they are the only asset that can beat inflation over long periods.
Suze Orman, an American author, financial advisor, motivational speaker and television host, is once reported to have said, "Cash-in savings accounts, short-term CDs or money market deposits-is great for an emergency fund. But to fulfill a long-term investment goal like funding your retirement , consider buying stocks. The more distant your financial target, the longer inflation will gnaw at the purchasing power of your money."
"A retired person, considering that his liquidity needs have to be met from investments , should invest in debt instruments an amount equal to three years of living expenses plus planned expenditures and ongoing and expected medical expenses. The instruments can be bank fixed deposits or short-term funds. The remaining money can be invested in equities," says Feroze Azeez, director, investment products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth.
WHERE TO INVEST?
An individual near retirement , due to less time and low risk appetite, should invest in companies that grow consistently and have quality managements. There are many such companies in fast moving consumer goods, or FMCG, pharmaceutical and information technology sectors whose earnings grow at a fast pace and which are not impacted much by market trends. Also, a good dividend payment (for regular income) and growth history should be considered.
DK Aggarwal, chairman and managing director, SMC Investment and Advisors, says, "A person who is about to retire can consider large-cap stocks as most blue-chip companies pay high dividends and outperform the stock market. Defensive sectors such as pharma and FMCG should have more weight in the ideal portfolio of a person nearing retirement."
FACTORS TO WATCH
Click here to Enlarge
Unlike the young, who can bet on new and emerging businesses as they can wait for years for their investments to grow, the retired should look at mature companies run by quality managements, score high on corporate governance, have delivered consistent returns and have a history of paying high dividends.
Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "Companies that have proven themselves and have gained market share over the years will need less funds for expansion and so will have a sizeable surplus that they can distribute as dividends. These will be beneficial for retired individuals (who want regular income). Such companies can be either in large-cap or mid-cap space."
Dipen Shah, head, private client group research, Kotak Securities, says, "If someone is near retirement or has already retired, he should invest only in large and stable companies with credible managements, strong balance sheets and good dividendpaying record. Small companies should be avoided."
DIRECT OR INDIRECT EXPOSURE?
What is the ideal way to take exposure to stocks in old age? Considering the recent changes in tax laws, which extended the holding period for short-term capital gains from debt funds from 12 to 36 months, the retired can look at balanced funds. These invest more than 65% money in stocks and so are considered equity funds for taxation. This means gains from an investment held for more than one year are not taxed. Plus, they give investors exposure to debt, which provides stability to the portfolio, as well.
At present, short-term gains from debt funds are added to the income and taxed according to the person's tax slab. Long-term gains, if the units are held for more than three years, are taxed at 20% with indexation. Indexation involves adjusting the purchase price with inflation. It lowers gains and, hence, the tax burden.
Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "Indirect exposure through mutual funds is better since these are well-regulated and managed by professionals. This saves investors the hassle of personally tracking companies. There are a number of mutual funds whose mandate is investing in growth companies. They also provide a dividend payout option." Dividends can be a good source of regular income for the retired.
Tushar Pendharkar, equity strategist, Right Horizons, says anyone can take exposure to stocks, either directly or through mutual funds. A thumb rule says that equity exposure should be 100 minus age. So, if the person's age is 55, he should invest 45% funds in equities. Therefore, it is recommended that one should reduce exposure to stocks with age.
For those who would like to take direct exposure to stocks, we talked to market experts and tried to find out stocks they can buy in the present market from their retirement funds. Hiren Dhakan, associate fund manager, Bonanza Portfolio, suggests stocks with consistent history of paying high dividends such as Colgate-Palmolive, Hawkins Cookers, Emami, HDFC and Hindustan Uniliver.
Aggarwal of SMC says, "Emami and Godrej Industries are good options for retirement planning." Emami has a robust portfolio of more than 300 products and good operational track record. Godrej Industries is part of a leading business group that is seeing robust growth in all its verticals.
Emami has given 47% annualised return to investors in the past ten years. Godrej Industries, Hawkins Cooker, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC and Colgate Palmolive have returned 43.25%, 64.56%, 19.82%, 23.70% and 26.64% a year, respectively, during the period. All these companies also have a record of paying dividends regularly.

School staff member detained for nursery student's rape
A three-year-old girl child studying in a private school in Bangalore was allegedly sexually abused in her nursery class on Tuesday, police said.
Yahoo India –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014
BANGALORE: Bangalore Police have detained a suspect and filed a criminal complaint against the private school where a three-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her school teacher on Tuesday.
According to reports, a school attendant has been detained by the police for interrogation.
The principal of the private school where the alleged rape took place had earlier on Wednesday said that the institution would abide by the law and use all of its resources to nab the perpetrators of the crime.
"We went through all the CCTV recordings, we are sure there was no outsider entry into the school. The police have examined each area of the school campus and have been provided all records for investigation. We take the safety of students very very carefully," she said.
The three-year-old girl child was allegedly sexually abused Tuesday in her nursery class, police said on Wednesday.
"We have registered a criminal case late Tuesday on a complaint by the victim's father that his young daughter was sexually abused in the Orchid The International School premises," Police Inspector T.C. Venkatesh told IANS.
The case was registered under sections 4 and 6 of the Pocso Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012) and section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unidentified suspect(s).
According to the complaint, the girl's mother found her daughter crying and behaving unusual and abnormal when she went to pick her up from the school in the evening.
"The victim had signs of fever and complained to her mother that she was physically abused by someone she did not know or recognize," the complaint by her father Harpreet Singh said.
The latest incident of child abuse in a city school has occurred three months after a six-year-old girl student was allegedly raped July 3 in The Vibgyor High school in the eastern suburb by its gymnastic coach and his assistant.
The accused were arrested three weeks after the incident July 29 and remanded to judicial custody pending investigation and filing of the charge-sheet by police. (Agencies)

MF Investments in IT Stocks Hit All-time High in SeptemberNew Delhi: The mutual fund industry is betting big on software companies as its equity exposure to the sector climbed to a fresh all-time high of around Rs 32,000 crore at the end of September.
This also marks the fourth consecutive rise in mutual fund (MF) industry's exposure to software stocks.
Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
The funds' investment in software stocks stood at Rs 31,834 crore as on September 30, 2014, accounting for 10.83 per cent of their total equity assets under management (AUM) of Rs 2.94 lakh crore, according to data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
At current levels, the MF industry has the highest exposure to software sector since August 2009. Data is not available for sector-wise exposure before August 2009, when the equity funds had deployed Rs 11,913 crore (6.71 per cent) in software shares.
The previous high was in August this year when investment in the sector rose to Rs 29,668 crore.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in software stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in software stocks by equity fund managers and fund infusion has grown from Rs 27,772 crore in January to Rs 31,834 crore in September.
Besides, mutual fund managers raised their exposure in bank stocks to an all-time high of over Rs 55,398 crore in September this year, which is the highest among all the sectors.
Among others, MFs have an exposure of Rs 21,908 crore in pharma space, followed by auto (Rs 18,892 crore) and finance (Rs 16,358 crore).

RCEP negotiations: India averse to delinking goods from servicesNew Delhi not willing to relent after bitter experience with ASEAN pact
New Delhi, October 26:  
India is facing pressure at the on-going Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations from members such as the ASEAN bloc, Japan and South Korea to conclude a free trade pact in goods earlier than one in services.
New Delhi, however, is unwilling to fall in line with the demand following its bitter experience with the 10-member ASEAN countries with which it had agreed to sign a FTA in goods first.
Sub-group meetings
Talks between RCEP members, which also include China, Australia and New Zealand, are happening in various sub-group meetings at the moment, with New Delhi set to host the next round of talks in December. The pact seeks to include goods, services, investments, competition and intellectual property.
“There is immense pressure on us in these sub-group meetings to agree to de-link goods from services, but we are not budging. With ASEAN, we hardly got any concessions in services as we had concluded an FTA in goods first and had no bargaining chip left. In RCEP we are not prepared to do the same and the entire pact has to be signed in one go,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine.
Negotiation on RCEP, which will be the largest trading bloc in the world accounting for 45 per cent of population and combined GDP of over $21 trillion, began in 2013 and is scheduled to be concluded by 2015.
But, talks have hit muddy waters, as there is no concurrence on important issues such as level of ambition for the initial offers, the divergence in offers made to individual members and whether all parts of the comprehensive pact should be concluded together.
“India wants to be conservative in its initial offers because of China, but other RCEP members want a high level of ambition even at the initial stages,” the official said.
There is also no unanimity on the divergences that members would be allowed to have. While India is prepared to be liberal with trade partners such as ASEAN, Japan and South Korea, with which it already has signed FTAs, it cannot be as open with China because of Indian industry’s inability to cope with open competition from the country.
Similarly, countries such as New Zealand and Australia, with which India has no trade pact, cannot be treated on the same footing as FTA partners.
“It is very important for us to be allowed divergences as we cannot treat all members of the RCEP alike. We hope the grouping recognises and provides us the needed leeway,” the official said.
India is keen to be part of the RCEP despite China’s presence in the grouping as it is not part of either the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) — the other two extensive regional trade deals under negotiations. There is a risk that India would have to face higher duties than its rival countries in most markets if it is not part of any major trade pacts.

SC panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas nearSariskaPrint
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:27 am
The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. However, a decision on the issue was put on hold in March 2013.
In December 2013, the government decided to withdraw the ban imposed by the state forest department in March 2012 and grant “consent to operate” to all mines falling beyond 100 metres of the sanctuary boundary. Other than Rajan, officials who cleared the decision included former chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, former mining secretary Sudhansh Pant and additional chief secretary (forest) O P Meena.

Good news from textile sector: exports to US  No. 1 single market  hit recordhighThe pick-up in performance, visible in the export of Indian apparel and textiles, is also matched by a revival of sorts visible in domestic sales.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:22 am
The Centre’s ‘Make in India’ pitch seems to have already found resonance in the country’s textile and garment industry, with India’s exports to its largest single market, the US, headed for a record surge this year.
While a renewed buoyancy in textile and apparel exports is helped by a sharp improvement in raw material supplies, the strong performance by India this year is also a reflection of a combination of global factors — a steady improvement in demand as the American economy picks up, a progressive decline in Chinese exports to major markets such as the US, currency appreciation in  Indonesia, labour unrest in Asian competitor Cambodia and safety concerns after a major factory fire in Bangladesh last year.
Indian textile and apparel exports have risen nearly 7 per cent during January-August 2014, according to the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) data, compared with an average 2 per cent annual growth in the last five years. The growth in exports this year is being seen as significant as it happened despite the sharp strengthening of the Indian rupee since September 2013 (a stronger domestic currency results in a loss of competitiveness for exporters and vice versa).
While the steady pick in US demand is a major factor, larger domestic cotton supplies are also helping India push textile and apparel exports, Ajay Sardana, vice-president of Aditya Birla group firm Grasim said on the sidelines of a recent conference. India is projected to be the world’s top cotton grower this year, ahead of China for the first time in over three decades, according to a September 12 US Department of Agriculture forecast that has been corroborated by the Cotton Association of India.
Virender Uppal, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said, “We (Indian exporters) have leveraged our raw material strengths and followed sustained better compliance practices, which attracted the buyers and international brands across globe to source from India.”
Added to this is a series of problems encountered by India competitors. Cambodia, in June this year, saw labour unrest as angry workers rampaged through a textile plant that supplied US sportswear company Nike Inc, clashing with police over their demands for a pay hike. The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last year has had a continuing impact in terms of orders being diverted to India and other markets because of concerns over Bangladeshi workshop safety while textile manufacturers in Vietnam, one of the fastest growing supplier base, have been weighed in by the high cost of credit.
Both Bangladesh and Cambodia have seen a contraction in exports to the US, continued…

Nifty likely to open higher; may reclaim 8050 levelsDow Jones
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Monday following positive trend seen in SGX Nifty and may reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8,050 in trade today. However, it may pare gains after strong start tracking muted momentum seen in other Asian markets.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading points 27.50 higher at 8,047.50 indicating a gap-up opening on the domestic market.
Nifty added 18.65 points to its values and ended at 8014.55, whereas the Sensex closed higher by 63.82 points at 26851.05 on the muhurat trading day.
Nifty cleared the short term resistance of 7970 level and closed above its crucial psychological level of 8000. Now the level of 8040 would act as a key resistance to watch out for in the immediate term.

"It is very important that the index takes support in the range of 7970 to 7930 in case of a decline, else we may see resumption of the recent down trend that has come in force after it violated a key support of 7840 in the past week," added the report.

ONGC ramps up Mumbai offshore production by 8%ONGC ramps up Mumbai offshore production by 8% as it faces scrutiny from oil ministry

Fields
NEW DELHI: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has ramped up output from its biggest fields in Mumbai offshore by 8% in the past seven months, the first growth in many years, and plans to quickly develop discovered fields, including some in deep-sea regions, as the staterun firm is facing enormous heat and scrutiny from the oil ministry.
ONGC has faced criticism for long delay in developing its deep-sea fields but its chairman DK Sarraf said the company was trying hard to quickly develop these fields. "Our KG discoveries that would require slightly more time due to difficult terrain, would get the price in the due course as the approved price is dynamic and it will substantially change by 2018," he told ET.
Sarraf said ONGC finds its deep-sea fields viable at the recently announced gas price of $5.61 per unit. "We are not worried about price. Our focus is to find more oil and gas and monetise them quickly. The purpose of ONGC is not profiteering, but to ensure the country's energy security. Exploration and production is our priority, everything else will be secondary," he said.
Sarraf said output from Mumbai offshore has risen to 316,130 barrels per day from 292,707 in the middle of March. "I myself monitor output details every morning and ensure action if there is even a barrel drop," he said.
Sarraf said he is directly connected with the basin managers through his smartphone supervising real-time developments. "This approach has brought the change. Now we plan to adopt similar systems in other basins. We are under strict vigil by the government as it has set targets and the oil secretary monitors it on the fifth day of every month without fail," he said. The company is now concentrating on the development of new gas-fields in the east and the west coasts to start over 28 million standard cubic meters per day output by 2017-18, he said.
"We plan to submit integrated field development plan for northern gas fields in the KG basin by early next year, where we expect more than 20 mmscmd gas and 90,000 barrels per day oil. In fact, we have already started some development works to avoid delays," he said. Sarraf said the northern discoveries have huge potential and more oil and gas is expected in the due course. He expects the first output from June 2018.
ONGC's second major focus is on the Western coast, near Daman offshore, he said. "There were several smaller discoveries in that region, which were lying idle. But recently, we have found some relatively bigger discoveries. Conservatively, the potential is about 8.5 mmscmd. We plan to club them with existing infrastructure of Tapti field, which will allow development in just $1 billion and save oneand-a-half year time. We can bring out the gas by mid -2017," Sarraf said.
He said due to natural decline, the Tapti field's infrastructure, which is now the government's property, would be idle.
"Both the process platform and the pipeline up to Hazira could be utilised by ONGC, which will also save abandon costs," he said.
ONGC is looking for right technology to draw gas from the southern part of its KGbasin block , which is ultradeepwater block. "We are concentrating on other prospects as no company in the world is able to produce gas from such ultra-deep sea," he said.

Dilma Rousseff becomes Brazils new President for second term after narrowwinPrint

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

Brent Drops Below $86 After Goldman Cuts Price Forecasts
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 13:31 (IST)
Gold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
Tokyo: Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, making the US investment bank the most bearish of major financial institutions that have been carving back their estimates in recent weeks, citing global growth concerns and ample supplies.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's analysts who last week pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0612 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 2 cents at $81.03 a barrel.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts ... I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
Increased domestic crude stores have depressed the price of short-term futures contracts. For the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on November 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Kuwait's oil minister said there was no negative effect on the country's development plan from lower oil prices, state news agency KUNA reported on Sunday.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.

Oil's slide a blow, not a boon to Asian refiners
Forecasts that crude prices will remain weaker-than-expected into next year have also raised the specter of big write-downs on crude and product inventories on year-end earnings reports.

Oil's slide a blow, not a boon to Asian refiners
Forecasts that crude prices will remain weaker-than-expected into next year have also raised the specter of big write-downs on crude and product inventories on year-end earnings reports.
Post your opinion here
 
A 25 percent slide in crude prices since June should mean a windfall for Asian refiners, but instead they are facing a major drag on profits.
Although benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate crudes are just off multi-year lows, many refiners have previously agreed to pay higher prices for deliveries through to the end of this year and can not pass those costs on to fuel buyers.
Forecasts that crude prices will remain weaker-than-expected into next year have also raised the specter of big write-downs on crude and product inventories on year-end earnings reports.
"As (the falls were) unexpected, they are causing earnings shocks," said Andrew Yoon, a senior analyst at Daishin Securities, noting the knock-on impact that cuts in oil inventory values would have on end-of-year results.
Brent dropped to less than USD 83 a barrel on Oct. 16, its lowest in almost four years after falling from this year's high of USD 115.71 in mid-June. The front-month contract has recovered some lost ground and has held mostly above USD 85 since then, but it is not clear its four-month downtrend is finished.
"In terms of an impact on our inventories, cheaper oil price is a minus as it will lead to appraisal losses," said Yasushi Kimura, head of the Petroleum Association of Japan and chairman of Japan's biggest refiner JX Holdings.
A source at a Southeast Asian refiner said his company started the year with an oil complex based on a USD 106 price for Brent, and even if the benchmark recovers to USD 90, it is looking at a USD 16-a-barrel loss on oil in tanks.
The refiner holds about 3 million barrels of crude at any time, yielding a paper loss of around USD 48 million under this price scenario.
South Korea - with the fourth-largest refining capacity in Asia Pacific at 2.9 million barrels per day - held 29.5 million barrels of crude inventory by end-September, customs data shows.
That means every USD 10 drop in crude represents a USD 295 million loss in South Korea's inventory values.
South Korean refiners could also take a hit on lower values for more than 52 million barrels of oil products that state-run Korea National Oil says they held at the end of last month.
Margins and runs
SK Innovation Co , which owns SK Energy Co, South Korea's largest refiner, said it is looking into ways to minimize position risks against falling crude prices.
Asian refiners usually do not hedge crude imports.
"We have already bought all the crude to be delivered through the year-end, considering it takes two months for most shipments," said a Seoul-based refining source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Although margins at a complex refinery in Singapore - the benchmark value for Asia - have rebounded to above USD 5 a barrel from an average of USD 3.66 a barrel in August, with refiners still waiting for high-cost crude shipments to arrive, those improvements may not hold.
"Despite the substantially lower feedstock prices, the product prices have also fallen. So margins have not really improved," said an analyst with an oil producer who declined to be named because of company policy.
"If the demand was 'solid' we should have seen some relative strength in product prices versus crude," he said.
Some Asian refiners have been striving to offset processing losses by cutting operating rates compared with a year ago, according to some sources and analysts.
Others have been holding rates flat to just slightly lower, looking to fill tanks with products refined from cheap crude that can be sold when the markets recover.
"Refiners will probably keep their runs cautious and just spoon feed, just buy enough and see how it goes," waiting until it is clear that prices have hit bottom or processing margins have turned less volatile, said the oil producer's analyst.
South Korea's September refinery utilization rate fell 6 percentage points from August, although run rates in the first nine months of the year were up 0.3 percentage point from the same period last year. Over January-August, Taiwan's throughput was down 1.3 percent from a year ago.
Chinese refiners, in contrast, bumped up their crude runs by 9.1 percent from a year ago in September, taking advantage of the sell-off in crude values to fill product tanks processed from cheap oil.
Still, demand for oil in 2015 is expected to grow far slower than previously forecast, the International Energy Agency said.
"In theory, lower oil prices would eventually stimulate demand but we still have some way to go for that to happen," said the producer's analyst.

Black money: Centre may reveal a/c holder names in SC today
The three account holders whose names are likely to be revealed before the SC are the ones against whom prosecution has been initiated by the government.
Post your opinion here
 
The central government is likely to disclose the names of three people who have black money stashed abroad in its affidavit to the Supreme Court on Monday.
In the affidavit, the Centre is likely to explain its stand in the black money case where it had told the apex court last week that it cannot disclose the names of account holders as it would be a violation of the double taxation avoidance agreement.
The three account holders whose names are likely to be revealed before the SC are the ones against whom prosecution has been initiated by the government.
Black money may have been the pet theme of the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party during the 2014 election campaign but the saffron brigade took a U-turn when it expressed its apprehensions to divulge information about the black money account holders.
Switzerland has promised to co-operate with India on black money saying that it will examine requests for banking information on a priority basis but a former Swiss Bank employee and a whistleblower Rudolf Elemer says that India must press for names and figures.

"To be fair here, there is a lot of talk going on and promises made, but understand that the Indian government is the world champion in delaying things especially about information. Therefore, as long as the Indian government does not have facts, names and figures, it is not positive move for present government. At the end of the day you need to have the information - client's name, amount, if there is no deadline agreed on, then you're still in the air and you don't know if you are going to receive the information tomorrow or in 2019 when Switzerland implements automatic information exchange", Elmer said.

You do not have to be an account holder for receiving funds from another account holder
Team Money Today        Edition: October 2014
You do not have to be an account holder for receiving funds from another account holder. ICICI Bank has recently launched a facility under which an account holder can transfer funds to another person even if the latter does not have a bank account. But there are a few prerequisites for using the facility. For example, a sender needs to have online banking ID and password, and the beneficiary needs to have a mobile phone for receiving the amount.
You first need to log in to the bank website with user ID and password. Register the beneficiary, the receiver of money, by entering his or her mobile number, name and address and the unique registration number (URN) that you receive on your registered mobile number. Then, you go to the transfer section and select 'cardless cash withdrawal' for entering the transaction amount. After the amount gets deducted, you receive a unique four-digit code on your mobile from the bank. You need to share it with the beneficiary.
The beneficiary or receiver also gets an SMS with a unique six-digit code on their mobile phone from the bank. Finally, the beneficiary has to visit a specified ATM and enter the required details - the mobile number, the four-digit code (received by the sender), the six-digit code (received by the beneficiary) and the amount to be withdrawn.
You can transfer a maximum Rs 10,000 per transaction and Rs 25,000 per account in a day. Also, the amount per recipient cannot exceed Rs 25,000 in a month.

Ram Jethmalani sends FM a black money stinkerRam Jethmalani sends Arun Jaitley a black money stinker
Mail Today Bureau        Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 11:32 IST
Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has come under scathing attack from senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani, who has alleged that the finance minister was not keen for the truth to emerge regarding the government's efforts to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks.
In a stinging letter to Jaitley, the veteran lawyer has questioned the government's inability to disclose the names of Indians holding illegal foreign bank accounts because of bilateral double taxation avoidance treaties (DTAT). Jethmalani said the government's petition citing DTATs coming in the way of disclosing names is "one of the most ill advised steps taken".
"The DTAT or any equivalent document is not to be used and cannot be used. We are not dealing with persons or entities who by the law of India and Germany are liable to pay tax in both countries on the same income," argued Jethmalani, who is a petitioner in the Supreme Court on the black money issue.
"The Germans never spoke of the DTAT. Our people deliberately brought it in as a certain method of rendering the entire investigation futile and making our corrupt rulers escape arrest and prosecution," he said.
He questioned Jaitley's determination to get the culprits apprehended or even identified. The noted lawyer said about 18 names were given to him under orders of the Supreme Court but the list did not include people like Hasan Ali Khan, a businessman who was investigated for alleged money laundering.
"It is most unfortunate that you continue to act only on DTATS," he said.
Jethmalani also accused Jaitley of inaction on the issue even when he was leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha.
"You were the leader of opposition when the Germans announced that they were willing to share the names with any friendly country without cost or condition," he said, adding that it was his (Jaitley's) duty as leader of opposition to establish contact with the Germans to get the names as the government of the day made no move for obvious reasons.
He claimed that the previous UPA government did not make any move as, in all likelihood, bigwigs in the erstwhile ruling Congress party were involved.
In his letter, Jethmalani went on to attack the finance minister by saying: "I strongly suspect that your conduct shows that you too like many others do not want the truth to come out. Your public statements… are product of a troubled conscience and mental confusion, a deadly combination."
The senior lawyer cited replies given by Jaitley in Parliament in July. "You are persistent in the fraud as your answers in the Rajya Sabha to questions on 8th and 15th July clearly show," he said. Jaitley had talked about a positive response from Swizz authorities to some requests for disclosing the names of account holders subject to the confidentiality clause in the double tax avoidance convention.
In another adverse commentary on Jaitley, Jethmalani wrote: "You do not know much of criminal law and hardly anything about complex criminal investigations, particularly the kind involved in the present case. You do not have the humility to learn from your intellectual and moral superiors."
Jethmalani, who was expelled from the BJP earlier this year, referred to Jaitley's recent ill health and said: "You recently had a near brush with death. This should have created in you a change in your moral makeup and devotion to the nation. You are destroying what Modiji has built during the last election campaign."
He signed off by writing: "You are out to help the biggest criminals to escape. "Please do not send names you have got from the Germans to the Swiss. Send them to the SIT so they can tell them what to do. The Supreme Court is monitoring the investigation, it is not an investigating agency," he said.

Cognizant Bags IT Deal From Germany s Vorwerk GroupNew Delhi: Software services major Cognizant has bagged a six-year deal from Germany's Vorwerk Group to transform its IT infrastructure and provide application services.
Vorwerk, an international direct-sales company, has subsidiaries in 24 countries with revenues of over $3.2 billion.
Through this transition, Vorwerk Group will be able to standardise and centralise its IT environment to a higher degree, while driving down costs, Cognizant said in a statement.
Increased centralisation will also make the Group's IT environment more transparent, enabling Vorwerk to proactively monitor, manage, and improve its IT infrastructure even further, it added.
No financial details were disclosed.
As part of the six-year engagement, Cognizant will provide Vorwerk with integrated service management, data centre, network and application management services.
"As an expanding business, customer orientation and time-to-market are top priorities for us," Vorwerk managing partner Reiner Strecker said.
Cognizant will also deliver end-user computing services and field services as well as manage a new service desk, providing help to Vorwerk's employees in a variety of languages, it said.
The services desk will be a central point of contact for the company, assisting staff in German, Italian, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech and Polish, it added.
"Our end-to-end capabilities in IT Infrastructure services, coupled with our deep understanding of Vorwerk's business, will help us establish best-in-class service delivery processes," said Debashis Chatterjee, president of technology solutions at Cognizant.
The Vorwerk & Co KG family enterprise was founded in 1883. The holding company's registered office is located in Wuppertal, Germany. Vorwerk's core business is the worldwide direct sale of products like vacuum cleaners, kitchen appliances, and cosmetics.
Vorwerk employs more than 622,000 people worldwide, 610,000 of which as independent advisers and generated group sales of 2.6 billion euros (2013).

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
New Delhi: Japanese auto major Nissan is recalling 9,000 units of its compact car Micra and mid-sized sedan Sunny in India to replace defective airbags as part of a global recall.
The recall will cover cars manufactured between 2008 and 2012 that use safety airbags made by Nissan's supplier, Takata.
"Nissan plans to begin notifying customers soon. Nissan dealers will replace the driver airbag inflator with a correctly manufactured part at no cost to the customers for parts or labour," a Nissan India spokesperson said.
The global recall of 2,60,000 units by the Japanese auto major affects models including Note, March/Micra, Sunny/Almera/Versa, Patrol and Cube.
These are affected by a driver airbag concern that Takata reported to Nissan, the company said.
Ever since the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) started voluntary vehicle recall for safety related issues in India in July 2012, over seven lakh vehicles have been recalled by various manufacturers including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Ford, Honda and General Motors.
Last month, Maruti Suzuki India announced recall of 69,555 units of Dzire, Swift and Ritz models manufactured between March 2010 and August 2013 to repair wiring harness fitment. ( Read more )
In April this year, in one of the biggest vehicle recalls in India, Maruti Suzuki recalled 1,03,311 units of Ertiga, Swift and DZire models manufactured between November 12, 2013 and February 4, 2014 to replace faulty fuel filler neck.
Last year, General Motors India recalled over 1,10,000 units of its multi-utility vehicle Tavera to address emission and specification issues.
The government is in process of framing a mandatory recall policy that would entail penalties as part of the new Central Motor Vehicle Rules.

Government Aims at 50th Spot in Ease of Doing Business Ranking: ReportIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: The government is aiming to improve India's ranking in the ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from 134th at present.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.

"Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India's ranking," sources said.
They also said that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped by 3 positions to the 134th spot in the latest 'ease of doing business' list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India's ranking in ease of doing business. It has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For the Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes, simplification of complex tax processes, expeditng implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services Tax, besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of $30 billion annual foreign direct investment (FDI).
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create millions of jobs.

Ebola Cases Top 10 000Ebola Cases Top 10,000: WHO

* WHO warns that Ebola coming closer to Ivory Coast
GENEVA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The death toll from the Ebola epidemic rose to 4,922 out of 10,141 known cases in eight countries through Oct. 23, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday.
The virus, which reached Mali through a two-year-old girl who died on Friday, now threatens Ivory Coast, having infected people virtually all along its borders with Guinea and Liberia.
Ivory Coast is the world's biggest cocoa producer. The Ebola outbreak has hurt the economic growth that has been raising living standards in the region.
The three worst-hit countries of West Africa -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- account for the bulk of the world's worst Ebola outbreak, recording 4,912 deaths out of 10,114 cases, the WHO said in its update.
The overall figures include outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal, deemed by the WHO to be now over, as well as isolated cases in Spain, the United States and a single case in Mali.
But the true toll may be three times as much: by a factor of 1.5 in Guinea, 2 in Sierra Leone and 2.5 in Liberia, while the death rate is thought to be about 70 percent of all cases.
The WHO has said that many families are keeping infected people at home rather than putting them into isolation in treatment centers, some of which have refused patients due to a lack of beds and basic supplies.
The U.N. agency, sounding an ominous note, said that out of the eight districts of Liberia and Guinea sharing a border with Ivory Coast, only two have yet to report confirmed or probable Ebola cases.
It has also said trials of Ebola vaccines could begin in West Africa in December, a month earlier than expected, and hundreds of thousands of doses should be available for use by the middle of next year.
The WHO says 15 African states including Ivory Coast are at highest risk of the deadly virus being imported.
In the last 10 days it sent teams to both priority Mali and Ivory Coast to help national authorities gear up their capacity to detect and treat potential cases. Four WHO experts are traveling this weekend to Mali to reinforce the team there.
The agency warned on Friday that many people in Mali had potentially been exposed to the virus because the little girl was taken across the country while ill. Some 43 people with whom she was in contact, including 10 health care workers, are being monitored for symptoms that include fever.
In all, 450 health care workers have been infected to date -- including one in Spain and three in the United States -- leading to the death of 244 of them, the WHO said.
"At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs (health care workers) are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk."
A medical worker quarantined in New Jersey on her return from treating Ebola victims in West Africa was being evaluated in a hospital isolation ward on Saturday after new contagion-control safeguards were imposed for America's biggest urban center.
Isolation wards have been used for medical personnel returning from Ebola zones since Craig Spencer, a doctor who treated patients in Guinea for a month, came back to New York City infected.
"The patient is currently in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, one of eight New York State hospitals that have been designated to treat patients with Ebola Virus Disease. Possible contacts are being identified and followed up," WHO said. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Mark Heinrich/Ruth Pitchford)

Kharif paddy  pulses severely hit in TelanganaKharif paddy, pulses severely hit in Telangana
K V Kurmanath
Officials are worried about further losses in the next two weeks
Hyderabad, Oct 26:  
With the kharif season coming to a close, Telangana has registered a significant drop in acreage of paddy and pulses. Official figures show a decline of 20 per cent in paddy and a 30 per cent in pulses acreage.
Rain brings hope With the State struggling hard to meet the power requirements at the fag end of the season, officials are worried about further losses in the next two weeks. But widespread rains in several districts on Saturday rekindled hopes.
As a result of drop in paddy and red gram and green gram acreage, foodgrains production is expected to be hit in the State. The total area under foodgrains has come down to 17 lakh hectares (ha), according to the provisional figures available with the Agriculture Department. This is about 30 per cent less than the season average of 20 lakh ha.
The total pulses’ area has been declined to 3.5 lakh ha against the normal area of 5 lakh ha. The other crops that witnessed lesser acreage this season include castor, jowar, chillies and turmeric.
Cotton proves dependable
Cotton, however, has shown an increase of 9 per cent. Cotton cultivation, though not recommended in the rain-fed State, is generally grown in 15 lakh ha during the season. A relatively resilient crop, cotton is seen as a dependable crop by the farmers.
“The acreage has grown up to 16.76 lakh hectares this year notwithstanding the initial fears. This is higher than last year’s figure of 16.30 lakh hectares. Pickings have begun in most parts,” an official from the Ministry told BusinessLine.
Soyabean, which is grown in a little over one lakh hectares, has shown a significant increase as the acreage cross the 2.7-lakh ha mark. The area of sugarcane too went up to 44,700 ha from the average of 38,400 ha. Maize too made marginal gains from the average figure of 4.66 lakh ha.

Financial regulators to issue warning against IS linksNew Delhi, October 26, 2014

Financial regulators to issue warning against IS links
PTI
financial and business service
Concerned over an estimated $1 million a day funding received by Islamic State, the Financial Action Task Force (FTAF) has asked all countries, including India, to prevent the terror group from tapping their financial systems.
Financial sector regulators in India, including Sebi for capital markets and RBI for banking sector, are likely to soon issue similar warnings to caution institutions operating under their respective jurisdictions to put in place necessary safeguards.
Sanctions are already in place by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) against entities linked to the Islamic State. However, it is for the first time that a public statement has been issued against this terror group by FATF, an inter-governmental grouping that sets global financial sector regulatory standards to tackle money laundering and terror financing activities.
In line with the UNSC sanctions, Sebi has asked market entities to stay cautious about any funds or entities linked to this terror group finding their way to Indian capital markets.
Following the FATF statement, Sebi and RBI among other regulatory agencies would now issue separate warnings to the entities regulated by them against dealing with ISIL—linked firms, individuals or funds.
While no instance of any IS-linked activities in the Indian markets has come to the fore so far, the regulator has informed stock exchanges about the updated al-Qaeda sanctions list of the UNSC.
Islamic State is estimated to be earning as much as $1 million every day from oil sales, as per the U.S. Treasury Department.
The warning from the FATF comes at a time when the terror group is spreading its reach in the Middle East and the UNSC raising red flag about the terror group’s funding activities.
In order to combat the threat posed by IS, the FATF on Friday reiterated “the need for all countries to fully implement the FATF standards to combat terrorist financing and calls on all countries to take steps to prevent ISIL from accessing their financial systems.”
According to FATF, the fight against IS urgently needs more insight into sources and methods of their funding. India, the United States and Japan are among the 34 member jurisdictions of the FATF.

Meet Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa  India s new racquet girlsprint
About 11 kilometres separate the leafy, colonnaded Chennai colony of Anna Nagar from the posh, buzzy township of RA Puram. Negotiating the city’s mostly disciplined traffic, you are likely to take around 40 minutes to cover the distance between the two residential colonies. Between these two apparently disparate neighbourhoods live two of the most exciting squash talents in the country.
Joshna Chinappa 28
Based in: Chennai and Mumbai, where she trains with former India number one Ritwik Bhattacharya
Sports connection: The fifth generation in a family of squash players, her great granduncle was Field Marshal KM Cariappa. Her father Anjan Chinappa, who represented Tamil Nadu in squash, was her first coach.
World Ranking: 21 (as of October, 2014)
Claim to fame: A 12-times national champion, Joshna is a pioneer of women’s squash in India. She became the youngest Indian to win the British Open juniors at the age of 16 and has been a regular face at international competitions since.
Unwind mantra: Watching “trashy television” shows such as the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and listening to exponents of progressive house music such as Dinka and Claes Rosen
Match point: Her dream date is footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, or any person who is fit, who plays sport and someone she can train and work out with
A few weeks ago, Joshna Chinappa (28), partnered with Dipika Pallikal (23) at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow to win India an unprecedented medal in squash.
The two were also part of India’s Asian Games campaign at Incheon, South Korea, this month, where the contingent won four medals in squash. The count could have been five, had the duo not clashed in the singles quarterfinals, where Dipika reversed past record to emerge one better than Joshna in a tense, almost acrimonious contest.
Before this hour of glory, lazy marketers and scribes tended to bracket Joshna and Dipika into the “good-looking athletes” category along with golfer Sharmila Nicollet, notwithstanding their exemplary track record and playing chops.
Sure, both the Chennai girls are glamorous, forthright and full of pizzazz. But their racquets speak louder than their looks in a sport with a distinct male bias.
In fact, protesting the discrimination against lower prize money for women in India, Dipika has been boycotting the national championships for the last few years. “We train as hard as the boys and play as much as them. We make the same sacrifices but don’t get our due. Once we get equal prize money, I’ll participate again,” says the number one squash player in the country, who broke into the top 10 of world rankings in December last year.
 
Ladies first
Their performance at Incheon, where Joshna and she won the doubles silver, is another manifestation of the lustre women-power is lending to India’s sporting fortunes. 
Dipika Pallikal, 23
Based in: Chennai and Melbourne, where she trains with former world champion Sarah Fitzgerald
Sports connection: She is the daughter of Susan Pallikal, who has represented India in cricket and her grandmother was a national level athlete
World Ranking: 12 (as of October, 2014,
Claim to fame: She became the first Indian squash player to break into the top 10 world rankings in 2013. Since then, she has helped India win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games 2014. At the Asian Games, Dipika won a bronze medal at Incheon and combined with Joshna to win a silver medal in doubles.
Unwind mantra: Listening to Adele on her iPod, watching movies and television shows on her Apple Mac Air laptop. A film fanatic, she is a fan of Robert Downey Jr. and was blown over by Tabu and Shahid Kapur’s acting in Haider. She has watched all seasons of Suits and is now waiting for the next season.
Match point: She is preparing for “a fairy tale wedding” with cricketer Dinesh Karthik in mid-2015.
“Women are finally getting their due. In a country with one of the worst statistics in gender crime, it is a really positive development,” says Joshna. “You have several top women champions. And for a movie to be made on one of them is absolutely awesome. I watched Mary Kom and thought Priyanka looked magnificent and then I was with the real Mary Kom at the Asian Games and was touched by her humility. I love that she’s so grounded despite being a five-time world champion,” she adds. 
“Didn’t a recent news article say that most of the medals at Incheon came from women?” asks Dipika.
Although they both cut their teeth in Chennai and have a lot in common – such as the ability not to call a spade a shovel – the life stories of the two Chennai champions have their own share of challenges and joys, pains and pleasures.
 
Early lessons
Joshna got introduced to squash at the Madras Cricket Club where her father Anjan Chinappa, who runs a coffee plantation in Coorg, was a member.
Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first commander-in-chief of the Indian Army in independent India is Joshna’s great-granduncle.
“I am the fifth generation of squash players in the family. My great granduncle, granduncle, granddad and father have all played the sport. But my father was the first not to join the military. He came to Chennai, fell in love with city life and settled here. I began going to the club with him at eight and since he had represented Tamil Nadu in squash, got my first tips from him. Papa was my coach for the first six years but he was putting too much pressure on me. He would accompany me to tournaments abroad when I was very young, but every time I looked out of the court, he was sweating more than I was. As a kid you look outside and want to see a supportive face, you don’t want somebody feeling as pressured as you are,” she jokes.
Like Joshna, Dipika didn’t have to look too far for sporting inspiration. Her mother Susan Pallikal has represented India in cricket and her grandmother was a national-level athlete.
“I am the youngest of three sisters and mom asked all of us to take up at least one sport seriously. Today I absolutely love squash but my entry into the sport was accidental. I used to play tennis earlier, but I took to squash since my best friend went for squash coaching,” says Dipika.
Once her parents realised Dipika’s hand-eye coordination was ideal for racquet sports, they reckoned she should train with the best in the world.
So, at the age of 13, Dipika was sent for coaching to Cairo’s Gezira Sports Club, since Egypt was the reigning global squash superpower.
Wasn’t it tough staying away from family and friends at the onset of teenage? “No, I wasn’t really fazed about missing my teenage years or parties back home because I was working towards becoming the top squash player in the world. I went to Egypt, England and now I am training at Melbourne. I’ve made a lot of friends and I tried to adapt wherever I am. That is what most professional athletes do when they start living alone. I am 23 but I am way more matured than any 23 year old girl.”
The rigours of living out of a suitcase after becoming a teenage sporting sensation are something Joshna, the first Indian to win a British Junior Open title, can relate to.
When she began playing in the juniors at the age of 10, she won pretty much everything on the Asian circuit. But the British Open, the mecca of squash, eluded her.
In 2003, Joshna was relieved she could finally win after four years of losing in the second round or quarterfinals.
“Sixteen is an interesting age. I was happy that I could win but I didn’t let that go to my head. All I wanted to do was go and buy candy with my teammates. I didn’t realise the magnitude of the win since at 16 there was still some innocence left in the world,” says the lithe athlete, lounging in her daintily decorated room, painted in pink near a dresser lined with junk jewellery and a trunkful of beaded bracelets.
Having candy and chocolate was a childhood fetish that Joshna continued with well into her teenage years. In fact, after losing the World Junior title at Belgium in 2005, she compensated by devouring a box of chocolates, or so goes the story.
Does she still indulge her sugar craving? “Not any longer. It used to be worse when I was younger. Now I train very hard and have to ensure I stay the way I am. So I make sure I eat healthy. I do have my chocolates on the weekend and I dig mint flavours such as After Eight and Lindt.”
 
The wild one
Although Joshna counts Andre Agassi as one of her favourite athletes, she doesn’t quite relate to what the champion wrote in Open, his autobiography, about how he “hated” tennis as a child.
“I absolutely loved it all. I got to travel around the world, when my friends were taking their exams. I didn’t have to attend school every day and I could come to school late after training. So, not everybody had my life. I have some great memories of the times I was a junior.”
Looking back, the 12-time national champion says she has mellowed with age and left behind her wild rebellious years where she got her ears and belly pierced and her back tattooed. “Oh come on, don’t even ask me why I got it done. I was 16 and got my back inked with a smoking devil tattoo in Mumbai without telling my mother and later got blasted by my parents!”
The years spent on the circuit have also given her perspective. “When I was younger and more adventurous, I probably didn’t have my priorities right all the time. As you grow older, you realise this is your time to work really hard and achieve your goals. Sport has a shelf-life right? I can always party later.”
Chennai Connection
The top two women’s squash players – Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinnappa – as well as men’s number one and Asian Games silver medallist Saurav Ghosal all play in Chennai. Why is the city such a hub of squash champions? To begin with it has great sporting infrastructure at the school level: both Joshna and Saurav went to the same school (Lady Andal). “Also, since the federation is based here, all the players that are from here benefit. You have the academy and coaches,” points out Joshna.
Joshna says one her most treasured sporting memories came in 2000, when, at the age of 14, she became the youngest person to win the women’s nationals. 
By holding both the senior and junior titles at such a young age she even eclipsed the achievements of Indian sporting greats such as Vijay Amritraj, Ramesh Krishnan and Prakash Padukone. “I wanted to win the women’s nationals really badly at that age, so I was really, really happy.”
But for Dipika nothing comes close to going for gold at Glasgow and getting it.
“Scotland was special. It is the biggest win of my career. Because we don’t have squash at the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games are our biggest platforms to perform, especially since squash is such an underrated sport in India. Those are the only times it is televised back home,” she points out.
Reminiscing about the Games, where they beat Jenny Duncalf and Laura Massaro of England 11-6, 11-8 in the doubles squash final, Dipika says the atmosphere at Glasgow’s Scotstoun Sports Campus Squash Arena was charged up. 
“We took it one match at one time, and our semi-final was a tough game. At one point, I was telling Dipika I don’t think I could do it. She told me that I should calm down and just play and that’s what I did and we won. Compared to that, the final was easier. The crowds were fantastic and the support from back home was incredible. It has never happened before,” says Joshna.
“Squash it is at an exciting new high. With the Commonwealth and Asian Games, we’ve proved we can beat the best in the world. Medals like this boost a sport up. It is a great time to be an Indian squash player,” adds Dipika.
 
Date, play, love
Clearly, these are eventful times for Dipika off the court, too. After a whirlwind romance, she got engaged with Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik on November 15 last year, with the wedding planned for mid-2015.
When the top squash player in the country dates a cricketer known for his lightning reflexes and explosive batting, it appears to be a match made in ESPN heaven.
How did the two of them meet?  “There isn’t really a story to how we met. We had known each other for six years but we were in touch on and off. Obviously, Dinesh was married before [to his former wife Nikita]. But one and half years back, we met again in the gym,” recalls Dipika.
“We exchanged numbers and promised to keep in touch. I had to leave for England three days after that and Dinesh surprised me in England. After that everything happened really quickly. We started dating in February and got engaged in November. Once we got to know each other, we knew this was it,” she says with a smile.
What does she like about Dinesh apart from being one of the fittest Indian cricketers?
“I like to think I am fitter than him (giggles). Dinesh got into the cricket team when he was 19. So, he has seen it all. For me what helped me make the decision was this trait: he is a very humble person. He takes care of me real well,” she blushes.
Fitness appears to be a trait that finds favour with Joshna too, in the dating stakes. In the past she has said she has a soft corner for international athletes and Cristiano Ronaldo is her dream date.
“I like fit people. It can be any person who is fit, plays sport and someone I can train and work out with.”
On a lighter note, Joshna says her laptop is like her boyfriend. “When I travel, I don’t want to do anything else apart from sitting in my room and watching movies and shows that I stream onto my laptop. I love the way trashy television makes me feel good. I am watching more than 12 shows right now. On a regular basis I watch Revenge, The Following and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. I’ve watched all four seasons of the show.”
Since she travels so much, which is her favourite playing destination? “The United States: I love playing in America. In New York, we have a tournament played on a glass court which has been set up bang in the middle of the Grand Central station. I just love that venue,” announces Joshna.
Meet the divas
Dipika and Joshna have frequently figured in the most glamorous Indian athletes list of fashion glossies. And they take their style quotient seriously.
One of the perks of traipsing the world for tournaments is visiting global fashion capitals and exposure to the coolest new trends in street fashion. “I am not obsessed with designer labels,” says Joshna. “But when it comes with to high street brands, I like Top Shop and Diesel,” she adds.
Dipika is a little more of a fashion diva, in the broader sense of the word. And she carries her love of dressing up onto the court. “I love fashion, so I shop wherever I travel. For apparel, I like choosing from H&M, Zara and Forever 21. Closer home, I like Arpita Mehta’s couture and a bit of Gauri and Nainika.”
Now, walking the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week Mumbai (the way Dipika did) is one thing and being offered lead roles opposite bona fide movie stars quite another.
Is it true that Dipika has turned down offers opposite ‘mega’ movie stars from Kollywood (as the Tamil film industry, a hybrid of Kodambakkam and Hollywood, is called)?
“Yes, there was one offer opposite Madhavan and another for a Malayalam movie opposite Mohanlal. But I was too young to take a decision and my father said no,” she says.
“Given an opportunity I might work in a Bollywood film, since my Tamil isn’t very good. I would love to work with any of the younger crop of actors such as Arjun Kapoor.”
They might hold forth on movies and fashion, but put them onto a court and the awesome Chennai twosome turn into world-beaters in the gruelling sport that is squash without even breaking into a sweat.
Dipika is looking forward to the day when she will triumph over world No 1 Nicol David of Malaysia and Joshna says beating former number one Rachael Grinham at the Richmond Open was no big deal. “
This whole thing of being Indian and not being able to go out there and beat the best in the world is long gone,” says Joshna.
“Breaking into the top 10 was just one of the goals that my team and I had set for ourselves. But if you have your goal set to be World Number 1, it is just one step towards achieving it. Breaking into the top 10 when you are 20 years old is great. But now, my goal is to be world number one!” declares Dipika.
Long after the racket over the Glasgow and Incheon victories has died down, the spark of interest for squash that the duo has generated amongst youngsters in the country will continue to ignite a thousand sporting dreams.
Deep down, Indian squash’s leading ladies know its chin-up time for the sport. Deepika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa, take a bow.

More Than 10 000 People Fled Myanmar In 2 WeeksOver 100,000 Rohingya Muslims Have Fled Violence In Myanmar: Expert

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — A growing sense of desperation is fueling a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from western Myanmar, with the number who have fled by boat since communal violence broke out two years ago now topping 100,000, a leading expert said Saturday.
Chris Lewa, director of the nonprofit advocacy group Arakan Project, said there has been a huge surge since Oct. 15, with an average of 900 people per day piling into cargo ships parked off Rakhine state.
That's nearly 10,000 in less than two weeks, she noted, one of the biggest spikes yet.
Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 50 million that only recently emerged from half a century of military rule, has an estimated 1.3 million Rohingya. Though many of their families arrived from neighboring Bangladesh generations ago, almost all have been denied citizenship. In the last two years, attacks by Buddhist mobs have left hundreds dead and 140,000 trapped in camps, where they live without access to adequate health care, education or jobs.
Lewa, who has teams monitoring embarkation points, is considered the leading authority on the number of fleeing Rohingya. But boats are now shoving off from more and more places, she said, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of how many are leaving.
"The real number may be higher," Lewa said.
She said some Rohingya families have received phone calls notifying them that ships from the latest exodus have started arriving in neighboring Thailand, where passengers often are brought to jungle camps, facing extortion and beatings until relatives come up with enough money to win their release.
From there they usually travel to Malaysia or other countries, but, still stateless, their futures remain bleak.
In Myanmar, the vast majority live in the northern tip of Rakhine state, where an aggressive campaign by authorities in recent months to register family members and officially categorize them as "Bengalis" — implying they are illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh — has aggravated their situation.
According to villagers contacted by The Associated Press, some were confined to their villages for weeks at a time for refusing to take part in the "verification" process, while others were beaten or arrested.
More recently, dozens of men were detained for having alleged ties to the militant Rohingya Solidarity Organization, or RSO, said Khin Maung Win, a resident from Maungdaw township, adding that several reportedly were beaten or tortured during their arrests or while in detention.
Lewa said three of the men died.
"Our team is becoming more and more convinced that this campaign of arbitrary arrests is aimed at triggering departures," she said.
Rakhine state spokesman Win Myaing denied any knowledge of arrests or abuse.
"There's nothing happening up there," he said. "There are no arrests of suspects of RSO. I haven't heard anything like that."
Every year, the festival of Eid al-Adha, which was celebrated by Muslims worldwide early this month, marks the beginning of a large exodus of Rohingya, in part due to calmer seas but also because it is a chance to spend time with family and friends.
But there seems to be a growing sense of desperation this year, with numbers nearly double from the same period in 2013.
Lewa said a number of Rohingya also were moving overland to Bangladesh and on to India and Nepal.
The United Nations, which has labeled the Rohingya one of the most persecuted religious minorities in the world, earlier this year confirmed figures provided by Lewa about a massive exodus that began after communal violence broke out in June 2012, targeting mainly Rohingya.
With the latest departures, Lewa estimates the total number of fleeing Rohingya to be more than 100,000.
It was not immediately clear where the newest arrivals were landing.

Government plans to fuel up 91K MW of stuck power projectsCoal India
( After clarity on natural…)
NEW DELHI: After clarity on natural gas prices and an ordinance on coal, the government is set to decide on pooling of imported and domestic fuel prices to help stressed power stations with a combined capacity of 91,000 mw generate electricity that's badly needed as India tries to revive its economy. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs is likely to decide on pooling gas and coal prices at its meeting this week, sources said.
The proposals include a bailout package for power plants idling due to scarcity of domestic gas and a plan to meet the needs of coal-based units till 2017. Of the 24,148 mw gas-based projects set up at an investment of about Rs 1,50,000 crore, those that can generate about 16,000 mw aren't running while the rest are operating at sub-optimal levels.
The Supreme Court on September 24 cancelled 204 coal mine allotments of which 59 were to supply power plants with nearly 67,000 mw capacity. The 59 include 20 producing blocks supplying projects of more than 11,000 mw capacity. Plants that can produce another 7,200 mw have stalled as Coal India supplies have dried up.The government had on October 18 raised the price of gas from domestic fields by about 33% to $5.6 per unit from November 1.
Three days later, it said an ordinance would be issued to open coal to commercial mining by private firms and allot captive coal blocks to private companies through eauctions and on a nomination basis to government entities. The government now proposes to supply any additional gas produced in the country in the next four years to power stations along with imported liquefied natural gas. State-run GAIL India will be the pool operator and will supply the fuel to power stations at an average 'pooled' price of domestic and imported gas.
The electricity from the plants will be supplied to power distribution companies at Rs 5.5 per unit. The government also proposes to subsidise firms operating gasbased power stations from the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) made up of a cess collected from coal miners. After much deliberation, the fixed cost of the gas-based plants is planned to be capped at Rs 1.30 per unit of electricity that will allow the operating companies to meet financial obligations and prevent idle projects, totaling an investment of Rs 64,000 crore, from turning into non-performing assets.
The plan includes simplifying procedures for availing customs duty waivers on LNG and scrapping value-added tax and central sales tax collected by states. Gas transporters GAIL India and Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd will be asked to take a 20% cut in pipeline tariff, which will help them improve utilisation of pipelines. GAIL will also be asked to halve its marketing margin to $0.1 per million British thermal unit.
A separate plan to provide longterm coal supplies to developers of power plants that have had their attached coal mines cancelled by the apex court is also likely to be considered by the Union Cabinet this week. The power ministry proposes such supplies to captive block based power projects that have secured debt, placed equipment orders and acquired land.
The proposal will immediately benefit power plants of about 36,000 mw combined capacity that are ready or likely to be commissioned by March 2017. Under the proposal, power plants with a total capacity of 78,000 mw that have signed letters of assurance with Coal India will get 90% of their requirement. Fuel supplies have also been sought for plants that can generate up to 21,000 mw that are set to begin operations after 2017 and have letters of assurance from Coal India.
The ministry has sought 50% fuel supplies from Coal India for projects that do not have letters of assurance from the company but have signed power purchase agreements ( PPAs ) with states. If required, Coal India will supply imported coal to such projects after pooling prices with locally produced coal.

Fare wars hit the road as Uber  Ola woo cust...Taxi fare wars hit the road as Uber, Meru, Ola woo customers

(Taxi service marketplaces…)
BANGALORE: Taxi service marketplaces are giving auto-rickshaw drivers a run for their money, offering almost matching fares in the rough and tumble of the country's vast but unorganised urban commuting sector.
Companies including Uber, Olacabs and Taxiforsure, most of which are flush with venture capital funds, are aggressively dropping rates, catalysing a low-fare revolution in the taxi market. This strategy had started with the entry of San Francisco-based Uber in 2013.
Uber, which had lowered fares in Bangalore by a quarter in August, last week reduced it by another 20% in the city. Close to Diwali, it had slashed fares in Delhi by a fourth. The company attributed the move to increased efficiency in their marketplace, but clarified that the offer is only for a limited period. "The more people ride with Uber, the longer we will be able to sustain low prices,"said Bhavik Rathod, general manager of Uber Bangalore . Uber is backed by Google Ventures and Fidelity Investments, among others.
Olacabs, which last week received a $210-million infusion from Japan's Softbank, has cut the rate for its low-cost segment to Rs 10/km. Bangalore-based TaxiForSure has run aggressive promotional offers, as has radio-taxi operator Meru.
TaxiForSure co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna said demand has increased ever since the discounting started. "For three years, we have not discounted at all. It's only now that we are giving out offers like Rs 1 ride to our customers,"Radhakrishna said. The company is backed by investors, including Accel Partners, Bessemer Venture and Helion Venture. "The game at this point is customer acquisition, and if that means putting in more cash to back the company and win the market, so be it,"said an investor who did not wish to be identified.
Such is the demand that, according to industry executives, taxi companies are unable to accommodate about almost a fifth of potential passengers. But since the longterm strategy for most aggregators is to attract first-time riders and lure more drivers into the system, profitability temporarily takes a backseat in the backdrop of support of investors.
Industry sources estimate that all firms are making a loss of between 20-40% on every ride, but with the support of investors, margin pressures are eased. The strategy is paying off. "We have seen demand go up five times since we cut our prices, with most traction coming from our app,"said Siddhartha Pahwa, CEO, Meru Cabs. Executives at Ola, Uber and TaxiForSure concur.
"A rapid scale-up in demand and supply is resulting in fewer dry runs for drivers, lower wait time for customers, more rides per hour and, hence, higher driver earnings,"said Tarun Davda, VP at Matrix Partners and a board observer at OlaCabs. With the discounting, it's not just consumer demand but also driver income that rises. Since Ola cut rates to Rs 10/km for its mini segment, it claims that average driver revenue has risen by 30%-40%.

Make in India: Fiat plans to manufacture luxury SUVs in the countryTweet
 Production of the C-segment vehicle will begin by the end of 2016, four people close to the development told Economic Times.
MUMBAI: Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted global manufacturers to 'Make in India', Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has put in motion plans to manufacture a premium sports utility vehicle under the Jeep brand as part of a Rs 1,500-2,500 crore investment in the country and export it to key markets including the UK , Australia and South Africa in the next two years.
The development work for the first premium SUV to be made in India has begun under the project code-named M6 or 556 and production of the C-segment vehicle will begin by the end of 2016, four people close to the development told ET, adding that the strategy to use India as an exports hub will help the company reduce its losses in the country. Experts say that Fiat Chrysler's move will further enhance the brand image of India.
The country is gradually transforming itself from a manufacturing hub for small cars into a base for the entire range of vehicles as companies including Renault-Nissan and Volkswagen have exported mid-sized sedans and compact SUVs to global markets from the country. An email sent to Fiat India did not elicit any response. One of the persons referred to earlier, however, said on condition of anonymity that the C-segment Jeep SUV is expected to be priced at Rs 20-25 lakh in the domestic market and will be produced in "tens of thousands".
"The announcement will be made shortly," another person said about the company's investment plans for India. "The company was waiting for the Fiat-Chrysler merger in the global markets. Now that the listing is out of the way, the funds will be channelled into the country." The investment is likely to go into expansion of capacity and Fiat may set up a new manufacturing line at its Ranjangaon plant after discussing the possibilities with its joint venture partner Tata Motors, a person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that a significant part of the investment will go into developing new products including engines.
Apart from the completely localised C-segment Jeep, Fiat Chrysler is also said to be working on a modular platform 326, which will churn out replacements for Punto and Linea cars in the next two to three years under the Fiat brand. However, the Italian carmaker's volumes in the Indian market remain a matter of major concern, according to these people, who said the company is hoping that export volumes along with new models will help the brand make a comeback in the country.
While Fiat announced a major comeback plan for the Indian market two years ago, its protracted merger with American automaker Chrysler kept it from making major investments in India. But now the company is readying to launch the Jeep brand with the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee models next year, followed by the locally produced C-segment Jeep at the end of 2016 or early 2017. Fiat has been selling just 1,000-1,500 units a month on average in India despite the launch of new Linea and Punto and expansion of its dealer network.
Its capacity in Ranjangaon plant is getting utilised by Tata Motors, though, for its Indica, Vista and recently launched Zest models. The move to manufacture a premium SUV signifies that Fiat is recognising the potential of Indian manufacturing, said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at consultancy firm IHS Automotive.
"The future is in India whether it is for domestic market or for export manufacturing. Renault-Nissan, Ford, Hyundai and Maruti all have accepted this fact that manufacturing in India gives strong top and bottom numbers. Exporting a luxury brand from India will definitely be a strong image booster for Indian manufacturing in mature markets, where India always remains popular with small hatchbacks," added Vangaal.

Hardening its stand further, the BJP on Sunday told the Shiv Sena to drop all its unwarranted conditions and unreasonable demands if it wished to participate in the BJP-led government that will take oath of office on October 30.

Vinod Tawde, member of the BJP’s core committee, told media persons that his party would join hands with Sena only if it doesn’t bring any conditions on the table.
“The Sena should join us by heart,” he said, in response to Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar’s statement that the state BJP leaders did not want his party to join the alliance government.
The BJP is all set to form a minority government instead of giving the Sena a big share of cabinet berths and important departments. But Tawde said the numbers were not an issue.
“We can discuss the matter further (if the Sena is serious and unconditional in its approach),” he said, adding that the people of Maharashtra wanted a government that could deliver efficiently.

According to Tawde, the BJP’s legislative party, including members of both houses and members of Parliament would elect their leader on Tuesday. State party president Devendra Fadnavis is the top contender for the post of CM who also enjoys backing from the party brass. His selection would be a mere formality, said sources.
Central observers, union home minister Rajnath Singh, party general secretary (state in-charge) JP Nadda, state poll in-charge OP Mathur and former state in-charge general secretary Rajeev Pratap Rudy will  attend the meeting, to be held from 11 am at the Vidhan Bhavan.
The Sena had earlier sought 14 berths, but later scaled down its demand to 10. However, the BJP is not willing to give Sena more than five berths, said sources.

The country's largest auto maker Tata Motors  has raised USD 750 million from Asian and European investors by selling a dual tranche bond issue which got an over subscription of six times at USD 4.5 billion.
The company has priced the 5.5-year benchmark senior unsecured notes of USD 500 million at 4.625 percent, while the coupon for the 10-year USD 250 million notes is fixed at 5.750 percent per annum.
It had sold USD 300 million worth bonds in April at a coupon of 5.53 percent for a five-year money, indicating better operating environment for the company.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to refinance external commercial borrowings, capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes, the company said in a statement.
"We are pleased to have completed this transaction successfully and we thank the investors for demonstrating their confidence in us," said Vijay Somaiya, vice-president for finance and head of treasury & investor relations at Tata Motors.

Global rating agency Standard & Poors has assigned BB long-term issue rating to the issue while highlighting Tata Motors' increased dependence on JLR, while rival Moody's has assigned Ba2 to the notes with a stable outlook.
"The ratings on Tata Motors reflect the company's small size and narrow product suite compared with many global peers', and its likely negative free operating cash flows because of high capital expenditure. JLR's established and improving market position in the global premium automotive segment and its strong operating performance temper these weaknesses," S&P said.
S&P further said it believes that the good operating performance of JLR, if sustained, can improve its consolidated financial strength.
Moody's also based the ratings to the continuing good show by its British arm JLR which has contributed over 90 per cent of group operating profit in FY14. "The phenomenal success of JLR continues to buy time for Tata Motors' weak domestic operations to turn around, and these are now showing some improvement."
The stable outlook on the bond reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core domestic business of the company to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating, Moody's said.
However, Moody's added that the current fiscal is critical as JLR's sales slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations.
Tata Motors is likely to list the benchmark issue on the Singapore exchange, according to merchant banking sources who worked on the issue. They added that Asian investors dominated the 5.5-year issue cornering 61 per cent, while the 10-year issue was lapped up by European and West Asian investors cornered 78 percent.
Mutual funds have reportedly bought close to 70 percent of the 5.5 year bond and also bought 50 per cent of the 10-year bonds; insurers bought 40 percent of the 10-year bonds, said sources at i-bankers which included ANZ Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and StanChart.
Tata Motors had a consolidated revenue of Rs 2,32,834 crore or USD 38.9 billion in 2013-14. Through subsidiaries and associate companies, it operates in Britain, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.
Tata Motors stock price
On December 05, 2014, Tata Motors closed at Rs 524.80, down Rs 3.1, or 0.59 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 550.80 and the 52-week low was Rs 331.05.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 59.58 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 8.81.

Air passengers  body AIPA asks DGCA to stop low fare schemesAir passengers' body AIPA urges DGCA to stop low air fare schemes
IANS     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 13:39 IST

Describing the frequent special discount fare offers by domestic carriers as "non-existent", the Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday urged regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to permit such schemes.
"We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger," APAI president D Sidhakara Reddy said in a communication to the DGCA.
In the latest instance over the last few weeks, budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday launched its 'Diwali Dhamaka' sale , with one-way fares starting as low as Rs.899 (including taxes).
According to the company, tickets can be booked October 21-26, 2014 for travel between November 1 to December 15, 2014.
" SpiceJet has fundamentally changed the air travel paradigm in India this year, with offers that are frequent and often lower than train fares," chief operating officer Sanjiv Kapoor said announcing the scheme.
"We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline's portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings," Reddy said.
Pointing out that it has become routine by airlines to announce such schemes almost once every 10-15 days, their aim appears to achieve cheap publicity for the airline, APAI said.
The association asked the regulator whether the carriers inform about the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with the DGCA showing the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered under the bucket pricing method.
"If they are not, then what action do you propose for not following the procedure?" APAI asked in its letter.
Reddy also said the association would explore the Right to Information (RTI) route if the DGCA did not respond in the matter.

Dilma Rousseff becomes Brazils new President for secondtermPrint

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

NEW DELHI: A cyclonic storm hurtling towards the north Gujarat coast is expected to make its landfall on October 31 morning with a sustained wind speed of 90-100 kilometres per hour at its centre, gusting to 110 km per hour.
The storm, named Nilofar, on October 26 lay centred over 1,270 km southwest of Mumbai and 910 km east-southeast of Salalah in Oman.
The cyclone will take the form of a severe cyclonic storm by October 31 before it makes the landfall, according to the met department, which said the cyclone will initially move north-northwestwards during the next 48 hours and then move northeastwards towards north Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coast in the subsequent 72 hours.
"It will intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. The cyclone will intensify over the Arabian Sea but while crossing the coast its intensity will be weakened," said Mrutunjay Mohapatra , chief of India Meteorological Department's cyclone warning division, adding that the department will specify the place of landfall in the next few days.
In recent years, when cyclone Phet headed towards northwest India in June 2010, it made landfall in Oman and then in Pakistan, said Mohapatra.
The met department officials said that they have issued distant warning to all ports and pre-cyclone watch to Gujarat government officials. "Only after the cyclone is 500 km from the Gujarat coast we will issue specific warning for fisherman, oil and gas companies and ports etc," said Manorama Mohanty, meteorologist at the met department in Ahmedabad.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on Sunday was charting the path of cyclone towards Oman and then recurvature by Thursday towards northeast towards Gujarat coast.
The cyclone has been named Nilofar by Pakistan, one of the eight countries the IMD issues cyclone advisories to.
Maximum and minimum temperatures will fall 2-3°C over northwest and adjoining central India during the next two-three days, as per the met department.
October and November are peak months for development of cyclones over Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
India gets five cyclones a year on average over Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. There have been two cyclones so far this year - the Nanauk in June and Hudhud in October.

Gold struggles as equities hurt safe-haven appeal
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the U.S. central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.

Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and U.S. economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks at the weekend were received calmly in the market.
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the U.S. central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.
"In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion," Gan said.
Spot gold was steady at USD 1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn't far from a one-week low of USD 1,226.17 reached last week.
The metal's losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the U.S. dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new U.S. home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain's economy expanded 0.7 percent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown. Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher.
Bullion traders were also closely watching investors' positions in gold funds. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 percent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the price of the precious metal rallied in the week up to Oct. 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

Top-level exits hinder growth plans of several startupscountry manager
(In July 2014, Alok Jain, CMO of…)
MUMBAI: A talent flux at the top may hinder aggressive growth plans at many cash-rich startups as many new ventures are grappling with exits of CXO-level talent. At least a dozen startups, including Myntra, Commonfloor, Housing.com, Zomato, Yebhi and Olacabs, have lost senior leaders around a year — or even less — after their joining. Reasons for the exits range from executives launching their own ventures, joining other startups, going back to a regular corporate job, taking abreak or even a clash in working styles with the founder/s.
The movements over the past few months represent a growing trend — shorter-than-usual stints for many C-level executives — in a sector that is seeing explosive growth, with a record billion dollars-plus in capital raised during January-September alone. While short stints, especially at the senior most levels, are generally frowned upon in traditional companies, they are seen as par for the course in India's nascent and rapidly evolving digital space. "This is part and parcel of the evolution of the economy and emergence of tech as an industry," says Sandeep Murthy, partner at venture capital firm Lightbox Ventures.
In July 2014, Alok Jain, CMO of online restaurant guide Zomato, left the organisation 10 months after joining to launch his own venture Yumist in the food space. Prior to joining Zomato, his stint at online coupons site DealsAndYou also lasted just about five months.
Wharton School of Business grad Richa Bansal joined real estate portal Housing.com as chief business officer in September last year. She left the organisation a couple of months ago.
Richa Bansal, co-founder and managing director of online jewellery and fashion accessories retailer 21Diamonds.in, quit Housing.com for "personal reasons", according to Advitiya Sharma, co-founder of Housing.com. When contacted, Bansal, who said she is now working on another venture, declined to share the reasons behind her exit.Sujal Shah, who joined as senior-VP and head of fashion at online fashion retailer Myntra in August this year, stayed on for just 10 days before putting in his papers.
He refused to comment on specific reasons for leaving, but said they were significant enough for him to disengage quickly.
Even some executives who had quit high-profile companies to join startups have walked out since. Vikas Ahuja, former country manager (new businesses) at Nestle India, joined Myntra as the chief marketing officer, only to quit 13 months later in end-August. "My family is based out of Gurgaon and shuttling up and down was taking up too much time. Right now, I'm taking a sabbatical," said Ahuja.
Nikhil Rungta, who was CMO at Google India for three years, later worked at Yebhi as chief business officer and marketing head for only a year before taking up an offer from Reliance Jio in March as CMO (hi-speed broadband, fibre-tothe-home and digital services).Other such executives have moved on, but within this space itself. LK Gupta, who in early 2013 joined as CMO of RedBus after a five-and-a-half year stint in LG Electronics India, joined Girnar Soft as CMO in May 2014.
  Anuj Roy, partner, digital practice, at executive search firm Transearch says that as the leadership teams in digital space are being built from adjacent sectors, there is an increasing trend that past accomplishments may not guarantee success in a new role. The ability to assess potential to succeed in a new environment is becoming a critical component of leadership hiring in early and growth-stage companies, he feels. "Short stints aren't taboo in startups as people are aware of the style of functioning of founders or business challenges in startups. It becomes a challenge when there are more than two such changes on the CV," he says.So far, the people who are quitting their jobs are finding no dearth of takers. IIM-Bangalore grad Satyendra K Dwivedi, who came on board as VP-engineering at mycity4kids.com in January this year, quit barely 7 months later in July to join travel and holiday information portal HolidayIQ in the same role in August. Similarly, Shikhar Mohan, VP and head-marketing at Commonfloor, left in February — barely after a year on the job — for OneyearMBA. co.in as chief marketing officer.
Sumit Jain, co-founder & CEO of Commonfloor. com, says that while they do look for a strong match during the screening process, there are times when there is a mismatch either in terms of what the organisation expects from a hire or vice versa. "People move on then," he says.A senior executive who declined to be quoted said there are many reasons why people move on sooner than expected. "Often senior executives are painted one picture when recruited, but see a different picture after joining. Some may leave quickly because they are underutilised and not able to grow," he said.
Investors are pumping in plenty of money into startups. Some of it, industry sources say, is being used wisely to hire talent; some, not so wisely. Krishnan Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and chairman of Portea Medical, has his own take. "We have observed consistently in our startups that have scaled very fast such as TutorVista, Bigbasket and Portea Medical that it takes new and different skill sets to handle such aggressive and massive scaling — agility, willingness to learn fast and take mid-course action.
This is not everyone's cup of tea. The culture fitment is also an issue sometimes and flat structures and use of technology, smartphones and data to run the business needs some adjusting which senior managers find difficult," says Ganesh, who along with wife Meena has a 100% success rate in terms of the startups they have been involved in.

Someone Drove Through The Disputed Oklahoma Ten Commandments Monument And Smashed It To Piecesreddit
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Someone drove up a ramp near the Oklahoma Capitol steps overnight and into a disputed granite monument of the Ten Commandments, smashing it to pieces in an apparent act of vandalism, authorities said.
Oklahoma Highway Patrol Capt. George Brown said the person abandoned the car and fled the scene after destroying the monument Thursday night, and that investigators are searching the sedan for clues. He said he didn't know if there were any witnesses, but that investigators are reviewing security video.
The 6-foot-tall monument was erected in 2012 with the blessing of Oklahoma's conservative Legislature. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma has been suing to have it removed, arguing that it violates the state constitution and could be seen as a state endorsement of a religion.
"We consider this an act of violence against the state of Oklahoma," said Republican state Rep. Mike Ritze, of Broken Arrow, whose family spent nearly $10,000 having the monument erected. "We are obviously shocked and dismayed, but we're not discouraged," he said, vowing to have it rebuilt.
Gov. Mary Fallin called it an "appalling" act of vandalism and volunteered to help raise private funds to restore it.
The ACLU sued on behalf of a Norman minister and others who allege the monument's location violates the state constitution's ban on using public property to support "any sect, church, denomination or system of religion."
A judge ruled last month that the monument does not violate the state constitution, and ACLU attorneys filed an appeal with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Ryan Kiesel, the ACLU of Oklahoma's executive director, said he and his clients are "outraged" that the monument was vandalized.
"To see the Ten Commandments desecrated by vandals is highly offensive to them as people of faith," Kiesel said.
The monument's placement has led others to seek their own on the Capitol grounds, including a satanic group that earlier this year unveiled designs for a 7-foot-tall statue of Satan. Other requests have been made from a Hindu leader in Nevada and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
It is appalling that this monument was attacked. Those who committed this crime will be caught & held responsible pic.twitter.com/SkYiyUwO8W

Startups engineer salary hike for freshers, bring cheer to upcoming joinees

(TCS, which has hired around…)
MUMBAI: Starting salaries for fresh engineering graduates stagnant in the Rs 3.5 to Rs 4.5 lakh band for 5-8 years are showing signs of going up, bringing cheer to the roughly 1.5-million students graduating next year.
One reason: e-commerce companies and other startups are stepping up hiring and offering better salaries, forcing mass IT recruiters to increase starting pay packages. TCS, which has hired around 25,000 students from campus in FY15 and will recruit 36,000 in FY16, may be the first to start offering more. "We are definitely looking at it, but at this point, I can't disclose whether we are raising it or not," said Ajoy Mukherjee, executive vice-president and head, global human resources for TCS. The firm introduced city allowances for its campus recruits and trainees last year for the first time and will offer them this year, too.
Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice-president for Nasscom , said, "Different IT companies are evaluating the increased competition from players like e-commerce and may need to relook at salaries."
Infosys and HCL declined to comment. Mid-tier companies, who, too, haven't increased starting salaries at campuses for years, are also taking a re-look. "Fresher salaries should definitely go up this year," said Anand Deshpande, CEO , Persistent Systems. Competition with start-ups for engineering talent is one of the reasons. "A lot of the freshers are mostly salary-driven (in their choice of employer)," he said. Persistent's average offer for freshers over the last few years was Rs 3.75 lakh.
Engineering colleges say mass recruiters like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Accenture offer between Rs 3.5 lakh and Rs4.5 lakh for an engineer , and this amount has not changed much in the last 5-8 years. Only specialised units of these IT majors like R&D offer higher compensation. Placement cells of top colleges have noted a dip in acceptance rates of offers made by these large IT recruiters, primarily because of low salaries. "The number of students opting for mass recruiters paying Rs4 lakh salary has fallen. Salary plays an important role in decision-making and many are opting for IT profiles offered by core firms and e-commerce companies this year," said one of the placement team members of NITK, Surathkal.
In stark contrast, startups offer salaries up to Rs 8 lakh, and in some cases, even up to Rs 12-15 lakh. A placement team member from one of the campuses of Birla Institute of Technology said that TCS, Accenture and Wipro recruit at least 500 students out of a batch of 2,100; but just 30-40% of offers they make are accepted. "IT companies say salaries remain unchanged because they have to battle high operation and training costs, along with attrition at the junior-most levels," said the BIT campus placement team member who did not wish to be named. "IT companies offer a sense of job security, but that alone (without adequate pay) is no longer enough," he said.
The placement seasons at non-IITs, where IT companies make a bulk of their hires, started in September.
NIT Warangal's placement team also held talks with large recruiters over salaries given at campus placements. Infosys recruited more than 100 from the college this year, but did not increase salary, according to a placement team member.
Starting salaries may not go up too much too fast. "Startups do not have the numbers advantage because they hire comparatively low numbers," PK Sharma, head - resource management group, at Tech Mahindra said. "In the long run, colleges will need support of the big players."

See Where Most Indian Billionaires StudiedIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
University of Mumbai is the only university outside the US to have the most number of billionaire graduates, according to this year's Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census.
The Indian university is ahead of prestigious institutes like the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), New York University (NYU), Columbia University, in terms of producing billionaires according to the survey.
"With 12 billionaire alumni, India's University of Mumbai has the most billionaire graduates of any university based outside the US. The London School of Economics and Political Science in the United Kingdom, Lomonosov Moscow State University and ETH Zurich in Switzerland are other schools outside the US that made it to the top 20 billionaire schools list," Wealth-X said.
University of Pennsylvania topped the list of '20 Schools That Produce The World's Billionaires' with 25 billionaires as part of its alma mater.
Harvard University with 22 billionaire alumni came in at second spot, followed by Yale University that boasts of 22 billionaires from its list of graduates.
The list is dominated by US universities with 16 of them making it to the top 20. ( See Full List )
However, the study also shows that higher education is not a prerequisite to achieving billionaire status as 35 per cent of the 2,325 billionaires in the world have not obtained a tertiary-level degree. Notable university dropouts include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Both walked out of Harvard during their undergraduate years to start their businesses.
Among the billionaires who hold a tertiary-level degree, 42 per cent graduated with a bachelor's degree, 26 per cent have a master's degree, 21 per cent finished their MBA, and 11 per cent attained a PhD, the survey revealed.

Government Likely to Strike Deal With Vietnam for Oil Exploration
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 25, 2014 20:38 (IST)
Iron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: Looking to deepen its economic ties with Vietnam, India is likely to strike a deal for exploration and production of oil and gas during the visit of the South East Asian nation's Prime Minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, on October 27.
Ahead of its Prime Minister's two-day visit here, Vietnam has also evinced keen interest in greater cooperation in key areas of defence, security and oil exploration and has hoped that some pacts will be signed during the trip.
"We are looking at enhancing India's cooperation in the fields of hydrocarbons and oil exploration," Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told PTI.
India is also looking at possibilities of tie-ups in the refinery and pipeline sector of Vietnam, he added.
He said he interacted with Vietnamese authorities on further cooperation in the oil sector during President Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Vietnam in September and wants this cooperation to be taken further.
"We are exploring more options to further our cooperation with Vietnam in the oil sector," he said, hinting at further talks and some possible tie-ups during the Vietnam Prime Minister's visit.
During Mr Mukherjee's visit in September, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had signed an agreement to expand its oil and gas exploration in offshore Vietnam.
The Indian flagship firm agreed to consider exploring in 2-3 blocks out of the 5 areas in South China Sea that Vietnam had offered on nomination basis in November last year. The five blocks or areas - 17, 41, 43, 10 & 11-1 and 102&106/10, offered in November last year lie outside the territory claimed by China in the South China Sea.
OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration license for Block 06.1. The company got two exploration blocks - Block 127 and Block 128, in 2006. However, Block 127 was relinquished after completing the work programme, and the other block - Block 128 - is currently under exploration.
Additionally, ONGC Videsh and PetroVietnam have been engaged in further discussions for possible expansion of cooperation in hydrocarbon sector of Vietnam.
OVL had relinquished Block 127 in offshore Phu Khanh Basin after it failed to find any oil or gas in the area. Though it had decided to withdraw from adjacent Block 128, it has decided to stay put because of India's strategic interests in the region. The exploration period for the block has been extended until June 15, 2015.
China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where Block 127 and 128 are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region.
OVL continues to own 45 per cent in Vietnam's offshore block 6.1 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate.
During his visit, Tan will be accompanied by a delegation of a number of businessmen who will hold talks with the top Indian leadership on strategically-important bilateral issues of security and energy as well as regional matters.

DLF Ban: MFs Say Sebi Should Not Enforce All Its Rules on ThemAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: As DLF is unable to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 2,500 crore in view of Sebi's ban on the largest builder in a case pertaining to its IPO in 2007, MFs have said that the capital market regulator should not enforce all its rules on them.
"As a sectoral regulator, Sebi happens to be the regulator of mutual fund houses as well. But whatever decision are taken by Sebi on capital markets shouldn't be enforced on mutual funds," chief executive of a mutual fund house told PTI requesting anonymity.
It can be noted that Sebi on October 13 banned DLF, its founder chairman S P Singh and five other senior officials associated with the said company from accessing the capital market for three years for not disclosing some details about three of its 357 associate companies during the 2007 IPO of the company which had raised over Rs 9,700 crore from the primary markets.
The country's largest realtor on October 22 challenged the ban in the Securities Appellate Tribunal and had sought interim relief to redeem MFs worth Rs 2,500 crore and also to launch a Rs 5,000-crore domestic debt sale. The tribunal will hear the matter on October 30.
Proxy advisory firms also want clarity from Sebi on the issue. "Until SAT overturns the Sebi ban or orders interim relief to DLF, the regulator's order stands for MF houses," Institutional Investor Advisory Services chief operating officer Hetal Dalal said.
DLF is not allowed to deal in securities as MF units are treated as securities, she added.
Meanwhile, the MFs' umbrella body the Association of Mutual Funds In India (AMFI) has sent an advisory note to the members in this connection indicating that Sebi ban does not include redemption of funds by DLF.
"Mutual fund units are securities within the meaning/ definition of securities. Hence, prima facie, the Sebi order seems to be applicable to MF units too.
"However, the purchase/redemption of units cannot be equated to accessing the securities market by the specified entity/persons against whom the order has been passed, which seems to be the intention of the Sebi order, since all MF units are not listed and therefore, not traded on the exchanges and units of open-ended schemes are subscribed to and redeemed on a daily basis," AMFI executive Vice-President Balkrishna Kini said in a letter dated October 16 to the members.

UK ends 13-year war in AfghanistanBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 26, 2014 6:17 pm
The UK on Sunday handed over its last base in Afghanistan to the Afghan forces, marking an official end to the 13-year-long combat operations that claimed over 450 British lives in the war-torn country.
“It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future,” UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said.
The Union Jack was lowered at a ceremony in Camp Bastion in Helmand province, bringing an end to the 13-year war in Afghanistan that has claimed 453 British servicemen and women’s lives.
All British troops will leave Camp Bastion within days, handing over the huge base to Afghan troops.
“Our armed forces’ tremendous sacrifice laid the foundations for a strong Afghan security force, set the security context that enabled the first democratic transition of power in the country’s history, and stopped it being a launch pad for terrorist attacks in the UK,” Fallon added.
Camp Bastion has been the British troops’ main Afghan base since 2006.
The last US Marines unit in Afghanistan also ended its combat operations with the handover of nearby Camp Leatherneck. The US has lost 2,349 personnel in Afghanistan.
Thousands of soldiers have returned to Britain in recent months, leaving only a few hundred members of the Armed Forces operating in the country. Tonnes of equipment have been repatriated, to meet the deadline of ending combat operations by the end of 2014.
A few dozen British military personnel will remain in Kabul to operate an officer training facility nicknamed ‘Sandhurst-in-the-Sand,’ as part of the continued support of the Afghan people. Special forces will continue to operate in the region.
Chief of the General Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter told the ‘Sunday Telegraph’ the handover of Camp Bastion would be significant “not least because of the sacrifice that so many people have made in Helmand”.
“They are going to have challenges, but I am absolutely confident that the majority of the population in central Helmand will be secured by Afghan forces,” he said.
As the American-led forces pull out of bases across Afghanistan, they have faced attack after attack, with some ground attacks being launched on the day of departure.
Some security experts believe that the Taliban is trying to establish their superiority as soon as coalition forces depart.
The Taliban have carried out a series of operations in Helmand this summer, attacking in areas such as Sangin and Nad-e Ali, where British soldiers spent months battling to maintain control.

Minister expresses concern over fishing policyMinister expresses concern over fishing policy

K Babu, Minister for Fisheries, Kerala Govt
Kochi Oct 26:  
Kerala Fisheries Minister K.Babu has expressed concern over the deep sea fishing policy report, saying that ‘it is harmful to traditional fisher folk in the country’.
The suggestions in the report prepared by the B.Meenakumari Commission would badly affect the lives of fishermen. He said that new policies of the Union Government would destroy the fisheries sector and the State Government would convey its concern to the Centre shortly.
The Minister was speaking after laying the foundation stone for setting up of an Ocean Studies Campus of Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) at Puthuvypeen.
Emphasising the need for serious research on climate change, global warming, cyclones etc, the Minister hoped that the proposed Ocean Studies Campus of KUFOS would provide adequate human resources in the sector to address these problems. The campus would be made a centre of excellence in ocean studies, with international standards.
Inaugurating a one-day workshop for shrimp farmers, K V Thomas MP said that Vanammei shrimp culture would uplift living standards of fish farmers.

Telangana Budget session to commence from Nov 5Telangana Budget session to commence from Nov 5
V.Rishi Kumar
DIPR Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao
Hyderabad, Oct. 25:  
The maiden budget session of the Telangana Assembly to be convened from November 5 will provide an opportunity for the K Chandrasekhar Rao Government to outline the development agenda amidst several contentious inter-State issues.
A decision to convene the Assembly was finalised during late on Friday evening.
The session being held after couple of postponements is also likely to be stormy as it comes at time when the two new states of Telangana and residual Andhra Pradesh have several inter-State issues that need to be resolved. Both the States do not see eye to eye on many issues, particularly sharing of power and water resources, fee reimbursement for students among various other concerns.
The State Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had constituted 14 task force teams to facilitate the budget making process with the objective of outlining the Government agenda for the next five years rather than drafting a Budget for the remaining part of the year.
The interim Budget to be presented by the Finance Minister Etela Rajender will be first budget for the new State. Thus far, the Budget allocations have been based on vote-on-account passed by the unified Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly before the general elections and the bifurcation of the State.
During the recent Finance Commission meetings, the State has indicated the tax collections so far have not been as per initial projections post the division. There is also growing concern about small and medium companies registering their offices in AP, leading to loss of tax collection.
The opposition parties, the Congress, Telugu Desam Party are seeking to corner the Government particularly with regard to severe power crisis the State is faced with. The opposition is gearing up to expose the State in the way it has handled the farm sector issues and supply of power where industries are faced with two day power holiday per week and domestic and commercial consumers are faced with huge power cuts.
Among other issues that are likely to be taken up during the Budget session include the crop loan waiver estimated to be about Rs 20,000 crore. The task force teams have come up with their suggestions to ensure inclusive growth by taking the feedback from the grassroot level.
While the session focus would be on budget and its proposals, the issues of power and water sharing between the two states will be among key areas where the opposition parties would like to corner the treasury benches.

When Apple iPhones ring, the US economy listens

(Since Sept. 19, when the…)
By Jeff Sommer
Since Sept. 19, when the iPhone 6 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus, went on sale, consumers have been ordering the gadgets faster than Apple can deliver them. The ripple effects are being felt throughout the economy, and these phones have been moving the stock market. "The iPhone is having a measurable impact," said Michael Feroli, chief US economist for JPMorgan Chase. "It's a little gadget, but it costs a lot, and it seems that everybody has one. When you do the multiplication, it's going to matter."
He estimates that iPhone sales are adding one-quarter to onethird of a percentage point to the annualized growth rate of the gross domestic product. You may not think of the iPhone as a financial powerhouse. After all, it's just a consumer good - albeit a highly functional, high-end one that you can carry in your pocket or your purse. Sales typically surge every two years when, as now, Apple does a major iPhone upgrade. You may have the warm and personal relationship with the iPhone that Timothy Cook, Apple's chief executive, described on Monday to Wall Street analysts during a conference call. Apple's next three months will be "incredibly strong," he said.
And he spoke enthusiastically about the principal reason for this performance: "These iPhones are the best we have ever created, and customers absolutely love them."
Whether you love them or not, though, it's a good moment to recognize their significance as a financial force. The iPhone's financial impact starts,of course, with Apple, which is reaping enormous profit from it. As the company disclosed in data embedded in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Apple has been selling a broad mix of iPhone models at an average price of $603.
That's not remotely close to the "starting price of $199" that Apple advertises. The full price is embedded in service agreements that many customers in the United States reach with phone carriers. And many of those carriers are stating that full price quite openly. The real starting price for a new, basic iPhone is $649, and models with more memory and bigger screens cost much more. This price structure is lucrative for Apple.
"The cost of building a basic phone has stayed at about $200 for years," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director for cost benchmarking services, at IHS Technology. That estimate doesn't include many expenses, like research and marketing costs. But it's a rough guidepost, and it helps explain how, as Apple disclosed in a court filing two years ago, its profit margins for the iPhone are roughly double those for iPads, which tend to be priced more cheaply. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, says the gross profit margin for the iPhone is close to 50 percent.
Because the iPhone is Apple's most popular product - with more than 39 million sold in the last quarter - it accounts for a disproportionately large percentage of Apple's overall profit, somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent, Sacconaghi said. "Apple is now so big that it takes a lot to make it grow appreciably," Sacconaghi said. Apple is producing an impressive, interrelated ecosystem of products and services, including its forthcoming digital watches, its new digital payment system, its revived Mac line, refreshed iPads and new software operating systems.
Even if all of its ventures succeed, none are likely in the next year or two to rival the financial impact of the iPhone. "The iPhone is the core of Apple right now," he said. In a sense, the iPhone is the core of the stock market, as well. Apple is the biggest company, by market capitalization, in the world. Apple accounts for about 3.5 per cent of the weighting of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. And, through Thursday, because its stock has performed magnificently while the overall market has not, Apple accounted for 18 per cent of the entire rise of the Standard & Poor's 500 index this year, according to calculations by Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. And the engine driving Apple shares is the iPhone.
 
"The market is obviously counting on another strong sales performance for the new iPhone," he said. So far, it's getting that performance. And, he said, Apple's invigorating effect is likely to continue. Because the iPhone is made mainly overseas and sold worldwide, it is stimulating the economy in other regions, particular in East Asia, Feroli observed, and it keeps a substantial amount of its cash abroad. Such factors make it harder to assess the company's impact domestically. "It's not like GM having a great quarter," Feroli said. "It doesn't translate directly into employment in the United States. It's a more complex world today, and, in that sense, Apple is representative of that world."

Online retailers report surge in sales this ...Amazon
(During the Big Billion Day, Flipkart’s biggest…)
BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: This Diwali, Indian online retail industry joined the mainstream with the top three players Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal hogging the limelight throughout the festive month of October, helped by massive sales and high-octane marketing. However, the heavy-duty sales with discounts of over 75% also exposed the industry's weakest link — last mile delivery.
Logistics infrastructure of online retailers struggled to deal with the sudden rise in the flow of shipments, leading to pile-ups at airports and packages failing to reach customers on time. "Online retailing has become mainstream this festival season," said Mukesh Bansal, board member at Flipkart.
"A large number of customers have come online. This has been a record month for us with the highest sales ever," said Mukesh Bansal of Flipkart. He declined to reveal the exact number of orders the Bangalore-based company had received.
Bansal, who heads fashion at the company, admitted that there were problems too. "We all found out that the capacity of the logistics network is not enough for the industry," he said. However, with top companies exceeding their targets, experts said the positives far outweighed all the negatives. "The online retail industry is the winner this season with all companies beating their own internal targets," said Saurabh Srivastava, director at advisory firm PwC India. Flipkart, for example, was targeting $3 billion (over Rs 18,300 crore) in overall value of goods sold by end of the fiscal and $4 billion (over Rs 24,500 crore) by mid-2015.
"They are now targeting to reach $4 billion by end of this fiscal itself," said a person with knowledge of the company's sales. Another person in the know said, "Flipkart has already seen over 80 lakh orders this month and is targeting to do about double next month." In June last year, Flipkart's peak sale was 1.3 lakh orders in one day.
During the Big Billion Day, Flipkart's biggest sales event on October 6, the company sold 20 lakh products worth about $100 million (over Rs 600 crore). Rivals Snapdeal and Amazon have been equally impressive.
"We received daily orders of about three lakh," said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior vice-president of marketing at Snapdeal. He said sales in October have more than doubled from September, and the company saw 250% growth month-on-month. "There was massive adoption of online shopping by the country's consumers, which in turn, saw ecommerce in India growing by almost 200-300% over the past few months, with Snapdeal growing at about 600%," Komaravelly said.
Industry insiders expect Snapdeal to touch gross merchandise sales of over Rs 700 crore in October, significantly higher than its sales of Rs 450-500 crore over the preceding three months. The company has crossed $1 billion (over Rs 6,000 crore) in sales this fiscal. Amazon India has seen over-fourfold jump in transactions, according to a person with knowledge of the company's sales.
The company saw a jump in traffic of up to 300% on various days during its 30-day festive season sales. "The response has been beyond our wildest expectations," said Amit Agarwal, country manager and vice-president at Amazon India. Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory Technopak, said, "I don't see a single clear winner among the top three. The growth overall has been spectacular. The aggression shown by them has ensured accelerated growth."
 
The aggression was in the form of highly visible advertisements and brand promotions. Ecommerce companies are estimated to have spent about Rs 200 crore on advertising just this festive season. Snapdeal alone got on board 28 celebrities and created 50 advertisement films. The company had blocked up to 2,000 ad spots a day across television channels. A senior executive at a logistics firm said, "Average shipments per day were at about 1 million before the festive season for the industry and that has almost doubled." The online retail boom was not a big-city phenomenon. "The small locations have seen big volumes. We are fulfilling about 200 orders a day in a small centre like Theni," said TA Krishnan, chief executive of ecommerce-focused logistics firm Ecom Express.
Flipkart said it now reaches about 1,000 cities and towns in India through its in-house logistics team and third-party partners, compared with under 900 before October. Amazon, which did not share the exact amount of sales during the month, said over half of all orders were from non-metros. But the problems in the industry were also brought into sharp focus this season. Delay in delivery, choked airports and increased focus by tax authorities were just some of the troubles that may continue to hobble the rapidly growing sector for some time.

Right to service to top Fadnavis  agenda | Sainiks upset as Sena bends for tie-upBJP
( Early this week, possibly…)
MUMBAI: Early this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday, newly elected BJP MLAs will choose their leader, the next chief minister of Maharashtra . And if that be 44-year-old Devendra Fadnavis — as is widely expected — the state could see a new 'right to service' that would enable citizens to avail public services in a timebound, transparent manner. As for India's financial capital, Mumbai, the presumptive CM plans to build Japanese-style elevated corridors to ease traffic and a refashioned police force that would not "tolerate intolerance".
All this and more form part of a 'mahaan rashtra' plan as envisaged by Fadnavis that he shared with ETa few hours before the first assembly election results started trickling in from counting centres. The management graduate said his party's focus would be on delivering good governance by making institutions accountable for the services they are supposed to provide.
"In the past 15 years, government institutions have weakened across the state. Our job will be to first strengthen them. The state is witnessing policy paralysis now... To make it an efficient service provider, we will have to start by changing governance, by fighting corruption that has entered every level of government institutions," he said.
Fadnavis said people were being made to run from pillar to post for even basic services which are their right. "What we will give people is the 'right to service', which will include the right to avail it (services) in a stipulated time.
Every government institution will be asked to take every service seriously and feedback will be monitored at every stage," he said. There will be strict measures to curb corruption at every level, he added. "People are angry because they need to shell out money at every stage to make things happen. This is not right. No government official can deny services to the people. The only way to get there is to make all services transparent and available online," he said.
"We need brisk procedures and effective offices for clearance of files after studying them in detail," Fadnavis said, adding that he will prioritise affordable public housing in the state without compromising on environmental clearances. On his vision to make Mumbai a world-class city, he said he would look at improving infrastructure. "We need elevated corridors in the city to fight traffic jams. If a country like Japan can look at 8-storeyed corridors, we can certainly look at one. That will reduce traffic jams and make travel around the city easier," he added.
He said the government would follow an integrated approach towards transport that includes developing marine as well as land transport. "We will look at advanced technologies on coastal lines even as we look at improving our metro lines." The low crime conviction rate is a cause for worry, said Fadnavis.

DLF slips over 6% on reports of probe by BJPAnil Vij
(Senior cabinet minister…)
MUMBAI: Shares of realty giant DLF slumped over 8 per cent today, wiping-out Rs 1,674.7 crore from its market value, on concerns that the company may face probe by the new government in Haryana.
DLF's scrip plunged 7.84 per cent to settle at Rs 110.50 on the BSE. During the day, it tumbled 9 per cent to Rs 109.10.
At the NSE, it slumped 8.30 per cent to close the day at Rs 110.
Led by the dip in the stock, the company's market value fell by Rs 1,674.7 crore to Rs 19,690.30 crore.
The fall in DLF shares, to as low as Rs 109.10 in intra-day trade at the BSE, follows a major plunge of 28 per cent in a single day earlier this month after a Sebi order barred the company and six others from accessing the capital markets for three years.
The Sebi order has been challenged by DLF before the Securities Appellate Tribunal which would next hear the case on October 30.
While the stock had recovered some lost ground last week after being hit by Sebi order, it fell further today after reports suggested that it may face probe in Haryana.
Hours after taking oath, two new ministers in Haryana yesterday said the BJP government would order a thorough probe into the alleged land scams and not spare anyone, even Robert Vadra or former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda .
DLF has a significant presence in Haryana and is credited with creation of India's largest township set up by a private player in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital.
Notably, BJP and other parties had in the run up to the assembly polls attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal.
There have been reports about alleged irregularities in land dealings between Robert Vadra and DLF.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi while campaigning for BJP in Haryana had also kept the alleged land scams in the state at the centre of his attack.
The new ministers' remarks, however, drew sharp reactions from the Congress, which said that such statements show the arrogance of Haryana government.

Though CM  I am afraid of taking decisions for fear of scrutiny: Bihar CM Jeetan RamManjhiBihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 28, 2014 2:45 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 2:49 am
Further stepping pressure on JD (U) leadership to “reinstate faith in his leadership amidst volley of recent criticism”, Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi seemed to take dig at top party leadership as he said that though he was “CM but is afraid of taking hard decisions for fear of scrutiny”. Manjhi, who looks bent on consolidating his position as an independent leader, took an indirect dig at his political detractors by “hoping that next chief minister also comes from Gaya”. Manjhi belongs to Mahkar village of Gaya.
Speaking at a village school function at Manpur, Gaya on Sunday evening, Manjhi talked about building decision making qualities in students. “Though I am chief minister now, I am afraid of taking tough decision foe fear of scrutiny and criticism. If you get demoralised, it hampers your decision making power”. Though he did not refer to his predecessor Nitish Kumar, Manjhi is reportedly upset with the state government “being forced to revoke suspension” Patna Medical College and Hospital medical superintendent, who was suspended for “negligence in duty” in treatment of those injured during Dussehra Gandhi Maidan stampede. Manjhi reportedly had to buckle under pressure of top JD (U) leadership, more so after Indian Medical Association’ tough stand after Manjhi’s “chop off hands of doctors if found negligent about treatment of the poor”
Speaking at another function in Gaya, Manjhi seemed to balance his political stance as he praised both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar for taking up cause of social justice and “standing up for the oppressed”.
Manjhi’s past few statements regarding his growing assertion as the dalit face of the party has caused confusion iJD (U) cadre among party’s going back to leadership of Nitish Kumar, who will start his Sampark Yatra from West Champaran freshly take up special category status demand to mount pressure on NDA government and also get back to focus in state and national politics.

Mkt to consolidate with upward bias; be company-specific08:00 am
Kenneth Andrade, head investment, IDFC Mutual Fund expects the Indian equity market to consolidate with an upward bias going ahead.  In an interview to CNBC-TV18, he said one can expect select midcap companies to post healthy earnings growth in FY16 and FY17 . However, it is difficult to find any specific sector taking leadership from the midcap space, he added.  
The fund house is bullish on consumer discretionary space and expects it to give healthy returns in the near-term. On the flipside, IDFC MF has cut some exposure to gas distribution companies recently.
Andrade recommends market participants to adopt a company-specific rather than sector-specific approach.
Sharing views on the Indian macros, he said that the new government has taken steps to make sure that Indian economy stabilises. “The Indian economy bottomed out in 2013 and now revival is on with a stable BJP government in power,” he added.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Kenneth Andrade’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy
Latha: What is the sense in the market itself, do you think that most of the good news has been juiced out and at least for the remaining part of 2014 we won’t see too much fireworks?
A: The last one year markets have been fairly in favour of the investor and you have got fairly high double digit gains out there. Largely valuations are fair at this point in time and there is a fair amount of execution that needs to be done to get profitability growth upwards. So that is the process that is going to take its time. So yes it will be good if markets actually consolidate themselves around these levels before an earnings kick in in 2015-2016 before we can see some structural gains for an extremely long period of time.
Sonia: You have significantly raised stake in two sectors, in engineering and in autos but these are stocks that have already run-up considerably in the last 6-12 months. Are these still sectors that one should accumulate into now or do you think you should move money elsewhere?
A: If you just look at the constituents of those two segments that we have raised exposure to, what we prefer to buy into our industries or our companies which do not have significant amount of leverage and where we see execution risks are reasonably low. So in discretionary spends that is one part of the industry that we think we will see near term gains that would come through.
The other in terms of engineering and capital goods space, there will be incremental capex on the ground and that should help the balance sheet of these companies, P&L accounts as well as stock should consolidate and give fair amount of returns from here.
Latha: When is the economy turning around, should we look at the fabulous sales that Hero and Honda posted on Dhanteras day as a signal of the economy turning around or are these just good products that would get sold anyway? When are you actually looking at earnings upgrades coming in?
A: 2013 is when the economy actually bottomed out. 2014 we got a new government in power and there has been reasonable amount of initiatives taken by this government to actually make sure that the base will hold. To expect the economy to actually have a hockey stick kind of recovery after a sluggish three-four years I think it is not right to expect that at least in the near term. So let us see if the market consolidates itself, let corporates get their balance sheets into place, let the banking system actually recapitalise itself and 2016 and 2017 should be reasonably interesting years as far as earnings are concerned.
Sonia: The oil and gas sector is not in your top five sector holdings right now but last year you had exposure of more than 6-7 percent in that, have you booked profits in oil and gas?
A: Historically we have had reasonable amount of exposure to the gas sector or distribution space and we have taken some money off the table.
In the other part of the market it is fairly regulated and government has got significant amount of control out there. So it is not really a free market economy that you are actually operating in. So that is one of the reasons why we have not been significantly overweight on that particular space.
Latha: Where should one look for big returns or outsized market breaking returns? What are the parameters to identify the outperformers?
A: What currently the market lacks is essentially category leadership or stock leadership. So it is very difficult to identify one company that is going to actually pull this market through or a category that is actually going to pull this market through. In 2005-2008 you had the entire investment economy that led the markets. If you step backwards to the turn of the century you had IT that held through the entire environment.
As the situation stands we don’t see that kind of category leadership that exists on the ground for the market. So if you have to build that into a portfolio strategy I would rather still go extremely company specific but that is going to be a significant challenge when you run large size portfolios. But near term that has to be done. Hopefully participate with the market till you identify the category leadership and then actually ride with it. I don’t think that category is actually showing up to give you some significant amount of alpha on the ground at this point in time. Companies might be able to do it but when you run large portfolios it is going to be reasonably tough.
Latha: How is the trend looking here on, will you continue to have this big outperformance from midcaps?
A: I think you are looking at it from a point to point basis. So if you take from an all time low to right now yes these indices have given you market beating returns. But if you look at it from an entire cycle perspective they have gone down that dramatically before they have actually bounced back. So to put it differently these indices have come back and a lot of these companies have come back from bankruptcy kind of valuations to market level valuations which is what the market is essentially displaying at this point in time.
There is no significant valuation arbitrage from industry to industry perspective, there is no significant valuation arbitrage even from company to company specific. So if you have to build it forward any investor has to take execution risk on his portfolio and make sure that the company actually executes and has more market share and higher cash flow and disproportionate profitability within the sector itself.

Market likely to remain bullish in Samvat 2071Stock market likely to remain bullish in Samvat 2071
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 24, 2014  | 16:38 IST
Indian stock markets are likely to remain bullish during the current Hindu calendar year (Samvat 2071) and investors would continue to reap rich gains, say experts.
This year has been euphoric for markets . Apart from the last one month or so, overseas investors have been buying heavily.
"Now, that markets have been acquiring higher peaks, we can see retail investors coming back gradually. We are likely to witness a rise in retail flow into the market this year. That will be healthy for the market as so far Indian market is totally dependent on the FII money," said S K Goel, Director, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"Expect the market to remain bullish from this Samvat to the next but volatility is likely to continue. In this rally so far, IT, pharma, auto consumer, banking had been the leaders and we expect these sectors to remain bullish. Cement and infra would do well in the coming year considering the fact that Modi government's focus has been on building new cities," he added.
The Sensex gained 5,590.42 points, or 26.37 per cent, in the entire Samvat 2070.
Analysts said that currently we are in a bull-market and stocks will remain as best asset-class in Samvat 2071, provided global markets remain stable.
BJP's win in two state elections (Maharashtra and Haryana) has raised expectations of additional reforms, they said.
Experts said markets have given a thumbs up to this win as now the new government would find it much easier to pass reform bills in the Rajya Sabha.
"With quick policy decision making and reforms clearances, we expect the new government to maintain and build higher confidence for FII investors," an expert said.
With stable macros and policy push by the Modi government, Indian markets should be able to continue doing good. Reforms at the Centre are the key for the next leg of rally, say analysts.
"This Samvat year would be positive for markets as macroeconomic data have been positive and there are expectation that slew of reforms would greet investors during this period," said Alex Matthews, Geojit BNP, Research Head.
Some tension at the borders can impact the market if they worsen from where they are today, he added.

Reuters In this September 30, 2014 photo, Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. The lawsuit against Mr. Modi argues that victims of the communal violence in Gujarat were entitled to compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages.

The U.S.-based lawsuit filed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi is progressing
A federal court in New York has signalled its intention to take forward a lawsuit filed in the U.S. against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by issuing an order on October 21 calling on the plaintiffs to explain why Mr. Modi was not immune from prosecution for allegedly presiding over the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom that took place in Gujarat.
U.S. Judge Analisa Torres asked the American Justice Center (AJC), a non-profit human rights organisation, to respond to a “suggestion of immunity,” submitted to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 19 by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Mr. Bharara was prompted to do so by a September 30 letter from the State Department, which argued that “a prompt dismissal of the proceedings,” could have “significant policy implications.”
The lawsuit against Mr. Modi filed by the AJC argues that under the Alien Tort statutes the plaintiffs including “Asif,” “Jane Doe,” and multiple “John Doe’s,” said to be victims of the communal violence in Gujarat, were entitled to compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages and a declaration that Mr. Modi’s alleged conduct “amounted to ‘Genocide’” according to court documents.
Last month, even as Mr. Modi was attending numerous meetings with business and community leaders in New York City and then a summit meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, the District Court issued a summons against the Prime Minister to answer the charges made against him.
Despite the AJC offering $10,000 for the serving of the summons to Mr. Modi, this step was apparently not achieved while the Prime Minister was in the U.S., and at that time Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told The Hindu that the Indian leader was “ring-fenced.”
Senior U.S. administration officials were quick to clarify that the summons could not be delivered to him while he was in the U.S. and he was immune from prosecution at this time because “as a general legal principle, sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from suits in American courts. Sitting heads of government also enjoy personal inviolability while in the U.S., which means they cannot be personally handed or delivered papers… to begin the process of a lawsuit.”
The service of the summons, however, may depend on whether the U.S. court has subject-matter jurisdiction for the complaint, and it is possible that if the alleged violations of certain laws took place at a time before the defendant in the case became a head of government, then the defendant may neither be personally inviolable nor immune.
Notably, the State Department letter on the “suggestion of immunity” for Mr. Modi does not comment on the merits of the case against the Prime Minister, and only emphasises his immunity from prosecution under U.S. common law principles and customary international law, that too only “while in office.”
The AJC has since argued that Mr. Bharara’s filing was “not binding on the court, [as] the human rights violations committed by Mr. Modi before becoming Prime Minister and as Chief Minister of Gujarat are not immune.” AJC legal adviser Gurpatwant Singh Pannun added that the federal court therefore had jurisdiction to hold Mr. Modi accountable under the Alien Tort Claims Act and Torture Victims Protection Act.
A question that may be critical to the unravelling of the legal web around the immunity issue is the U.S. government’s view on whether immunity enjoyed at the present time by a foreign dignitary is retroactive, or applies to past acts as well, when that dignitary was not a head of government.
An earlier diplomatic row
In the past, the U.S. State Department has already spelt out its view on this matter in another high-profile case of a legal dispute concerning India — the criminal charges filed against Devyani Khobragade, former Indian Deputy Consul General who was arrested on the streets of New York last December and strip-searched in custody, sparking off a massive diplomatic row between the two countries. In that case, days after Ms Khobragade’s arrest, Department spokesperson Marie Harf said that in the event that the senior Indian diplomat was successfully reassigned to the United Nations and thus given full diplomatic immunity from prosecution, such immunity would only apply to her from the day on which she was officially confirmed to her new post and not retroactively.
“Generally speaking, if there’s a change in immunity… because of a different diplomatic status that immunity would start on the date it’s conferred,” Ms. Harf said on the record at the time.
Yet if that is in fact what U.S. law dictates, or that is what the current administration’s position is, then it may find little room for manoeuvre to argue for personal inviolability and immunity from subsequent prosecution for Mr. Modi for a complaint based on acts that he was said to have committed more than a decade before he became India’s Prime Minister.
The plaintiffs in the case appear not to be unaware of this point, and this week Mr. Pannun said, “The selective and arbitrary approach of the U.S. Department of Justice on the issue of immunity to foreign leaders will be the key factor in challenging the immunity to PM Modi.”

Big businessmen turn mentors for startups like Demand  OlaBig businessmen turn mentors for startups like Demand Farm, OlaCabs and others

Demand Farm
(The success of companies…)
When Bangalore-based Milind Katti approached Mu Sigma CEO Dhiraj Rajaram to sell B2B lead generation services, their conversation turned to Katti's another startup that makes software to manage key B2B accounts. Enthused, Rajaram soon led a $750,000 angel funding into Demand Farm .
The investment not only extended Demand Farm's survivability, but also saw Rajaram give regular feedback and Mu Sigma become its beta user.
Scores of Indian entrepreneurs, who have tasted hard-earned success, have started giving it back to the ecosystem by not only investing their time and money on young startups, but also becoming their early beta users, educating them on the pitfalls and making connections with other investors.
"This was a trend which was happening in Silicon Valley but has only started in India recently," said Mukul Singhal of SAIF Partners ."These entrepreneurs also have an operating experience, which is recent and more relevant compared with someone who built a company 30 years ago," Singhal added.
However, it is not just validation of an idea but the execution learning too that digital age entrepreneurs look for when they scout for money or advice from their seniors. "The capital was helpful, but for me validation of product from Dhiraj and Mu Sigma was much more important," said Katti, who successfully launched the product a few months ago.
The success of companies in newage sectors such as e-commerce, cloud, analytics and mobile applications, has made the young startups rely on those who have seen early success. Taxi aggregator Olacabs, founded by IIT Bombay alumni Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati chose to raise a Rs 2-crore angel round in 2011 with participation from Snapdeal's Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal.
"In the early stages, one entrepreneur betting on another is a great validation of the idea," said Aggarwal, CEO of Olacabs. Snapdeal's co-founders held about 0.21 per cent each as of August 15, this year in OlaCabs. Anupam Mittal, founder of matchmaking portal Shaadi.com, also held 1.5 per cent in OlaCabs, as per latest data. "They have lived the entrepreneurial life and hence bring valuable and real on-ground experience, which for first-time entrepreneurs is invaluable."
The results show. Olacabs recently closed a Rs 250-crore Series C investment from Steadview Capital and Sequoia Capital, valuing it at nearly Rs 1,100 crore.
Till five years ago, the mentoring and investment would be limited to global groupings such as those within the IIT network, where Silicon Valley-based seniors would invest in ventures of juniors or mentor them online or at coffee shops when visiting India. With the growth of India's accelerator ecosystem and platforms that help entrepreneurs meet, the trend has seen a hockey stick curve.
Mobile ad network firm In Mobi's cofounder and CTO Mohit Saxena met App Virality CEO Laxman Papineni at a Microsoft accelerator event in Bangalore recently. "They needed help with hiring the right people and guidance on how to launch a global product," said Saxena, who then became a mentor to the startup. According to data from VCCEdge, angel and seed stage deals have been steadily rising--from 227 in 2012 to 240 in 2013. There were 135 seed and angel investments till August 2014, most of which were led by current and former entrepreneurs.
Eka Software CEO and cofounder Manav Garg has also backed startups such as StayZilla, social media newspaper Frrole and enterprise software maker OrangeScape, all in their early phases. To discover more startups from other parts of the country, he has invested in LetsVenture, a linkedin for startups and investors along with InMobi's other cofounder, Naveen Tewari.
"Our collective vision is to take the number of seed stage and Series A (first round of venture capital) deals in India from about 200 to over 1,000 in a couple of years," said Garg, 38.
The growth in social media tools such as WhatsApp in the last few years has also encouraged entrepreneurs to give their valuable time, if not physically, then virtually.
"The Bansals of Flipkart are very approachable on Whatsapp and keep the door open for constant communication," said Deepit Purkayastha, cofounder of News in Shorts, a mobile app that gives out top news stories in 60-word portions. The 23-year old raised seed investments from Flipkart cofounders last month.
"For example, they helped us choose the right marketing channels," Purkayastha said. It also shortens their time to market. "Instead of blindly exploring, it makes us more focused and effective." Myntra CEO Mukesh Bansal has backed grocery delivery chain Zopnow and co-invests in startups referred by Kae Capital.
It's not only entrepreneurs with billion dollar valuation startups who have turned angels. Freshdesk's co-founder Girish Mathrubootham and Toppr's Zishaan Hayath have also been backing startups.

Meet the developer having an App blast near SivakasiShunmugharajan has chosen a unusual location for her firm, in the hinterlands close to Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu's Virudunagar district.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BANGALORE: The upcoming mobile applications company Bubble Thoughts promises to add another feather in the cap of Sasi Dharani Shunmugharajan . The 26-year-old coding enthusiast, who is just one among the many women who are quietly demolishing the gender barrier in this male-dominated field, already has 13 mobile apps to her credit and nets Rs 60,000 in ad revenue every month.
She has chosen a rather unusual location for her firm, in the hinterlands close to India's fireworks hub of Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu's Virudunagar district.
Shunmugharajan, who has developed all her apps under the nickname Sindu Rajan, is vying for a place in the burgeoning app industry which is expected to rise 62% to $25 billion (Rs 1.53 lakh crore) this year, according to Gartner Inc.
Her flagship GRE training app has been consistently ranked among the top 50 apps in the Android play store in India for the past two years.
"My family didn't understand what I was up to when I started coding. Now they understand the concept," said Dharani, a working mother of a two-year-old child, whose chief designer happens to be her sister-in-law Yalini Kumara guru. Contrary to popular belief, women set the foundation in the field of computer programming.Britain's Countess Ada Lovelace, who worked with mathematician Charles Babbage, is considered to be the world's first programmer.Grace Hopper, called Grandma COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) by some, helped invent some of the early programming languages in English.
Dharani's story is similar to that of many other girls from India's smaller towns. She rejected a job soon after she earned her engineering degree from PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, and got married at the age of 22. "I was frustrated. Most of my friends were working in large companies.And I was scared if I would lose out on exposure, since I was settled in a small town," said Dharani, whose initial doubts now seem unfounded to her.
She took four months to understand the basics of app development and put out her first app Pocket Aptitude in December 2012, soon after delivering her baby. Her apps for competitive exams such as SAT, GRE and GMAT have been down loaded about 4 lakh times. Besides coding the app, she also comes up with the aptitude questions in most cases.
According to the US-based not for-profit National Public Radio , the number of women learning computer science drastically plunged in 1984 in that country.
The reason, NPR says, was selec tive access to personal computers in the 1980s, the decade when Apple and IBM debuted with their per sonal computing products.
Home PCs sprung up in places that boys loved to hang out in. So companies targeted their products to boys by default. In a home set ting, it was the brother who got the PC, never his sister. The computers became a boy toy. The action sim ply fed on itself, and rippled across to the rest of the world.
"In India, the problem continues in a different fashion," said Kriti ka M, accounts director at Anita Borg Institute, a non-profit organi sation founded by computer scien tist Anita Borg that works to recruit, retain and advance women in technology.
"Even though engineering colleg es in India have 50% girls, few in that crowd go into this profes sion, especially those from tier-II and tier-III cities," she said.
However, she added that India's fledgling start-up ecosystem has come to grips with this issue much faster than the decade-old Silicon Valley did. ven large companies to day appreciate the need for women coders in the world. Google , which employs just 30% women, started offering in June free vouchers to women and minorities interested in learning how to code. The vouch ers quickly sold out due to high de mand.
Microsoft has a Codess pro gramme in place, a community to encourage women coders and in crease gender diversity in the workplace.
Such efforts appear to be making some difference. Nasscom's "Girls in Technology" programme, which included sessions directed at women on topics such as An droid, Bizathon and mobile apps pitching, has ensured that 30% of the applicants for its 10,000 Start ups batch are women.
Going forward, Dharani wants to focus on enabling schools with technology. "I love to code. There's logical reasoning, and designing.
How can anybody not?" she said.

Olacabs raises $210 million from Japan’s SoftBank Corp; enters $1b Club

(Announcement is likely…)
BANGALORE: Taxi service aggregator Olacabs has raised $210 million from Japan's SoftBank Corp at a valuation of nearly $1 billion (Rs 6,100 crore), people familiar with the development said, as it joins the league of India's most valuable startups and squares off against Uber as well as other venture-funded cab service marketplaces.
An announcement could be made as early as next week, when SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son visits India and makes official his group's investments of over $1 billion in Indian startups. ET reported that online retailer Snapdeal is in line to snag $650 million and mobile marketplace Paytm up to $300 million from the Japanese conglomerate which booked an estimated $5 billion gain from the IPO of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba last month. "The company is valued close to $1 billion," a source said, referring to Olacabs, which was founded in January 2011 by IIT-Bombay alumni Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati.
Olacabs declined to comment. Soft-Bank did not reply to an email seeking its view. Olacabs started life in Mumbai but is now based in Bangalore.
It is backed by Sequoia Capital, Hong Kong's Steadview Capital and Tiger Global . Kunal Bahl, the cofounder of Snapdeal, is an angel investor in the company. The funding is an important milestone for Indian startups that are increasingly gaining the attention of deep-pocketed global investors looking to cash in on India's entrepreneurial prowess and the country's vast market opportunity.
Online retail has grabbed most of the attention and money so far—market leader Flipkart alone has raised $1.2 billion this year—but taxi marketplaces and realty portals are expected to be where the next battles to gain consumers and market share will be fought. An indication of the rising interest in the taxi aggregation market is the fact that Olacabs raised Rs 250 crore only in July, when it was valued at Rs 1,000 crore. What has also excited investors is the entry into India of Uber, the cab hailing app that has been making waves across the world.
San-Francisco based Uber, which is barely four years old raised $1.2 billion, at a valuation of $18 billion, in June this year. Uber entered India in August 2013 and has been recruiting taxi owners rapidly. Jaspal Singh, the cofounder of Valoriser Consultants which provides market research services for transportation companies, said the funding and valuation of Olacabs are an indication that investors are betting on rapid growth prospects. "Their longterm strategy is to expand the market size by attracting first-time riders and enter into new geographies," he said. Over two million taxis are registered in India and the market is estimated to be worth over $7 billion.
Companies like Olacabs do not operate their own taxis but provide the technology platform that links taxi owners with passengers. Ola, which is launching its service in one city every two weeks, claims to have around 33,000 cars on its platform. In about three and ahalf years, it has built a presence in 19 cities so far. The latest funding for Olacabs is likely to put pressure on Taxiforsure, its main Indian competitor which has also raised an estimated $50 million this year. Taxiforsure, cofounded by IIM-Ahmedabad alumni Aprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G, is backed by Accel Partners, Bessemer Venture and Helion Venture .

Writing about Clean India a service to nation: Modi tells mediaPrint
New Delhi, Oct 25 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday thanked the media for creating awareness about the Clean India Campaign, adding that the members of the fourth estate were doing a service to the nation by writing about it.
In his first formal interaction with the media after becoming the prime minister, Modi recounted his relations with the press as a party worker, and then talked about his pet Clean India Campaign.
"I am reading so many articles on clean India. Electronic and social media is also doing a comprehensive debate on it. This is a service to the nation. This is a good example of how the media can play a constructive role," Modi said at the media meet at the BJP headquarters here.
"I know 80 percent of it is criticism, but it is spreading awareness on an issue which has tainted India's image in the world," Modi said referring to his cleanliness campaign.
He said that by virtue of these writings, an environment was being created where citizens were coming together to work hand-in-hand with the government.
"Since independence, it was believed that the government would do everything. But the media is encouraging people to work for the nation. There is now an environment where citizens are realising that all have to work together," Modi said.
"This could not have happened if just the prime minister had taken a broom in his hand," he said.
He said he has had a close association with the media and that he wants to strengthen it.
"When I interact with the media, I not only get information, but I also get a vision," Modi said.
He said that he used to once help with the seating arrangement at media meets and used to interact freely with the press, and even though times have now changed, he was looking for ways to deepen his old ties with the media.

Arvind Subramanian well positioned to guide India as it moves into world leadership positions

(The new CEA can be counted…)
By: C Fred Bergsten
A top economic policymaker in any government must meet three tests. She or he must be able to conceptualize the problems that the country faces. She or he must be able to devise solutions to them that are both effective and practical. And she or he must be able to articulate those strategies clearly, inside the government and publicly, and persuade the many relevant players to support them.
On all these counts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made an inspired choice by picking Arvind Subramanian to become Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) to the Government of India.
As a close colleague and friend of Subramanian for the past seven years at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, I can personally attest to his superior talents in all of the arenas that will be critical to his own success and, much more importantly, to that of his country and of the Modi administration.
Subramanian is a superb conceptualizer and creator of innovative policy proposals. In fact, he will have many more ideas that his (or any) government can pursue even over the course of an extended period in office.
Development Economist
The breadth of his expertise, as demonstrated by the dazzling array of his publications over his stay at the Peterson Institute, is exceptional: macroeconomics, development, finance, trade, the environment and many others.
For example, he has proposed creative responses to such key issues facing the new government as its treatment of intellectual property rights and its defence of food security for the Indian population in the context of the World Trade Organization debate, fully defending Indian interests but with tactical shifts from the previous government that would be much more likely to succeed.
Some observers have in fact suggested that Subramanian has too many interests to focus on those of greatest importance to India at this point in time.
But the president of the Center for Global Development in Washington, Nancy Birdsall, where he has also been a Senior Fellow, has rightly observed that he "is a development economist at heart."
He has been leading the "Understanding India" initiative at the Center and his greatest intellectual ambition is to write the definitive study on development.
There is no reason to doubt that he will be a source of thoughtful proposals to address the priority concerns of India, whose greatness and huge potential is deeply rooted within him, both today and for the foreseeable future.
Moreover, India will soon be the world's most populous country and third largest economy and it can only benefit by drawing on such a top global economist.
  Subramanian also has exceptional talent in conveying his ideas clearly and forcefully. His written work ranges from lengthy books to refereed articles in scholarly journals to short policy briefs to opeds in most of the world's leading newspapers, especially in India. He has been a widely sought-after speaker around the globe.
His sophistication on the politics of economic issues — both domestic and international — will help him greatly in selling his own ideas and those of his government. I hope that his new environment will deploy him as extensively as possible to help bring its message to the widest possible audience. There are important personal characteristics that will reinforce Subramanian's substantive knowledge and skills.
Perhaps, the most salient is intellectual integrity, a commitment to advance one's ideas firmly and forcefully in seeking to persuade the country's leadership to adopt new courses of action that may at first glance seem too difficult conceptually or, especially, politically.
This will be reinforced by his enormous energy and tenacity, as demonstrated repeatedly by his persistence in championing ideas that may be too new or controversial to win immediate support.
The new CEA can be counted on to "stick to his guns" in pursuit of important and especially fresh ideas even in the face of entrenched and powerful resistance. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, and the people of India, will be well served by an adviser with this rare combination of integrity and energy.
Attuned to India
The unquestioned integrity of Subramanian has been on display with his willingness, along with his strong support for the Modi government from its outset, to publicly question a couple of its early policies.
In these cases, notably the initial budget and the WTO debate, he has, in fact, proposed constructive alternatives that would fully promote the interests of both India as a whole and the new government.
I understand from afar that concern was expressed that Subramanian had spent a long time outside India and thus is not sufficiently familiar with the country's problems and political realities.

How Kishore Biyani is remodelling Future GroupAmazon
(Thinking big comes easy…)
I wouldn't suggest we are an ideal organization, but I think we have made the beginning towards building one" Kishore Biyani, in his autobiography It Happened in India
Seven years after India's Raja of Retail penned his entrepreneurial journey — and in the process convinced his elder daughter Ashni that he wasn't writing it, as she feared, "too soon" — Kishore Biyani's "ideal organization" is still a work in progress. By 2007 — 16 years after he opened his first store to sell apparel, Pantaloons — Biyani had done enough in the retail space, and more, to earn the Raja handle.
Read Kishore Biyani's Interview Here
His Future Group was selling food and groceries, apparel, footwear, furniture, consumer electronics, home products, books, medicines, mobiles et al through multiple formats like supermarkets, hypermarkets, malls, specialty stores — and, yes, an online portal too.
Forays into the broader consumption space — restaurants, entertainment centres and even consumer finance and insurance — were all prongs of the group that hit revenues of just over Rs 5,000 crore in the year ended June 2008.
Today, Biyani looks back at the no-holds-barred growth phase with mixed emotions. "Success is very heady. [But] difficult times humble you."
Those difficult times came courtesy of the global financial crisis of 2008.
The Future Group found itself saddled with a debt of over Rs 4,000 crore even as liquidity dried up and consumers tightened their purse strings.
The debt kept rising, peaking at Rs 7,800 crore in 2012. The post-2008 phase was of gritty survival, culminating in the sale of Pantaloon to the AV Birla group for Rs 1,600 crore in 2012; and a series of selloff deals are still in the pipeline.
Over the next couple of years, rationalizing stores became the buzzword and, as things stand today, Reliance Retail is the largest organized retailer — the newly crowned 'Raja', if you will — and e-commerce giants Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal et al have captured the mind space of consumers and the moneybags of investors.
Yesterday's Raja of Retail, now 53, seemingly with a smaller fire in the belly, is watching the new kids on the block, happy that he wrote his tome at the right time — after all, wasn't it Biyani himself who told an investor: "Retail is like riding a bicycle uphill, if you stop pedaling you will slide down?"
Biyani hasn't stopped pedalling. The only difference is that he now wants to ride a faster, larger cycle, a road bike perhaps, that traverses terrains beyond organized retailing and bunny-hops onto the track of food — processing it, marketing it and branding it.
At the same time he wants to throw his hat once again in the ring in which he was one of the first to do so: e-commerce. Don't forget he had set up Futurebazaar.com in 2007 — the same year Flipkart was born.
"He [Biyani] is in the most exciting phase of his career. I have never seen him so engaged and committed," says Shailesh Haribhakti, managing partner, Haribhakti & Co, an independent director of Future Lifestyle. On the board, Haribhakti has known Biyani for over two decades now.
Food for Thought
Last month, prime minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a 110-acre food park in Tumkur in Karnataka, Biyani's first iron in the fire of foodprocessing.
He plans to set up two more — one in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal each — with the aim of fuelling the foods business into a Rs 20,000-crore behemoth by 2020, from just Rs 1,000 crore currently.
The processed and packaged foods business in India is a gargantuan pie, at Rs 40,000 crore; however, it is fragmented and dominated by unorganized players. In 2012-13, Indian households are estimated to have spent Rs 11,00,000 crore on food.
  For his part, Biyani doesn't see the food foray as a shift from the core business. "I have never looked at myself as just a retailer," he says. "We have always been an FMCG company," he adds.
To be sure, group company Future Consumer Enterprises is present in over 60 product categories, and the plan is to make frozen foods, ready-to-eat and baked items at the food parks. "India does not have home-grown food products that cater to Indian tastes," adds Biyani.
Biyani wants to do to food what he did to retail in the 1990s. "Hopefully, we will be the largest food FMCG company in the country by 2020," says Biyani. His vision is to make Future Group a Rs 1,00,000 crore entity by 2020, with food contributing a fifth of those revenues.
When Biyani took the plunge into retail, Walmart founder Sam Walton was doubtless an inspiration — but not necessarily for the Walmart model. The Future Group CEO has been influenced by Walton's desire to "rewrite rules".
Biyani reckons he's done something similar by creating a unique retailing model in India that has the look and feel of mandis, and takes into account local tastes and cultures. The food venture will follow the similar principles of providing indigenous solutions.

On his tech handicap:
I had to apply my mind to understand technology; in the last 7-8 years, I have been calling budding entrepreneurs home to get their sense of technology.
On why Futurebazaar.com failed:
We came too early in the game. We were ahead of the times
On the future of retailing:
I see store sizes shrinking and physical stores doing a lot more to support digital presence. By 2020, I expect some stores to be so data-enabled that the moment you enter our store our staff will know a whole lot about you.
On what the downturn taught him:
Success can be very heady. It gives you a high. I feel humbled.
On the shift in his approach to business:
Any creation has to be tempered with control. Art and science have to go hand in hand when running a business. Don't get attached. Attachment can be blinding. Sweating existing assets is important. I also learnt that balance sheets, investors and the stock market are important.
On competition in retailing:
15 years back, we were called leaders. I am surprised we could sustain it for so long. I don't see that changing significantly until 2020.

E-commerce industry to touch $90 bn by 2021 in India: Expertadvertising
(700 per cent growth will…)
MUMBAI: The e-commerce industry is worth USD 13 billion today and is expected to touch USD 90 billion by 2021, according to eTailing India Founder Ashish Jhalani.
This 700 per cent growth will change the way organisations allocate internet advertising budgets in India, eTailing India Jhalani said in a statement here today.
"E-commerce is a full-fledged industry today, from being ancillary part of the retail industry less than a few years ago. Much like Apple changed the music industry, e-commerce will not only impact retail, but also the advertising industry, Jhalani said.
Shoppers in India are increasingly using smartphones to buy products; sites such as Flipkart , Snapdeal and Shopclues have reported that that up to 35 percent of their traffic comes from the mobile phone. With the high penetration of phones in India and improving internet connectivity, e-commerce firms are expected to reach millions of new users in the coming years, he said.
In line with the growth of e-commerce, one-third of the world's advertising revenue is also expected to go digital by 2018, Jhalani said.
At a recent conference, Google India declared that Indian internet users will surpass the number in the US by the end of 2014 and around 500 million people will be online by 2018.

Weve no time please  were childrenUpdated: October 26, 2014 01:00 IST
We’ve no time please, we’re children
Kermaan Satha Munshi
children
Children are being increasingly deprived of the time, space and freedom to play and learn at their own pace. Indeed, this should be deemed to be their birthright.
My own seven-year-old daughter recently asked me for a hand sanitiser to take to school, to “quickly clean hands before I open my dabba”. “Why quickly?” I asked. It took me some time to realise that she was in fact responding to my repeated questions on why she was often not finishing her lunch in school. “If we go down to wash our hands, we do not have enough time to eat. Sometimes I have just a couple of bites and the bell rings.”
“But what about playtime?” “We aren’t allowed to go out of the class — if we eat fast, we can play ‘stone-paper-scissor’.”
That explained the unfinished food, the loss of weight and appetite, and the almost permanent slouch I was noticing in my child since the start of the academic year.
A couple of students who come to me for English classes reported similar treatment being meted out to them in their respective upscale CBSE schools. I write from Central India, but the situation must be similar in other parts of the country, where schools are systematically over-scheduling kids when it comes to academics and co-curricular activities (read CCE worksheets, “project work”, “formative and summative assessments” and sundry competitions), and shrinking recess hours to accommodate vast and ambitious curriculums that “raise the bar of learning”.
Children have their own sense of justice, and the feeling of revolt at being play-deprived is palpable when they open up to me. School managements, often with the active collaboration of ill-informed and overambitious parents, have been insidiously but determinedly robbing our children of a most basic need to play, explore, create and chill, at their own time, in their own space. We are talking of thousands of schools, pre-schools, “day-care” and “activity centres” across India that cite complex theories of learning, show brilliant images of neural connections develop at breakneck speed till the age of six, quote educationists from Maria Montessori to Howard Gardner to justify the need to shove new concepts down the throats of millions of children. Parents are spoilt for choice — i-math, calligraphy, sanskaar or the ubiquitous art and craft — and convinced they are raising a generation of child prodigies by minutely chalking out every moment of their day.
By depriving our children of physical space, good old sand pits and water play with buckets and shovels, we are robbing them of the only window they have to expand their awareness of space, develop their motor reflexes, their sense of touch and their own emotional space. No instructions are needed for sand and water play, and yet these, along with moulding play dough, constitute the most therapeutic of all activities. Through free play — and here I am talking good old catch-catch, kho-kho, kabaddi or hopscotch — they learn to distinguish between fair and unfair play, to take risks and to resolve conflicts, to form teams and show empathy. Such kids are clever, not cunning, non-violent yet not risk-averse!
What is a childhood without cuts, bruises, stained or torn clothes and a few tears? If kids do not fall, how will they learn to pick themselves up? Are school managements and teachers catering to overprotective parents or to their own need to avoid a mess and the hassle of managing turbulent tots? In either case, they shouldn’t be running schools in the first place. If kids are not given the time to share goodies and ideas over relaxed meals, how will they ever develop social skills? Authentic interaction rather than instruction is what hones social skills. What better place than a school where peers and resources are aplenty!
Finally, what of the child’s mental space? To get those great grades, answers or keywords are dictated in notebooks which kids regurgitate on their worksheets. Students are thus being robbed of the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them, of the ability to think on their feet, to organise their thoughts and use their own language and logic. How will this generation “Make in India” when they cannot even string up a decent sentence together on their own.
Unarmed and unmasked, the heartless robbers pursue their heist in broad daylight, relentlessly robbing our children of the time, space and freedom to play and learn at their pace, a freedom that should be every child’s birthright. Children do not have a voice, and schools, ministries of education and sometimes parents do not have a heart. And so the burglary goes on unchecked.
When will we realise that children do not just twiddle their thumbs and waste away if given some downtime? They may daydream, draw or doodle, but they are also learning. They may kick, hop, skip, fall, fight and make up, but they are still learning. Please let them learn. Please let them play.

AP to double coffee acreage to 1 lakh haAP to double coffee acreage to 1 lakh ha

Hyderabad, Oct. 26:  
The Andhra Pradesh Government has decided to increase the coffee plantation acreage to one lakh hectares from the present 58,000 hectares and increase productivity.
Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has asked the officials to increasing the productivity in the State which is very low at 170 kg a hectare (in the Visakhapatnam agency area) as against 700 kg in the neighbouring Karnataka.
Tribals take care of cultivation in about 55,000 hectares.
In a review meeting held on Sunday, the Chief Minister said the officials should introduce the best practices in plantation in order to increase productivity and increase incomes.
Despite favourable climatic conditions, the State was not able to produce more because of the obsolete farming and management practices.
The Chief Minister asked the officials to study the best practices and deploy technological solutions to improve the output and make the State the top producer of coffee in the country. “Besides increasing the incomes of tribals, it will also help earn the State a good branding,” he said.

Sikka to focus on GenNext team to transform ...You are here: Home > Collections > Infosys
With new hires from SAP, Infosys strengthens senior team

(Vishal Sikka continues…)
BANGALORE:Vishal Sikka continues to attract talent from SAP as he builds a team of leaders to help transform Infosys into what the first non-founder chief executive officer calls a "next generation IT services company."
Ganapathy Subramanian, former vice-president at SAP Labs India , and Sudipto Shankar Dasgupta, former chief development architect at SAP Labs India, have joined Infosys as vice presidents. While their roles have not been revealed, ETlearns they will continue to be based out of Bangalore.
Kaustav Mitra , Global VP, SAP Startup Focus, is serving his notice period and is expected to join Sikka's team, as is Yusuf Bashir, VP,New Products & Business Development at SAP.
Since Sikka, a former member of the Executive Board of SAP AG, took over at the country's second-largest software company on August 1, seven SAP executives, including five SVPs, have switched loyalties to join Infosys. They include Ritika Suri, Abdul Razack, Sanjay Rajagopalan, Navin Budhiraja and Michael Reh, all of whom report directly to Sikka.
The SVPs will be stationed in Palo Alto, save Reh who will be based out of Germany. With Mitra and Bashir, also expected to work from Palo Alto, the number of former SAP executives joining Infosys rises to nine.
Mitra told ET that for now he remains with SAP, driving the Startup Focus programme. "If there is any change in my situation, I would be more than happy to do a detailed debrief, circumstances permitting,"said Mitra. An e-mail sent to Bashir remained unanswered.
Mitra will be joining Infosys when the Bangalore-based company is looking to strengthen its engagement with startups. At SAP, Mitra is credited with having recruited over 1,500 startups in two years and helped enable $20 million in startup revenue in 2014, with forecast of $90 million for 2015, making SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner call it "one of the best ideas at SAP of the past 10 years."
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, saying: "As per company policy, we do not comment on the appointments or exits of executives other than members of the board or executive officers."
Infosys had said that in the second quarter, over 3,000 professionals joined the company from several global corporations, including "a few from SAP. It is relatively common in our industry that when a senior leader leaves a company, there would be a few people who may decide to follow."
Srikantan Moorthy, executive vice president and head of human resources, told ET earlier this month that Infosys will "continue to build on its relationship with SAP in different forms, whether it is on the human resources side in terms of their processes or the products they have built."
Some experts say that SAP executives joining Infosys is a vote of confidence in Sikka's leadership skills. "People are attracted to leaders and compelling ideas,"said Dave Gardner, founder of Gardner & Associates Consulting, a California-based advisory firm. "If the work is exciting, there will be little difficulty finding people who want to help Infosys evolve. Vishal is building a great team. I don't see any problems attracting and retaining top talent."
When Sikka announced Infosys' second-quarter results on October 10, the company maintained its revenue growth forecast of 7-9% for the year and gave investors a generous interim dividend and share bonus. Nasscom expects the industry to grow by 13-15%, meaning Infosys and Sikka have a lot of ground to cover.

Air India faces MPs ire for not meeting demandsAir India faces MPs’ ire for not meeting ‘demands’
Saubhadra Chatterji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:50 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 10:26 IST(27/10/2014)
Comments
Air India, the national carrier, has faced a new turbulence on the ground. Peeved over its “failure” to provide preferred seats to MPs, apart from “negligence” and “discourteous behaviour”, a parliamentary panel has asked AI officials to appear before it.
The list of “allegations” of the MPs is pretty long. It ranges from non-allotment of key seats in the aircraft for MPs despite advance intimation to absence of liaison staff and lack of coordination.
The parliamentary committee on welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes went on a five-day long study tour last week to Chennai, Raipur and Hyderabad. The MPs flew with the national carrier, as per the guidelines. “We, however, faced problems with Air India. There was no one from their side to coordinate with us at the airport. MPs were also not given priority in allotment of seats,” panel chairman Faggan Singh Kulaste told HT.
More than 25 MPs went on the study tour.
Sources in AI, whose senior management has to appear before the panel on October 29, said that many other passengers had secured front row and other key seats through advance check-in before the MPs booked the flight. At the airport, the MPs demanded front row and spacious seats which were not available.
Some MPs even demanded that previous allotment for other passengers may be cancelled to accommodate their demand, sources added.
Sources added that some parliamentarians even asked the aircraft to be changed so that business class seats are available for MPs. AI officials turned it down. “That was a minor issue,” said Kulaste.
Air India CMD Rohit Nandan, who was recently granted an extension by PM Narendra Modi for his performance, has already explained the airline’s position vis-à-vis the allegations to the ministry. But he may have to appear before the panel where MPs are expected to vent their anger.

Milk selling for Rs 100 a litre  Rs 10 for an egg in riot-hit TrilokpuriComments
Rioting on the streets may have stopped in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri but hoarding of basic commodities sent prices skyrocketing on Sunday, adding to the misery of residents after violence broke out on Diwali evening.
Prohibitory orders have been in place in the neighbourhood since Thursday following clashes between two communities. This has led to a rampant black market trade, with prices of essential items doubling overnight.

“Eggs are selling for Rs. 10 per piece, which usually costs us Rs. 4,” said Kiswas, a resident of Block 27. “A half-litre packet of milk worth Rs. 24 is being sold for upto Rs. 50,” she added.
Some of the blocks worst-affected by violence are also reeling under exorbitant prices. With the police restricting movement of people, residents say they are at the mercy of local shopkeepers.
Read: Trilokpuri tense but no fresh clashes reported
The narrow bylanes are packed with over a thousand police and paramilitary personnel with an uneasy calm hanging over the neighbourhood. Taking advantage of the situation, small shops have downed shutters and are selling groceries through the back door.
The police have arrested about 40 people. Around 30 people have been injured in stone-pelting that began Thursday.
People fled their homes for the second straight day on Sunday as it became clear that prohibitory orders won’t be lifted anytime soon. 
“People are running out of ration. With shops closed more than 100 people have left my area alone,” said Mohammed Ahmed, a resident of block 27.

Crude oil prices mixed in Asian tradeCrude oil prices mixed in Asian trade
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 27:  
Oil was mixed in Asian trade today but remained subdued with no signs that the world’s key crude producers will cut output in the face of a supply glut, analysts said.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in December was up one cent at $81.02 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade, reversing earlier losses, while Brent crude for December delivery eased 25 cents to $85.88.
Both contracts were down on Friday, resuming their slide following a rebound the day before as traders shrugged off reports of a supply cutback in September by oil kingpin Saudi Arabia.
Production cut
World oil prices have fallen by a quarter since June as excess supply and weaker demand led to a glut in global markets, prompting some other exporters to call for cuts in output.
Analysts said however there are no indications of a production cut, and investors were looking for further developments during a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) next month.
“This year, global commercial oil stocks have surpassed the 5.0 billion barrel mark, growing at a rate of 1.16 million barrels per day on average over the first three quarters of this year,” British bank Barclays said in a research note.
“Such is the surplus in the market that is weighing on prices.”
It said that “the absence of an official policy statement, especially from Saudi Arabia in response to the fall in oil prices, has left a void in guidance“.
“This void has thus far been filled by a string of unsubstantiated assumptions in various press reports, as well as an extrapolation of the kingdom’s crude pricing and production data,” it added.
Phillip Futures said in a note that in the coming week, “it is unlikely that supply and demand factors would change’’.

Gold struggles as stronger equities hurt safe-haven appealGold struggles as stronger equities hurt safe-haven appeal
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 27:  
Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal’s safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened the risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks during the week-end were received calmly in the market.
Fed policy meet
Gold’s outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed’s two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank’s monetary policy.
“In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion,’’ Gan said.
Spot gold
Spot gold was steady at $1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn’t far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week. The metal’s losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain’s economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown.
Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher. Bullion traders were also closely watching investors’ positions in gold funds.
SPDR Gold Trust
SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the prices of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

Asian stocks rise as upbeat earnings  data sharpen risk appetiteAsian stocks rise as upbeat earnings, data sharpen risk appetite
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Oct 27:  
Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased recent global growth fears and sharpened the risk appetite.
The euro ticked higher but financial markets largely showed a muted reaction to Sunday’s health check results of euro zone banks, which painted a slightly brighter picture than expected.
Euro zone health checks
Of the euro zone’s 130 top lenders, 25 failed the health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank had said on Sunday.
Still, the test results were a sombre reminder that much work still remained, with the euro zone bank sector’s long-term attractiveness damaged by revelations of extra non-performing loans and hidden losses that will dent future profits.
“Banks face a significant challenge as the sector remains chronically unprofitable and must address their €879-billion exposure to non-performing loans as this will tie-up significant amount of capital,’’ accountancy firm KPMG noted.
The euro was up 0.1 per cent at $1.2699, edging away from a two-week low of $1.2614 hit last week in the wake of concerns about the bank tests.
Asian equities advanced, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 0.1 per cent and Tokyo’s Nikkei gaining 0.5 per cent.
“Stable housing starts in the US and solid Q3 GDP in the UK are likely to give the market some comfort after the recent concerns about global growth,’’ strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.
US home sales, UK economy
Data on Friday showed new US home sales rose to a six-year high, while Britain’s economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, still on track to outpace other advanced economies.
US stocks, recovering from a battering earlier in the month on worries about global growth losing momentum, gained on Friday on upbeat earnings from blue chips Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Easing worries over the possible spread of Ebola in the United States also helped.
The dollar traded at 108.08 yen after touching a three-week peak of 108.38, with a rise in US Treasury yields and improving risk appetite shoring up the greenback.
The Brazilian real’s non-deliverable forwards showed muted response so far after leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff's interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, but some traders think her re-election is already priced in as the real has fallen nearly 10 percent since early September.
Brent crude, spot gold
In commodities, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $85.81 a barrel, continuing a months-long rout as signs of rising global supply threatened deeper losses.
Iraq increased its oil supply in October and Libya’s output remains high, despite instability in both countries.
Gold edged lower as robust equity markets and strong US economic data dented demand for the precious metal.
Spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $1,230.97 an ounce.

Mkt to consolidate with upward bias; be company-specific: IDFC MF08:00 am
Kenneth Andrade, head investment, IDFC Mutual Fund expects the Indian equity market to consolidate with an upward bias going ahead.  In an interview to CNBC-TV18, he said one can expect select midcap companies to post healthy earnings growth in FY16 and FY17 . However, it is difficult to find any specific sector taking leadership from the midcap space, he added.  
The fund house is bullish on consumer discretionary space and expects it to give healthy returns in the near-term. On the flipside, IDFC MF has cut some exposure to gas distribution companies recently.
Andrade recommends market participants to adopt a company-specific rather than sector-specific approach.
Sharing views on the Indian macros, he said that the new government has taken steps to make sure that Indian economy stabilises. “The Indian economy bottomed out in 2013 and now revival is on with a stable BJP government in power,” he added.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Kenneth Andrade’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy
Latha: What is the sense in the market itself, do you think that most of the good news has been juiced out and at least for the remaining part of 2014 we won’t see too much fireworks?
A: The last one year markets have been fairly in favour of the investor and you have got fairly high double digit gains out there. Largely valuations are fair at this point in time and there is a fair amount of execution that needs to be done to get profitability growth upwards. So that is the process that is going to take its time. So yes it will be good if markets actually consolidate themselves around these levels before an earnings kick in in 2015-2016 before we can see some structural gains for an extremely long period of time.
Sonia: You have significantly raised stake in two sectors, in engineering and in autos but these are stocks that have already run-up considerably in the last 6-12 months. Are these still sectors that one should accumulate into now or do you think you should move money elsewhere?
A: If you just look at the constituents of those two segments that we have raised exposure to, what we prefer to buy into our industries or our companies which do not have significant amount of leverage and where we see execution risks are reasonably low. So in discretionary spends that is one part of the industry that we think we will see near term gains that would come through.
The other in terms of engineering and capital goods space, there will be incremental capex on the ground and that should help the balance sheet of these companies, P&L accounts as well as stock should consolidate and give fair amount of returns from here.
Latha: When is the economy turning around, should we look at the fabulous sales that Hero and Honda posted on Dhanteras day as a signal of the economy turning around or are these just good products that would get sold anyway? When are you actually looking at earnings upgrades coming in?
A: 2013 is when the economy actually bottomed out. 2014 we got a new government in power and there has been reasonable amount of initiatives taken by this government to actually make sure that the base will hold. To expect the economy to actually have a hockey stick kind of recovery after a sluggish three-four years I think it is not right to expect that at least in the near term. So let us see if the market consolidates itself, let corporates get their balance sheets into place, let the banking system actually recapitalise itself and 2016 and 2017 should be reasonably interesting years as far as earnings are concerned.
Sonia: The oil and gas sector is not in your top five sector holdings right now but last year you had exposure of more than 6-7 percent in that, have you booked profits in oil and gas?
A: Historically we have had reasonable amount of exposure to the gas sector or distribution space and we have taken some money off the table.
In the other part of the market it is fairly regulated and government has got significant amount of control out there. So it is not really a free market economy that you are actually operating in. So that is one of the reasons why we have not been significantly overweight on that particular space.
Latha: Where should one look for big returns or outsized market breaking returns? What are the parameters to identify the outperformers?
A: What currently the market lacks is essentially category leadership or stock leadership. So it is very difficult to identify one company that is going to actually pull this market through or a category that is actually going to pull this market through. In 2005-2008 you had the entire investment economy that led the markets. If you step backwards to the turn of the century you had IT that held through the entire environment.
As the situation stands we don’t see that kind of category leadership that exists on the ground for the market. So if you have to build that into a portfolio strategy I would rather still go extremely company specific but that is going to be a significant challenge when you run large size portfolios. But near term that has to be done. Hopefully participate with the market till you identify the category leadership and then actually ride with it. I don’t think that category is actually showing up to give you some significant amount of alpha on the ground at this point in time. Companies might be able to do it but when you run large portfolios it is going to be reasonably tough.
Latha: How is the trend looking here on, will you continue to have this big outperformance from midcaps?
A: I think you are looking at it from a point to point basis. So if you take from an all time low to right now yes these indices have given you market beating returns. But if you look at it from an entire cycle perspective they have gone down that dramatically before they have actually bounced back. So to put it differently these indices have come back and a lot of these companies have come back from bankruptcy kind of valuations to market level valuations which is what the market is essentially displaying at this point in time.
There is no significant valuation arbitrage from industry to industry perspective, there is no significant valuation arbitrage even from company to company specific. So if you have to build it forward any investor has to take execution risk on his portfolio and make sure that the company actually executes and has more market share and higher cash flow and disproportionate profitability within the sector itself.

BSE Sensex up 49 pts in early trade on fund inflows  reformhopesPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 10:49 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 4:35 pm

Camp Bastion has been the center of U.K. operations in Afghanistan since 2006. The handover of the base to Afghan control ends an important chapter in the 13-year Afghan campaign, which started after the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001.
UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement that the end of combat operations is being announced “with pride” and that Britain has helped give Afghanistan “the best possible chance of a stable future.”
But he told BBC’s Andrew Marr show that there is “no guarantee that Afghanistan is going to be stable and safe.”

He said the mission has succeeded in the sense that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists planning atrocities against Britain and the rest of Europe.
Fallon said Britain’s commitment to support Afghanistan will continue “through institutional development, the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, and development aid.”
Britain plans to withdraw its final combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year and is planning to give Afghan forces control of a base in Kandahar, the country’s second most populous city.

Attack on parliament  killing of soldier stun CanadaPrint
By Randall Palmer, David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The gunman in Wednesday's attack on Canada's capital had a criminal record and recently applied for a passport, planning to travel to Syria after undergoing a "radicalisation process," police said on Thursday.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a Canadian who may also have held Libyan citizenship, said Bob Paulson, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He said the suspect had no apparent links to another Canadian who killed a soldier in Quebec earlier in the week.
Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot a soldier at a national war memorial in the capital Ottawa on Wednesday before racing through the parliament building where he was shot dead near where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with lawmakers.
Born in Montreal to a father from Libya and a Canadian mother, Zehaf-Bibeau had gone on to live in Calgary and Vancouver, police said.
"We need to investigate and understand his radicalisation process. He is an interesting individual in that he had a very well developed criminality," Paulson said. "There is no one path or one formula to radicalisation."
The RCMP had only learned of the suspect's interest in travelling to Syria when it interviewed his mother on Wednesday, the commissioner said.
U.S. officials said on Wednesday they had been advised Zehaf-Bibeau was a convert to Islam, the same as the assailant in Monday's attack, Martin Rouleau, 25, who ran over two Canadian soldiers with his car. Both attackers were shot dead.
"We have no information linking the two attacks this week," Paulson told reporters in Ottawa, which remained on high security alert. He said police expected to swiftly determine whether Zehaf-Bibeau received support in planning his attack.
Zehaf-Bibeau had recently applied for a passport and had arrived in Ottawa on Oct. 2 to try to speed that process, but checks by the RCMP did not turn up any evidence of national security-related criminality despite criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities, Paulson said.
QUESTIONS ABOUT EMAIL
The commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau's email was found in the hard drive of someone charged with what he called a terrorist-related offence.
"We need to understand what that means and so when we say 'a connection' it is a sort of, you know, the weakest of connections. Clearly given what's happened it's strengthened by what's happened," Paulson said.
Zehaf-Bibeau was not one of a group of 93 people the RCMP are investigating as "high-risk travellers," he added.
Underscoring tensions on Thursday, armed police arrested a man who tried to approach the shooting site just as Harper, the prime minister, was laying a wreath to commemorate the slain soldier.
Harper said the attack would only strengthen Canada's response to "terrorist organizations."
On Tuesday, Canada sent six warplanes to the Middle East to participate in U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State militants who have taken over parts of Iraq.
Harper pledged to speed up a plan already under way to bolster Canadian laws and police powers in the areas of "surveillance, detention and arrest."
The attacks prompted U.S. officials to consider steps to tighten controls on the border with Canada and make it easier to revoke the passports of suspected militants, but officials cautioned the talks are in preliminary stages.
MOTHER'S APOLOGY
A woman who identified herself as the suspect's mother issued a statement earlier on Thursday apologising for her son's apparent actions.
"No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time," said the woman, Susan Bibeau, in a statement provided to the Associated Press. "We send our deepest condolences."
Zehaf-Bibeau stayed at a homeless shelter in a downtrodden part of Ottawa for at least a week before the attack, multiple people at the site said on Thursday.
A friend, Steve Sikich, who had lived with Zehaf-Bibeau at a Vancouver homeless shelter said Zehaf-Bibeau had rambled about wanting to travel to Libya and join the Islamic State. "He didn't seem like a bad guy," Sikich said.
Police have interviewed some of the people who were at the Ottawa shelter but none of the people with whom they spoke said they had any knowledge of his plans.
Tighter security was evident all over the sprawling parliamentary zone in downtown Ottawa.
The flag flying over Parliament's Centre Block, where the gunman had burst in on Wednesday morning, was at half mast and bullet holes could be seen in the carpet just inside the front door and in the masonry in the hallway.
As police hunted for Zehaf-Bibeau in the parliament building, Harper spent a few terrifying moments hiding in a closet-like space in the building, listening to a barrage of gunshots that one member of parliament thought was machine gun fire, the Winnipeg Free Press reported.
"Because we heard so many gunshots, the impression I had was there were several gunman outside with machine guns about to enter and spray the caucus," the paper quoted Jay Aspin, a member of parliament who was present, as saying. "It was pretty traumatic."

School secretary arrested in Bangalore child rape caseBangalore school secretary arrested in child rape case
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Fri 24 Oct, 2014
Print
Bangalore, Oct 24 (IANS) Karnataka Police Friday arrested the secretary of a society that runs a private school here, where a three-year-old student was allegedly raped, and registered criminal cases against its three office-bearers.
"We have registered a criminal case against K.R.K. Reddy, secretary of Sri Gowtham Academy of General & Technical Education Society, which runs Orchids The International School, in which the horrifying incident occurred, and arrested him for interrogation," Home Minister K.J. George told reporters here.
Besides Reddy, the society's three office bearers - president K. Durga, vice-president Y. Shilpa and joint secretary U. Surendra Babu - were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 on a complaint filed by state education department deputy director H.B. Manjunath in the jurisdictional police station Thursday.
"The accused have been running the school (Orchids) by flouting rules, violating laws and cheating the public, parents and about 900 students without any recognition from the state or central governments," George said.
On inspection, officials found that the society secured permission March 3, 2013 from the state government to run a primary school from class 1-5 in Kannada medium.
"In reality, the school has been running classes from pre-nursery to seventh class in English medium, claiming affiliation to the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), which is a gross violation and abuse of law," George said.
The society is alleged to have also collected huge sums of money from parents in the guise of donations and building fund by claiming that it was a recognised school.
Meanwhile, a special team set up to probe the incident, Friday questioned seven drivers of buses operated by the society to ferry students from their homes to the school.
"The investigation into the case is in progress. We have interrogated the school management, all male employees in the school, including PT (physical training) teachers, sports coaches and security persons," additional police commissioner (law and order) Alok Kumar told reporters.
Though the probe team, headed by assistant commissioner of police Sarah Fatima, detained the school's attender for questioning, Kumar said no arrest has been made as yet as the investigation is on.
"We have not arrested anyone so far in the main case but have been interrogating the 45-year-old attender on the basis of evidence collected such as his movements in the CCTV footage and what the victim told her parents, our women counsellers, who are part of the probe team," Alok Kumar added.
In a related development, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said stringent action would be taken against the school management and the guilty would be punished under the relevant law, including the Goonda Act, which was recently amended to include rape and sexual abuse of girls or children as serious crime.
The criminal case was registered late Tuesday under sections of the Pocso Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012) and section of the IPC on a complaint by the victim's father that his young daughter was molested while she was in the school.

Decoding the mindset of new generation of voters(The minor trends seem to…)
By Harish Nambiar
The elections in Maharashtra and Haryana have given the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) controlling stake in two of India's most urbanized states. However, those reading this as a resurgence of Hindu chauvinism may be using older benchmarks to plot out new trends.
There are indications that the elections in these two states might have more to do with the country's deepening democracy and a shift that was first available on television in 2002.
That was the year Dhirubhai Ambani died and the country saw a huge display of public mourning never seen before on the streets of Mumbai for an industrialist and businessman.
That singular event suggested that India's sensibility was changing course irreversibly from being a primarily socialist country to becoming an unabashedly capitalist one. The current elections might signal a similar shift in the country's political sensibility too.
More than two decades after economic reforms started, the idea of a polyphonic India has only now achieved critical mass. Across Bangalore, Gurgaon, Pune, Hyderabad as much as Kochi, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Nagpur, Jaipur and Vizag. You can see this as the slipstream that feeds the telecom services world, which of course it also is. Young men and women in these cities have given multiple fractures to any global idea of an Indian accent. And, in the process, they have strengthened the idea of India.
Speedy Urbanization
One of the reasons to be taken into account is India's speedy urbanization. A 2011 study, using the temporal satellite data and the latest census results by The Energy and Resources Institute India (TERI), says this country is riding the fastest urbanization process in the world with 12 cities expected to cross the 2.5-million mark by 2015.
Urbanisation's primary propeller is the opportunity to get a job and earn a living. But for refugees from oppression, the urban sprawl is also a warren of hope.
The romantic belief that citylights seduce rural folk with false hope is plain wrong. To a lot of individuals from smaller places — and not necessarily rural dalits, social outcasts and many such fugitives from a powerful majority consensus — the poverty and decrepitude of urban slums hold the one opportunity that rural poverty does not; it gives every sucker an even chance.
It is something that every country in our neck of the woods has been responding to. A 2012 World Bank report said south Asia as a whole was urbanizing at the speed of thought, despite vastly varying degrees of economic inequity.
"Pakistan is already 36% urban, India 31.16%, Bangladesh 30%, and even Nepal — south Asia's least urbanised country with a 20% share — is having to contend with a 5% annual urban population growth."
Political Shakeout
Maharashtra is the third most urbanized big state in India after Tamil Nadu and Kerala. As per the 2011 Census, 5.08 crore people in the state live in urban areas. Haryana's industries and proximity to New Delhi have made malls and cineplexes ubiquitous in the state.
It is these two states that are at the forefront of the Modi wave's residual effects. And both states have thrown up BJP-led governments. The BJP's aggressive canvassing has extended the Modi magic of last summer's Lok Sabha polls and achieved a political shakeout in these states. In that sense, the consolidation is based on a massive support for speedy development and the anger against the earlier government's seeming sloth.
However, there are smaller trends that may have not received due attention. And these trends show a decisive shift towards a market-set political value for politicians, parties and even social causes. In the notoriously cast-ridden Haryana, where the BJP is not as widespread as in Maharashtra, the saffronnites put up 25 Jat candidates. Jats have dominated Haryana politics for years. Only seven of the BJP's 47 MLAs are Jats.
Maharashtra's election was split wide open when the two primary political alliances parted on the eve of the polls. In the five-cornered elections, BJP emerged as the single largest party, but the election also confirmed the state's more varied political landscape. The incumbent Congress-NCP alliance retained a fair number of seats, but again some traditional calculations failed.
With the opening up of the political space, the Hyderabad-based Islamic party the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen ( MIM ) opened its account in the state with two seats out of the 24 it contested. Openly seeking only Muslim votes, the MIM's success suggests that it has thrown up a more transparent political counter to Hindu chauvinism. And reaped its reward.
If that is disheartening for those afraid of the rise of chauvinism and divisive politics, perhaps it bodes well that the party came a cropper in the three Muslim-dominated hotbeds of communal riots: Bhiwandi, Malegaon and Mumbra. These minor trends seem to indicate that Indian politics might decouple from the ideological alliance of the previous generation of voters.
Also, for a country set to be the world's youngest by 2020 with a median age of 29, when the Chinese median age would be 37, this demographic dividend would make India the biggest consumer market. And it bodes well that Indian voters are consuming their politics like they do their watches, shoes and bikes.

Tussle over Chief Minister post may hit BJPs image  fears RSSSave precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI/NAGPUR: BJP chief ministerial contender Devendra Fadnavis and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari , who has caused rumblings within the party because his supporters are demanding that he be made the CM, separately met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur within a few hours of each other on Friday night and Saturday.
That the selection of CM candidate should spark factionalism in the state BJP has "pained" the RSS leadership, a key Maharashtra BJP functionary admitted while talking to TOI on Saturday.
The recent show of strength by Gadkari's supporters and over 30 newly elected party MLAs from Vidarbha has not gone down well with the RSS top brass, he stated. "The RSS thinks groupism will take a heavy toll of the BJP's reputation and make it look like the Congress," he added.
So fire-fighting measures were the order of the day on Friday and Saturday as Gadkari met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur; that meeting, significantly, came hours after Fadnavis called on Bhagwat.
A helmetless Gadkari rode his two-wheeler from his Mahal residence to the RSS headquarters less than a km away sparking out a fresh controversy of alleged violation of traffic rule by a Union minister . What transpired at both the meetings is not known, but Gadkari after his hour-long call to the RSS headquarters admitted that politics was indeed discussed.
Fadnavis met Bhagwat on Friday evening when the RSS boss returned here after a weeklong north India tour attending the Sangh's national council meeting in Lucknow.
There are indications to suggest that the RSS wants Gadkari to stay put in Delhi and Fadnavis takes over the reins in the state. The two were advised accordingly by the RSS chief, sources said.
Fadnavis was told to keep Gadkari in the loop on crucial decisions respecting his seniority. The senior BJP leader was told that he had a crucial role to play at the Centre in coming days and it would be better for his political career to remain in Delhi.
It is believed that only after getting approval of the RSS, the party leadership finalized Fadnavis as the CM candidate though a formal meeting with the newly elected legislators to get their views is yet to happen.

Manohar Lal Khattar sworn-in as Haryana chief ministerbjp leader
(Haryana Governor administered…)
PANCHKULA (HARYANA): Manohar Lal Khattar , mentored by RSS and known for his organisational skills and clean image, today took oath as Haryana Chief Minister, leading the first BJP government in the state since it was created 48 years ago.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi , with whom 60-year-old Khattar shares proximity, BJP President Amit Shah, Union Ministers, veteran leaders L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi and Chief Ministers of four BJP ruled states were present as the ten-member ministry was sworn in at a ceremony here by Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki .
A first time MLA, Khattar, who has a four-decade-long association with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and BJP, is the first Punjabi to become the Chief Minister of the state.
Khattar is also the fifth non-Jat Chief Minister of the state and the first in last 18 years.
Six cabinet ministers, including a woman MLA Kavita Jain (Sonipat), and three Ministers of State (Independent Charge) were also sworn in at the event attended by a large number of people.
The five other Cabinet ministers sworn in are Haryana BJP President Ram Bilas Sharma (MLA from Mahendargarh), Abhimanyu (Narnaund), Om Parkash Dhankar (Badli), Anil Vij (Ambala Cantt) and Narbir Singh (Badshahpur).
Three Ministers of State (Independent Charge) - Vikram Singh Thekedar (Kosli), Krishan Kumar Bedi (Shahabad SC) and Karan Dev Kamboj (Indri) - were also sworn in.
A number of Union Ministers including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Harsh Vardhan, Maneka Gandhi, V K Singh, Ram Bilas Paswan, Ananth Kumar, Venkaiah Naidu, Krishan Pal Gujjar were present at the ceremony held at the Sector 5 HUDA Ground.
Opposition INLD was represented by Abhay Chautala. Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal whose party SAD had opposed the BJP and backed INLD during the assembly elections in Haryana despite being an NDA constituent also attended the ceremony.
On October 21, Khattar was elected leader of BJP Legislature Party, two days after the party created history in Haryana storming to power for the first time on its own in the state.
In a departure from past when swearing-in ceremonies were held at Chandigarh, this time the event was held at Panchkula.
Born in Rohtak district, Khattar, a bachelor who once wanted to become a doctor, had contested the first Assembly elections from Karnal wher he won by a margin of 63,736 votes.
He joined RSS as a full-time 'pracharak' in 1980 and after 14 years of service to the Sangh, Khattar was moved to BJP as party general secretary in Haryana in 1994.
Apart from his crucial role in the party's success in states like Punjab, Haryana and Chhattisgarh, he was given prominent roles in various elections in different states where he always delivered results.
Bhajan Lal was the last non-Jat Chief Minister who held office from 1991 to 1996. After his exit Bansi Lal, Om Parkash Chautala (twice) and Bhupinder Singh Hooda (twice) were the Chief Ministers.
Earlier, B D Sharma, Rao Birender Singh, B D Gupta and Bhajan Lal were the other non-Jat Chief Ministers of Haryana, which was carved out as a separate state in 1966.
In the October 15 assembly polls, the saffron party won 47 seats while the rest were shared by INLD (19), Congress (15) and HJC-BL (2). BSP and SAD got one seat each while five were won by Independents.

India is the 4th largest downloader of pirated moviesBollywood
(Hollywood studios fear…)
India is not yet a box-office goldmine for Hollywood; far from it actually — the market share of Hollywood movies is still only 10%. Nonetheless, Hollywood studios consider India an important market thanks to a growing audience for its movies and TV shows (the top 10 Hollywood films of the 53 released in India in 2013 made a total of Rs 323 crore and the theatrical growth in India is estimated at 12% a year). Annoyingly for the studios, not every fan watches movies legitimately. But the fight against piracy has lost its sting because Bollywood , which was once leading the fight, is now almost aloof after many of its movies began making Rs 100 crore and more at the box office. That has left the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), a body representing six Hollywood studios, to almost single-handedly lobby for tougher laws on piracy in India. MPAA has also been knocking on government doors to make it easier for Hollywood studios to shoot movies in India. Frank Rittman, MPAA senior vice-president and deputy managing director and regional policy officer, Asia- Pacific, a 25-year veteran in the field of copyright in the music and film industry, says by enhancing its position as a shooting destination, India would be boosting tourism and local economies. As for the fight against piracy, Rittman, who doesn't step out "at night chasing down the bad guys", prefers to educate people rather than clamp down on them. Edited excerpts from an interview with Binoy Prabhakar.
How important a market is India for Hollywood movies?
It is a tremendously important market. By and large, Indian audiences prefer Indian movies. But the country offers great growth potential. More and more [Hollywood] studios are getting involved with local counterparts.
We hardly hear anything about piracy in India. Why is that?
It is actually a big concern. We have historically had a problem with camcording in the region. As recently in 2012, India was leading the region in terms of what we call forensic matches. When we go out to look for pirated DVDs, we could trace them back to the theatres where they were recorded. That said, we view exhibitors as our partners in this respect. The point of identifying perpetrators is that we can go back to the theatres and say, 'Hey, look, we got a problem here.' We did have some targeted investigations which resulted in pretty wellpublicized raids last year. India still ranks high in terms of quantitative measurement in DVD piracy, internet piracy — you name it — because of its [huge] population. But the concerns have migrated towards digital technology and the number of users accessing internet for illegal downloads of movies.
So what is driving piracy?
Online piracy is an ingrained behaviour and to a large degree, it is a generational thing. We are making progress, with young people getting the message. As kids, we saved money, went to the store, bought a record and took it home to listen. Today's kids don't know what that is.
Pirates have always been ingenious. You clamp down on one illegal site or one method, they come up with new ways...
When I joined MPAA in 2001, the single biggest concern in the Asia-Pacific was illegal optical discs. Factories were at work making pieces of plastic over and above any possible legitimate demand. Before that, it was VHS [video home system]. There is a continuous evolution in this field. From old-fashioned tape recordings to DVDs, we have digital files now which can be operated pretty much out of any country with technology that can be set up in such a way that they [pirates] can outdo the law.
How do you fight these evolving methods?
There is no single bullet... there isn't any technological fix that will be 100% effective. No matter what lock you devise to put on the door, somebody is going to get through. Having said that, putting a decent lock on the door will deter 80% of the people. About 10% of the population is always going to [illegally] take the content no matter how reasonably priced it is. They do it because they can. So education is a huge part of how we address our concerns. We are trying to create awareness about the value of the creativity and availability of legitimate content. We can talk about losses suffered by industry but not a lot of people have sympathy. What will resonate better will be messages about what kind of malaware gets into computers when they download illegal content.
Is that to say harsher penalties and longer jail terms don't work?
There are really bad guys profiting hugely from piracy and we need to have the full weight of the government after them. But as far as going after individuals, we and the music industry are aware that is not very popular in public opinion. That doesn't really change things.

Croatia s capital Zagreb is the city with a million heartsTraditional licitar hearts, Baroque buildings, spectacular museums and ancient churches — Croatia’s capital Zagreb throbs to different beats. It even has a place for the broken hearted
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Anita Rao-Kashi
I see them for the first time almost as soon as I begin wandering around the city — bright, shiny, plump, deep red hearts. They are everywhere in multiple sizes, hanging on strings, decorated with white trimmings and delectable. I quickly realize why Zagreb — Croatia's capital — is called the city with a million hearts. Called licitars, akin to gingerbread, they are an integral part of Croatian culture and a symbol of Zagreb; they are gifted during times of celebration, be it weddings, birthdays or Christmas. But more than anything else, they symbolize the warmth and energy running through the city itself. And everywhere I go, the heart is a leitmotif that manifests itself in a hundred different intangible ways.
Old World Charm
Standing on the cusp of central and western Europe, straddling the historical and the modern, Zagreb is full of stories and monuments that mark the passage of time. Divided into lower and upper towns, Old Zagreb is quite compact and almost all the sights are within walking distance. The Lower Town (Donji Grad) is a grid of beautiful Baroque buildings housing museums and galleries, characterized by the influence of the Austro-Hungarian empire interspersed with lovely green parks, while the hilly Upper Town (Gornji Grad), accessed by a quaint and pretty funicular, is marked by a plethora of churches, cobblestoned streets and the distinctive feel of a bygone era with gas street lamps and the heaviness of history.
Heart of the Matter
It is debatable where the heart of the Upper Town lies. The 13th century Romanesque Church of St Mark with its roof of spectacularly colourful ceramic tiles depicting the flags of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia is eye-catching. More so because it forms the background for the elaborate changing of guard ceremony every weekend. I stand mesmerized as nattily dressed soldiers accessorized with the famous cravat (which originated in Croatia and gradually evolved into the neck tie) march up and down and switch places.
If the church is eye-catching, the Zagreb Cathedral, its twin spires towering over almost the entire city, is equally arresting. Built in neo-Gothic style with Renaissance walls, the inside is dominated by massive chandeliers which throw light over beautiful sculptures on the walls and stained glass windows. I am there when the evening mass is in progress and the whole place reverberates with hymns and an air of piety.
Unarguably, the heart of Zagreb's history and heritage lies in the Upper Town's Zagreb City Museum. Tucked away amid narrow streets flanked by magnificent buildings, the museum is housed in the former convent of St Clare. It is easy to spend more than a couple of hours there, tracing the city's history from the Iron Age through various phases and ending with the turbulent communist era and the eventual disintegration of Yugoslavia .
Art and Craft
In Zagreb's Lower Town, the heart beats to several different rhythms. The streets are in a perfect grid pattern, containing a plethora of museums housed in beautiful heritage structures. Each is more mesmerising than the other, and I wander around, unable to decide which ones I want to see.
My choices include the Arts and Crafts Museum housed in a 19th century building in Marshal Tito Square, a rich treasure trove of history and heritage with over 1,00,000 artifacts. Adjacent to it is the neo-Baroque style Croatian National Theatre which gathers under its roof opera, ballet and drama, in contemporary and classic styles from within Croatia as well as outside.
A few minutes away, in King Tomislav Square stands the elegant Art Pavilion which was originally in Budapest but was dismantled, transported and re-assembled in Zagreb. Opposite this is the main railway station, Glavni Kolodvor, built in a mix of Renaissance and Neo-Classical elements and is rumoured to have been specially constructed to suit the glamour and elegance of the legendary Orient Express.
Next door is of course the magnificent Hotel Esplanade, built in 1925 especially for the passengers of the Orient Express. But I opt for the Mimara Museum in Roosevelt Square, a brooding Neo-Renaissance palace, housing art from ancient Egypt and Greece to masters such as Raphael, Rembrandt , Rubens, Goya and Velasquez.

Overnight, Oscar Pistorius went from an athlete of global fame to qaidi number something. Yes, he shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp , last year on what just happened to be Valentine's Day, but it was a misunderstanding, okay? The double-amputee South African sprinter thought she was next to him fast asleep, but didn't wait to check or call out, no whisper-whisper, nudge-nudge to the other person occupying the bed, and he doesn't have legs in the first place but had too much money at last count and the gun kind of went off, oops, not once, but four times. Bang bang bang bang.
Pistorius knows he's been a bad boy, but prison, a real prison bars and all? Jailed exactly a month before his 28th birthday for five years, he, his family and lawyers protest about him being a sitting duck, literally and metaphorically, in a place filled with hard-core criminals. They fear he will be killed, sodomised, gang-raped or contract AIDS — not in that order.
A photogenic model and a sports hero, both under 30 — the stuff of fairy tale front-page headlines. A crime of passion, the world decided, typing up a storm, with gory pictures to boot. In a world where two-legged men routinely bash up their girlfriends, it is thinkable that a man without legs could whip out a gun in a jealous haze.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
by Alok Kejriwal
When I was mandated by ET Magazine to 'test drive' some of the popular dating apps and write about the ones that I picked, I kinda gulped. I mean, here I was — a 45-year-old hooked and booked dude who was expected to go out pretending to be looking for dates on mobile apps.
The doubt didn't last for long and soon turned into a smile. After all, I remembered my favourite character of all times — Shylock (from The Merchant of Venice) and how he could trade anything for anything. So what if I was supposed to pretend to be a 'Merchant of Love' for a few days? It was possible that I would earn my pound of... learnings, if nothing else!
ACT I, SCENE I: Getting Inside
I downloaded a few dating apps and tried registering, quite methodically. A relatively new app called Woo that has been making a bit of a noise on the circuit, rejected me outright. What had I done wrong? I looked carefully at the registration process and discovered my faux pas. I had signed-in using my Facebook ID that had automatically declared my marital status (married, obviously) to the Woo servers. Hmm — I guess the servers didn't like married men and came back with a silly, "Woo accepts only limited signups. We will come back to you when a slot opens up".
Heck — why couldn't the app simply tell me that married men were not allowed?
Was "love ever supposed to be delayed?" I could have changed my Facebook profile to a fake one but that wouldn't seem genuine. So I said boo to Woo and went on to the other apps.
The ones that seemed to 'accept' me as I am were OkCupid (ranked in 142 countries on the iTunes stores), Zoosk (ranked in 155 countries on iTunes) and Tinder (ranked in 149 countries on iTunes). It seemed that I had chosen apps that were the best in the world (they had chosen me too) and I was ready to go on some serious date-hunting.
ACT I, SCENE II: Getting Started
Registering using Facebook was the easy part. Adding a picture (typically the same that I was using on Facebook) was a breeze. The process that really challenged me was replying to the questions that were a part of the 'profiling' of the dating apps.
The question and multiple answer section seemed like a never-ending treadmill that made me more and more tired plus surprised after every question I answered.
For instance, imagine my reaction when I was asked, "STALE is to STEAL is 89475 to...?"This was a question in a dating app that was supposed to match people for compatibility! Other awesome questions asked included: "How often do you brush your teeth?"
"Do you think the government should limit chain stores to give small businesses a chance?"
"Overall, has capitalism made the world a better place?"
The killer question was:
"If you were to die, would whoever goes through your personal belongings be shocked by what he/she finds?" I grimaced and thought that the agenda using these apps was planning my life to get more romantic — not derisking my death?!
Takeaway: Dating via these apps didn't appear to be about meeting someone, getting butterflies in your stomach and wondering for weeks if she likes you. Sure, profiling and creating deep insights could be logical for digital match-making, but the process seemed to be like a postmortem of my heart and mind.
PS: The answer to "STALE is to STEAL is 89475 to...?" is 89547. If you didn't get it, I refuse to date you.
ACT II, SCENE I: Getting Hooked
The Merchant of Venice is a play built around events that occur when Bassanio (a young Venetian nobleman) borrows 3,000 ducats from his wealthy merchant friend Antonio to woo (no pun intended) the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia.
If there were no Portia, there would be no Merchant of Venice. In the dating apps that I downloaded, there seemed to be many Portias waiting to be wooed.
If you diligently answered the profiling questions asked (I counted over 50), gave accurate information and didn't shy away from being honest, a 'menu' of lots of interesting, attractive and likable 'dates' would begin to show up as people eligible for you to chase.
Now, back to The Merchant of Venice (If you haven't read it, please buy a copy and send me the bill. I will fund your read) — the beautiful Portia is aggressively wooed by suitors; but her father has left a will stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets — one each of gold, silver and lead in order to win her. If the suitor picked the right casket, he got Portia. The first suitor, the luxurious Prince of Morocco, chose the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire" as referring to Portia. Tsk, tsk, foolish fellow.
The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chose the silver casket, which proclaimed, "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves", imagining himself to be full of merit. Obviously he did not win Portia either. Paagal!
Both suitors left empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." The last suitor was Bassanio, whom Portia wished to have as a husband, having met him before. As Bassanio pondered his choice, members of Portia's household sang a song which prompted Bassanio to disregard "outward shows" and "ornament" and choose the lead casket, winning Portia's hand.
Mota moti (old Marwari saying), Bassanio was humble and not averse to betting all that he had to win his love. And he won!
Now, the co-relation of this long story and the dating apps I reviewed?
Each of the damsels (Portias) in the dating apps had set up their own 'caskets' of questions that needed to be answered by potential suitors if they hoped to win their love!
A pretty lady whom I 'winked' at (errr...just a button called 'wink' that you click) replied saying, "Winks are flattering. Now, if you are interested, tell me why YOU are interesting!"
A rather aggressive date-in-the-waiting wrote, "Thanks for noticing me. Now, what do you wanna talk about?" Even before I hazarded a reply, I noticed her profile which mentioned, "Nobody is perfect — I am nobody. I love lying about my age. I wish I could date Sting [the singer], but since he is busy with his wife, I can give you a chance..."
Oh Boy! If Portia's father were alive, he would have simply asked these suitors to download these apps and try and win Portia.
Acknowledging that I was no Bassanio, I exited this casket part of the game with empty hands.
Takeaway: Dating apps are competitive! Just like board meetings and sales pitches, the women I seemed to have been 'matched with' were so demanding in their approach that I gave up and set my goals to pleasing my VCs instead.
ACT II, SCENE II: Getting Booked
Shylock was the quintessential Marwari. Always talked trade, money, interest, compound interest, business and profits. Above all, a very smart entrepreneur.
It was no surprise that he readily loaned Antonio money sensing a larger opportunity at hand. Shylock was interested in trapping Antonio first and then extracting much more value from him.
The dating apps that I encountered (created by some of the most ingenious entrepreneurs in the world) were even more clever and scheming.
In Zoosk, for instance, all the potential women dates I was presented were open to 'chat' with. I quickly sent safe, "How are you... Nice profile pic" type of messages to at least eight damsels.
In a few hours, I was very surprised (and pleased) to have received notifications saying that each of the women had replied to my message. I was curious to their level of interest in me and quickly fired up the app to read their replies. But to my utter shock, I learnt that while sending messages was free, reading the replies received from the dates required a 'subscription' account. And the minimum amount to acquire a subscription was Rs 1,000!!!
In my enthusiasm (and endeavour to honestly report the findings to you), I paid up. I became Antonio. I slipped. I succumbed. And very quickly learnt that I had been fooled. It turned out that none of these women had replied to me personally; instead an 'auto-responder' they had set up had broadcast some canned messages back to me.
Shucks.
Other 'Shylockesque' tricks included a feature that let you know "if she had read the message" you sent (to potential dates). And this was not part of the subscription! It required coins to unlock (these coins needed to be further purchased — for a minimum `850). As I prowled the Apps of Love, my profile was suddenly pronounced as 'highly unpopular' and was graphically depicted as a gas tank that was below the 'E' mark. How sad I felt. Of course, the way to fill up the tank was to pay more money!
Shylock would have loved to meet these app creators! There were options to 'Mega Flirt' that allowed me to send a tsunami of a hand-picked message to lots of dates.(A canned message I particularly liked was, "Why aren't you in jail? It's illegal to look that good.") Another really interesting trap was to 'look for dates in your area' — cleverly using a mobile phone's geo locater to show people close to each other.
All said and done, I barely received any signs of love, save alone a potential date. And reasonably so. I guess that the apps and its users had cleverly figured out that this guy was not around for the real deal. Further proving that the apps were really doing a good job!
Takeaway: ( for me, personally): Love was not really meant to be an app. Meeting people to date was not supposed to be an algorithm. Was it something else then? Maybe the chase was more meaningful than the prize? The excitement of wooing and getting wooed?
To quote Gratiano (a friend of Bassanio): "All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd."

A comcast executive raises doubts about streaming servicesA comcast executive raises doubts about streaming services
By New York Times | 24 Oct, 2014, 09.15PM IST
Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, said he was surprised by announcements last week that both HBO and CBS would start subscription streaming services.

By Emily Steel
Comcast, the country's largest cable operator, predicts that television groups like HBO and CBS will face steep challenges introducing streaming services that do not require cable subscriptions and that people will continue to pay for bundles of television and Internet services in the years to come.
Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, said he was surprised by announcements last week that both HBO and CBS would start subscription streaming services. He said HBO risks "cannibalizing" its existing, profitable business because the premium TV network would have a hard time luring new streaming subscribers while not cutting into its base of customers who pay for cable or satellite subscriptions. CBS has long been a defender of established television business models, he said.
"I don't think distributing to consumers via the Internet is an easy thing to do," Burke said during a conference call Thursday. "I think it's a voyage that if you're successful, like Netflix, can be a way to create a lot of value, but it's not an easy thing to do."
The comments came as Comcast, the cable and entertainment conglomerate, reported a 12 percent increase in adjusted earnings in the third quarter, propelled by growth in the company's high-speed Internet business and the NBC broadcast television network.
Total revenue increased 4 percent, to $16.8 billion, compared with the same period last year, the company reported Thursday.
Net income for the quarter was $2.63 billion, up 49.7 percent from the year-earlier period because of the one-time addition of income tax adjustments and other items. Excluding those additions, earnings per share increased 12.3 percent to 73 cents.
In recent days, questions about the health of the cable business have loomed over Comcast and its rivals after the announcements by both HBO and CBS. The introduction of these new options for watching TV has caused concerns that more people will cancel their cable subscriptions, or never subscribe at all, because they would be able to watch the shows they wanted to watch - when and how they wanted to watch them - via the Web.
HBO and CBS executives have said the new services would not cannibalize their business, but rather provide a new route to distribute their programming to people who don't subscribe to traditional TV packages. "We simply don't believe that an HBO stand-alone product is anything other than a win-win for us and for our distributors," Richard Plepler, chief executive of HBO, said in a statement. "This isn't cannibalization, it's growth."
Cable companies like Comcast have started selling more flexible subscription offerings beyond the standard bundles of television networks they sell. Comcast executives pointed to its "Internet Plus" offering as an example. The service includes a smaller television package, HBO and high-speed Internet service.
"All companies are trying to figure out how to reach all customers," said Brian L. Roberts, chief executive of Comcast. "Our existing business model is very strong this quarter, last quarter, and probably future quarters will show that many people want these bundles."
Cable companies also are placing an increased emphasis on selling Internet service, which viewers need to watch streaming video.
Comcast has said its Internet business at some point will overtake its video business, and that tipping point is likely to occur soon. Comcast has about 22.4 million video customers and 21.6 million high-speed Internet customers.

Panchkula (Haryana), Oct 26:  
Manohar Lal Khattar, a low-profile organisation man with active RSS background, was today sworn in as the Chief Minister of Haryana, where BJP has formed government for the first time on its own.
60-year-old Khattar, a first-time MLA from Karnal and a non-Jat leader known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was administered the oath along with nine ministers by Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki at a function here attended by a galaxy of BJP leaders including the PM, party chief Amit Shah, Union Ministers, Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states and veterans L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.
The six Cabinet ministers are Kavita Jain, state BJP president Ram Bilas Sharma, Abhimanyu, Om Parkash Dhankar, Anil Vij and Narbir Singh. Three others — Vikram Singh Thekedar, Krishan Kumar Bedi and Karan Dev Kamboj — are ministers of state (independent charge).
Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, whose party SAD had opposed the BJP during the Assembly elections despite being an NDA constituent, also attended the ceremony.
Among Union Ministers who were present were Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Power Minister Piyush Goyal, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Minister of Shipping and Transport Krishan Pal Gujjar, Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh and Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar.
Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states, including Madhya Pradesh’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vasundhara Raje from Rajasthan and Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel, were also present on the occasion.
In a departure from the past, the oath-taking function was held at Panchkula instead of Chandigarh, the common capital of both Haryana and Punjab.
Khattar is Haryana’s first non-Jat chief minister in nearly two decades. Jats have for long dominated politics in the State.

Working to Recover Loans From Kingfisher Airlines: Private BanksAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: Private sector banks, which have shied away from tagging Kingfisher Airlines chairman Vijay Mallya a 'wilful defaulter' as some key public sector lenders have done, say that they are exploring "all options" to recover their loans.
At least two banks, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank and the south-based Federal Bank, have said they have not classified KFA, Mallya and his senior officials as wilful defaulters.
"We have not classified them as wilful defaulters as yet," Axis Bank executive director in charge of corporate banking V Srinivasan said.
The exposure, declared as bad loan long time back, is very small, he said, adding that the bank had an exposure of Rs 50 crore to the airlines that has not flown since October 2012.
Its peer Federal Bank has also not declared the liquor baron Mallya as "a wilful defaulter", the bank's managing director and chief executive Shyam Srinivasan said.
The bank is engaged in negotiations with the airline and is considering "all options" of recourse to recover its outstanding, he said.
The bank has been able to recover around 12 per cent of its total exposure of Rs 90 crore till now, he added.
Country's largest private sector lender ICICI Bank had sold its Rs 430-crore exposure to an arm of the Kolkata-based Srei Infrastructure Finance. The status on that exposure, which reportedly had the best of collaterals, is not immediately known.
The wilful defaulter tag, dreaded by the industry, is designed to impact the top management's ability to raise any loan in the future, even in the case of other companies where they hold directorships.

TOPICS
Haryana
The first non-Jat Chief Minister of Haryana in two decades, Mohan Lal Khattar was sworn in on Sunday in the presence of almost the entire frontline leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other BJP leaders at the function included L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Radha Mohan, Anant Kumar, Harsh Vardhan. Also present were Punjab Governor Shivraj Patil, Chief Ministers of States ruled by the BJP and its allies — Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Raman Singh, Anandiben Patel, Vasundhara Raje and Parkash Singh Badal.
This was the first time that the swearing-in ceremony was held in the ‘Mela ground’ in Panchkula instead of the customary Haryana Raj Bhavan.
Apart from Mr. Khattar, Ram Bilas Sharma, Captain Abhimanyu Singh, Om Prakash Dhankar, Anil Vij, Narvir Singh and Kavita Jain were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers; Bikram Singh Thekedar, Krishan Kumar and Karan Dev Kamboj were inducted as Ministers of State.
Shuns limelight
Known as a key strategist of the BJP who avoids the spotlight, Mr. Khattar has worked closely with Mr. Modi as his deputy, when the latter was in charge of Haryana affairs before becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Mr. Khattar is also said to have organised major relief activities during the Bhuj earthquake and managed the party’s campaign in a major portion of Varanasi during the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.

JSPL slips nearly 6% as CBI launches probe for mining in Saranda forests
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 11.36AM IST
(JSPL said it would respond…)
NEW DELHI: Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) slipped nearly as much as 5.6 per cent in trade on Monday, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun a probe into how Congress leader Naveen Jindal's company got permission from the environment ministry under Jayanti Natarajan in 2013 to mine iron ore in Asia's largest sal forest in the Naxal-affected Saranda area of Jharkhand.
At 09:20 a.m.; JSPL was trading 4.2 per cent lower at Rs 158.75. It hit a low of Rs 156.35 and a high of Rs 160.10 in trade today.
However, JSPL in a statement mailed to IANS, said it would respond to the CBI's preliminary enquiry (PE) registered Friday over the company's alleged diversion of forest land.
Responding to an ET query a JSPL spokesperson said "we have only come to know of the preliminary enquiry through media reports."
"JSPL reiterates that we have always co-operated with the investigative agencies and will respond when we receive these queries from the investigative authorities," added the report.
Sources told ET the JSPL project in the Saranda forests was taken up for discussion in the Cabinet Committee on Investments and cleared in May 2013.
The project was cleared by the CCI, the sources maintained. CBI sources said the Forest Advisory Committee in 2011 had considered JSPL's mining project but noted that the forest of Saranda is part of the core area of the Singhbhum reserve, one of the finest habitats for elephants, added the ET report.

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
The rupee ended on Monday a tad weaker at 61.31 against the dollar amid a narrow movement and weak domestic equity markets as European banks fail the stress test. However, improved sentiment from upbeat US data and smaller-than-feared capital shortfalls at European banks limited the fall in the rupee.
The domestic unit’s previous close was at 61.28 on Wednesday. Currency markets remained closed on Thursday and Friday on account of festival.
On Monday, the unit opened stronger at 61.19 after which it declined to 61.36 per dollar offset by weaker local shares and caution ahead of the US central bank decision.
The US Federal bank’s meeting ending on Wednesday is expected to end its government bond purchases, while giving accompanying assurances that it will respond if a global downturn threatens the US economy.
Analysts fear this could impact the emerging market currencies including the rupee adversely.
Call rates and Bonds
The interbank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short term funds from one another, ended at 8.25 per cent. Intra-day, it moved in the 8.00 per cent to 8.80 per cent range.
The yield on 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, ended at a year’s low of 8.31 per cent (last seen in September 2013) from the previous close of 8.35 per cent. The price of the security ended at Rs 100.53.

Wipro slips for second session after Q2 results

(The company sees Q3 IT services…)
MUMBAI: IT major Wipro declined for second straight session after its second quarter results were below street expectations. After correcting 4 per cent on muhurat trading session, the stock slipped over 2 per cent in early trade.
The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,085 crore during July-September quarter, down 0.9 per cent, against Rs 2,103.2 crore in previous quarter.
"Wipro reported weaker than expected performance for Q2FY15, with revenue and margin missing the expectation. Moreover, the guidance was softer than PLe/Consensus expectation," said Prabhudas Lilladher report.
Sales in during the quarter increased to Rs 11,816 crore, up 12.4 per cent, from Rs 10,508.3 crore, QoQ.
The company sees Q3 IT services revenues at $1,808-1,842 million. Q2 EBIT margins stood at 22 per cent vs 22.8 per cent, QoQ.
The management is still confident of improving growth momentum in H2FY15 on the back of large deal wins.
"We assign high probability to H2 FY15 being materially better than H1 FY15 in terms of overall absolute profitability. Uncertainty around growth trajectory has precluded company's valuation from re-rating and therefore stock has been a relative underperformer," said IIFL report.
"So another good thing is that valuation is quite inexpensive at 12.9x FY17 P/E. We upgrade our rating on Wipro to Buy with a higher 9-12 month target price of Rs 652," the report added.
At 09:50 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 554.85, down 1.05 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 557.95 and a low of Rs 548 in trade today.

DLF Falls 8%, a Day after New Haryana Minister Says Vadra Land Deals Will be Probed
NDTV | Updated On: October 27, 2014 16:49 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
DLF shares faced sharp selloff on Monday after a newly-inducted Haryana minister said the BJP government will investigate land deals of the previous Congress government.
Anil Vij, a Cabinet Minister in the new Haryana government, told PTI on Sunday, "Nearly 70,000 acres of land was acquired from farmers and sold at high profits. We will order probe and anyone found guilty, be it any official, Robert Vadra or (former Chief Minister) Bhupinder Singh Hooda or anyone else, will not be spared." ( Read the full story here )
In the run up to the assembly elections, BJP and other parties had attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal. The 2008 deal involved the sale of a 3.5 acre land by Mr Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, to DLF.
In 2012, senior Haryana bureaucrat Ashok Khemka cancelled the mutation of the land deal alleging that the rules were bent for Mr Vadra on account of his hefty connections. Mr Khemka was transferred three days later.
The Haryana government said an inquiry had found Mr Khemka's allegations to be baseless. In July this year, the mutation was sanctioned by the state government.
DLF was among the top losers in the 50-share Nifty. It ended 7.88 per cent lower at Rs 110.50 on the NSE and underperformed the broader realty-sub index on the NSE, which declined 3.9 per cent. ( Track stock )
Monday's selloff comes at a time when India's largest property developer is already under huge pressure following a ban by market regulator Sebi, which has barred DLF from tapping capital markets for three years. ( Read )
The ban is a blow to the heavily-indebted real estate firm because it will now not be able to raise money using equity or debt instruments regulated by Sebi.
DLF has sought interim relief from Securities Appellate Tribunal against Sebi's ban and the next hearing on the matter is slated for October 30. ( Read the full story )

Singapore introduces pre-departure video for migrant workersSingapore introduces ‘pre-departure video’ for migrant workers
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 27:  
A 14-minute ‘Pre-Departure Video’ has been made by the Singapore government for its migrant workers including Indians, explaining the proper employment practices and workers’ rights in the country to help them avoid getting duped by rogue agents and employers.
The video is one of the latest initiatives by the Singapore Manpower Ministry and Migrant Workers Centre (MWC) to make workers aware of their rights even before they step into the country, The Straits Times reported today.
“It is important now that we put in place this ’Pre-Departure Video’ to let them understand more about how and what and when they come to Singapore, what kind of rights they have,” said Yeo Guat Kwang, chairman of MWC.
“Because many of them told us before they come, they are already locked in with a big sum of money. And at the same time, they really do not know the terms and conditions that they will face when they come to Singapore and work,” he said.
MWC said that while some organisations can seek recourse for abuses that take place in Singapore, there is little they can do to recover overpaid agency fees done overseas.
A two-minute trailer of the “MWC Pre-Departure Video” was screened at a Diwali celebration event yesterday evening, which was attended by about 5,000 migrant workers who received free dinner, the report said.
The event was held at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Little India where the December 2013 riot involving migrant workers broke out.
MWC said it aims to make the videos available in the workers’ home countries, at places like the overseas Construction Skills Testing Centres.
In Singapore, the organisation plans to screen the videos in workers’ dormitories, and on board buses that ferry migrant workers to and from their dormitories and work places, the report said.
The video will be made available in the workers’ native languages, especially those from India, Bangladesh and China, who are often vulnerable to such employment malpractices, it added.

Brent drops $86 on Goldman price cut forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Electricity Act to get a facelift forreformThe government has proposed some key changes in the Electricty Act to remedy the situation and prevent the loss-ridden sector. (Reuters)
New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 10:57 am
With a decade’s existence of the Electricity Act of 2003 doing precious little in infusing efficiency and competition into the sector, the government has proposed some key changes in the Act to remedy the situation and prevent the loss-ridden sector, which is struggling to meet the reformist conditions of a financial restructuring package (FRP), from plumbing fresh depths.
The Union power ministry’s draft amendments to the Act, to be placed before the Cabinet soon, seek to separate “carriage from content”— meaning there will be separate licences for the wire business and the actual supply of electricity — with a provider-of-last-resort (POLR) facility, in what could eventually pave the way for open access for ordinary consumers.
Click here for graph
While open access for even bulk buyers, despite the 2003 Act providing for it, has rarely been achieved due to the prohibitive surcharges levied by the regulators, the ministry now proposes to make open access mandatory for buyers with a load of of 1 MW and more.
According to the draft amendments, to start with, the distribution network business and supply business of the extant discom in an area will be separated with dual licensing. While for the initial one year, there will only be functional separation with common ownership, subsequently, ownership will also be segregated and additional supply licences will be given to new players. Initially, the incumbent supply licencee only will have universal service obligation (USO). This means a consumer can resort to him if other suppliers fail. Over a period of three years from the grant of licence, each supplier will also have the USO, so that consumers are not deprived of supply, even while having the freedom to switch from one supplier to another, in search of cheaper and quality power.
Experts welcomed the move saying it’ll help bring down tariffs but added that to perform the role of POLR, licencees must be given incentives as in other countries where open access at the retail power distribution level is a reality. “POLR should have recourse to a Fund which the regulator will create by way of some levy to make good any loss that could be suffered by him due to this responsibility,” said Kameshwar Rao, leader, energy, utilities and mining at PwC India. Although there are concerns over a proposal to deprive bulk consumers using open access of the services of PLOR, Rao said since suppliers usually compete to rope in large consumers, it might not be problem.
What’s important is how ably various state regulators enforce the provisions, analysts said, citing the unimpressive track record of most of them in meeting obligations under the 2003 Act like reduction in cross-subsidisation and ensuring procurement from renewable energy continued…

DLF slips over 8% on reports of probe by BJPAnil Vij
(Senior cabinet minister…)
MUMBAI: Shares of realty giant DLF slumped over 8 per cent today, wiping-out Rs 1,674.7 crore from its market value, on concerns that the company may face probe by the new government in Haryana.
DLF's scrip plunged 7.84 per cent to settle at Rs 110.50 on the BSE. During the day, it tumbled 9 per cent to Rs 109.10.
At the NSE, it slumped 8.30 per cent to close the day at Rs 110.
Led by the dip in the stock, the company's market value fell by Rs 1,674.7 crore to Rs 19,690.30 crore.
The fall in DLF shares, to as low as Rs 109.10 in intra-day trade at the BSE, follows a major plunge of 28 per cent in a single day earlier this month after a Sebi order barred the company and six others from accessing the capital markets for three years.
The Sebi order has been challenged by DLF before the Securities Appellate Tribunal which would next hear the case on October 30.
While the stock had recovered some lost ground last week after being hit by Sebi order, it fell further today after reports suggested that it may face probe in Haryana.
Hours after taking oath, two new ministers in Haryana yesterday said the BJP government would order a thorough probe into the alleged land scams and not spare anyone, even Robert Vadra or former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda .
DLF has a significant presence in Haryana and is credited with creation of India's largest township set up by a private player in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital.
Notably, BJP and other parties had in the run up to the assembly polls attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal.
There have been reports about alleged irregularities in land dealings between Robert Vadra and DLF.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi while campaigning for BJP in Haryana had also kept the alleged land scams in the state at the centre of his attack.
The new ministers' remarks, however, drew sharp reactions from the Congress, which said that such statements show the arrogance of Haryana government.

Ashok Leyland may go to Rs 47.50: Hemant Thukral08:00 am
Hemant Thukral of Aditya Birla Money told CNBC-TV18, "Autos have been doing fairly well again. They have been showing buying interest at every lower levels and  Ashok Leyland especially because of two reasons, one technically everybody would be talking because the stock has now clearly crossed and sustained above Rs 45. Secondly, the way the open interest is being added up already and the way the rollovers are going up, so the rollovers are happening at a much higher cost than the average.”
“So what I see here is that if it doesn’t break Rs 44.50 on the downside, there is some more room on the upside left towards that Rs 47.50. So definitely Ashok Leyland qualifies one of the good trading stocks in auto but overall auto pack especially the two-wheelers also are looking quite strong,” he added.

Yahoo Movies Review: Happy New YearCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah, Jackie Shroff
Direction: Farah Khan
 
Rating: ***1/2
Will ‘Happy New Year’ make big money? Most definitely.  Are there instances that defy logic? Obviously. Does this multi-starrer entertain? Absolutely.
Farah Khan plays to her strengths. She has an ensemble cast that for the most part don’t disappoint. She has a convincing revenge saga, action sequences designed to thrill, plenty of song and dance, a generous dose of drama, a downplayed romantic track - all this is strung together with a thread of emotions by a director who knows her target audience.
 
The first half seemed to be moving very slowly; the setting-up took a lot of time and it wasn’t till Mohini’s (Deepika Padukone) entry that things seemed to really move along. I was pleasantly surprised that Deepika was used so well in this film. I was half expecting her to be a beautiful prop, where the men planned the heist and Shah Rukh hogged the limelight. In fact, in a film where romance just wasn’t integral to the general scheme of things, our heroine really did seem intrinsic to the narrative.
And that’s the other thing: Shah Rukh – Bollywood’s King of Romance, hardly spends any time trying to woo an object of affection. In fact, it is almost as if he is trying to reinvent himself as an action hero in this film – rippling muscles, a well-sculpted eight-pack and well-choreographed fights. Is Khan sending out a message to actors who think he is capable of only pulling-off mushy love stories?
It is commendable actually how well Farah’s cast works. The hero and heroine demand your complete attention when they are on screen. Bomani Irani is exceptional. Abhishek Bachchan and Sonu Sood deliver on their brief. Vivaan Shah is missable. But overall, it’s a competent cast.
It is a Farah Khan film, so may be you are willing to overlook some glaring loopholes – like the one where they’re trying to hide Nandu (Abhishek Bachchan) at parties but have absolutely no problem with him performing on stage. He’s exposed to way more people there but suddenly, that seems to be the least of their concerns. Okay, so it is cinematic liberty or whatever explanation the filmmakers will come up with.
What is more disappointing are the song and dance elements of the film. We are ready to overlook flaws in the narrative but except the ‘Lovely’ number, most of the other dances are completely average and I guess, that is explicable because our Indiawale can’t dance saala. But for the climax, I was expecting one jaw-dropping piece of choreography, at least by Deepika, even if the other members of the cast can’t be a part of it. Alas, that wasn’t to be.
Same goes for the music direction, Vishal-Shekhar’s music is disappointing to say the least. Not one hummable number with the exception of ‘Manwa Laage’.
Despite the ifs and buts ‘Happy New Year’ remains immensely watchable because Farah Khan had the audience break into whistles and claps at regular intervals. While I was looking for granular details and dissing the excesses, I couldn’t help but get a little emotional when they drum up the patriotic fervor at the end. I loved how she makes Shah Rukh pun on the lines from his previous films, and how Deepika gives the pep talk in typical ‘Chak De’ style.
 
Hell, yes, I quite enjoyed most of the film and especially, the end credits. It’s heartwarming to see the entire crew in Farah’s films. She manages to pack-in a little surprise in the credits too.
After a disastrous ‘Tees Maar Khan’, Farah Khan has definitely got her mojo back with ‘Happy New Year’.

automotive equipment
Japanese auto major Nissan has announced that it would recall about 9,000 units of India-built compact car Micra and mid-size sedan Sunny to fix a faulty airbag. While the exercise is part of a global recall, this is fourth time that Nissan is facing issues in its India-made cars.
The latest recall will cover Micra and Sunny models, manufactured between 2008 and 2012, that use safety airbags made by its supplier Takata.
“Nissan is conducting a voluntary safety recall campaign on the certain Nissan models for Note, March/Micra, Sunny/Almera/Versa, Patrol and Cube, which are affected by a driver airbag concern that Takata reported to Nissan. Nissan plans to begin notifying customers soon. Nissan dealers will replace the driver airbag inflator with a correctly manufactured part at no cost to the customers for parts or labour,” said a company statement. Nissan had earlier faced issues in its models and announced recalls.
In May 2013, it recalled 22,188 units of Micra and Sunny to replace a faulty braking system. In February 2012, Nissan recalled 9,600 units of India-built Micra cars as part of the global recall of about 2.5 lakh units over faulty sensor.
Also during end 2010, Nissan had to carry out some changes in Micra cars produced for European markets, due to some technical issues relating to noise levels.
Nissan has been trying hard to boost its sales in the Indian market.
Even its latest small car Datsun failed to bring any big fortunes for the company.
However, after revamped dealer business, which was earlier outsourced, the company has aggressively been working on marketing strategies to increase sales.
During the first half of this fiscal, the company’s total passenger vehicle (PV) sales stood at 25,739 units, up 109 per cent when compared with a year-ago period.
Its share is just two per cent in the Indian PV market.
But, Nissan is the third largest exporter of cars from India with a share of 18 per cent in total PV exports. It exported over 55,500 units of Oragadam-built vehicles to various countries during H1.

Centre gives nod to defence projects worth Rs 80,000 crore

anti-tank guided missiles
(Six submarines will be made…)
NEW DELHI: Defence projects worth a whopping Rs 80,000 crore were today cleared by the government which decided that six submarines will be made indigenously and over 8,000 Israeli anti-tank guided missiles and 12 upgraded Dornier surveillance aircraft will be purchased.
The decisions were taken following a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley , that lasted for over two hours with Defence Secretary, the Chiefs of all three services, DRDO Chief and other senior officials attending it.
The bulk of the decisions went in favour of the Navy that was in dire need of up-gradation and capability enhancement.
The big ticket step was the decision to build six submarines in India at a cost of about Rs.50,000 crore rather than source it from outside.
The other major decision was to purchase 8,356 Anti Tank Guided Missile of Israel worth Rs 3,200 crore rather than the US' Javelin missile for the Indian Army . The Army will also purchase 321 launchers for the missile.
Another 12 Dornier surveillance aircraft with enhanced sensors will also be bought from the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd at a cost of Rs 1,850 crore.
The DAC also decided to buy 362 infantry fighting vehicle from the Ordinance Factory Board, Medak in West Bengal for Rs 662 crore.
Giving details of the decision to make the six submarines in the country, official sources said a committee will now be formed by the Defence Ministry which will study both public and private shipyards over the next 6-8 weeks.
Following this, the Ministry will issue Request for Proposal (RFP) to specific port that will be identified on the basis of the study which will look into whether they have the capacity and manpower to build six submarines in the same port only besides other parametres.
The submarines will be Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) capable that will enable them to stay underwater for longer than a conventional submarine besides having enhanced stealth features.
The Navy currently has 13 operational submarines and the target set in 1999 was to have 24 by 2030.
The previous UPA government had gone in for six Scorpene submarines and the first is likely to be delivered only in 2016.
The decision to manufacture the submarines in India is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' pitch.
The submarines will have the capacity to be equipped with land attack cruise missiles.
The DAC also decided to buy 1,761 units of five spoke 7.5 tonne radio containers at the cost of Rs 662 crore besides acquiring 1,768 critical rolling stock - open and closed wagons for transport of military equipments at a cost of Rs 740 crore.
Both will go to domestic vendors. During his address to those attending the meeting, Jaitley said national security was paramount concern for the government.
He added that all hurdles and bottlenecks in the procurement process should be addressed expeditiously so that the pace of the acquisition is not stymied.
The DAC also approved the purchase of equipments for special operations for the Navy which remained classified.
Sources said it is basically for the elite Naval commandos Marcos.
The decision for the purchase of torpedos for the scorpene submarines and heavy calibre guns were put off today on technical grounds, sources said,adding that they are likely to be cleared soon.
The DAC was set up in 2001 as part of the post-Kargil reforms in defence sector.
The Council approves the long-term integrated perspective plan for the forces, accords acceptance of necessity ( AON) to begin acquisition proposals, and has to grant its approval to all major deals through all their important phases.
It also has the power to approve any deviations in an acquisition, and recommends all big purchases for approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security.
In a recent conference of top commanders of the armed forces, Jaitley had said that the process of military acquisitions, which had slowed down due to "some controversies", will be speeded up with at least one meeting per month of DAC.

Black Money
(The pact with the Swiss insists…)
Just when the government was on a roll, earning hosannas for a series of reforms, severe grief visited it in the form of a Supreme Court hearing on ill-gotten, untaxed "black money" held in foreign banks. The change in fortunes was precipitated by its admission in court that the names of Indians (secretly) holding bank accounts abroad cannot be revealed owing to double taxation avoidance treaties with other countries. A public roasting ensued — expectedly.
The BJP when it warmed the opposition benches had consistently attacked the Congress government for its refusal to reveal these names. Now as ruling party, it had taken recourse to the same excuse as its predecessor. The admission in court was also a serious blemish on the BJP's election promise of bringing back black money (the deadline of 100 days had long passed, remember).
A battered Congress finally had a stick to beat the government with, singling out for special mention prime minister Narendra Modi's promise of depositing Rs 15 lakh in every citizen's account after the seizure of illicit billions.
The Evidence
Fortuitously for the government, a team of Indian officials had almost simultaneously rounded off talks with Switzerland, which they believe is the epicentre of black money (never mind that plenty of tax havens have sprouted around the world). The Swiss banking system is steeped in secrecy and Indian attempts to even extract information have always proved futile. The government gave the impression that it had at long last achieved a major breakthrough in Switzerland. Has it really?
Let's look at the joint statement signed by Indian revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das and Swiss state secretary Jacques de Watteville that describes the talks. The two officials met in Berne as "part of the regular dialogue conducted by Swiss and Indian authorities". Though this deflates the impression of Indian spooks chasing bad guys, it would be wrong to surmise that nothing good came out of the meeting. There were two gains.
The first was the willingness expressed by Switzerland to examine Indian requests for which investigations have been carried out independently. Indian authorities possess a so-called 'HSBC list' that contains names of Indians who have stashed wealth in the Swiss unit of the banking major. But Switzerland had long maintained that there is no international standard to provide assistance based on information illegally obtained and Swiss legislation does not allow cooperation in such cases. The Swiss had finally relented, if only a little.
The second gain was the statement by Adrian Hug, director of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, that a competent Swiss authority would assist in confirming the genuineness of bank documents. (The Indian Express reported on Thursday that the government is about to send a batch of 50 names to Switzerland to confirm the authenticity of the HSBC list.) The gains end here.
India's attempt to conclude an automatic exchange of information agreement (AEIA) with Switzerland "after completion of domestic procedures at the earliest" too was bandied about as another triumph. But only a diehard optimist would take solace from 'domestic procedures' and 'at the earliest'.
  Switzerland is yet to introduce the new global standard on AEIA in tax matters with partner states — the Swiss parliament will vote on the standard only next year. A statement on October 8 by the Swiss Federal Council says the first exchange of information could take place in 2018 but is subject to parliament and voters approving the necessary laws and agreements.
The referendum has become necessary because, as a recent The New York Times report said, though Swiss authorities have nodded at cooperation with frustrated governments abroad (after pressure from developed countries), "at home, laws on the books since 1934 make violating client confidentiality a crime". There is no telling how the referendum will swing. But the NYT report said "a backlash is building to protect the vaunted traditions of secrecy".
Reluctant Partner
Andres Knobel, an analyst for the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group that promotes transparency in international finance, said Switzerland has proved unwilling to part with information, especially to developing countries.
Switzerland has already expressed that it will require, among other things, reciprocity and confidentiality to exchange information, according to him. The first caveat does not bode well for India because New Delhi is not a tax haven and the chances of Swiss nationals parking money here are remote. As for confidentiality, the double taxation avoidance treaty (DTAA) with Switzerland — the basis of cooperation in tax matters between the two countries — allows disclosure of information to authorities and courts concerned with tax appeals.

KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress today dared the Narendra Modi government to "come clean" on black money and reveal the names who stashed it at one go.
"The BJP government must come clean on black money and reveal names at one go. The selective leaking, rumour mongering and innuendo will not do," the party said in a statement posted in its official website.
"Who is the Government trying to protect in the black money scandal ? Is it playing politics to blackmail the culprits? BJP ministers not being transparent," it said.
The party further said, "The Black Money Scandal: Another one in the long list of promises made by BJP and now broken. So, finally... the cat is out of the bag. Looks like the BJP is petrified about belling 'the black money cat'", the statement said.

Govt submission on black money in SC  ill-advised : JethmalaniNDA government
(Jethmalani said that the…)
NEW DELHI: Slamming the NDA government for stating that it cannot disclose details of the data shared by it with foreign countries regarding black money, Rajya Sabha MP and senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani today said that its recent submission in Supreme Court in the matter was "ill-advised".
Jethmalani said that the BJP-led government at the Centre should take no step without obtaining the consent of the SIT which has been set up to probe the matter.
A petitioner in the apex court on the issue of black money, Jethmalani suggested that the Centre was using the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement as an excuse to avoid revealing the names of those Indians who have black money stashed away in banks abroad.
"Your action in approaching SC with the kind of petition you have filed is one of the most ill-advised steps taken. The DTAA or any equivalent document is not to be used and cannot be used (to not reveal names)," Jethmalani, an expelled BJP member, said in a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
He said that the black money investigation rested with the Special Investigation Team (SIT) by the order of the apex court and it is the government's duty to take no steps without supplying the information to SIT and taking its permission.
The apex court had constituted the SIT on black money upon a plea by Jethmalani.
"Please do not send names you have got from the Germans to the Swiss. Send them to SIT so they can tell them what to do," Jethmalani said.
The Narendra Modi government, which had promised to bring back black money kept by Indians in foreign banks, recently toed the line of the previous UPA regime by informing Supreme Court that it cannot make public such details as have been shared by countries with which India has a double taxation avoidance agreement.
Jethmalani had strongly objected to the stand taken by the Centre and said that the matter be not heard.
"Matter should not be entertained even for a day. Such application should have been made by the culprits and not by the government," Jethmalani had said.

Airbus may partner Tatas for manufacturing defence transport aircraftAirbus may partner Tatas for manufacturing defence transport aircraft

NEW DELHI: French aircraft giant Airbus is likely to tie up with the Tatas to manufacture transport planes for the defence sector, sources familiar with the development told TOI.
The planned partnership is likely to mark the first big-ticket entry after the Narendra Modi government raised the FDI limit in defence production to 49% from 26% to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce outgo of foreign exchange.
The proposed entry of Airbus in partnership with the Tatas puts at rest doubts that were expressed when the sector was opened up. The government had faced criticism for not allowing majority control for foreign partners and there was an apprehension that global majors might stay away.
India Air Force has plans to replace its Avros aircraft, and the Airbus-Tata combine is one among several groups that are expected to bid for the contract. An email sent to a Tata Sons spokesperson did not elicit any response.
Several Indian companies ranging from Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries to the Mahindras and Bharat Forge have entered the defence industry but the Tata Group seems to have taken an early lead in a segment hitherto dominated by imports.
The government has embarked on a "Make in India" campaign to ensure that the country emerges as a global hub for low-cost quality manufacturing; the defence sector is a key element in this strategy.
In August the Union cabinet approved raising the FDI in the sensitive defence sector and opened up railway infrastructure to foreign firms. The cabinet had also decided that FDI beyond 49% would be allowed in state-of-the art defence equipment manufacturing, with technology transfer under Indian control and management.
Technically, this means 100% FDI is allowed, but sources said this has been the position since 2002. As a safeguard, the Cabinet Committee on Security will approve such proposals. Sources also said that FDI up to 24% would be allowed via the automatic route.
Headquartered in Toulouse, Airbus has had close links with India, a key market for planes, for a while now. In 1988, Airbus struck a deal with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the Indian PSU to manufacture passenger doors for the A320 aircraft. In addition, Airbus India Engineering in Bangalore employs 350 local engineers working in engineering design and innovation activities; the number working directly or indirectly on Airbus programmes has reached some 5,000 Indian jobs, according to the company's website.
Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, is the strategic aerospace and defence arm of the Tata group. It has a tie-up with US helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky.

I am a fairly decisive defence minister  says Arun JaitleyArun Jaitley
(Arun Jaitley, who is also…)
NEW DELHI: "I am a fairly decisive defence minister," Arun Jaitley said today against the backdrop of criticism by the opposition parties who have described him as a "part time" Minister.
Jaitley, who is also the Finance Minister, said he was conscious of the fact that people call him a part time defence minister.
"But I am a fairly decisive defence minister," he said in an interview to ET Now channel.
Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed had recently questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not able to find a Defence Minister from his 283 Members of Parliament.
"We all know that Arun Jaitley is a part-time Defence Minister. Could not a person, who used to talk about the country's security and respect so much before becoming the Prime Minister, find any capable Defence Minister?" he had questioned.
Another Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma had said "It is a matter of concern that India does not have a full time defence minister even though the new government is in place for five months".

From think tank to trade reports  IP on the boil  againFrom think tank to trade reports – IP on the boil, again
P. T. Jyothi Datta
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct. 26:  
Close to 10 years after the Indian Patents Act was amended in January 2005, discussions around intellectual property are on the boil again.
Last week, the Government set up a think tank to draft a national policy on intellectual property rights (IPR), and have a coordinated IP approach across various Government departments.
And while this is an opportunity for India to counter criticism from some global quarters on its IP enforcement track-record, the discussion is not without its concerns. From the composition of the think-tank to concerns on whether features in the amended Patents Act would be watered-down – questions abound. And transparency will be key, as the Government formulates its IP road-map and the think tank begins its meetings, the first of which is expected this week.
With Prime Minister Modi’s agenda of “make in India” as the canvas, the thrust will be on spurring innovation at home. While none may disagree with this, the challenge will be in protecting innovator rights, without for instance, whittling down public health concerns of citizens.
IP think tank member, senior advocate Pratibha Singh says, they would work as a support group, so the Government can have a coordinated approach and encourage more people to innovate and produce in India. Beyond this, the aim is to produce a single document outlining India’s IP achievements. These range from documenting measures taken involving online copyrights to communicating outcomes where foreign companies have in fact got injunctions in their favour.
Concerns on dilution
Healthworkers laud the presence of Justice Prabha Sridevan as Chairperson of the think tank, but express concern on the absence of other seasoned IP academicians. IP lawyers also worry on the fate of section 3 (d) of the amended Patents Act that disallows frivolous patents, unless the product shows greater efficacy.
Despite Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s assurances on the Patents Act, there is concern being expressed in IP circles on testimonies made by Arvind Subramanian, before he was appointed as India’s Chief Economic Adviser. He had termed some provisions in the Act as “problematic”, in submissions made in the U.S. earlier this year in the run up to two US trade reports.
The Special 301 report in April stopped short of further downgrading India, but nevertheless called for “out of cycle” reviews. This annual controversial report grades U.S. trade partners on their IP track-record.
The second report, by the U.S. International Trade Commission, is expected next month. Here, the U.S. evaluates the impact India’s trade policies have had on American businesses. And in the past, several U.S. trade and congress representatives have criticized India’s trade policies and IP enforcement, especially involving pharmaceuticals. In fact, they caution, the lack of IP protection would hold back both innovation and investment.
IP and innovation
Against this backdrop, a recent study – “Innovation, Intellectual Property, FDI & Economic Growth: A Scholarly Review of Findings”- by three academicians observed that while innovation was key to economic growth, suggesting strong IP rights were essential to provide incentives for innovation was “ambiguous” . Economists too are divided on the relationship between IP and foreign direct investment, it said, adding that stronger IP may induce “adverse welfare effects”.
A “careful and creative policy deliberation” involving multi-party dialogues is required, the report said, especially in markets where societies grapple with availability and access to healthcare and incentives for medical innovation. The report was commissioned by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, a body representing large Indian drug companies.
But as more conflicting, though well-reasoned viewpoints are put on the table, the think tank has its task cut out. But it’s going to be anything but easy.

Sania Mirza-Cara Black win WTA Finals crownPrint
Singapore, Oct 26 (IANS) The India-Zimbabwe tennis pairing of Sania Mirza and Cara Black clinched the prestigious season-ending WTA Finals title here Sunday.
The third seeds, playing their last tournament together, took exactly an hour to thrash second seeds Hsieh Su-wei (Chinese Taipei) and Peng Shuai (China) 6-1, 6-0 in the women's double final, being played on the hard-courts of the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
Sania and Cara were totally dominant in the first set, winning three of the four set points they earned, while they gave away nothing to their higher seeded opponents. Hsieh and Peng only managed to hold their serve in one game.
The third seeds had a perfect second set, notching all their service games and breaking their opponents thrice again, out of five chances.
The India-Zimbabwe combine also had a much better percentage of points won on their serve than Hsieh and Peng, whose two double faults at crucial junctures of the match also did not help them.
Sania had also reached the US Open semis with Cara earlier this season. Last month, the duo announced that the season finale would be their last tournament together.

Mathews not happy with timing of India tourTweet
0
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews has said his players have not had sufficient time to prepare thoroughly for the ODI series in India in November. Sri Lanka's players were in the middle of a break from international cricket but have been asked to fill the gap in the BCCI's calendar after West Indies abandoned their tour of India because of a payment structure dispute.
"The preparation for the series is not that great, we only had a few practice sessions especially with the weather interrupting," Mathews said. "It is not the ideal preparation for an Indian tour but we will do our best to prepare ourselves and take it as it comes."
After the home series against Pakistan in August, Sri Lanka were not due to play until they hosted England in late November. They were using the down time to rest some players who had been on the road since December 2013, and also began physical training sessions.

"We had a good break to improve our physical fitness; a good month and a half fitness session, and now we have to maintain that fitness," Mathews said. "I am sure during the Indian matches we won't be able to do strenuous training as we did in the past one and a half months, but we will try and maintain it and look at it positively."
"We were preparing for the England series because we knew that there weren't any tours coming before that. We were focused on a lot on fitness and we just started batting three days ago. We only had a few skill-training sessions. We needed to reach our peak levels during the England series but now that we've been thrown into a challenge we will try our best to be prepared as much as we can."
Sri Lanka will leave for India on October 28 and begin the tour with a practice game against India A in Mumbai on October 30, before the five-match ODI series starts on November 2.
"We will try to use the series to keep our momentum going as well as try and get our World Cup combinations right, that will be our main focal point," Mathews said. "Our World Cup preparations started from the Pakistan series. I need to make sure I get the team right before the series in New Zealand. The confidence level of the team is also pretty crucial as we move into the last few months of the World Cup but then again we need to look at our options and get the combinations right as well."
In the absence of Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal from the batting line-up, young players like Niroshan Dickwella and Ashan Priyanjan have an opportunity to book a place in the World Cup squad.
"We still haven't decided on our combination but all 15 are candidates to make it to the final 11," Mathews said. "The main idea is to look at the younger players as well. Niroshan is a really good player so we want to try him out."
Kumar Sangakkara is expected to keep wicket but he has a back niggle and Mathews said there is a possibility of Dickwella taking the gloves. "Sanga is having a small disc problem in his back, he was complaining of it, but it's nothing serious, he was getting better every day so hopefully he will be okay," Mathews said. "We might have to monitor him in the next few days, if he can he will keep otherwise we will have to play Dickwella."
With three openers in the squad - Tillakaratne Dilshan , Upul Tharanga and Kusal Perera - Mathews said they were looking at Tharanga as an opener, but if the need arose he could play in the middle. Injuries to fast bowlers Lasith Malinga and Suranga Lakmal forced the selectors to pick the uncapped Lahiru Gamage, a 26-year old medium-pacer.
"Champaka Ramanayake (from the coaching department) has recommended Lahiru because he has been working with him a lot and playing in A team matches and performing really well. We been hit by a few injuries so we want to see how Lahiru performs at top level," Mathews said. "It's a really good tour to prove himself, it's going to be tough. He is a seamer who bowls around mid 130s and gets in those yorkers as well. India is a tough tour and we all know that. He will find it difficult to bowl there but I am sure he will do well."
Mathews also said Rangana Herath was being rested for the series and that leaving out Ajantha Mendis was a "tactical move".
Mathews warned his team could not be complacent because the India captain MS Dhoni had been rested for the first three ODIs. "Dhoni is a great strength to the Indian team and if he is rested we have a very good chance but we still cannot be complacent because we all know that India is a difficult place to play cricket," he said. "We had bad experiences in the past. We will try and play positive and good cricket to win against them."
Sri Lanka have not won a bilateral ODI series in India. Their best performance was a drawn three-match series in 1997.

Actress Mindy Kaling was mistakenly identified as Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai at an after-party in New York City.
Kaling was at an exclusive after-party for The New Yorker Festival in The Standard hotel after doing a Q&A with the magazine's television critic Emily Nussbaum when a drunk 80-something man confused her for Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, reported The New York Times.
The man came up to the 35-year-old 'The Mindy Project' actress to congratulate her for her Nobel Prize, "expressing wonder at how well she had recovered from Taliban gunshots."
After the man left, Kaling said, "Did he really think I'm Malala? And that if I were, I'd be at the Boom Boom Room?"  "That's the best thing that's happened all night," she added.
On October 10, 17-year-old Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner to date.

Asian Shares Up as Upbeat Earnings, Data, Sharpen Risk Appetite
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 08:13 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Tokyo: Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased recent global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite.
The euro ticked higher but financial markets largely showed a muted reaction to Sunday's health check results of euro zone banks, which painted a slightly brighter picture than expected.
Of the euro zone's 130 top lenders, 25 failed the health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank said on Sunday.
Still, the test results were a sombre reminder that much work still remained, with the euro zone bank sector's long-term attractiveness damaged by revelations of extra non-performing loans and hidden losses that will dent future profits.
"Banks face a significant challenge as the sector remains chronically unprofitable and must address their 879 billion euro exposure to non-performing loans as this will tie-up significant amounts of capital," accountancy firm KPMG noted.
The euro was up 0.1 per cent at $1.2699, edging away from a two-week low of $1.2614 hit last week in wake of concerns about the bank tests.
Asian equities advanced, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 0.1 per cent and Tokyo's Nikkei gaining 0.5 per cent.
"Stable housing starts in the US and solid Q3 GDP in the UK are likely to give the market some comfort after the recent concerns about global growth," strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.
Data on Friday showed new US home sales rose to a six-year high, while Britain's economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, still on track to outpace other advanced economies.
US stocks, recovering from a battering earlier in the month on worries about global growth losing momentum, gained on Friday on upbeat earnings from blue chips Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Easing worries over the possible spread of Ebola in the United States also helped.
The dollar traded at 108.08 yen after touching a three-week peak of 108.38, with a rise in US Treasury yields and improving risk appetite shoring up the greenback.
The Brazilian real's non-deliverable forwards showed muted response so far after leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff's interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, but some traders think her re-election is already priced in as the real has fallen nearly 10 per cent since early September.
In commodities, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $85.81 a barrel, continuing a months-long rout as signs of rising global supply threatened deeper losses.
Iraq increased its oil supply in October and Libya's output remains high, despite instability in both countries.
Gold edged lower as robust equity markets and strong US economic data dented demand for the precious metal.
Spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $1,230.97 an ounce.

The country's largest auto maker Tata Motors  has raised USD 750 million from Asian and European investors by selling a dual tranche bond issue which got an over subscription of six times at USD 4.5 billion.
The company has priced the 5.5-year benchmark senior unsecured notes of USD 500 million at 4.625 percent, while the coupon for the 10-year USD 250 million notes is fixed at 5.750 percent per annum.
It had sold USD 300 million worth bonds in April at a coupon of 5.53 percent for a five-year money, indicating better operating environment for the company.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to refinance external commercial borrowings, capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes, the company said in a statement.
"We are pleased to have completed this transaction successfully and we thank the investors for demonstrating their confidence in us," said Vijay Somaiya, vice-president for finance and head of treasury & investor relations at Tata Motors.

Global rating agency Standard & Poors has assigned BB long-term issue rating to the issue while highlighting Tata Motors' increased dependence on JLR, while rival Moody's has assigned Ba2 to the notes with a stable outlook.
"The ratings on Tata Motors reflect the company's small size and narrow product suite compared with many global peers', and its likely negative free operating cash flows because of high capital expenditure. JLR's established and improving market position in the global premium automotive segment and its strong operating performance temper these weaknesses," S&P said.
S&P further said it believes that the good operating performance of JLR, if sustained, can improve its consolidated financial strength.
Moody's also based the ratings to the continuing good show by its British arm JLR which has contributed over 90 per cent of group operating profit in FY14. "The phenomenal success of JLR continues to buy time for Tata Motors' weak domestic operations to turn around, and these are now showing some improvement."
The stable outlook on the bond reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core domestic business of the company to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating, Moody's said.
However, Moody's added that the current fiscal is critical as JLR's sales slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations.
Tata Motors is likely to list the benchmark issue on the Singapore exchange, according to merchant banking sources who worked on the issue. They added that Asian investors dominated the 5.5-year issue cornering 61 per cent, while the 10-year issue was lapped up by European and West Asian investors cornered 78 percent.
Mutual funds have reportedly bought close to 70 percent of the 5.5 year bond and also bought 50 per cent of the 10-year bonds; insurers bought 40 percent of the 10-year bonds, said sources at i-bankers which included ANZ Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and StanChart.
Tata Motors had a consolidated revenue of Rs 2,32,834 crore or USD 38.9 billion in 2013-14. Through subsidiaries and associate companies, it operates in Britain, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.
Tata Motors stock price
On December 05, 2014, Tata Motors closed at Rs 524.80, down Rs 3.1, or 0.59 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 550.80 and the 52-week low was Rs 331.05.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 59.58 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 8.81.

Centre may disclose names of black money account holders to Supreme Court todayCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
Dabur said that Pradip Burman’s account was opened when he was a non-resident Indian, Lodhya denied having a foreign bank account, and Radha Timblo said she needed to study the affidavit before reacting.
“The intention of the present government is clear and unambiguous. The government is keen to unearth black money held abroad and for that purpose it will use all diplomatic and legal means and also all investigative agencies to obtain information that can assist in such unearthing,” the Centre said in the affidavit.

The Congress asked the Modi administration to refrain from “political titillation and playing games”, calling for disclosure of names of all those who had illicit money abroad.
“They are the government. They control ministries and departments. They should act....Do not play games,” said party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
Monday’s affidavit was filed by the income tax (I-T) department in response to a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking that the government take action to bring back India’s black money, estimated by some at nearly $500 billion.
Read:  Govt trying to protect politicians, businessmen, says Ram Jethmalani
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu will hear the black money case on Tuesday. The government is seeking that the court modify an earlier order insisting that all names be revealed; its view is that names should be disclosed only after prosecution is launched against the tax evaders.
The affidavit said that the prosecution against Burman began after the government received information against him from French authorities. It was silent on the sources of information on the others.
The government also informed the court that Switzerland had assured its cooperation, including reaching a treaty on automatic exchange of information with India. It said Swiss authorities had agreed to assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank documents.
HT had on last Wednesday reported the Centre was likely to tell the apex court names of people against whom strong evidence exists of stashing away black money in Swiss banks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is moving fast to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in slush funds or black money stashed abroad, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The government is building pressure particularly on Switzerland, seeking details of Indians who have parked unaccounted for money in the Alpine country's highly secretive banks. It has quickly implemented a Supreme Court directive to set up a high-powered special investigation team , headed by retired judge MB Shah, to look into the issue.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
According to PTI, the Union government told the apex court that Switzerland had indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases probed by the income tax department.
Information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established, the government said.
Even though the government pointed out that it had no intention to withhold names of people who have stashed black money, it also said such names could not be disclosed unless there was prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.
The Centre also noted that every foreign account held by an Indian may not be illegal.
Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had told the Supreme Court that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
There were murmurs of protest within the ruling BJP that not disclosing names would hurt the party's image after it had made bringing back black money, a key issue in a general election that it won by a landslide. The Centre's stand also drew a strong response from the Congress, which accused it of hypocrisy.
Turning the tables on the Congress, finance minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the disclosing of names of people holding black money accounts will embarrass the opposition party.
The previous UPA government had submitted the names of 18 persons who had illegally stashed away money in Liechtenstein to the Supreme Court.
It had come under flak after it opposed the Supreme Court’s direction to set-up a special investigation team (SIT) and its review petition against the court’s verdict was dismissed. The SIT was finally set up by the Modi government within days of its taking over at the Centre.

Wipro slips 2%; Brokerages reduce rating & target post Q2

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  Wipro slipped another 2 percent intraday on Monday after its September quarter results disappointed investors. The stock had already fallen 5 percent on Mahurat trading day after it announced second quarter results after market hours on Wednesday.
Most brokerages are bearish on the stock as the software firm’s Q2 underperformed its peers in dollar revenue growth.
Its IT services revenue in rupee terms grew by 4 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 8.5 percent on yearly basis) to Rs 10,923 crore during the quarter. IT services revenue (non-GAAP constant currency) in dollar terms climbed 1.8 percent sequentially (up 8.6 percent year-on-year) to USD 1,771.5 million, which was within the company's guidance range of USD 1,770 million to USD 1,810 million but lower than estimates of USD 1,783 million (according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18).
Citi downgraded the stock to neutral and reduced target price to Rs 625 from Rs 705, stating that deal wins have been strong for several quarters but are yet to translate into revenue growth.
Bank of America Merill Lynch has also trimmed down FY15-17 estimates by 2-3 percent and target price to Rs 600. It has a neutral rating on the stock.
Not at all impressed by the results, Goldman Sachs advises to sell the stock with a target of Rs 500. The brokerage believes that the continued weakness in application, development and maintenance (ADM) modest growth in top 10 clients, and inadequate conversion of deals into revenues may keep Wipro’s growth profile lagging the sector.
Wipro's second quarter net profit declined nearly 1 percent sequentially (up 8 percent year-on-year) to Rs 2,098.3 crore dented by higher tax and finance expenses, and reconciling items. Profit in the previous quarter was Rs 2,118 crore.
However, Prabhudas Lilladher advises to buy Wipro despite its July-September quarter underperforming peers in dollar revenue growth. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 650 per share stating that improvement in win rate may drive revenue momentum in CY15, along with available margin levers that would accelerate earnings momentum. It also quickly warns that there could be near term weakness in the stock due to weaker-than-expected guidance.
The management is optmistic that H2FY15 will be stronger. K Kurien, executive director & chief executive officer sees good momentum in large deals. He expects H2FY15 (October-March) to be better than H1FY15. According to him, the current demand environment is better than last year (Read management interview here ).
At 09:25 hrs, the stock was quoting at Rs 552.60, down Rs 8.15, or 1.45 percent on the BSE.

Big Diwali for autos  cautiously optimistic now: HeroMoto08:00 am
Two-wheeler major  Hero MotoCorp witnessed a phenomenal Diwali by registering explosive sales on Dhanteras. The market leader sold over 2 lakh units on that day, which establishes the fact that the Indian economy is turning.
Speaking about the cracker sales and future of the two wheelers, Sunil Munjal, Joint MD of Hero MotoCorp told CNBC-TV18 that the automotive industry saw 16 percent growth in 2-wheelers over the last six months. He acknowledged it is heartening to see healthy demand of scooters after a long time. Despite all this, Munjal believes it is sensible to be cautious now as he expects consolidation over the next six months.
Justifying his fears and hopes, Munjal said the industry is cautiously optimistic based on actions taken by the government so far but high interest rate along with deficient monsoon are deterrents. Hence, at the moment, the expectation is that the industry will see a mixed bag but general improvement on the ground, acknowledged by global rating agencies, will ensure there will be upside.
Also read:  Is Hero Motocorp best recovery play after record sales?
He admitted competition is heating up, but so is the share of the pie. "I think margin will not drop at this point despite competitive pressures," he said. The company is eyeing Sri Lanka, Latin American markets to increase its exports. "We are well positioned to take advantage of global and domestic opportunity," Munjal said.
Below is the edited transcript of the interview:
Q: It looks like a brilliant Diwali going by your sales but give us some colour - was it largely rural? How was the mix and how would you position this demand in an economic context? Is it just your company grabbing market share or is it that the economy is turning and the pie is getting largely?
A: This has been a wonderful Diwali for India, for Indian industry, certainly for the automotive industry and for two-wheelers.
To you question – I think it is a bit of both. The overall size has grown. We have seen in the last six months growth over 16 percent in two-wheelers and our company particularly over the last few months has done well. The festival period has been very kind to the industry. There was some nervousness earlier on. It grew rapidly then petered off but on Dhanteras day, we were fortunate to get a very large number of two-wheelers sold in the market. A part of it came from the branding, part came from the new launches and part of it also came from better logistics and planning and how to position the product across the market. Therefore, it was a combination of multiple things that are going on.
Q: What is the prognosis for the second half of the year in terms of growth for the sector as a whole as well as for Hero Motocorp?
A: I will stick to the sector and the economy. There is cautious optimism right now in India (a) because of the number of initiatives the government has taken and which they are likely to take over the next few months because they have spoken about some of the others and these are in the areas of labour reform continuing the excise benefit that is offered. There are series of them going on and many of them are pure reform related (b) those specifically will build the market.
The concern side of course is that as on date the monsoon has reported 12 percent shortfall across India. It’s not even across India but overall is 12 percent and it has been patchy. In some places it’s been very good, in some it is way behind the normal. The good thing is that agriculture has not suffered across the board. Therefore, it is somewhat mixed bag right now. The expectation for the next few months is we will continue to see consolidation with significant growth coming into the next year.
Q: Would you say that this 16 percent growth, which mentioned for the industry in the first six months would be repeated in the second half. Would it be 16 percent higher than the previous second half or would it be better than that?
A: The industry would like to see that happen but at this moment, it is sensible to be cautiously optimistic. There are both pros and cons in the industry because of continuous high interest rate there is some push back. Hopefully with the improved economy the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will see it fit to start to taper down interest to encourage some growth in the economy right now. At the same time the general improvement both in the mood, actually on the ground, in the macroeconomic factors and the rating agencies both Indian and global giving a thumbs up to the direction that Indian economy has taken will give us some headroom for growth. I do not want to get the number right now but I would say the direction is right and we will see upside.
Q: Talking about some of the micros in the industry, the scooter industry has seen a very sharp growth. In the first half of the year, the industry has grown 32 percent. What is the outlook for the second half and what would a strategy be to grow in the scooter industry from Hero Moto point of view?
A: The scooter industry has made a big comeback over the last few years and that’s apparent in all of the numbers and we are also seeing company after company look at this as a product line those who were not involved in this and those who were also expanding the lines as we have done ourselves. We had one single scooter for a long time and we launched the second one. The plan right now is to continue to expand the capacity because there is significant growth in demand in scooters and interestingly it is happening across – earlier it was only in few places, it is now pretty wide spread and we are seeing both men and women drawing the scooter volume across India. However, for us we have already grown the scooter volume production over the last few months and we continue to do this again now.
Q: How will that help you in terms of market share? We have seen others like TVS Motor  gain in the scooter segment in the last three-six months and then Honda which is in any case is the market leader in that segment. For Hero, how much of growth in market share would you expect because of all the initiatives that you are taking in the scooter segment?
A: We have been constrained by capacity. We were selling whatever we were making. In the last few months we made an effort to grow the capacity for these and you will see further growth in the next few months on production of scooters and we are adding capacity. We just started up a new plant. So overall capacity growth is taking place for us and we are hoping that our scooter market share would also grow. As I said, I am not going to give any number and I would rather talk of the overall economy rather than just specific only on one entity alone.
Q: As things heat up do you expect that the competition gets a little hot and therefore margins could come under pressure in the second half for most of the two-wheelers?
A: It is clear that competition has become pretty intense but fortunately so is the size of the pie. The market has shown good growth and with the improvement we are seeing in the economy, one would expect this to continue over the next few months and into the next few years. So margins while maybe under pressure but I do not think margin will drop in this industry at this moment.
Q: One of the segments of Hero Motocorp that has enthuse the market a lot is the way exports are expected to grow going ahead. You have set an aggressive target of 250,000 units in FY15. I want to understand from you what are the key markets where you expect exports to pickup in order for the company to reach that target?
A: The export markets that we have gone to are in the immediate neighbourhood, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal etc and then in Africa and in central Latin America - these are the three broad market segments that we are looking at. We would like to grow these. There are also new markets we would like to add but that’s something which the company would announce at an appropriate time. At this moment, a lot of work has been done over the last few years to setup and establish our presence there, setup distributors, setup assembly in some places even manufacturing in some of the market and to try and develop the brand there. So, the response that we are getting is reasonably good and that is why it gives one hope and confidence that over the next few months and years we will see a significant growth in our export volume which is why we need to increase the production capacity here because we do not expect Indian market to go down anytime soon, so in that sense it’s a good news on both ends.
Q: If I look at all your plans, Hero alone intents to have about 12 million bikes in installed capacity by 2020. Honda is speaking of a similar capacity by similar time period. Do you expect that kind of a burgeoning of demand or by then would you all be sitting on capacity that you cannot use?
A: If you look at what the Indian government is putting out as numbers or if you look at what the new economic adviser put out, if Indian economy can and hopefully will grow at about 8-8.5 percent for a sustained period of time. The numbers one can expect maybe even more optimistic than the one some of us are putting out because the population in India which is currently not able to afford a two-wheeler will then be in that position and with easier transactions, with more banking, with more financing available, easier access to distribution points and service points. The market is expected over a time to have a healthy and a significant growth and as always in any industry, some will win more and some will win less but it is clear there is growth and we would like to position ourselves well to be able to take advantage of this growth.
Q: On that same theme Siddhartha Lal of Eicher Motors  has proved that there is a huge market even for the premium segment. Do we see you getting into that segment more aggressively?
A: I do not think this is an appropriate time or a place to make those kinds of an announcements but the company would like to position itself well to take advantage of the evolving market, the growing market, watching the domestic market and also internationally and you will hear the plans as they are made public. 
Q: To add on the point – in terms of combating the intense competition, can we expect to hear anything from Hero Motocorp on a new brand being launch, something like Splendor and Passion and how they have worked in the past. So far we have seen variants. We have seen refreshers of the older brands but in the next 12-18 months any new brand launches that we can expect from Hero in the motorcycle segment?
A: Pawan had already mentioned this in a couple of interviews earlier that there would be new product launches happening over the next coming months and years and there is intense work going on right now in the company in its technology centers to create more specific product features and attributes in some of the existing products and certainly in the new products which are in the pipeline and this is not something which one announces on an interview like this.

Reforming India faces an uncertain global situationReforming India faces an uncertain global situation
C. R. L. NARASIMHAN
Tweet
October 27, 2014:  
The linkage between the Indian economy and the global economy, always important for policymakers, has become pronounced recently. As the Modi-led NDA government embarks on some long-pending but overdue reforms in the petroleum and energy sectors, the dynamics of the global environment become particularly evident.
The decontrol of diesel prices, for long thought of but not implemented due mainly to political considerations, could be implemented at last as global oil prices took a tumble. What would normally be a controversial move became palatable as decontrol actually made retail diesel prices in India cheaper by more than Rs.3 a litre. With petrol prices having already been deregulated, the government has also rationalised the payment of LPG subsidies to the really needy.
The real test
However, the point needs to be made that if the unexpected fall in global prices has given a unique opportunity for reform, the real test for policymakers will come when oil prices move up from their present low levels. Real reform here would require them to stay away during different phases of the petroleum price cycle. Unless of course there are oil shocks that create crisis situations crying out for government interventions.
Right now, the fall in global prices has had an all-round beneficial effect in India — government finances will improve dramatically as petroleum subsidies get reduced. The fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of the GDP, once considered unrealistically ambitious, looks eminently achievable now. The current account deficit will fall to the extent the oil import bill is less. This, of course, assumes that the present trends in oil and other commodity prices will hold.
Declining oil prices
After declining gradually for three months, oil prices suddenly fell by almost $4 a barrel on October 14, the biggest single-day fall in nearly a year. The Brent crude international benchmark is substantially lower, trading now around $85. At its peak in June, a barrel had cost $115.
The dramatic decline in oil prices benefits India, but is obviously not so good for the oil producers. In normal situations, cheaper oil should boost global economic growth. This is because consumers in oil importing countries are more likely to spend the money quickly than cash-rich exporters. By boosting spending, cheaper oil can raise global output.
Do lower oil prices reflect weak demand or are caused by an abundant supply of crude? In the former case, weak demand may indicate economic slowdown. On the other hand, if the fall in oil prices is due to abundant supplies that may be potentially better news. Cheaper oil should boost spending and drive up the global economy.
The fact that there is no clear cut answer as to whether oil prices have fallen because of a slowdown in the world economy or because of abundant supplies is an indication of global uncertainty. This is something policymakers in India will have to reckon with. The global economy is certainly weak.
IMF’s outlook update
Just a fortnight ago, the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook update had forecast a slower than expected economic growth in the next year. India is one of the few countries that fared better in IMF’s assessment. Its growth rate, projected at well above 5 per cent for the current year, can go above 6 per cent next year, subject to India undertaking some much-needed reforms. But the IMF’s study has also pointed out that India’s potential to grow substantially higher is limited.
The U.S. economy, now firmly on the move up, and the U.K. are the only bright spots among developed economies. The European Union continues to be crisis-ridden. Japan’s GDP growth fell in the second quarter. But the biggest disappointment comes from two countries, which had hitherto spearheaded global economic growth — Germany and China.
Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe and indeed of much of the world, has cut its growth forecasts for this year and the next by more than 0.5 percentage point. Germany’s potential to stimulate global growth is enormous. It runs a huge current account surplus. Yet, the German government is loathing for embarking on any type of stimuli.
On the face of it, China’s economy chugs along with above-average growth rates. However, there are doubts about its financial sector and its inflated property market. However, the correlation between slower global growth and falling energy prices is not as watertight as it appears to be. There has also been a big increase in the supply of oil.
Where the oil prices will stabilise even over the short-term is still a matter of conjecture. In these circumstances, India — which imports 80 per cent of its oil requirements — needs a clear and proactive strategy to ride over the uncertain global outlook.

Milk selling for Rs 100 a litre  Rs 10 for an egg in riot-hit east DelhiComments
Rioting on the streets may have stopped in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri but hoarding of basic commodities sent prices skyrocketing on Sunday, adding to the misery of residents after violence broke out on Diwali evening.
Prohibitory orders have been in place in the neighbourhood since Thursday following clashes between two communities. This has led to a rampant black market trade, with prices of essential items doubling overnight.

“Eggs are selling for Rs. 10 per piece, which usually costs us Rs. 4,” said Kiswas, a resident of Block 27. “A half-litre packet of milk worth Rs. 24 is being sold for upto Rs. 50,” she added.
Some of the blocks worst-affected by violence are also reeling under exorbitant prices. With the police restricting movement of people, residents say they are at the mercy of local shopkeepers.
Read: Trilokpuri tense but no fresh clashes reported
The narrow bylanes are packed with over a thousand police and paramilitary personnel with an uneasy calm hanging over the neighbourhood. Taking advantage of the situation, small shops have downed shutters and are selling groceries through the back door.
The police have arrested about 40 people. Around 30 people have been injured in stone-pelting that began Thursday.
People fled their homes for the second straight day on Sunday as it became clear that prohibitory orders won’t be lifted anytime soon. 
“People are running out of ration. With shops closed more than 100 people have left my area alone,” said Mohammed Ahmed, a resident of block 27.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  DLF continued to remain under heavy selling pressure, falling 8 percent intraday on Monday. Investors are cautious as media reports suggest that the new BJP-led Haryana government is going to probe into all land scams, including the deal between UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and realty developer DLF.
The report quoted senior cabinet minister Anil Vij, “We would hold a probe into acquisition of 70,000 acres during the 10-year regime of Bhupinder Singh Hooda government. We would inquire whether the land was used for the purpose it was acquired. It would be probed if there was any violation in acquisition to benefit any individual.”
Earlier in July, Bhupinder Singh Hooda (former Haryana chief minister) government had legalised the controversial land deal between Vadra-owned company Skylight Hospitality and DLF.
DLF stock has already been under pressure as market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has barred the company and its six executives from accessing capital markets for 3 years. It was penalised for failing to disclose key information at the time of its record-breaking 2007 market listing. 
DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time. This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market.
The realty firm appealed for interim relief from the Sebi order last week. The Securities Appellate Tribunal will hear the matter next on 30 October.
 At 11:11 hrs DLF was quoting at Rs 110.30, down Rs 9.60, or 8.01 percent on the BSE.

Gold prices fell 0.08 per cent to Rs 27,153 per 10 gram in futures trade today as participants reduced their positions largely in tandem with a weak trend overseas where precious metal dropped from a six-week high.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December month contracts eased by Rs 23, or 0.08 per cent, to Rs 27,153 per 10 gram in business turnover of 394 lots.
Likewise, the metal for delivery in February shed Rs 22, or 0.08 per cent, to Rs 27,370 per 10 gram in four lots.
Market analysts said eroding haven demand due to weakening trend in the overseas markets on investors expecting the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying programme this week, weighed on gold futures here.
Globally, gold fell by 0.30 per cent, to $1,227.51 an ounce in Singapore today.

NSEL crisis: Govt mulls Board changes for merged entityNSEL crisis: Govt mulls Board changes for merged entity

Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
After ordering merger of crisis-hit NSEL with parent firm Financial Technologies to help affected investors get their dues, the Government is starting a process to assess compensation amounts and is also considering a proposal to make changes to the Board of the merged entity.
The Corporate Affairs Ministry last week unveiled a proposal to merge NSEL — which has been embroiled in an over Rs 5,600 crore payment crisis — with Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies (India) Ltd.
Sources said the Ministry would now start a process of assessing the compensation amount to be given to affected investors and a chartered accountant entity might be appointed in this regard.
Besides, the possibility of completely or partially replacing the FTIL board would also be looked into, sources said, adding that these proposals are being considered after taking into account suggestions made by the commodity sector regulator FMC (Forward Markets Commission) and other government departments.
This is the first time that the Ministry has invoked a clause in the Companies Act for a forced merger in the private sector due to “public interest”, while a takeover of FTIL board, if it happens, would be the first such development since the Satyam case in 2009.
In Satyam case, the scandal-hit IT firm was later sold to Tech Mahindra through a government-monitored auction.
Post merger, FTIL would take over all the liabilities of National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), including payments due to be paid to investors and others to help in repayment process.
Soon after the government’s amalgamation order on October 21, FTIL had said in a brief statement that it “is taking appropriate steps in the matter in consultation with legal counsel of the company“.
No immediate comments could be obtained from FTIL on the proposal for making changes to its Board following merger of NSEL, which itself would fructify after taking into account submissions and objections, if any, made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies.
FTIL shares were trading nearly flat at Rs 195.75 in morning trade after paring their opening trade gains.
The Ministry’s decision comes more than a year after the payment scam at NSEL came into light in July 2013. The move has been initiated taking into consideration “essential public interest” as the exchange is “not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues“.
So far, the crisis-hit spot exchange has managed to recover only little over Rs 360 crore dues from defaulters, a part of which has been disbursed and the rest is in an escrow account. Funds worth about Rs 5,300 crore are yet to be recovered for subsequent payment to affected investors.

Brent falls to $86 on Goldman price cut forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST

Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Saamna editorial says Sena is ready to back any CM as long as he has peoples blessingsSena supporters in Dadar celebrate the party’s victory.(Source: Express photo by Prashant Nadkar)

Softening its stand after BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Maharashtra Assembly polls, the Shiv Sena on Monday said it is ready to support any leader chosen by its estranged ally as the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra.
“On the day of Laxmi Pooja, (Devendra) Fadnavis met (Nitin) Gadkari and took his blessings. Later Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings. All these blessings are undoubtedly important, but the blessings of the people are the most important. Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who will take Maharashtra ahead with the blessings of the people,” Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
The party says that though Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has the experience to don the mantle in the state, the final decision will be taken by the high command in Delhi.  “The final decision (over the CM’s name) will be taken by the high command in Delhi, hence no point for the state leaders to think over this. Gadkari is well versed with the state and hence has a development vision for Maharashtra. On the other hand, Fadnavis does not have the experience of being involved in governance,” the party organ said.
“We are happy that the BJP won the elections and rooted the corrupt Congress and the NCP out of power. The state will benefit from the oust of both these parties,” it added. BJP’s central observers Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and J P Nadda will attend the legislature party meet in Mumbai tomorrow and elect the next Chief Minister of the state.
With no concrete talks having taken place between the BJP and the Sena over the allocation of portfolios, the Sena will have to wait for further clarity until the legislature party meet.
Meanwhile, newly elected BJP MLA from Mukhed in Nanded district Govind Rathod died here following a heart attack. Rathod was on his way to Mumbai by Devgiri Express when he was taken ill last night, party sources said. With Rathod’s passing away, the strength of BJP in the 13th Assembly is 121.

JSPL slips nearly 6% as CBI launches probe for mining in Saranda forests
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 11.36AM IST
(JSPL said it would respond…)
NEW DELHI: Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) slipped nearly as much as 5.6 per cent in trade on Monday, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun a probe into how Congress leader Naveen Jindal's company got permission from the environment ministry under Jayanti Natarajan in 2013 to mine iron ore in Asia's largest sal forest in the Naxal-affected Saranda area of Jharkhand.
At 09:20 a.m.; JSPL was trading 4.2 per cent lower at Rs 158.75. It hit a low of Rs 156.35 and a high of Rs 160.10 in trade today.
However, JSPL in a statement mailed to IANS, said it would respond to the CBI's preliminary enquiry (PE) registered Friday over the company's alleged diversion of forest land.
Responding to an ET query a JSPL spokesperson said "we have only come to know of the preliminary enquiry through media reports."
"JSPL reiterates that we have always co-operated with the investigative agencies and will respond when we receive these queries from the investigative authorities," added the report.
Sources told ET the JSPL project in the Saranda forests was taken up for discussion in the Cabinet Committee on Investments and cleared in May 2013.
The project was cleared by the CCI, the sources maintained. CBI sources said the Forest Advisory Committee in 2011 had considered JSPL's mining project but noted that the forest of Saranda is part of the core area of the Singhbhum reserve, one of the finest habitats for elephants, added the ET report.

Prefer Infosys  buy Wipro on dips: Ajay Bodke08:00 am
Ajay Bodke of Prabhudas Lilladher told CNBC-TV18, " Tata Consultancy Services ,  HCL Technologies and  Wipro have posted numbers which have been below the analyst expectations; some of them have said that going forward they are expecting a slight improvement in the numbers."
"We would be sticking here to  Infosys as among our top buys. The hope that has been generated with the new CEO and the plan that he has laid out to up the both earnings as well as the revenue growth in the medium term the 24 month perspective makes us believe that Infosys offers a good entry point. So I would stick with Infosys in the  largecap space and on declines I will be looking at Wipro, although Wipro numbers optically appear to be disappointing in the current quarter. But the valuation it is trading at 14 times one year forward earning FY16 earnings and we are penciling in roughly around 12.50 to 13 percent growth in earnings for FY15-16 on the back of around 10-11 percent growth in top line. So we believe that from valuation perspective any drop in Wipro should be utilised as an entry point with a medium term perspective," he said.

Govt may allow foreign firms to mine coalStory
Update: Govt may allow foreign firms with domestic units to mine, sell coal
Rupam Jain Nair and Krishna N Das     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 22, 2014  | 15:45 IST

The government could allow commercial coal mining by foreign companies if they set up units in the country, opening the door for global giants like Rio Tinto to access the country's coal reserves , a source familiar with the matter said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to open commercial coal mining to private players is a key step towards bringing order to the chaotic domestic power industry and ending the chronic blackouts that impede its economic rise.
Nearly a quarter of a century after the country embraced economic liberalisation, many businesses still rely on costly back-up generators for round-the-clock power and a third of its 1.2 billion people still lack access to electricity.
As of now, only domestic power, steel and cement companies can mine coal for their own consumption. Commercial mining is dominated by state-run Coal India (CIL).
However, now the government plans to allow companies like Rio Tinto India to mine coal commercially after it completes the auction of 74 coalfields for the exclusive consumption of power, cement and steel plants owned by domestic companies, said the source, who spoke on conditions of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
In a 27-page executive order posted on the Coal Ministry's website on Wednesday, the government said any firm incorporated in the country may be allowed to mine coal for their own consumption or sale, ending a 42-year-old ban. The document did not make any direct reference to allowing foreign firms.
Rio Tinto India Managing Director Nik Senapati declined to comment on the matter.
Other foreign players that may show interest in the nation are BHP Billiton and US-based company Peabody.
A CIL official said it would be natural for the government to allow deep-pocketed foreign companies to mine coal, given the need to invest heavily in order to quickly raise output.
MODI'S REFORMS
Opening up the industry would ultimately boost production of coal, a raw material that generates three-fifths of the country's power supply, while piling pressure on CIL to produce more.
"This is a first step but a very important one," said Manish Aggarwal, head of KPMG's energy and natural resources practice in India.
"What the government is really saying is that we will focus on domestic coal and on renewables to meet our energy needs... India needs the latest technology, the latest equipment and international expertise if it is to raise coal production."
PM Modi prided himself on supplying uninterrupted electricity as the former chief minister of Gujarat, and repeating that feat at a national level is one of his priorities.
It will not be an easy task.
The country sits on the world's fifth-largest coal reserves, and yet state-owned CIL, which has enjoyed a monopoly on commercial mining, has consistently failed to meet the rising demand of the rapidly growing domestic economy.
Instead, wretched inefficiency has turned the country into the world's third-largest importer of coal.
In September, the Supreme Court cancelled 214 of the 218 coal block licences issued since 1993, after ruling that they were allocated illegally, in a case that has become emblematic of the dysfunctional nature of the industry.
The government will re-auction the mines to private firms within four months. For the first time, revenue from the concessions will be paid to the states where the blocks are located, creating an incentive to speed up project approvals.
"Modi wants to include incentives... By giving the opportunity to coal-rich states to earn royalties," said a retired bureaucrat who helped the Prime Minister tackle power shortages in Gujarat.
NEXT STEPS
Boosting the supply of energy is only half the problem, industry experts say, and Modi is expected to now push individual states to reform the rickety distribution model.
The country's installed energy generation - more than half of it powered by coal - has surged by 20 per cent in the last three years, and the peak power deficit fell to 5.1 per cent in June from 9 per cent in 2012, according to official data released by the government.
However, cash-strapped distributors, whose tariffs are capped and are facing rampant power theft, have invested little in new transmission lines. This implies that, for all the extra power generated, not enough is delivered to consumers.
"This is not a complete solution... Fixing the transmission and distribution side is equally critical," said Aggarwal.

Xiaomi migrates some smartphone user data out of Beijing on privacy concernsData belonging to the privately owned company's non-Chinese users will be moved in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the US and data centres in Singapore.
By: Reuters | Beijing | Posted: October 24, 2014 3:14 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 4:34 am
Fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc said on Thursday it is migrating some data on non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing due to performance and privacy considerations.
Data belonging to the privately owned company’s non-Chinese users will be moved in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the United States and data centres in Singapore, Xiaomi vice president Hugo Barra said in a Wednesday blog post on Google Plus.
The migration matches in reverse Apple Inc’s move earlier this year to store Chinese user data with China Telecom Corp, the first time the iPhone maker has kept user data on the Chinese mainland.
User privacy remains a key issue for Xiaomi as it eyes overseas expansion, having risen in the three years since it was founded to become the top smartphone vendor in China, according to industry analysts. It has already faced several privacy controversies, including accusations from international security researchers and a government agency in Taiwan that it funnels unauthorized user data back to its servers in Beijing.
Apart from privacy, Barra also said the moving data to overseas servers has significantly boosted speed in markets such as Singapore, India and Malaysia. Xiaomi is targeting India and Brazil as its next big markets.
Technology companies typically keep data centres physically close to their user base to maximize service speeds, but the question of where to situate them has sometimes been politically wrought. Companies such as Google Inc, for instance, have chosen to store user data off mainland Chinese soil over concerns about privacy and the need to comply with Chinese censorship laws.
Moving data offshore “better equips us to maintain high privacy standards and comply with local data protection regulations,” Barra wrote. “This is a very high priority for Xiaomi as we expand into new markets over the next few years.”
Barra’s post came days after the Chinese web monitoring group Greatfire.org accused Chinese government-affiliated hackers of seeking to obtain Chinese Apple users’ personal data – an accusation which the government has strongly denied. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook discussed information security with a top Chinese official while visiting Beijing this week, according to Chinese state media.
Barra said Xiaomi will also begin using Akamai Technologies Inc’s content delivery service, which in the past has served clients ranging from Apple to Netflix Inc.

ADR claimed that railway minister Sadananda Gowda's wealth increased by over Rs 10.46 crore from Rs 9.99 crore in May to Rs 20.35 crore in Oct.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has faulted the format for declaration of assets adopted by the government saying it did not provide a correct indicator of the ministers' wealth and defeated the exercise towards transparency.
Several ministers in the cabinet have shown a dramatic increase in assets in just the last 5 months which ADR has attributed to lack of a standardized format for ministers' asset declaration. It said that in many cases ministers have either not given the value of their moveable and immoveable assets or not given the present market value which has led to discrepancies. For instance ministers including Jitendra Singh , V K Singh, Ananth Kumar, and Sripad Naik have not given value for moveable assets to the PMO while Harsh Vardhan, Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj have not given value for their immoveable assets.
ADR claimed that railway minister Sadananda Gowda's wealth increased by over Rs 10.46 crore from Rs 9.99 crore in May to Rs 20.35 crore in October and assets worth Rs 10 crore had been acquired in the interim. However in response to reports Gowda tweeted that the properties were bought earlier with a loan worth Rs 8 crore from Federal Bank and Rs 2 crore had been paid in advance. He is followed by heavy industry MoS Radhakrishnan P who has shown an increase of Rs 2.98 crore (from assets worth Rs 4.09 crore to Rs 7.07 crore) and finance minister Arun Jaitley whose wealth has increased by 1% from Rs 113.02 crore to Rs 114.03 crore.
Minister for social justice and empowerment Thaawar Chand Gehlot whose personal wealth increased by 323% in the last two years has seen the sharpest rise in a cabinet dominated by crorepatis. He is followed by power and coal minister Piyush Goyal whose assets have increased by 212% since 2010. According to ADR analysis the overwhelming majority of ministers (91%) that is 41 of the 45 ministers are crorepatis with average assets worth Rs 14.32 crore.
Among the ministers—who did not contest the Lok Sabha polls—whose personal wealth has risen sharply are social justice and empowerment minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot whose assets increase by 323% in two years. According to the declaration he made to the Rajya Sabha in 2012 Gehlot's assets were Rs 86.12 lakh which have shot up to Rs 3.64 crore in October 2014. Coal and power minister Piyush Goyal came in second with his assets increasing by 212% from Rs 30.34 crore in 2010 (according to the affidavit submitted to the Rajya Sabha) to Rs 64.31 crore. MoS for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan's assets grew by 61% since 2012 from Rs 1.54 crore to Rs 2.48 crore. Communications and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's wealth rose by 27% in two years while urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu's assets grew by 28% in four years.

Why Modi picked Rijiju as MoS for Home AffairsYou are here: Home > Collections > Visa
What is PM Modi's 'game plan' in picking Arunachal Pradesh's Kiren Rijiju as MoS for Home Affairs?
Shantanu Nandan Sharma, ET Bureau Oct 26, 2014, 07.00AM IST

Arunachal Pradesh
(The appointment of Kiren…)
A week before Chinese President Xi Jinping visited India last month, minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju addressed a gathering of strategists at leading US think tank, Brookings Institution, based on Embassy Row in Washington DC.
The government of India restrained itself from giving publicity to the event where Rijiju, hailing from Arunachal Pradesh, talked at length about the need to step up border infrastructure in India's eastern-most state which China claims as its own.
In his 40-minute address followed by an hour-long interaction, Rijiju also touched upon issues such as left wing extremism, intelligence gathering, police modernisation, disaster management and food security, but his references to India-China skirmishes ahead of Xi's India visit prompted New Delhi to take that extra precaution.
During Xi's stay in New Delhi, Rijiju was conspicuous by his absence. The opposition Congress questioned why Rijiju was absent in delegation-level talks and also at the state banquet hosted by the President of India in Xi's honour.
"I am sure a day will come when Rijiju in his official capacity will need to visit China and the Chinese authority will say: please come, you don't need a visa," says one of his aides.
There is, of course, a precedent to this: the 1997 visa row when the then chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh Gegong Apang was told he could visit Kunming in the Yunnan province without a visa. New Delhi apparently did not allow Apang to visit China without a valid visa.
Part of Game Plan
Many in the corridors of power say Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a game plan when he handpicked the 42-year-old lawyer-turned-politician from Arunachal Pradesh as minister of state in the highly sensitive ministry of home affairs (MHA).
Among the subjects that Rijiju handles in MHA are police modernisation, visa issues for foreigners, and disaster management.
But he has also been asked to handle border management, which includes creation of new infrastructure on the frontiers.
  Senior minister and former party president Rajnath Singh reportedly gives him enough freedom on issues concerning North-east India. No wonder it was Rijiju, and not any senior minister of Modi sarkar, who announced a fortnight ago the Centre's grand plan to construct a 2,000-km-long road along the McMahon Line from Mago-Thingbu in Tawang to Vijaynagar in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh.
It's no small project. In the backdrop of hostile terrain, mostly snow-fed, the project cost could run up to Rs 40,000 crore, according to Rijiju. And this border road will be the biggest single road project in the history of India.
China, which has already created allweather road infrastructure in Tibet bordering Arunachal Pradesh, lodged strong protests, only to be rebuffed by New Delhi.
Beijing must have noted by now the moves of this young minister from Arunachal Pradesh. But experts say mere symbolism will not scare away China which in 1962 temporarily occupied parts of present-day Arunachal Pradesh, then called the North-East Frontier Agency or NEFA.
No Impact on China
Ajai Sahni, executive director of New Delhi based think tank, the Institute for Conflict Management, says Rijiju's appointment in the Modi sarkar will have no significant impact on China's orientation.
"The only element that will influence China is India's real military and economic capacities, and the equation of power between the two countries," says Sahni.
Apart from the China angle, Rijiju's placement in North Block is expected to aid Modi sarkar on two other counts. First, he could help woo north-east insurgents into the mainstream and signing permanent pacts with them within the framework of the Indian Constitution.
And, secondly, the presence of a prominent NE face in MHA was expected to curb the menace of racial attacks on north-easterners in metro cities such as New Delhi and Bangalore, a phenomenon that has flared up in recent months.
Binalakshmi Nepram, a NE activist and founder of Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network, says Delhi alone has registered 700 incidents of verbal and physical assault on north-easterners in the last 10 months, making a case for an anti-racial law.
Former home secretary GK Pillai does not think yet another law will help curb such attacks. He advises Rijiju to take steps towards making changes in history textbooks, and in the national anthem. "It's sad that no northeast hero finds a place in our history books.
Also, our national anthem mentions the Sindh or Sindhu which is no longer an Indian river. Why can't we replace it with a river from the north-east?" Pillai asks.
(The MHA in the previous government took the stand that the versions of the national anthem with Sindh and Sindhu mean the same and may refer either to the river or the Sindhi community.)

Having been thrashed in elections  can Congress bounce back from No 3Can Congress bounce back from No 3?
By Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar, TNN | 26 Oct, 2014, 10.59AM IST
Incumbents tend to lose, especially after more than one term, in all democracies. So, even if a Congress state government had performed dreadfully and been ousted by voters, it could hope that the new government would also face anti-incumbency.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Having been thrashed in the general election, and again in the state elections last week in Maharashtra and Haryana, can the Congress bounce back? And if so, how and why?
In the past, the Congress has often been written off after massive defeats but bounced back. However, we may have entered a new phase. The Congress was able to recover from terrible debacles in the past as long as it remained the second largest party, in state as well as national elections. The reason was simple.
Incumbents tend to lose, especially after more than one term, in all democracies. So, even if a Congress state government had performed dreadfully and been ousted by voters, it could hope that the new government would also face anti-incumbency after a few years, and be voted out. In this game, the Congress didn't have to do anything spectacular while in Opposition. It could just bide its time, and wait for its opponent to make mistakes and be hit by anti-incumbency .
But that strategy will no longer work in several states.Wherever the Congress has slipped to third or fourth position in a state, anti-incumbency has favoured the No 2 party , leaving the No 3 party out in the cold. The Congress has never been able to bounce back in any state where it has fallen to third position.
This first happened in Tamil Nadu. The Congress ruled the state till 1967, but lost to the DMK. Congressmen waited confidently for a comeback. But then MG Ramachandran split from the DMK to form the AIADMK . These two parties have occupied the No 1 and 2 positions ever since. The Congress, at No 3, has grown ever weaker. The pattern was repeated next in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Congress was thrashed by Lalu Yadav in Bihar in 1990, but was still No 2. Then it slipped to third position in 1995, being overtaken by the BJP as well as Lalu. And later Congress slipped to No 4 after Nitish Kumar split away from Lalu to form the Samta Party, later called the JDU. Even when the Congress returned to power in New Delhi in 2004-14, it remained a pygmy in Bihar.
In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state, Mulayam Singh Yadav edged out the Congress in the 1989 state election.After that the BJP and BSP came up strongly, relegating Congress to third or fourth position. It was never able to bounce back.
Despite these setbacks, the Congress remained either No 1 or No 2 in other states. This enabled it come back after every defeat, though often as head of a coalition, not in its own right.
But in the last few years the party has slipped to No 3 or lower in several other states. The top two positions are now occupied in West Bengal by the Trinamool Cogress and Left Front; in Andhra Pradesh by the TDP and YSR Congress; in Haryana by the BJP and INLD; and in Maharashtra by the BJP and Shiv Sena.
Today , the once-mighty Congress rules in only three major states -Karnataka, Kerala and Assam -and some mini-states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur. These states account for less than 80 of the 543 seats in Parliament.
Clearly , the Congress can no longer bank on anti-incumbency to return to power in places where it has become No 3. It needs a new purpose, a new message to enthuse voters. Alas, its leadership shows no sign of acknowledging this. Some Congressmen have the forlorn hope that Priyanka Gandhi can be a new savior. But the dubious deals of her husband were a key reason for the party's decimation in Haryana, so she could be more a liability than an asset.
Some intellectuals have suggested that the Congress should sack the Gandhi family, or at least Rahul Gandhi.Sorry, but the party is a bunch of opportunists held together only by the Gandhi family . Without the family, it will split into irrelevancy.
And the party retains one trump card. Even if it slips to No 3 in state after state, it is easily No 2 at the national level. Regional parties may hammer it in state elections, but no single regional party can beat it at the national level. So, when anti-incumbency duly hits the BJP after one, two or even three terms, the Congress can still hope to replace it at the head of a diverse coalition. Coalition dharma may mean the Congress will have to swallow even more humiliations than were heaped on it by the Left Front in 2004 and by Mamata Banerjee in 2009. But all is not lost.

Wary of Indo-US joint efforts  ISI shifts Dawood Ibrahim to Pak-Afghan borderDawood Ibrahim
(Top sources in country’s…)
NEW DELHI: Sustained joint efforts by Indian and US security agencies seem to have driven underworld don Dawood Ibrahim into hiding close to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border .
Top sources in country's security establishment, involved in tracking the activities of the D-Company, said that Dawood had been whisked away from his high-security mansion in Karachi's Clifton area by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and shifted to an undisclosed location close to the Af-Pak border.Indian intelligence agencies, keeping close tabs on movement of Dawood and his men, received specific inputs over the past few days about the gangster shifting base.
"Dawood seems to have gone completely underground. He has not been seen or even heard of interacting with his close aides. The Inter-Services Intelligence and Dawood appear under a lot of pressure," sources in the intelligence community claimed. Sources added that Inter-Services Intelligence appeared extremely wary of the new Indo-US cooperation to fight terrorism, with special focus on targeting the D-Company network.
This had come up during he extended dialogue between National Security Advisor AK Doval and state department officials in the US earlier this month. Sources said that cooperation on Dawood would be the first test of the partnership between the two countries with US playing a crucial role in choking the funds to the DCompany. The mastermind of 1992 Mumbai terror attacks and many more subsequently has business interests around the world, including in UAE, Africa and Pakistan. It is suspected that Dawood has been using money raised by smuggling narcotics to fund terror activities in Afghanistan and India .

Wipro slips for second session after Q2 results
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 10.01AM IST
(The company sees Q3 IT services…)
MUMBAI: IT major Wipro declined for second straight session after its second quarter results were below street expectations. After correcting 4 per cent on muhurat trading session, the stock slipped over 2 per cent in early trade.
The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,085 crore during July-September quarter, down 0.9 per cent, against Rs 2,103.2 crore in previous quarter.
"Wipro reported weaker than expected performance for Q2FY15, with revenue and margin missing the expectation. Moreover, the guidance was softer than PLe/Consensus expectation," said Prabhudas Lilladher report.
Sales in during the quarter increased to Rs 11,816 crore, up 12.4 per cent, from Rs 10,508.3 crore, QoQ.
The company sees Q3 IT services revenues at $1,808-1,842 million. Q2 EBIT margins stood at 22 per cent vs 22.8 per cent, QoQ.
The management is still confident of improving growth momentum in H2FY15 on the back of large deal wins.
"We assign high probability to H2 FY15 being materially better than H1 FY15 in terms of overall absolute profitability. Uncertainty around growth trajectory has precluded company's valuation from re-rating and therefore stock has been a relative underperformer," said IIFL report.
"So another good thing is that valuation is quite inexpensive at 12.9x FY17 P/E. We upgrade our rating on Wipro to Buy with a higher 9-12 month target price of Rs 652," the report added.
At 09:50 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 554.85, down 1.05 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 557.95 and a low of Rs 548 in trade today.

NEW DELHI: A slew of earnings announcements from blue-chips, including Maruti Suzuki and ICICI Bank , will set the tone for stock markets this week, say experts.
Besides, trend in global markets, investment by overseas investors, movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price would also influence the trend on bourses.
"We believe positivity would extend further in the days to come; however, traders should be cautious in stock selection due to prevailing earning season," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Major earnings this week include those from Hindustan Unilever, Lupin, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Sesa Sterlite, Tech Mahindra, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki India and Suzlon Energy.
On the global front, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) will undertake a monetary policy review at a two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The benchmark S&P BSE 30-share Sensex concluded the week at 26,851.05, showing a surge of 742.52 points.

What to look-out for in a property for rentAshutosh Limaye
(If you are buying a house…)
A lot of investors buy property on the basis of back-of-the-envelope calculations of rental income. Unfortunately, many of the assumptions they use are not realistic. If you are also planning to buy property to rent out, make sure you do not make the same mistakes.
The first assumption is that the property will earn rent throughout the year. The calculation can go awry if you are not able to find a tenant. This is especially true if the property is in a far-flung and sparsely occupied locality. You might also have to shell out 15-30 days' rent as brokerage if you find a tenant through an estate agent.
To earn an attractive rental return, buy the apartment in a service or manufacturing hub. "You may buy the apartment at some distance from the employment hub, but it should be well-connected. You may then get the flat at a lower price and be able to earn a higher yield of 6-7%," says Ashutosh Limaye , head, research & REIS, JLL India. He cites the example of Old Madras Road in Bangalore, which is well connected to Whitefield.
Another flawed assumption is that the rent received will be net return. Rental income is eligible for a 30% deduction but the balance 70% is added to the income of the owner and taxed as normal income. If you are in the highest 30% tax bracket and earn Rs 20,000 as rent from your property, the post-tax income will be only Rs 15,634 a month.
It's a bit easier if you have taken a loan, because under Section 24b, the interest paid on the loan can be deducted from your total income. It certainly brings down the cost of the loan. Here again, keep in mind that the interest portion of the EMI keeps coming down every month. So, the tax benefit will dwindle with every passing year.
Residential or commercial property?
Investors are also swayed by the greater demand for residential property. True, such property has a higher demand, but the prices push down the rental yields. "Rental yields from residential property are very low at 2.5-3%," says Limaye. On the other hand, commercial property offers rental yield of 6-9%. "However, buyers of residential property are compensated by higher capital appreciation," points out Sanjay Sharma, managing director, Qubrex, a Gurgaon-based real estate consultancy.
There are other advantages as well. It is easier to find tenants for a residential property. However, an investor must also take into account the legal implications if the tenant refuses to vacate the property.
Also consider the tax implications of owning a house. If the house is lying vacant, you have to pay tax on the deemed rental from it at marginal tax rate after 30% deduction. Owners of vacant residential properties also have to pay wealth tax at the rate of 1% of the amount by which the combined value of your assets exceeds Rs 30 lakh. Commercial property is not included in the computation of wealth tax.

Five common ways you can lose money
Oct 27, 2014, 08.00AM IST
Tags:
(If you are suffering monetary…)
By Bindisha Sarang
If you are suffering monetary losses due to laziness and ignorance, have an ECS arrangement in place or set up phone reminders to ensure that you don't.
1. Missing the insurance premium date
How you lose: Irrespective of the reason for missing the payment date for your insurance premium, you stand to lose a lot of money. Insurers usually give a 15-30 day grace period, but if you miss even this, your policy can lapse. Depending on the time lapsed, you have to pay the premium, along with the revival charges, to retain the policy after the grace period is over.
What's your loss? The revival charge varies among different insurers. Typically, it is a flat fee of around Rs 500 or an interest on the outstanding premium, which is usually around 0.75% per month. The revival charges also depend on the type of policy.
2. Forgetting your credit card payment
How you lose: Among financial products, there's nothing as easy to use and as complicated to understand as a credit card. If you miss a credit card payment, you stand to suffer losses in three ways. You will be slapped with a late payment fee; you will have to pay interest on the outstanding sum, and you will have to pay more for any purchases that you make in the next billing cycle.
What's your loss? Usually, the late payment fee ranges between Rs 300 and Rs 700, depending on the payment due. The interest charged is 2-3% on the outstanding bill. You will have to pay an extra 2-3% for the purchases made in the next billing cycle. Your credit score will also suffer.
3. Ignorance about depositing advance tax
How you lose: Advance tax is required to be paid in three instalments. At least 30% of the tax by 15 September, 60% of the tax by 15 December, and the remaining by 15 March. If you fail to pay advance tax, you will have to pay interest on the defaulted amount.
What's your loss? Penalty is 1% simple interest per month on the defaulted sum for three months. The penalty is the same (1%) if you missed the 15 December deadline. If you miss the final date of payment, you will have to pay 1% simple interest on the defaulted amount for every month until the tax is fully paid.
4. Delay in paying utility bills
How you lose: A family of four easily pays 6-8 utility bills a month, which includes mobile bills, electricity bills, Internet charges, among others. If you manage to miss these, you have to shell out the late payment fee. What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
5. Forgetting the loan EMI payment
How you lose: This is again a double-edged sword. If you miss home or car loan instalment , not only are you slapped with a penalty, but your credit score also suffers.
What's your loss? A late payment fee for a missed EMI on a personal loan with HDFC Bank is 24% per annum on the outstanding sum from the date of default. A late payment charge for a missed EMI on a home loan with ICICI Bank is in the range of Rs 500-5,000.

JSPL slips nearly 6% as CBI launches probe for mining in Saranda forests
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 11.36AM IST
(JSPL said it would respond…)
NEW DELHI: Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) slipped nearly as much as 5.6 per cent in trade on Monday, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun a probe into how Congress leader Naveen Jindal's company got permission from the environment ministry under Jayanti Natarajan in 2013 to mine iron ore in Asia's largest sal forest in the Naxal-affected Saranda area of Jharkhand.
At 09:20 a.m.; JSPL was trading 4.2 per cent lower at Rs 158.75. It hit a low of Rs 156.35 and a high of Rs 160.10 in trade today.
However, JSPL in a statement mailed to IANS, said it would respond to the CBI's preliminary enquiry (PE) registered Friday over the company's alleged diversion of forest land.
Responding to an ET query a JSPL spokesperson said "we have only come to know of the preliminary enquiry through media reports."
"JSPL reiterates that we have always co-operated with the investigative agencies and will respond when we receive these queries from the investigative authorities," added the report.
Sources told ET the JSPL project in the Saranda forests was taken up for discussion in the Cabinet Committee on Investments and cleared in May 2013.
The project was cleared by the CCI, the sources maintained. CBI sources said the Forest Advisory Committee in 2011 had considered JSPL's mining project but noted that the forest of Saranda is part of the core area of the Singhbhum reserve, one of the finest habitats for elephants, added the ET report.

European Union doubles assistance to 1 billion euros to combat EbolaBy: Press Trust of India | Berlin | Posted: October 26, 2014 3:45 pm
The European Union has nearly doubled its assistance to combat the raging Ebola virus in West Africa to 1 billion euros.
The heads of state and government of the 28-nation bloc agreed upon the move at their two-day summit concluded in Brussels on Friday.
“EU member nations pledged at the meeting to increase their financial assistance to continue to provide emergency assistance for the population affected by the Ebola epidemic and to support a “sustained, coordinated and increased” effort to curb the spread of the deadly virus,” a joint statement said.
Before providing 1 billion euros (USD 1.26 billion), EU leaders had pledged nearly 600 million euros to pay for medical staff and facilities in the worst affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where some 4,900 people have died of the disease.
In addition to the financial assistance, the EU nations also agreed to increase the deployment of medical and support staff in the affected region.
While expressing their “deep concern” over the continuing spread, the member states said that the scale of the epidemic is a threat not only to the economy and stability of the affected countries, but also to the region as a whole.
They called upon the EU high representative on foreign affairs and the European Commission to develop a package of measures addressing the wider political, security and economic implications of the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
EU member nations and the European Commission pledged to provide appropriate care for international health workers within available resources to receive the treatment they needed, including thorough medical evacuation.
They also agreed on the use of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre to promote the deployment of voluntary health experts.
They shared the view that helping West Africa to cope with the crisis is the best way to prevent a serious outbreak of the disease elsewhere in the world.
However, in the wake of the first confirmed case of Ebola infections in Europe, the state of preparedness within the EU and further efforts to protect EU countries and their citizens must be given top priority, the statement said.
They called for precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contagion, including coordinated preventive actions within the EU such as sharing of information and best practices, training of health professionals and entry screenings if necessary.

Gold Struggles as Equities Hurt Safe-haven AppealIVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Singapore: Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks at the weekend were received calmly in the market.
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.
"In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion," Gan said.
Spot gold was steady at $1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn't far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week.
The metal's losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain's economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown. Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher.
Bullion traders were also closely watching investors' positions in gold funds. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the price of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

Govt mulls fixing tenures of top management ...Government mulls fixing tenures of top management in PSUs to revamp sector

Central Public Sector Enterprises
(Government is readying…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government is readying a reform blueprint to revitalise public sector companies with measures, including listing such enterprises on stock exchanges, fixing tenures for the top management and increasing accountability for their boards to instil efficiency. The government has dusted off the three-year old S K Roongta committee report on reforming central public sector units, which had not been implemented by the previous regime."A fresh Cabinet note has been floated," a government official familiar with the move told ET.
The panel headed by former Steel Authority of India chairman had submitted its report to the Planning Commission during the previous United Progressive Alliance government. After unshackling diesel prices from state control and opening up coal mining to the private sector, the government is keen to continue the momentum of reforms. Besides big-bang steps, attention is also being given to nuts-and-bolts measures.
More efficient and goal-oriented managements of state -run companies with significant surplus funds can help kick-start the investment cycle. Maharatna and Navratna companies, which have some degree of financial autonomy, have a surplus of over Rs 2 lakh crore parked in banks. "The country's public sector needs reforms," said UD Chaubey, director general of the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises , the apex body of central government-owned public enterprises. Chaubey, who was a member of the panel, said there was increased emphasis on the role of public sector companies worldwide following the financial crisis.
He highlighted how countries including the UK, Norway, Malaysia, China, Vietnam and the Philippines had opted for a holding company structure to strengthen the public sector. The government had initiated some cleaning up in the boards of public sector enterprises soon after taking over in May and is now looking at ways to infuse transparency in functioning and improve productivity. With the increased focus on manufacturing, the government sees an important role for the public sector.
"There is an important need for the fourth phase of CPSEs reform, as many sectors have lost out in global competition and have declined...Should India not have a strong presence in manufacturing, may be, defence, nuclear power, specialised capital goods industries, green technologies and the like? How could the government get an efficient Indian presence in these sectors where the private sector investments are not forthcoming?" the panel said it is report.
The panel had also suggested that the government should list at least 50 stateowned companies over the next five years and give them greater autonomy to choose consultants, vendors with proprietary technology, technology partners, joint venture partners and companies for acquisition. The panel had also suggested that the
Narendra Modi government should identify loss-making Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and consider selling them through auctions to other public sector companies and better utilisation of their land banks. It had pitched for sweeping human resource reforms at CPSEs to bring in domain experts and fixed tenures for toplevel management. The emphasis on strong state-run enterprises is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's experiment as chief minister of Gujarat, where he encouraged and eventually developed very strong companies across sectors. There are about 260 CPSEs, employing over 1.3 million people.

Mulayam wala laptop up for sale on e-taili...The scheme was launched by the Akhilesh Yadav government in 2012 under which laptops were distributed among students in the state.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MORADABAD: The Uttar Pradesh government's 'free laptop' scheme may have been launched to uplift the education standard in the state, but its beneficiaries seem to have a different goal in mind. It has been found that students have been trading these laptops on e-marketing portals for easy money.
The incident came to light when it was found that a mathematics teacher of the private Munda Panday inter college sold a laptop for Rs 14,000 to a Rampur resident through an e-tailing site. On further investigation, it was found that he had purchased the laptop from the father of one of his female students who had received it under the scheme.
The scheme was launched by the Akhilesh Yadav government in 2012 under which laptops were distributed among students in the state passing out from class X and XII.
District inspector of school, Sarwan Kumar Yadav said that the state government had distributed 24,143 laptops each costing around Rs 19,000 in the Moradabad district. Speaking with TOI, Yadav said, "The chief minister wants to make the students more tech savvy and laptops are the best equipment for imparting e-education. We are saddened to hear that the students are selling their laptops." He said that the matter of this teacher of a private inter college selling a laptop distributed under the scheme will be looked into and action will be taken accordingly.
As per earlier news reports, some such laptops had also been sold earlier in other parts of the state.
The Moradabad teacher had used the description, 'Mulayam Wala Laptop or Sath me net setter, new keyword, new mouse' etc to make the product more attractive for buyers. When TOI contacted the teacher through the details given on the website, he confirmed selling the laptop for Rs 14,000, saying that he mentioned keywords like Rampur in the ad he posted as it is very close to where he teaches. He said that he had used the laptop for merely 50 hours before selling it.
The teacher claimed that he has a Bachelor of Education and BSc Mathematics degree and despite having a government job, had to sell the laptop due to shortage of money.
Many sellers also post ads expressing their desire to buy laptops distributed under the SP government's free laptop scheme. The Rampur resident had also expressed a desire to purchase 'Mulayam Wala Laptop' for Rs 9,000.
Socialist and the renowned Dalit writer Kanwal Bharti, says, "The basic needs of the students are not the laptops. In rural areas, students don't the have a basic education system in place. Due to lack of money, inability to access the internet and shortage of electricity, they end up selling their laptops." He said the state should provide free education and employment first; laptops are secondary needs.
Sarwan Kumar Yadav said, "It's not easy for the administration to stop students from selling their laptops. We can only request that instead of selling, they use the technology for their own benefit and make their future brighter."

Bumper Diwali sale; seeing surge in proxy demand: Honda08:00 am
Backed by Diwali sale boost, Yadvinder Guleria, Vice President-Sales & Marketing, Honda Motorcycles is confident of selling 45 lakh 2-wheeler units in FY15.
In addition, second largest two-wheeler player sees a massive surge in ownership replacement demand for the two-wheeler segment, in turn indicating a pick up in the economy.
The company has a 26 percent market share in the two-wheeler space in H1FY15. Furthermore, it enjoys leadership in automatic scooters with 55 percent market share, he says in an interview with CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy.
Experts believe this bumper Diwali celebration will continue in next Diwali as well, on hopes of more reforms and execution of these reforms from the Modi government going ahead.
Also read:  Is Hero Motocorp best recovery play after record sales?
Below is the edited transcript of the interview:
Q: Was it a market share increase, was it more replacement demand or did you see in your buyers list a lot of first time buyers and an actual expansion of the market pie?
A: Definitely, there is a mix of buyers in the market. We do see a lot of first time buyers and maybe up to 125 CC to 150 CC category, there are a lot of first time buyers but yes. At the same time, in the entry level segment, we obviously see the maximum number of first time buyers but replacement market is also growing because now the ownership period of the two wheeler buyers in the last couple of years or I would say in last one decade has definitely reduced from earlier 8-10 years to now probably in the range of five years. So that also is giving an impetus to the two wheeler market growth.
Q: Will you be able to give us a candid view of what the exact market share situation is? Can you tell us what is Honda’s market share in the two-wheeler market now and in the scooter segment and who has Honda really gained market share from in the last six months?
A: Probably, the last question which you ask is for you to work out but yes, definitely I can share the first six months. April to September - Honda is at 26 percent market share in the domestic market and we continue to be the leader in the automatic scooter segment at 55 percent. It is very significant from Honda's perspective that we are not only able to maintain our leadership in automatic scooter market but in fact, compared to the first six months of the previous fiscal year, we have gained 4 percent because last April to September we were around 51 percent market share and in this year, we stand at 55 percent market share despite having many new launches in the segment which have happened. At the same time, this segment of automatic scooter is primarily driving the overall two-wheeler sales in the Indian market.
Q: End of the next 12-18 months, from this 26 percent two wheeler market share how much do you aim to clock in terms of market share?
A: At Honda, we have set up a volume target and the market share would be the final results of what is the overall situation and environment in the market. It depends upon what the overall volumes are clocked in the industry. However, for Honda we are right on our target, which we have set for this fiscal year. Our plan is to sell 4.5 million units i.e. 45 lakh units in this financial year and April to September and even October this month we are right on our target and we hope that we would be able to hit this target of 45 lakh unit in this financial year.
Q: While speaking with dealers before this interview, one Hero dealer was telling us you all had a non-poaching clause up until July i.e. Hero  and Honda won’t poach each other’s dealers and that contract ended in July. So is it that you are going to see more aggressive poaching of dealers hereafter and will that mean larger sales margins to the vendor’s, dealers, will your margins get impacted in the second quarter or in the next 12-16 months?
A: Globally, Honda follows the FIT approach which we define as Fair, Impartial and Transparent. As far as this clause of understanding between two companies is concerned, I would not like to comment more because it was primarily an understanding between Honda Motors Japan and the joint venture that we had in the country. So HMSI was out of it.
However, yes, it is a fact that from July 1st onwards all the clauses as per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which was there between HM Japan and the joint venture company. Now both the companies are free. HMSI as well as Honda is having now the exclusive rights of the legendary wing mark in the country and that is why we say or we basically started our new ‘Honda is Honda’ campaign aggressively in the market so that we can generate a large amount of awareness even in the rural market where we were relatively penetrated.
Q: What about the new launches are that are lined up both in the sub 150 CC motorcycles segment and in the scooter segment in the next 12-18 months?
A: We already announced earlier that we will be very soon coming up with our new 160 CC motorcycle launch which will happen within this calendar year and after that yes, we have a couple of launches both in the scooter segment as well as in the motorcycle segment. Therefore, you will need to wait a little more for formal announcement on those.

Canon Q3 profit slides as demand for cameras tumblesCanon Q3 profit slides as demand for cameras tumbles

Tweet
TOKYO, Oct 24:  
Japan's Canon Inc reported a 21 per cent drop in operating profit for the July to September quarter as a slump in the global digital camera market outweighed a boost from a weaker yen.
The consumer shift to smartphones for casual photo taking has pummelled demand for compact cameras, while the growing popularity of lighter mirrorless cameras has taken away market share from higher margin single-lens reflex cameras.
Operating profit came in at 71.8 billion yen ($665 million), down from 90.6 billion yen for the same period a year ago and not far off figures flagged by the Nikkei business daily earlier this month.
Revenue fell 4.5 per cent to 872.2 billion yen.
But bolstered by sales of printers and other office equipment, the export-reliant company lifted its full-year operating profit forecast for the year ending Dec. 31 to 370 billion yen, up from a prior prediction of 365 billion yen. The new forecast would mark an 9.7 per cent increase on the year.
Canon's shares closed up 0.8 per cent on Monday ahead of results.

Right pricing petrol & dieselOil companies should price their products according to their own cost structures
October 27, 2014:  
Fuel pricing has been the bugbear of many a government in India. Though de-licensing of oil refining and marketing, and decontrol of products such as naphtha, fuel oil, lubricants and aviation turbine fuel were one of the first accomplishments of the reform process in the early 1990s, freeing the pricing for transportation fuels — petrol and diesel — remained a challenge.
Last week’s decision by the Centre to deregulate diesel prices has to been seen in this context. For the first time since the short-lived experiment in 2002 when petrol and diesel prices were freed for a short period, oil companies will have the freedom to manage retail price of diesel on their own and adjust it at periodic intervals to reflect market levels. Petrol prices were deregulated in June 2010 but fortnightly revisions have been a reality only since January 2013.
Both petrol and diesel are politically sensitive commodities but unlike petrol, diesel price changes have a cascading effect across the economy on everything from bus and rail fares to vegetable and fruit prices. Governments have, therefore, been wary of freeing diesel pricing and the sustained rise in global oil prices from 2002 until the crisis in 2008 did not help matters. The Modi government has now grabbed the opportunity provided by a falling global oil price regime — prices of benchmark Brent have fallen from around $105 a barrel in April to about $86 a barrel now— to push through deregulation of diesel and it needs to be complimented for this. Yet, deregulation of diesel, noteworthy as it is, is only the first step in much-needed reform of the oil sector.
What we immediately need is some transparency and reform of the methods followed by the oil companies while setting fuel prices, whether petrol and diesel or cooking gas and kerosene. The concept of ‘under-recovery’ has to be jettisoned and competition between the different players — public and private — needs to be encouraged. That alone will allow proper price discovery for these economically sensitive fuels.
The concept of ‘under-recovery’ is unique to India. ‘Under-recoveries’ are nothing but the difference between the oil companies’ ‘desired’ price of a fuel, say diesel, and its prevailing retail price in the domestic market. This ‘desired’ price is calculated on trade-parity basis that takes into account the landed cost of imported fuel and the price at which it is exported by domestic refineries. Presently, the ratio is 80:20 in favour of landed cost. For instance, if the price of a litre of diesel as calculated on trade-parity basis is, say, Rs.70 a litre and the oil companies are selling diesel in the retail market at Rs.65 a litre, the ‘under-recovery’ will be Rs.5 a litre.
‘Under-recovery’ is not the same as a loss which happens when a producer is forced to sell his product below cost. Oil companies refine crude oil to produce diesel (and other products such as petrol, cooking gas and kerosene) in their own refineries in India. They have not been importing diesel or petrol for a decade now, thanks to a sharp increase in domestic refining capacity.
Given this, why should the landed cost of imports, which includes items such as freight, insurance, handling charges and, of course, customs duty, be considered for fixing domestic retail price? This is the unfair part about ‘under-recoveries’, a word that is often cleverly used interchangeably with losses. Let this be clear: ‘under-recovery’ is a notional concept and does not necessarily mean a loss. The only exception when it could include a loss is where global crude oil prices surge to abnormal levels and the retail price of fuels remains unchanged. There has not been such a situation in recent years.
But why do oil companies harp on ‘under-recoveries’ and demand that domestic price should be linked to that? Simply because the landed cost, which includes duties and other levies, offers them protection to cover up possible inefficiencies in their operations. This protection is unnecessary and unfair to domestic consumers and all it does is promote inefficiency. It is no secret that the public sector oil companies are saddled with high costs for reasons ranging from excess staff to duplication of facilities between them. By linking retail price to ‘under-recovery’ all that the government does is ensure that such inefficiencies are passed on to consumers. Again, global prices of crude oil and refined fuels such as petrol and diesel do not always move in tandem. The forces that drive their respective markets are different. For instance, the international market price of petrol and diesel can spike if there is a refinery outage somewhere in the world causing supply disruption. There have been instances in the past when refined fuel prices have surged due to a fire or a maintenance shutdown by a particular refinery. Crude oil prices are not affected by such factors. By taking into account landed cost of refined fuels rather than crude oil, the oil companies may be forcing consumers to pay a higher price when there is really no supply problem within the country.
Cost-plus pricing
The ideal way to go is for oil companies to price their products according to their own cost structures. Each company has a unique cost structure which is a factor of its refining efficiency. The final market price should be discovered on the basis of the cost of crude plus refining costs and the margin of the oil company.
This can happen only in a competitive environment where the oil companies compete with each other and against the three private players — Reliance Industries, Essar and Shell. As of now , the PSUs operate as a cartel when pricing their products, which is an anti-competition practice. Clearly, the next item on the agenda for the government should be to push the oil companies truly into the market era where fuel prices are linked to efficiencies and vary not just between the different players but between petrol stations of the same player based on which one is more efficient. That will be real reform.

Hyderabad, Oct 27:

The main accused and founder-chairman of Satyam, B Ramalinga Raju, and others accused who are on the bail, appeared before the judge.
The special court is expected to announce the date of final verdict in the case on October 30. Hearing in the five-and-a-half-year-old case was completed in June this year during which 216 witnesses were examined.
Raju had confessed in January 2009 fudging of books to inflate profit over the years. He was later arrested by the Andhra Pradesh Police after which the CBI had taken over the investigation.
He, along with his brother and company team, was charged with cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery, breach of trust and violation of various I-T laws, among others.

Black money: Govt discloses 3 names to SC  politicians not on list for nowCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
Dabur said that Pradip Burman’s account was opened when he was a non-resident Indian, Lodhya denied having a foreign bank account, and Radha Timblo said she needed to study the affidavit before reacting.
“The intention of the present government is clear and unambiguous. The government is keen to unearth black money held abroad and for that purpose it will use all diplomatic and legal means and also all investigative agencies to obtain information that can assist in such unearthing,” the Centre said in the affidavit.
Read: BJP calls black money affidavit historic, Cong claims blackmail
 
The Congress asked the Modi administration to refrain from “political titillation and playing games”, calling for disclosure of names of all those who had illicit money abroad.
“They are the government. They control ministries and departments. They should act....Do not play games,” said party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
Monday’s affidavit was filed by the income tax (I-T) department in response to a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking that the government take action to bring back India’s black money, estimated by some at nearly $500 billion.
Read:  Govt trying to protect politicians, businessmen, says Ram Jethmalani
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu will hear the black money case on Tuesday. The government is seeking that the court modify an earlier order insisting that all names be revealed; its view is that names should be disclosed only after prosecution is launched against the tax evaders.
The affidavit said that the prosecution against Burman began after the government received information against him from French authorities. It was silent on the sources of information on the others.
The government also informed the court that Switzerland had assured its cooperation, including reaching a treaty on automatic exchange of information with India. It said Swiss authorities had agreed to assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank documents.
HT had on last Wednesday reported the Centre was likely to tell the apex court names of people against whom strong evidence exists of stashing away black money in Swiss banks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is moving fast to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in slush funds or black money stashed abroad, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The government is building pressure particularly on Switzerland, seeking details of Indians who have parked unaccounted for money in the Alpine country's highly secretive banks. It has quickly implemented a Supreme Court directive to set up a high-powered special investigation team , headed by retired judge MB Shah, to look into the issue.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
According to PTI, the Union government told the apex court that Switzerland had indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases probed by the income tax department.
Information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established, the government said.
Even though the government pointed out that it had no intention to withhold names of people who have stashed black money, it also said such names could not be disclosed unless there was prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.
The Centre also noted that every foreign account held by an Indian may not be illegal.
Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had told the Supreme Court that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
There were murmurs of protest within the ruling BJP that not disclosing names would hurt the party's image after it had made bringing back black money, a key issue in a general election that it won by a landslide. The Centre's stand also drew a strong response from the Congress, which accused it of hypocrisy.
Turning the tables on the Congress, finance minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the disclosing of names of people holding black money accounts will embarrass the opposition party.
The previous UPA government had submitted the names of 18 persons who had illegally stashed away money in Liechtenstein to the Supreme Court.
It had come under flak after it opposed the Supreme Court’s direction to set-up a special investigation team (SIT) and its review petition against the court’s verdict was dismissed. The SIT was finally set up by the Modi government within days of its taking over at the Centre.

(In a major move, the government…)
NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court in the black money case, naming three prominent businessmen including Pradip Burman, formerly of Dabur group.
Goa-based miner Radha S Timblo and Bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya were the other two businessmen named in the affidavit.
The Centre told the court that it had no intention to withhold names of persons who have stashed black money abroad and stated that information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established.
Every foreign account held by an Indian may not be illegal, the Centre said, adding that names cannot be disclosed unless there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.
It also told the court that Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases where probe has been done by IT department.
Reacting to the reports Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya told Times Now, "We don't have any Swiss account. That is the only thing that I can say." "I don't know how my name has appeared on the list," he added.
With one of its members, Pradip Burman, being named as an account holder in a foreign bank in the black money issue, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans said the account complied with all legal requirements.
"We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account," a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
"We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable," he added.
Pradip Burman currently holds no position in the homegrown FMCG major although he was once a Whole Time Director of Dabur India.
Regretting that there was a lack of differentiation between legal and illegal foreign bank account holders, the spokesperson further said: "It is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush."
It was earlier reported that the Centre will reveal the names of three Indians in the affidavit against whom prosecution has been launched for stashing black money in foreign banks. The other names which have been doing the rounds, including politicians linked to the previous UPA government , would be revealed only if prosecution is launched against them.

Asian Countries Most Affordable for Expats: SurveyECB Weighs Further Action as Economic Picture Darkens
Asian countries dominated the rankings of being most affordable places for expats, according a survey. Asian countries Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan took the first three places, driven by lower spend on utilities, groceries and accommodation, said the survey, which was commissioned by HSBC Expat.
HSBC Expat is a provider of offshore financial services and is part of the HSBC Group, one of the world's largest financial services organisations. Over 9,000 expats in more than 100 countries were surveyed.
The expat expenses league table (see table below) ranks each country using a score that summarises expats' ability to afford a range of goods and services. In the survey, 35 per cent of the expat expenses score is derived from the disposable income score, with the remaining 65 per cent comes from the cost of everyday goods and services score.
India was ranked at the sixth position as being the sixth most affordable place for expats. On the other end, UK was ranked the costliest places for expats while US was put at the 18th rank.
"Expats in Thailand and Vietnam point out how cost-effective it is to live in these destinations, with many saying that the countries offer much better value than home," the survey said.
In Asia, over six in ten (65 per cent) expats see their disposable income increase, with more expats rating the country highly for quality of life (50 per cent) than Europe (37 per cent), the survey added.
The survey showed that China is the best place for expats looking to make their money go further, with more than three quarters (76 per cent) of expats in the country experiencing a growth in their spending power once they have moved.
Asia also remained a popular destination for high earnings expats. "Expats there are almost three times more likely to earn over $250,000 per annum than their counterparts in Europe," the survey said.

Post your opinion here
 
Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  DLF continued to remain under heavy selling pressure, falling 8 percent intraday on Monday. Investors are cautious as media reports suggest that the new BJP-led Haryana government is going to probe into all land scams, including the deal between UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and realty developer DLF.
The report quoted senior cabinet minister Anil Vij, “We would hold a probe into acquisition of 70,000 acres during the 10-year regime of Bhupinder Singh Hooda government. We would inquire whether the land was used for the purpose it was acquired. It would be probed if there was any violation in acquisition to benefit any individual.”
Earlier in July, Bhupinder Singh Hooda (former Haryana chief minister) government had legalised the controversial land deal between Vadra-owned company Skylight Hospitality and DLF.
DLF stock has already been under pressure as market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has barred the company and its six executives from accessing capital markets for 3 years. It was penalised for failing to disclose key information at the time of its record-breaking 2007 market listing. 
DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time. This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market.
The realty firm appealed for interim relief from the Sebi order last week. The Securities Appellate Tribunal will hear the matter next on 30 October.
 At 11:11 hrs DLF was quoting at Rs 110.30, down Rs 9.60, or 8.01 percent on the BSE.

Nissan to recall 9k Micra  Sunny units in IndiaNissan to recall 9000 Micra, Sunny units in India
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 14:25 IST
Nissan Sunny
Japanese auto firm Nissan is recalling 9,000 units of its compact car Micra and mid-sized sedan Sunny in India to replace defective airbags as part of a global recall.
The recall will cover cars manufactured between 2008 to 2012 that use safety airbags made by its supplier Takata.
" Nissan plans to begin notifying customers soon. Nissan dealers will replace the driver airbag inflator with a correctly manufactured part at no cost to the customers for parts or labour," a Nissan India spokesperson said.
The global recall of 2,60,000 units by the Japanese auto major affects models, including Note, March/Micra, Sunny/Almera/Versa, Patrol and Cube.
These are affected by a driver airbag concern that Takata reported to Nissan, the company said.
Ever since auto industry body SIAM started voluntary vehicle recall for safety related issues in India in July 2012, over seven lakh vehicles have been recalled by various manufacturers including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Ford, Honda and General Motors.
Last month, Maruti Suzuki India announced recall of 69,555 units of Dzire, Swift and Ritz models manufactured between March 2010 and August 2013 to repair wiring harness fitment.
In April this year, in one of the biggest vehicle recalls in India, Maruti Suzuki recalled 1,03,311 units Ertiga, Swift and DZire -- manufactured between November 12, 2013 and February 4, 2014 to replace faulty fuel filler neck.
Last year, General Motors India recalled over 1,10,000 units of its multi-utility vehicle Tavera to address emission and specification issues.
The government is in process of framing a mandatory recall policy that would entail penalties as part of the new Central Motor Vehicle Rules.

Narendra Modi inaugurates HN Reliance Foundation hospital
Taking ahead from his digital media campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the need of upgradation in medical science and telemedicine in the country during the inauguration of the recently refurbished Sir Harkisondas Nurrotamdas Reliance Foundation hospital in South Mumbai on Saturday (October 25) evening.

“When our country is compared to other countries, the health care system in our country shames us,” Modi said. He added,  “Instead of focusing on treatment of patients, the health care system must focus on preventive care. It takes less to invest in preventive care than in treatment.”

While addressing several Bollywood stars and political dignitaries, including Maharashtra governor Vidyasagr Rao, present at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital’s inauguration, Modi emphasized on the urgent need to inculcate habit of hand washing as a preventive measure in the health care system.

“The women and child mortality is still alarming in the country,” he said, adding that he read that  40 per cent child death in Pakistan is caused due to absence of hand-washing.  “The roots of both the countries are the same and the situation is not very different in India,” Modi said.

After the launch of ‘Make in India’ campaign, Modi now encouraged the concept of foreign direct investment in the country’s health care system adding that telemedicine will benefit rural areas where expert knowledge can be used to conduct emergency surgeries. He also indicated that the Digital India campaign will be used to improve the telemedicine services in the country. Seen here with Nita Ambani. (Source: Express Photo)

NSE Nifty to trade in a band of 7 800-8 200NSE Nifty to trade in band of 7,800-8,200 with immediate resistance at 8,050 levels
Ambareesh Baliga        Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 09:07 IST
Photo: Reuters
The truncated Diwali week saw the Nifty closing at 8,014, recovering from a 'breakdown' scare and ending about 3 per cent higher to welcome the new Hindu calendar year - Samvat 2071 .
The markets were aided by the performance of the BJP in assembly elections and a slew of reforms, which laid to rest the growing sense of inaction on the policy front. These included the long-awaited diesel deregulation, gas pricing and labour reforms, and a roadmap on coal sector reforms.
Development was the key poll plank for the BJP and the state election results will give the central government renewed confidence and impetus to push forward its reform agenda.
The global environment has also been kind. Lower commodity prices, especially crude oil, have truly been a blessing for the government. If oil prices had hovered above $110, there was a bleak chance of either the diesel deregulation or any hope of reining in the fiscal deficit.
Being an 'Internal Consumption' economy, India would benefit from lower input prices in a stable currency scenario. With China stuttering, India would look a shade better as the domestic industrial climate turns brighter. The government's renewed mandate in state elections will ensure fast-tracking of reforms, which in turn could give the economy a much-awaited kick-start.
The moot question, however, will be the performance of the markets based on the hypothesis of the economy getting back on track. Although I am bullish from a longer term perspective, I still believe that the correction I was expecting is not yet complete.
The expected uptick in the economy due to the Modi factor has been discounted by the markets in the last few months with a 30+ per cent appreciation, and if the government hadn't moved on reforms even after 150 days in the saddle, market participants would have been sorely disappointed.
While the global environment is favourable for the country's economy, FIIs , who are the prime movers of the stock market in the country, may react differently in the short term due to pressures at home. With a probable rate hike in the US and slowdown in the euro zone and China, FIIs in the interim could prefer to be in a 'risk-off' zone. Despite increased domestic inflows, the mismatch could lead to a correction, which below the recent support zone of 7,800-7,850 could lead to a sell-off.
The high expectation faced by the government is the other risk factor for markets. The pace of reforms in the past week could set a new benchmark for delivery going ahead. The big test lies ahead on smooth implementation of GST and the new coal block allocation policy. The industry would also look for higher FDI in insurance. One also needs to see the follow-up action on policy measures already taken. The government has cleared defence projects worth Rs 800 billion, mostly to be sourced domestically, but defense FDI of 49 per cent is yet to draw visible interest from foreign majors.
On the macro data front, inflation has been benign and could continue to be so till November when the base effect wears out. The RBI too may not oblige the finance minister's wish for a rate cut. IIP data is yet to show signs of a sustained recovery.
The festive season sales seemed to have got a huge sentiment boost. Hero MotoCorp sold about 150,000 units in a single day and there are similar stories across various consumer segments. The next few weeks would be important for a confirmation of the continued buoyant sentiments.
Company results have been mixed so far and I don't expect any major positive surprises from companies announcing their earnings in the latter half of the season. The Nifty will stay in a broad band of 7,800-8,200 with an immediate resistance at around 8,050 levels. One should look to selectively accumulate in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods, cement, power and metals.
The outperforming sectors such as pharma, IT and auto ancillaries could take a breather due to international headwinds. I would advise maintaining a healthy cash ratio to utilise opportunities during a sharper correction.

(Toyota Motor Corp. said…)
TOKYO: Toyota kept its lead over rivals against rivals Volkswagen and General Motors as the world's top-selling automaker in the first three quarters of the year.
Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that it had sold 7.615 million vehicles around the world, up nearly 3 per cent from the previous year.
Volkswagen said earlier this month it sold 7.40 million vehicles for January-September, barely edging out General Motors Co. in the closely watched auto sales race, at 7.372 million cars and trucks worldwide. Detroit-based GM also reported its figure earlier this month.
Japanese automaker Toyota was in first place in the first half with sales of almost 5.1 million. It finished first last year with a record 9.98 million sales. GM had finished second and Volkswagen AG third.

DLF slips over 8% on Vadra-DLF deal probe re...Anil Vij
(Senior cabinet minister…)
MUMBAI: Shares of realty giant DLF slumped over 8 per cent today, wiping-out Rs 1,674.7 crore from its market value, on concerns that the company may face probe by the new government in Haryana.
DLF's scrip plunged 7.84 per cent to settle at Rs 110.50 on the BSE. During the day, it tumbled 9 per cent to Rs 109.10.
At the NSE, it slumped 8.30 per cent to close the day at Rs 110.
Led by the dip in the stock, the company's market value fell by Rs 1,674.7 crore to Rs 19,690.30 crore.
The fall in DLF shares, to as low as Rs 109.10 in intra-day trade at the BSE, follows a major plunge of 28 per cent in a single day earlier this month after a Sebi order barred the company and six others from accessing the capital markets for three years.
The Sebi order has been challenged by DLF before the Securities Appellate Tribunal which would next hear the case on October 30.
While the stock had recovered some lost ground last week after being hit by Sebi order, it fell further today after reports suggested that it may face probe in Haryana.
Hours after taking oath, two new ministers in Haryana yesterday said the BJP government would order a thorough probe into the alleged land scams and not spare anyone, even Robert Vadra or former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda .
DLF has a significant presence in Haryana and is credited with creation of India's largest township set up by a private player in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital.
Notably, BJP and other parties had in the run up to the assembly polls attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal.
There have been reports about alleged irregularities in land dealings between Robert Vadra and DLF.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi while campaigning for BJP in Haryana had also kept the alleged land scams in the state at the centre of his attack.
The new ministers' remarks, however, drew sharp reactions from the Congress, which said that such statements show the arrogance of Haryana government.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos faces season of worsts
Bloomberg Oct 27, 2014, 11.40AM IST

(For Amazon.com chief executive…)
For Amazon.com chief executive officer Jeff Bezos , it's turning into a season of worsts.
As Amazon heads into the lucrative end-of-year shopping period, the company on October 25 posted its biggest quarterly net loss since at least 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also forecast sales and profit for the fourth quarter that missed analysts' projections. That puts Amazon on track to lose an estimated $40.5 million for the year, which would be the company's largest annual loss in 12 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only other annual loss for Amazon during that period came in 2012.
In response, investors pushed Amazon shares down 8.3% on October 25, the biggest drop since July. For the year, the stock is down 28%, compared with a 6.3% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. If that performance continues, the company is set for its worst annual stock decline since 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis.
The results illustrate the growing lack of support for Bezos's methods of spending big and counting on sales growth to make up for minuscule profit. Bezos has poured money into everything from smartphones to original television programming to drones, keeping margins razor thin. In contrast, Chinese company Alibaba Group Holding, which overtook Amazon as the world's largest e-commerce company last month based on market capitalisation, makes healthy profits.
"The biggest component is the expense side of the equation," said Scott Tilghman, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. in Los Angeles. "They've got a big checkbook they keep writing upon, which all results in a top line that is less robust than thought." Amazon fell to $287.06 at the close in New York.

Jindal Steel shares drop 8% on fresh CBI enquiryJindal Steel shares drop 8% on fresh CBI enquiry
25 out of 130 banks fail ECB test but capital hole mostly plugged25 out of 130 banks fail ECB test but capital hole mostly plugged

Frankfurt, Oct 26:  
Roughly one in five of the euro zone’s top lenders failed landmark health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank had said on Sunday.
Painting a brighter picture than had been expected, the ECB found the biggest problems in Italy, Cyprus and Greece but concluded that banks’ capital holes had since chiefly been plugged, leaving only a modest €10 billion to be raised.
Italy faces the biggest challenge with nine of its banks falling short and two still needing to raise funds.
The test, designed to mark a clean start before the ECB takes on supervision of the banks next month, said Monte dei Paschi had the largest capital hole to fill at €2.1 billion.
The exercise provides the clearest picture yet of the health of the euro zone's banks more than seven years after the eruption of a financial crisis that almost bankrupted a handful of countries and threatened to fracture the currency bloc.
While 25 of the euro zone's 130 biggest banks failed the health check at the end of last year with a total capital shortfall of €25 billion, a dozen have already raised €15 billion this year to make repairs.
Golman survey
A recent investor survey by Goldman Sachs found they believed the ECB ought to ask lenders to raise an additional €51 billion of capital for the tests to be credible.
Although investors may take heart, it remains to be seen whether the exercise can spur banks to lend more as the region's economic growth stutters to a virtual halt.
European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said the results could encourage banks to lend.
“There is some pick-up (in demand), but it is still slight,’’ Constancio told Reuters. "All this now can really start to change the environment and we hope it will also change the reality."
Alongside Italy, regulators said three Greek banks, three Cypriots, two from both Belgium and Slovenia, and one each from France, Germany, Austria, Ireland and Portugal had also missed the grade as of end-2013.
Analysts generally gave the results a cautious welcome, saying they marked the beginning rather than the end of a banking clean-up in Europe.
"I consider the stress test as an important partial success, which will help reduce uncertainty," said Marcel Fratzscher, president of Germany's DIW economic institute.
"However, important challenges remain unsolved. The stress test alone will not end the credit crunch for small and mid-sized companies in Southern Europe."
Some were more critical. "This seems as if it has been pretty unstressful," said Karl Whelan, an economist with University College Dublin.
"The real issue is the size of the capital shortfall and that is very, very small. I don't feel a whole lot more reassured about the health of the banking system today than last week."
The exercise nonetheless provided a snapshot of banks' vital statistics and forced them, for example, to revise the amount of risky loans - which have not been serviced in 90 days - upwards by €136 billion to €879 billion.
Clean-up ahead
The exercise, which saw officials trawl through more than 40 million individual bank figures, had two parts - a strict review by the ECB of assets such as loans, followed by a wider test of how banks would cope with a new economic crash.
It is the fourth attempt by Europe to clean the stables of its financial sector and has been billed as much the most rigorous.
Previous efforts failed to spot problems, giving lenders in Ireland a clean bill of health shortly before a banking crash drove the country to the brink of financial collapse.
"It is credible," said Nicolas Veron of Brussels think tank Bruegel. "But it is only the start of a longer sequence of cleanup that will extend well into 2015."
The ECB's passmark was for banks to have high-quality capital of at least 8 per cent of their risk-weighted assets, a measure of the riskiness of a banks' loans and other assets, if the economy grows as expected over the next three years, and capital of at least 5.5 per cent if it slides into recession.
Banks with a capital shortfall will have to say within two weeks how they intend to close the gap. They will then be given up to nine months to do so.
Unblocking lending
The ECB staked its reputation on delivering a thorough assessment in an attempt to draw a line under years of financial and economic strife in the bloc.
For many banks, the biggest impact of the tests was not in identifying capital holes but in finding that their assets, such as loans, had been overvalued.
In total, the ECB said banks had been valuing their loans and assets at €48 billion more than they are really worth. This was because they had not recognised €136 billion of bad loans.
That accounted for 11 billion of the €25 billion banks were collectively short of at the end of last year. It also eroded €37 billion of capital among the banks that passed.
Among the major listed banks, the biggest hits were to Greece's Piraeus bank, whose core capital fell by 3.7 percentage points after the ECB adjusted the bank's capital to reflect the new asset valuations.
Monte dei Paschi's capital was reduced by almost a third. There was also a big impact on Austria's Erste Bank.
The adjustments put many banks in an uncomfortable position. Thirty-one had core capital below the 10 per cent mark viewed by investors as a safety threshold, while a further 28 were had ratios just 1 percentage point above.
The ECB will not immediately force lenders with overvalued assets to take remedial action but they will have to hold more capital eventually, leaving less room to expand, lend or pay dividends.
For overall lending, the more fundamental question is whether the demand for credit is there in a moribund euro zone economy.

JSPL slips nearly 6% as CBI launches probe for mining in Saranda forests
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 11.36AM IST
(JSPL said it would respond…)
NEW DELHI: Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) slipped nearly as much as 5.6 per cent in trade on Monday, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun a probe into how Congress leader Naveen Jindal's company got permission from the environment ministry under Jayanti Natarajan in 2013 to mine iron ore in Asia's largest sal forest in the Naxal-affected Saranda area of Jharkhand.
At 09:20 a.m.; JSPL was trading 4.2 per cent lower at Rs 158.75. It hit a low of Rs 156.35 and a high of Rs 160.10 in trade today.
However, JSPL in a statement mailed to IANS, said it would respond to the CBI's preliminary enquiry (PE) registered Friday over the company's alleged diversion of forest land.
Responding to an ET query a JSPL spokesperson said "we have only come to know of the preliminary enquiry through media reports."
"JSPL reiterates that we have always co-operated with the investigative agencies and will respond when we receive these queries from the investigative authorities," added the report.
Sources told ET the JSPL project in the Saranda forests was taken up for discussion in the Cabinet Committee on Investments and cleared in May 2013.
The project was cleared by the CCI, the sources maintained. CBI sources said the Forest Advisory Committee in 2011 had considered JSPL's mining project but noted that the forest of Saranda is part of the core area of the Singhbhum reserve, one of the finest habitats for elephants, added the ET report.

Eye 50% sales post mega defence deal fillip: WalchandnagarAs a company we have been primarily looking at cogeneration power and we are actually trying to change our focus to defence and nuclear segment.
GK Pillai
MD & CEO
Walchandnagar Industries
Hailing the government’s move to approve defence acquisitions worth Rs 80,000 crore, GK Pillai, managing director & chief executive officer,  Walchandnagar Industries says this move gives a major fillip to the defense sector.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Pillai says the company, that works on the research and development (R&D) of submarines, nuclear submarines, launchers, container, etc, is looking to double its sales to 50 percent now.
Furthermore, he is optimistic on partnering with submarine manufacturers for supplying various parts and adds that the company is open to forming a joint-venture (JV) with foreign companies.
Below is the verbatim transcript of GK Pillai’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Anuj Singhal
Anuj: Defence companies have been buzzing in trade today as the government has given nod to projects worth Rs 80,000 crore in the defence space. Can you tell us the kind of opportunity that exists for a company like Walchandnagar and can you quantify that for us?
A: Yes, definitely because the news which came yesterday with regard to the government clearing projects in the defence sector for almost Rs 80000 crore, I am sure it is a big fillip for both the Indian industries as well as for the defence sector itself. We feel that the Indian industries are capable of meeting many of defence equipment related activities will get a fillip and our business capabilities would be better utilized by the country.
But to quantify the things for a company like Walchandnagar industries Ltd who have been mainly into the defence sector we have been doing more work on R&D basis on a single product basis where indigenization has been required. This opportunity will really help us to grow our defence business from the present existing about 25-30 percent what we do now of our total sales, we are hopeful that we will be able to increase it to almost doubling it from 25 percent to almost 50 percent share of our business.
Ekta: What would be the defence orders that you would possibly gain from? You spoke about research and development but can you give us more specifics in terms of what would be the order and where would you come into the value chain and which segment would it be, would it be manufacture of submarines, would it be the other defence mechanisms or manufacturing that you would be gaining from?
A: Definitely because at present we do on a one-off basis more on R&D basis but once this opening up happens we are keener to work on the submarines that have been one of our strength areas. We do some work for the nuclear submarine also.
We also are looking at the ATGMs which the government has decided to open up, we will be working along with DDL as well as the foreign collaborators. The launchers and containers which are there, which we feel will be more in the light of Walchandnagar’s existing manufacturing technology. So these are the three major areas what we are now looking at. And to add to what I said, as a company we have been primarily looking at sugar and cogeneration power and we are actually trying to change our focus to defence and nuclear segment. So this really will help us to move very fast in the direction of being a very specialised manufacturing set up in the country for the defence and nuclear sector. 
Walchandnagar stock price
On December 05, 2014, Walchandnagar Industries closed at Rs 142.00, down Rs 2.95, or 2.04 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 154.50 and the 52-week low was Rs 53.60.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 182.31 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 0.78.

Kochi, Oct 27:  
Software rentals through subscription payment model are fast catching up among infrastructure companies for timely completion of projects with IT assistance.
Majority of the companies are adopting this business model for cost reduction, as India’s infrastructure industry today is facing hard times. With huge debts, companies are even unable to undertake new projects and are struggling to complete the existing ones.
Given the situation, IT is proving to be infrastructure industry’s best bet for survival as well as growth, says K.Varghese Daniel, Founder Director and CEO of Kochi-based Wrench Solutions.
“We are entering a new era of construction project management. Gone are the days when project management software meant CAD and MSOffice and MSProject. Today, there is software designed specifically for the full cycle of engineering, procurement and construction, which is as comprehensive as ERP, much more affordable and faster to roll out”, he told BusinessLine.
Wrench, he said, recently introduced a subscription payment model, which allows customers to use its software as a service (SaaS). The market slowdown has forced companies to shift focus from Capex to Opex to reduce cost. Hence, SaaS would enable customers to simply stop using the system if the project is discontinued, he added.
Wrench’s switch over to SaaS model signals an encouraging trend in the IT market, as it allows companies a risk free way to leverage IT benefits even during cost-cutting phases, he added.

Centre files before Supreme Court affidavit in black money caseBlack money case: Centre discloses 8 more names to Supreme Court
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Centre today disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and Goa-based mining company, against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Pvt Ltd and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the Government.
The affidavit, filed days after the government came under attack from political rivals that it was chary of revealing names, said that these names have been received from French authorities and other countries.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under its scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal“.
The additional affidavit on the black money issue was filed today in furtherance of its affidavit recently when it had said that the names of account holders in foreign banks cannot be disclosed till there is evidence of tax evasion against them and prosecution is launched in India.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries''.
The list names Timblo Pvt Ltd and its directors Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. It was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its directors.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family Burmans said that the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income-Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added.
Lodhiya denied having a Swiss bank account. “We have already declared in the income-tax and there is nothing...we don’t have any Swiss account that is the only thing which I can say,” he said.
Radha Timbo declined to comment on her name being mentioned in the affidavit, saying she has to first study it before commenting.

Bilawal Bhutto booed during Kashmir Million March inUKPrint
PPP's leader Bilawal Bhutto.
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:13 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 6:30 pm
A protest march by a UK-based pro-Pakistan group on the Kashmir issue in the heart of London today fizzled out as barely a few hundred protesters gathered to wave placards and flags.
The so-called ‘Million March’ from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street descended into chaos as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stepped on to the makeshift stage to speak.
The crowd began booing and throwing empty plastic bottles and refused to let him speak.
“This march was to be about Kashmir and for the welfare of Kashmiris. Bilawal has no business being here,” said a group of angry protesters who had travelled from Derby in the East Midlands region of England.
The march was led by Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, referred to as a former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was supported by Mirpuri-origin British parliamentarian Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham.
While the group had claimed overwhelming support from various communities for the march, others had dismissed it as against the “national interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
A counter-protest held by a rival group on Sunday ended with memorandums submitted for the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their high commissions here.
The memorandums urged both India and Pakistan to “respect the fundamental human rights of all citizens of Jammu and Kashmir”.

Shares of defence stocks are celebrating even after Diwali as the sector has bagged major government aid. Stocks like BEL ,  BEML and  Pipavav Defence rallied 5-8 percent intraday on Monday as the government approved projects worth a whopping Rs 80,000 crore. The government also decided that six submarines will be made indigenously and over 8,000 Israeli anti-tank guided missiles and 12 upgraded Dornier surveillance aircraft will be purchased.
The decisions were taken following a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by defence minister Arun Jaitley, that lasted for over two hours with defence secretary, the chiefs of all three services, defence research & development organisation (DRDO) chief and other senior officials attending it. The bulk of the decisions went in favour of the Navy that was in dire need of up-gradation and capability enhancement.
The big ticket step was the decision to build six submarines in India at a cost of about Rs.50,000 crore rather than source it from outside. The other major decision was to purchase 8,356 anti tank guided missile of Israel worth Rs.3,200 crore rather than the US’s Javelin missile for the Indian Army. The Army will also purchase 321 launchers for the missile. Another 12 Dornier surveillance aircraft with enhanced sensors will also be bought from the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) at a cost of Rs.1,850 crore.
The DAC also decided to buy 362 infantry fighting vehicle from the Ordinance Factory Board, Medak in West Bengal for Rs.662 crore. Giving details of the decision to make the six submarines in the country, official sources said a committee will now be formed by the defence ministry which will study both public and private shipyards over the next 6-8 weeks. Following this, the ministry will issue Request for Proposal (RFP) to specific port that will be identified on the basis of the study which will look into whether they have the capacity and manpower to build six submarines in the same port only besides other parametres.
The submarines will be Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) capable that will enable them to stay underwater for longer than a conventional submarine besides having enhanced stealth features. The Navy currently has 13 operational submarines and the target set in 1999 was to have 24 by 2030. The previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had gone in for six Scorpene submarines and the first is likely to be delivered only in 2016. The decision to manufacture the submarines in India is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” pitch.
At 12:45 hrs, Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company was locked at 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 43.05, up Rs 2.05 on the BSE. Bharat Electronics was quoting at Rs 2,141.20, up Rs 83.90, or 4.08 percent on the BSE. Walchandnagar Industries is also locked at 10 percent upper circuit at Rs 119.50.

Consistent govt policy needed for investor confidence: JSPL MDConsistent govt policy needed for investor confidence, says Jindal Steel MD Ravi Uppal

The Supreme Court had recently cancelled the permits of 214 coal blocks allocated between 1993 and 2010 by various Central governments. Miners have been given time till March 31, 2015, to wind up their operations. Jindal Steel and Power is among them and seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place. In the wake of these developments, Ravi Uppal, Managing Director and Group CEO of Jindal Steel and Power, spoke to Business Today on what needs to be done to make PM's 'Make in India' campaign a success.
Q. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT AWAY TO MAKE PM NARENDRA MODI'S 'MAKE IN INDIA' A SUCCESS?
A. First we have to get back buoyancy to the Indian manufacturing sector. The government must realise that that will happen when the private sector gets into it. Take the case of telecom and civil aviation. Any federal government must come to terms with it and accept it.
It's time we give up our infatuation with the public sector. The sector was important when the country became independent and resources were scarce. Then we were not focussed on productivity and technology. The government can rake in a lot of money by divestment.
Most public sector undertakings are living on oxygen provided by the government. We have the case of MTNL and BSNL - see how these superstructures have crashed. In manufacturing, petrochemical refineries can be divested. Even Steel Authority and BHEL can be. There is no need for the government to stay in these sectors. A lot of state undertakings are sick. Some of them require huge amount of technological inputs and are in a fierce competitive market. They will fall under their own weight. So let the private sector play a bigger role.
Second is gaining the trust of the private sector, which in India feels highly insecure. The governments has not been consistent; lot of reversals take place. Today people are even questioning the validity of any document or licence issued by the government.
The recent events such as the cancellation of the 2G licences and mining permits clearly erodes the private sector's confidence in any document given by the government. It comes to saying that the any such document must be endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Central Vigilance Commission, Central Bureau of Investigation and finally by the Supreme Court before it becomes a valid document.  
Q. DURING MODI'S VISIT TO THE US, MANY WALL STREET INVESTORS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE RECENT CANCELLATION OF COAL MINES. THE SC HAS INDICTED ONE AGENCY - THE GOVERNMENT. BUT THE PUNISHMENT IS BEING GIVEN TO INVESTORS. WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR YOUR COMPANY?
A. What is at stake is a total investment of Rs 36,000 crore that have been made in Chhattisgarh and Orissa.
Q. WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY LOST?
A. We employ 30,000 people in our mines, steel plants and power plants. They will be laid off. Opportunity lost will be in terms of future investment. As a company, the continuity of supply will be disrupted. Coal Indian does not have the wherewithal to supply the kind of coal we want and the regularity at which it has to be supplied.
Q. WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG WITH THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING THE MINES?
A. Some of these mines were operating for more than 10 years. These are captive mines. The plants were located there. In 1993, when the mining act was amended, the government was not able to generate enough power and steel because they are investment intensive sectors. To motivate the private sector and give them input material security, the government decided to give captive mines.
If you develop a three million tonne mine, the investment is Rs 800 crore. The kind of investment you make when you set up a 1,000 mW power project is about Rs 6,000 crore. So at that point of time, the government was not foolish. And they gave the worst of mines to the private sector.
The government asked Coal India to make a list of mines they were not interested in. Coal India was mining A,B and C grade coal. The private sector was given E, F and G grade where the ash content was anywhere between 45-55 per cent. These were discards as far as Coal India was concerned.
Now the private sector put in huge investment, put washeries to wash coal, remove soil and ash. So it suddenly started looking attractive. The government obviously did not remember the basis why these captive mines were given - it was to stimulate investment in core sectors.
Now, it is a serious setback to the investment process. There were 40 mines which were operative. They said you have six months to wind down operations. After six months, the mines will be auctioned or they will put them on auction again. It is like taking away your house and saying we will auction it.
There is a severe setback to private investment due to this.  It is a setback to investor confidence. So the government needs to win back investor confidence. There needs to be continuity and consistency in government policy. They should state that any decision made by the government is irrevocable. This is the kind of protection we need.
Q. AFTER THE RECENT SETBACKS, HOW EASY WILL IT BE TO FINANCE NEW PROJECTS?
A. Sectoral allocation by banks should also be more liberal, especially in the more investment centric industries. A steel plant of one million tonne costs $1 billion. If you ask a promoter to put in 25 per cent equity, he must have $250 million. Not many people have that kind of cash. The government should have a guideline that they can go up to 90 per cent lending. Lending norms have to be looked at. In the Middle East, the investment is very easy. We have set up $2 million tonne steel plant in Oman. The banks gave us money with a smile with favourable terms. The cost of loan is 6 per cent. In dollar terms, the rate is less than 5 per cent. India is at 12 per cent.

Modi s big bang reforms coming post DiwaliModi's big bang reforms coming post Diwali
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times   October 23, 2014

The Narendra Modi government’s economic reform measures leading into Diwali — labour, diesel and coal — have lifted Indian stock markets by 3% in the last week alone. Now expect the trading New Year that begins Thursday to usher in bigger initiatives aimed at boosting investment and creating jobs.
On the cards are fresh moves to ease land acquisition rules, raise foreign investment limits in insurance and pension sector, introduce a country-wide goods and services tax (GST) and a separate labour law for small factories. The measures will likely be implemented in the Parliament’s month-long winter session to be held from the last week of November.
“We believe that policy reforms are much needed to ensure that India transitions out from stagflation to an environment of higher growth and lower inflation. Indeed, the decisive (Lok Sabha) election outcome suggests that the new government will be able to implement reforms at a faster than previously expected pace,” global investment bank Morgan Stanley said in a recent research report.
The recent wins in Maharashtra and Haryana elections will only add more political power to the ruling BJP and enable it to push through reform that stock markets are likely to cheer.
“A bulging young lower-middle income group in large and small cities, with strong aspirations for upward mobility, has swelled the middle class in India. Poor GDP growth of recent years has made the middle class more favourable toward reforms, which they increasingly see as necessary for rapid economic expansion and their own continued prosperity,” said credit rating firm Standard and Poor’s.
Easing land acquisition rules is likely to be among the first of the next round of reforms.  Government sources told HT that the Centre is trying to do this without hurting farmers’ interests. The highly restrictive consent clauses are proving to be a major barrier for industry to buy land as costs have jumped more than three times according to the formula stipulated in the new law enacted by the former UPA regime.
A bill to amend the insurance laws to ease FDI limit in the sector to 49% from 26% will be introduced in the winter session, the sources said.
The move, however, comes with a rider that management control of these companies will remain with Indian promoters. The higher FDI ceiling will come into force after Parliament passes the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill that has been pending since 2008 for lack of political consensus.
Insurers need funds to maintain a healthy capital base, offer a wider bouquet of products, protect consumer interests against insolvency and deepen insurance penetration in India.
In another major move, the government will introduce a constitution amendment bill to initiate India’s biggest tax reform initiative—Goods and Services Tax (GST) — in the winter session.
If adopted, GST can dramatically alter tax administration by giving a one-shot solution by subsuming a string of central and local levies such as excise, value-added tax and octroi into a single unified tax and stitching together a common national market.
GST’s implementation has faced political hurdles as state governments fear it could rob them of fiscal powers.
The government is also planning a separate labour law for small factories, sources said.
This will be in addition to the string of labour reforms aimed at making rules simpler and employee-friendly, remove arbitrary inspections at factories, reduce cumbersome paperwork and turn India more investor friendly.

U.S. general: North Korea likely can build a miniaturized nuclear weaponsBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe

North Korea likely can develop a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can be launched from a mobile launcher, the top U.S. general in South Korea said — a capability that weapons experts have previously said they doubt is within the reach of the government of Kim Jong-un.
Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that North Korea has claimed to have already done so, and has had the right connections and technology to make it happen.
“I think given their technological capabilities, the time that they been working on this, that they probably have the capabilities to put this together,” he said. “I don’t believe that they have. I don’t know that they have at this point.”
Any “mini-nuke” would likely be launched from a system mounted on a truck, and carried by an intermediate or long-range missile. U.S. officials have mixed opinions on how far North Korea has come in developing one, but most believe that any missile launched will have very low reliability.
Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday afternoon that Scaparrotti speaks with Defense Secretary Hagel about the issue, and the Defense Department is monitoring the situation.”
But they have not moved — we have not seen evidence that they’ve done it,” Kirby said. “And we’ve not seen certainly any evidence that they’re testing or in development of it.”
President Obama said in April that there is no “magic bullet” to influence officials in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. 
Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye signaled in April that they were considering delaying a plan to give Seoul control of its own troops during any future war on the Korean Peninsula, rather than placing them under U.S. command. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and South Korean Defense Minister Han Min Koo formalized that Thursday . Instead of turning operational control of troops over to South Korea as planned in December 2005, they signed a memorandum of understanding that effectively postpones it indefinitely.

Fireworks back for FMCG companies this DiwaliFireworks back for FMCG companies this Diwali
None   October 24, 2014
Comments
After hitting a rough patch in recent years, the fireworks seem to be back for the consumer durables industry.
With the overall consumer sentiment improving, companies are launching new products, and are finding buyers too. Premium products are selling particularly well, according to executives at several large consumer goods firms.
“The past three years were not very good. But this year, sales are much better,” said Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice-president, Godrej Appliances. “We are seeing growth in excess of 40%. The overall industry, too, is growing more than 20%.”
Both modern trade (retail chain stores) as well as traditional channels are seeing growth, he said.
According to a report by ZyFin Research, the consumer outlook index, which measures consumer sentiment on spending, employment and inflation, recovered to 45.2 in September, a 1.6-point increase over August. Since April, the average index level has been at 43.9, compared to 40.9 in the year-ago period.
There has been a slew of launches this festive season. For instance, Videocon, LG, Samsung and Sony launched a range of high-end ultra-high definition (UHD) TVs.
Godrej launched a new washing machine platform and a hybrid refrigerator. Several smartphones were launched as well.
“With a stable government at the Centre, and the stock markets doing well, the consumer sentiment during the festive season is looking positive,” said Anirudh Dhoot, director, Videocon. “There has been a steep rise in the demand for premium products, especially high-end TVs.”
“We had targeted a 35% growth in sales during this festive season and have exceeded that by a large margin, thanks to contribution from premium products,” an LG spokesperson told HT.  A UHD TV range and the flagship smartphone, G3 have been sold out, he said.
Apple’s latest flagship devices, iPhone 6 and 6Plus, launched in India last week, also attracted huge consumer interest.
Companies are going the extra mile to woo buyers with a host of promotions.
Godrej, for example, had offered assured gifts such as dinner sets and rice cookers, among other things, on purchase of all its products. Videocon, which is aiming to top `2,000 crore sales this festive season, also launched a mega Diwali campaign.

FM Arun Jaitley favours interest rate cutRatnajyoti Dutta and Manoj Kumar        Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 12:55 IST
Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley favours a cut in interest rates to trigger demand in the construction sector, a newspaper report said on Saturday, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has signalled it will not ease policy until it is confident of lower inflation .
In May, Prime Minister Modi was elected on promises that his government would create jobs and rejuvenate the economy, but experts were disappointed by Jaitley's first Budget and a lack of early progress on fixing structural economic problems.
"Currently, interest rates are a disincentive. Now that inflation seems to be stabilising somewhat, the time seems to have come to moderate the interest rates," Jaitley said in an interview to The Times of India.
Last month, the RBI sent a strong signal that it would refrain from cutting interest rates until the central bank was confident that consumer inflation can be cut to a target of 6 percent by January 2016.
India's retail inflation eased for a second straight month in September, but the risks of price shocks from weak monsoon rains and oil are expected to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon.
Consumer prices rose a slower-than-expected 6.46 percent from a year earlier, the lowest since figures were first published in January 2012.

China to Shut Factories During APEC to Curb Beijing Pollution
Reuters | Updated On: October 25, 2014 13:26 (IST)
Iron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
Shanghai: Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli ordered a temporary shutdown of factories to ensure air quality during a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Beijing next month, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Friday.
It is the strongest measure yet to curb pollution for the November 7-11 meeting in the capital, which has been enveloped by heavy smog over the past few days.
Mr Zhang told officials that ensuring air quality during APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) is the "priority of priorities", although the task will be a "tremendous pressure and challenge" given dropping temperatures and the start of the coal burning season in northern China, Xinhua said.
He also said vehicle controls must be strictly enforced and residents should be encouraged to take public transportation during the meeting, the report said.
In an effort to ease traffic congestion and curb pollution, Beijing has already announced that public workers in the capital will be given six days off during the meeting.

Clocking the slowest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.9 per cent in terms of gross state domestic product, Uttar Pradesh is the lowest among the traditional BIMARU states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP) in this regard during the past nine years i.e. during 2004-05 and 2012-13, according to an ASSOCHAM study.
"Bihar has ranked on top among the BIMARU states registering highest growth rate of 9.3 per cent in GSDP during the aforesaid nine year period followed by Madhya Pradesh (8.8 per cent) and Rajasthan (8.2 per cent) even as India's overall gross domestic product (GDP) grew at eight per cent during 2004-05 and 2012-13," said a study titled 'Analysis of BIMARU states' conducted by ASSOCHAM.
"Though UP's share in terms of contribution to Indian economy has remained highest during the aforesaid period,its share has dipped from 8.8 per cent as of 2004-05 to 8.1 per cent as of 2012-13/. The share of other states in BIMARU category though has remained stagnant over these years but has slightly improved-Bihar (from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent), MP (3.8 per cent to 4 per cent) and Rajasthan (4.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent)," the study prepared by ASSOCHAM Economic Research Bureau (AERB) said.
"Total share of BIMARU states to India's economy has also slightly dipped from 19.5 per cent as of 2004-05 to 19.4 per cent as of 2012-13," D.S. Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM said while releasing the chamber's study.
Even on the agriculture and allied sector front, UP has proved to be the slowest in CAGR at 2.9 per cent ,well below the national growth rate of 3.7 per cent, it said.
Madhya Pradesh clocked highest growth rate of seven per cent in terms of agriculture and allied sector performance amid BIMARU states followed by Rajasthan (4.8 per cent) and Bihar (4.7 per cent).
he share of agriculture and allied sector in UP's GSDP has dipped from 29.7 per cent as of 2004-05 to 21.9 per cent as of 2012-13, the Assocham study said.
In Bihar, it has come down from 31.5 per cent to 22.5 per cent, while in Rajasthan it has slowed from 25.6 per cent to 19.9 per cent. MP registered just about three per cent decline i.e. from 27.7 per cent to 24.2 per cent during the period under review.
The contribution of agriculture and allied sector in Indian economy too dipped sharply from 19 per cent to 13.7 per cent during this period.
"On the industrial sector front, UP has registered 6.9 per cent growth rate during the said period while India clocked 7.4 per cent CAGR in the industrial sector," it said.
While amid BIMARU states, Bihar clocked highest growth rate of 13.9 per cent in the industry sector followed by MP (9.2 per cent) and Rajasthan (8.5 per cent).
The share of industry sector in UP's economy has marginally declined from 23.3 per cent as of 2004-05 to 23.2 as of 2012-13, while it has increased considerably in other BIMARU states - Bihar (from 13.8 per cent to 19.2 per cent), MP (27.1 per cent to 27.9 per cent) and Rajasthan (30.6 per cent to 31.3 per cent).
In the services sector too, UP has clocked slowest growth rate of nine per cent during 2004-05 and 2012-13 which is not only below other BIMARU states but also the national average of 9.6 per cent. Bihar registered highest growth rate of over 10 per cent followed by Rajasthan (9.7 per cent) and MP (9.6 per cent) during the period under review.
UP, however, has recorded highest growth in terms of services sector's contribution to the state economy as it rose from 47 per cent in 2004-05 to about 55 per cent as of 2012-13 followed by Rajasthan (from 43.8 per cent to 48.8 per cent), Bihar (from 54.7 per cent to 58.3 per cent) and MP (from 45.2 per cent to 47.9 per cent). Though, nationally the services sector share in the GDP increased from 53 per cent to 59.6 per cent.
At 4.8 per cent, UP has also registered slowest per- capita income growth rate between 2004-05 and 2012-13, while Bihar topped with 7.6 per cent CAGR amid other BIMARU states followed by MP (7 per cent) and Rajasthan (6.1 per cent).
Nationally the per-capita income grew by 6.2 per cent during this period.

Microsoft to Drop Nokia Name From Lumia Smartphones
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 24, 2014 23:03 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Washington: US software giant Microsoft on Friday said it will now start selling Lumia smartphones as 'Microsoft Lumia' devices, instead of calling them Nokia Lumia.
"Our global and local websites are going through a transition as we speak and in the coming days our social channels will get a new name too they will be called Microsoft Lumia," Microsoft's senior vice president of marketing for phones, Tuula Rytila, said on a blog.
"We have now started the transition from Nokia Lumia to Microsoft Lumia," the company said.
The move comes within 6 month of Microsoft acquiring Finnish telecom company Nokia's mobile device business for about $7.5 billion. The deal was completed on April 25, 2014.
Ms Rytila did not share timeline for launching Lumia device without Nokia brand name, but said, "We are looking forward to unveiling a Microsoft Lumia device soon. This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft."
Microsoft, however, will retain Nokia brand name for entry level phones.
"Microsoft will continue to sell Nokia-branded, entry-level category of phones, such as the Nokia 130. We have licensed the Nokia brand for such devices," she said.
Microsoft has a 10-year licence to use the Nokia brand on the current and subsequently developed mobile phones from the date it acquired the Finnish mobile devices company.

Govt allows field trials for GM mustard  brinjalGovt allows field trials for GM mustard, brinjal
Chetan Chauhan , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:55 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 08:51 IST(27/10/2014)
Comments
The environment ministry has allowed field trials of two varieties of genetically modified (GM) brinjal and mustard, almost 18 months after the previous government ordered a freeze on such tests.
In a reply to an RTI query early October, the ministry said on August 21, it permitted the Delhi University to hold trials for a mustard variety and Maharashtra-based Bejo Seeds Pvt Ltd to test Bt brinjal.
The decision does away with the uncertainty surrounding the biotech sector. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar had been saying the government had not taken a decision on field trials while maintaining “science cannot be stopped”.
There is a huge debate surrounding GM crops that are strongly resisted by organisations that question their safety and cite concerns that the country’s food security could be compromised due to monopolising farm biotech MNCs. The Supreme Court is hearing a public interest litigation that has sought a ban on open field trials.
The ministry’s nod came after the country’s biotech regulator, the genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC), approved trials of more than 30 varieties in two batches this year.
The go-ahead, a ministry official said, was an indication of the positive outlook of the Modi government towards the use of “science” to boost agriculture production.
The process of field trials, a necessary step to evaluate a GM technology’s efficacy and safety before commercial approval, had nearly come to a halt during the previous UPA regime.
The DU’s Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, headed by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, got the permission to conduct trials for a new variety of GM mustard two years after filing an application with GEAC, the ministry said.
Nod for Bejo Seeds came after a year. Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh had imposed a moratorium on commercial release of Bt brinjal in 2010.
“Either the minister is being misled by the bureaucrats, or the public is being misled by the minister. For gains of few companies, people and farmers are being blindfolded. Mr Javadekar should come out in public and end this double-talk,” said Manvendra Singh, a Greenpeace campaigner who filed the RTI plea.
The UPA government’s decision to freeze trials was wrong as these were conducted in labs and that, too, after state governments’ permission, the official said. “The Supreme Court had never asked the government to impose the moratorium,” the official said.
Several states such as Haryana, Maharashtra and Punjab have asked agriculture universities to ensure that the GEAC safety conditions for field trials were complied with, the reply said.
GM crops are those in which genetic material is altered to provide some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer, such as pest resistance or better nutrition.

What s in a name: From Vijay to Ganeshan  south bug bites Delhi zooComments
Eight-month-old Saravanan leaps, plays and runs around his new home at the Delhi zoo, displaying agility and enthusiasm similar to the popular Tamil actor the white tiger cub is named after.
His father and the zoo’s most famous resident Vijay, who made headlines last month after killing a man who jumped into his enclosure, also shares his name with a Tamil superstar.
This new trend of giving animals south Indian names at the Capital’s National Zoological Park – usually a north Indian hub – is because of the zoo’s veterinary head Dr Panneer Selvam, who hails from Tamil Nadu.
Dr Selvam takes care of animals born in the zoo or brought to the institution before releasing them to their respective enclosures and is responsible for naming them.
At present, more than 10 zoo animals have names with south Indian meanings. Some of them include Rajalakshmi (Indian elephant), Ganeshan (African elephant), Maheshwari and Anjuha (rhinos) and Sendil (wild bear).
Uma, a rhino he had named after goddess Parvati, is Selvam’s favourite.
“I treat these animals as my own children and therefore the names I give them are derived from the social background that I have. There is a story and a meaning behind every name given,” added Selvam.
Though naming animals in any zoological park in the world is a practice necessary for identifying the animal and keeping a record of its ancestry, it generally becomes a ritual that officials undertake with a lot of love and care.
“When a new animal comes into the zoo from outside we generally keep it at the hospital for 10 to 45 days depending on the need. If the offspring is born here, we keep them in for at least six months. It is natural to develop a certain bond with the animal in this period,” said Selvam.

Burdwan blast: NSA Doval in Bengal  spotlight on MamataNSA Doval visits Burdwan, pressure on Mamata
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:58 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 15:26 IST(27/10/2014)
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and top intelligence chiefs of the country on Monday visited the blast site in West Bengal's Burdwan and assessed the progress of investigations.
 
NIA director general Sharad Kumar, NSG director general Jayanta Narayan Chowdhury and Intelligence Bureau director Syed Asif Ibrahim accompanied him during the over 30 minute visit to the house at Khagragarh where the blast took place on October 2, police said.
 
Doval and the three top officials visited the room where the blast occurred, during which two suspected terrorists were also killed.
 
They also went to the room which had served as the laboratory of the suspected terrorists and climbed the roof top of the house to check the visibility of surrounding areas.
 
Doval also inquired where the two children of the suspected terrorists stayed in the house.
 
The children, who are toddlers have since been taken into custody along with their mothers, one of whom is the widow of one of the suspected terrorists who died in the explosion.
 
Later, Doval met the district officials and asked about the progress of inquiry into the blast, the police added.
 
The four top officials then left for Kolkata to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat 'Nabanna'.
 
Earlier, the security and intelligence chiefs flew in to Burdwan by a chopper from NSC Bose International Airport. They had reached Kolkata in a IAF special aircraft this morning.
 
The present visit was the second in four days by the NIA director. Kumar after his first visit to Burdwan and Murshidabad on
Friday had said that the arrested persons in connection with the blast and their associates were members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and were making IEDs to be transported to the neighbouring country for possible terror attacks.
 
The visits by top security and intelligence chiefs come ahead of the union government's move to send a report to Bangladesh following a request from that country.
 
Three persons, including the two women were arrested in connection with the blast and were interrogated by the NIA.
The PMO is giving utmost importance to the terror issue in Bengal after the Burdwan blast and subsequent revelations of a well-oiled terror network using madrasas.
On the other hand, the Trinamool-led government came under heavy fire from the opposition for trying to keep the NIA at bay after the Burdwan blasts. It was CID, which was entrusted with the investigation, until NIA suo moto took up the case.

Euro comes safely through ECB stress test  Aussie upDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.
8
Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.
0
Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

Nilofar is now a severe cyclone  to cross Naliya on FridayVery severe cyclone Nilofar may weaken ahead of landfall
Vinson Kurian
Source: IMD Satellite image taken on October 27, 2014.
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 27:  
Arabian Sea Cyclone Nilofar is now a very severe cyclone, only one step away from class-topping super cyclone status, an India Met update said this afternoon.
But all available indications suggest that Nilofar will wind down to severe cyclone status due to a combination of adverse factors.
PEAK WINDS
Westerly winds associated with the western disturbance that steers Nilofar towards Naliya in Gujarat would be the primary culprit for the weakening.
Since Nilofar will hitch a ride on the westerly system, it would get directly impacted from the top as opposing winds tear into it.
A second reason is dry air intrusion from around the land – the cyclone would be in close proximity to mainland Pakistan and western India as it runs in.
Third are the cooler waters towards the north Gujarat coast, which caps evaporation and moisture build that is needed to fuel the cyclone system.
YELLOW MESSAGE
The Met located Nilofar to 1,170 km southwest of Naliya (Gujarat) and 1,230 km south-southwest of Karachi (Pakistan) at 1.30 pm.
In a ‘yellow message’ (warning), the Met said that the coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch would receive rainfall at most places from Thursday morning.
Isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also commence along these areas around the same time.
The rainfall intensity would increase gradually with heavy to very heavy fall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls from later in the night.
Squally winds speed reaching 45-to 55 km/hr and gusting to 65 km/hr would commence along and off Gujarat coast from Thursday morning.
SEA CONDITION
They would ramp up to between 100- and 110 km/hr with gusts of 125 km/hr at the time of landfall.
Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be ‘rough’ (13 ft in height) to ‘very rough’ (13- to 20 ft) from Thursday.

Satyam case: Court may set judgement date on...Andhra Pradesh
(Raju and others were charged…)
HYDERABAD: A local court trying the case of multi-crore accounting fraud in erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) may announce a date for verdict on October 30.
CBI special public prosecutor K Surender said the court has ordered all the accused to appear before it on that date.
The ten accused in the case include prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju , his brother and Satyam's former MD B Rama Raju, ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, Raju's another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch Srisailam, and Satyam's former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The trial in Satyam fraud case had concluded in June before the special court, which examined 216 witnesses and marked 3,038 documents during the course of the hearing.
Touted as the country's biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009 after Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company's account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees.
Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother.
In February that year, CBI took over the investigation and filed three charge sheets (on April 7, 2009, November 24, 2009 and January 7, 2010), which were later clubbed into one.
Raju and others were charged with offences like cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust, under relevant sections of IPC, for inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of various I-T laws.
During the trial, the CBI alleged that the scam caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to Satyam shareholders, while the defence countered the charges, saying the accused were not responsible for the fraud and all the documents filed by the central agency relating to the case were fabricated and not according to law.

Sena softens stand  says willing to accept any BJP CMShiv Sena climbs down, says will back BJP

A cornered Shiv Sena made a last-ditch effort to patch up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be part of the new Maharashtra government as its former ally prepared to elect its chief ministerial candidate on Tuesday.

Devendra Fadnavis looks like a clear favourite for the chief minister’s job in the western state which has been gripped by political uncertainty since the BJP emerged as the single largest party but failed to get a clear majority in the assembly election.
The BJP is finalising its team of ministers ahead of the oath-taking ceremony on October 31, but it isn’t clear if the Shiv Sena will join the ministry as the BJP is not willing to accept its demands for key portfolios and an assurance to not carve out a separate state of Vidarbha.
Despite the talks with the Shiv Sena, the BJP has also prepared a plan to run a minority government instead of giving the Sena a considerable share of ministerial berths and important departments.
The first indication of the Shiv Sena softening its stand was an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana saying the party would support the BJP-led government as it has got a mandate.
“We will have to keep our political differences aside and work with the BJP chief minister for the unity of Maharashtra. We have kept ourselves together even in difficult circumstances and it will be better if it remains so,” said the editorial in Saamana, which is regarded as the opinion of Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray.
The BJP has an upper hand in negotiations with future allies because it emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly compared with the Shiv Sena’s 63 seats. The BJP’s strength reduced by one as one its MLAs, Govind Rathod elected from Nanded district, died of heart attack on Sunday.
 It has also been in talks with smaller parties and independents, which could take its tally to around 135.
Wankhede Stadium is being decked up for the oath-taking function, expected to be attended by 30,000-40,000 BJP workers from all corners of the state.

In what would be only the second instance since the Satyam Computers scam broke out in 2009, the government is considering superseding the board of Financial Technologies India Limited (FTIL) , the listed parent firm of scandal-tainted National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL), according to a report in the Indian Express this morning which quoted sources.
FTIL is promoted by Jignesh Shah, who was arrested and later granted bail in the Rs 5,600 crore NSEL case, in which the spot exchange was, in August 2013, discovered to have violated regulations by facilitating forward trades without ensuring adequate underlying collateral. The trades initially fetched solid returns for investors but later turned out be a Ponzi scheme, according to the Mumbai police .
Shah owns 45.63 percent in FTIL, which in turn owns almost 100 percent stake in NSEL. However, Shah has denied wrongdoing, saying he was unaware of goings-on at the spot exchange and put the blame on its erstwhile management.
The regulator, Forward Markets Commission, has appointed its own nominees on the NSEL board and ordered FTIL to shed its stakes in any exchange it promoted: three major exchanges it anchored were commodity futures exchange MCX , stock exchange MCX-SX and the NSEL spot exchange. Before that, the Arvind Mayaram committee had recommended a management takeover of all three exchanges.
However, both the merger as well as supersession of the board could run into legal issues, considering FTIL is a listed entity and forcing it to essentially assume all of NSEL’s liabilities could be considered detrimental to their interests.
In a discussion with the CNBC-TV18’s Menaka Doshi in May this year , Shuva Mundal of AZB, laywer for the NSEL Investor Forum, said that the legal basis for supersession of FTIL’s board would depend on whether it is proved if FTIL was actively involved in perpetrating the fraud. “If you ask me at this stage there are not enough facts out there to demonstrate that,” he conceded.
While the above discussion took place several months ago, not much has moved in the case and while a criminal investigation is on by the CBI and Mumbai police as well as a court case is being heard, wrongdoing on Shah’s or FTIL’s part has not been proved.
A similar point was raised H Jayesh, another lawyer, who said such a takeover would hinge on proving the fact that FTIL set up NSEL with the sole intention of perpetrating fraud.
“That is the major intent out there we are talking about. If not so then on what basis are we talking about going after the assets of FTIL,” he said, adding that even if a few directors of FTIL, Shah for instance, were proved to have the intent of committing fraud, “attributing the intent to a corporate entity as a whole was a different thing.”
Shah’s legal defence team has also rubbished parallels between Satyam and FTIL. In the former case, its founder Ramalinga Raju had confessed to inflating cash and profits at the firm for years, while in the case of FTIL, “there is the strongest possible denial of any wrongdoing,” the defence laywers said. “You cannot penalise the holding company’s shareholders for a mishap at one of its subsidiaries.”
Some lawyers also insisted that there was a bit more needed to “lift the corporate veil”, where key shareholders, who are normally not held liable for misgivings on the part of illegal activities company, can be prosecuted.
“If there are sufficient assets available [to recover money lost in the NSEL fraud] there is no question of lifting the veil and going after the assets of FTIL,” said lawyer Akila Agarwal of Amarchand, who advised the government during the Satyam scam, pointing to the fact that the government has already attached assets worth thousands of crores of key NSEL borrowers to try and recover money. “The question of lifting the veil arises only when there are insufficient assets on the primary people concerned in NSEL.”

ONGC on the hunt for overseas producing assets
Reuters
Business Line D.K. Sarraf
NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) wants to take advantage of falling oil prices to more than double its overseas output to the equivalent of 400,000 barrels per day of oil by 2018, Chairman D.K. Sarraf told Reuters.
Global oil prices sank to a four-year low at below $83 a barrel this month, hitting valuations of energy explorers.
The Indian government, which is preparing to float a $3 billion stake in ONGC, wants state firms to secure energy assets abroad to reduce the exposure of Asia's third-largest economy to supply risks.
India is the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, importing four-fifths of its needs as its own output shrinks.
"For meeting the short-term 2018 target we would like to aggressively go for producing assets, because you can't acquire an exploration block and then make it produce in such a short time," Sarraf said in a telephone interview on Monday.
ONGC, the country's biggest oil explorer, has often been criticised for stagnant output and the slow pace of exploration and development.
Sarraf reaffirmed ONGC's long-term plans to raise overseas output in two stages to 60 million tonnes of oil plus oil-equivalent gas by 2030 - or 1.2 million barrels per day.
The plan envisages investing around $180 billion between 2013 and 2030 on a gamut of projects including raising local and overseas oil and gas output, according to the company's website.
EXPLORATION ASSETS
Sarraf, however, added that ONGC was interested at the same time in acquiring overseas exploration assets, which would take longer to enter production, with a view to hitting its 2030 goal.
"More value is created through exploration assets," he said. "Even for the 2030 target we cannot get out of exploration (to production) if we don't start acting on exploration now."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has initiated a process to sell a 5 per cent stake in ONGC, which is 69 per cent state controlled.
ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, produced about 9 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (180,000 bpd) in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014, Sarraf said.
To achieve its pursuit of acquiring overseas assets ONGC has signed initial cooperation agreements with Mexico's national oil company Pemex, PetroVietnam, Ecuador and PdVSA of Venezuela.
In the last fiscal year ONGC Videsh bought a 20 per cent stake in a block in Mozambique, raised its stake in a deepwater block in Brazil and was awarded exploration blocks in Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Russia's Rosneft has also offered stakes in two Siberian oil fields to ONGC, which is already a partner in the Sakhalin 1 offshore project.
ONGC has 13 producing assets in eight countries. It had cash and cash equivalent of Rs 10,800 crore on March 31, 2014 and its profitability is set to rise after Modi's five-month-old government hiked gas prices and scrapped subsidies on diesel.
ONGC, along with other explorers, had been giving a discount on crude and products sales to state fuel retailers to partly compensate them for losses on retail sales at cheaper regulated rates for diesel, kerosene and cooking gas.
When asked where his firm was targeting oil and gas assets Sarraf said: "The globe. The target is so big we can't look for one geography and say no to another."
He listed Russia and the former Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the Middle East, adding, "We are not in the U.S. and Canada, we want to be there as well."

By: Associated Press | Washington | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:15 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 1:22 pm
One of the teenagers wounded in a Washington state high school shooting has died, raising the number of fatalities from when a student opened fire in a cafeteria to three. Officials at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett confirmed 14-year-old Gia Soriano died yesterday night.
Another girl was killed during the shooting Friday by a popular first-year student at Marysville-Pilchuck High School north of Seattle. The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, died of a self-inflicted wound. Three other students remain hospitalized, two in critical condition and one in serious condition.

At a news conference, Dr. Joanne Roberts read a statement from Soriano’s family. “We are devastated by this senseless tragedy. Gia is our beautiful daughter, and words cannot express how much we will miss her,” the statement said. Roberts said Soriano’s family was donating her organs for transplant. Earlier yesterday, parents and students gathered in a gymnasium at the school for a community meeting, with speakers urging support and prayers and tribal members playing drums and singing songs. Fryberg was from a prominent Tulalip Indian tribes family.
Young people hugged each other and cried and speakers urged people to come together during the gathering Sunday. “Our legs are still wobbly,” said Tony Hatch, a cousin of one of the injured students. “We’re really damaged right now.” Of the wounded students, only 14-year-old Nate Hatch showed improvement, though he remained in s erious condition in intensive. Fifteen-year-old Andrew Fryberg also remained in critical condition in intensive care. Both are cousins of Jaylen Fryberg.
Meanwhile, 14-year-old Shaylee Chuckulnaskit remained in critical condition in intensive care. Fryberg died in the attack after a first-year teacher intervened. It’s unclear if he intentionally killed himself or if the gun went off in a struggle with a teacher. The makeshift memorial on a chain link fence by the school, which will be closed this week, kept growing Sunday.
Balloons honoring the victims and the shooter adorn the fence along with flowers, stuffed toys and signs. The close-knit community, meanwhile, on continued…

Plastic bottles hurled at Bilawal Bhutto during Kashmir Million March inUKPrint
PPP's leader Bilawal Bhutto.
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:13 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 6:30 pm
A protest march by a UK-based pro-Pakistan group on the Kashmir issue in the heart of London today fizzled out as barely a few hundred protesters gathered to wave placards and flags.
The so-called ‘Million March’ from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street descended into chaos as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stepped on to the makeshift stage to speak.
The crowd began booing and throwing empty plastic bottles and refused to let him speak.
“This march was to be about Kashmir and for the welfare of Kashmiris. Bilawal has no business being here,” said a group of angry protesters who had travelled from Derby in the East Midlands region of England.
The march was led by Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, referred to as a former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was supported by Mirpuri-origin British parliamentarian Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham.
While the group had claimed overwhelming support from various communities for the march, others had dismissed it as against the “national interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
A counter-protest held by a rival group on Sunday ended with memorandums submitted for the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their high commissions here.
The memorandums urged both India and Pakistan to “respect the fundamental human rights of all citizens of Jammu and Kashmir”.

“We expect HCL Tech to post a USD and INR revenue CAGR of 13.7% and 12.3%, respectively, over FY2014–16E. We remain watchful of the company’s performance in the core software services segment. On the operating front, we remain skeptic on the company’s ability to sustain operating margins at current levels. This is on account of the ongoing hiring in the company to align staff strength to service the growing business and on account of the company estimated to hike wages going forward to restrain attrition. We recommend a Buy rating on the stock,” says Angel Broking research report.

Street Signs
Dipan Mehta, Member of BSE & NSE told CNBC-TV18, "We are clearly seeing a recovery across the board in auto sector and all the segments be it commercial vehicles, in passenger car on and off we do see lot of bright sparks over there and clearly two-wheelers also seem to have delivered in terms of monthly sales even in terms of performance. So investors are trying to play this entire India centric story through the automobile sector. Valuations still are quite reasonable; balance sheets of all auto companies are in great shape, they have lot of cash on their balance sheets.”
"At the same time a part form lot of these companies apart from benefiting from domestic trends are also heavily focusing on export markets to kind of build capacities. Although overall I am very positive on auto however the company to watch out for will be  Maruti Suzuki and in fact how the resolution for the Gujarat plant goes through out the minority shareholders vote over there will be very interesting. If that particular proposal does not go through then it would be extremely positive for minority shareholders of Maruti. So that’s the top picks within the entire sector from our perspective," he added.

Dipan Mehta positive on FMCG space
Dipan Mehta, Member of BSE & NSE is positive on FMCG space.
Post your opinion here
Street Signs
Dipan Mehta, Member of BSE & NSE told CNBC-TV18, "On the whole we have to get very positive on the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) stocks and the consumer oriented stocks and the reason is that with inflation coming off there is a lot more in the pockets of the consumers to spend. So typically FMCG consumer oriented companies will benefit from what is called up-trading which means more value added products get sold. At the same time they benefit from lower commodity prices, so in a way it is best of both worlds for FMCG and consumer oriented companies where the volumes look up and the costs are under control. So they get the benefits of lower cost and better operating leverages as well."
"Now I am not sure that this quarter or the next quarter you will see the benefits of this. However, over the next 12 to 18 months or so the numbers of the FMCG Company will be better than what street is expecting and what the analyst have been factoring in. So I would be looking at HUL results as well as the entire FMCG pack all their numbers with the great deal of thinness and then go stock by stock depending upon where they are getting growth in terms of new products or specific products segments or specific markets, exports and so on so forth," he added.
"So I would be quite positive on the entire sector. I mean  HUL no doubt it has been a great performer in the past but our focus is more on the Indian FMCG companies which are been continuously outperforming, the multi national companies (MNC) FMCG companies."

China s Xiaomi plans data centre in India to deflect privacy concernsChina's Xiaomi plans data centre in India to deflect privacy concerns
Reuters
Tweet
MUMBAI, Oct 27:  
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc said on Monday it plans to set up a data centre in India next year to store local user data, as the fast-growing company seeks to deflect concerns about privacy that could hamper its efforts to expand overseas.
The move by privately owned Xiaomi comes after it said last week it was migrating some data on non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing due to performance and privacy considerations.
Xiaomi, whose low-priced but feature-rich smartphones have made it the biggest smartphone vendor in China, entered India this year with plans to invest heavily to secure rapid growth in the world's third-largest smartphone market.
It sells its phones in India via Flipkart.com, the country's biggest online retailer, and said last month it planned to sell 100,000 phones a week in the country in October.
On Monday, Xiaomi said it had been moving Indian users' data from its Beijing data centre to data centres of Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing platform of the online retailer Amazon.com Inc, in Singapore and the US since early 2014. It said that process would be completed by the end of the year.
Xiaomi has faced several privacy controversies, including accusations from international security researchers and a government agency in Taiwan that it funnels unauthorized user data back to its servers in Beijing. Indian media reported last week that the country's air force had issued alerts to its personnel and their families against using Xiaomi phones on security concerns.
The Chinese company said on Monday it was attempting to contact Indian authorities for more details on local media reports, adding that it did not collect user data without permission.

Prayaas Day: IIM-B students hold Jaipur foot  eye screening campPrayaas Day: IIM-B students hold Jaipur foot, eye screening camp
Our Bureau
Tweet
Bangalore, Oct 27:  
Students of IIM Bangalore's Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) organised a 'Prayaas Day' in the college campus. Prayaas is a social responsibility initiative run by the EPGP students where the students try to do their bit towards improving the lives of the underprivileged.
Prayaas Day is an annual event where free Jaipur foot camps and eye screening camps are organised.
The programme was inaugurated by Dr L Prasad, a professor of organisational behaviour at IIM Bangalore and Dr Hanumappa Sudarshan, a renowned tribal rights activist and Padmashree award winner.
Dr H Sudarshan inspired the students with some anecdotes from his life and motivated the students to continue giving back to society.
The Jaipur foot camp, which was conducted along with Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, provided free calipers to those affected by polio and free artificial lower limbs to the needy.
The eye screening camp, conducted in association with Akshara Eye Hospital, provided a free eye checkup and helped in diagnosing various conditions such as glaucoma, poor vision, and cataract.
The event saw the active participation of students from across different programmes of IIM Bangalore, with many volunteering their time and money to conduct the event.
Lakshmi, an EPGP student and Prayaas volunteer, said "I saw a small girl who was provided calipers and when I saw the smile on her face after she was fitted with the calipers, I felt that all of us have an opportunity to bring a smile on the faces of people around us and we should make use of these opportunities."

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Shares of HMT surged nearly 20 per cent to touch its highest trading permissible limit for the day amid reports that the company may get another lease of life.
HMT’s stock soared 19.9 per cent to touch its upper circuit limit of Rs 36.75 on the BSE. On the NSE, the scrip zoomed 19.90 per cent to Rs 36.75.
Following the surge in the stock, the company’s market value rose Rs 455.1 crore to Rs 2,785.10 crore.
On the volume front, 5.88 lakh shares of the company changed hands on the BSE, while over 14 lakh shares were traded on the NSE.
As per media reports, the unprecedented demand for timepieces manufactured by the country’s first watch-maker has led the government to rethink its decision to close the loss-making public sector company.
According to reports, after the government announced the closure of the sick state-run company, demand for HMT watches has shot up sharply.
“The company has been incurring cash losses since last 15 years as can be seen in our annual reports submitted to you and other stakeholders from time to time. The company is on budgetary support for payment of salaries and statutory dues since over past 10 years,” the company had said last month in a filing to the BSE.
The present manpower of the company is 1,045 with an annual wage bill of around Rs 45 crore, it had said.

Islamic State threatens to kill British jihadis wanting to return homePrint
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 26, 2014 3:33 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 3:45 pm
Muslim extremists from Britain, who went to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside the Islamic State, are now desperate to return home but are facing death threats from the militant group’s top leaders, a media report said.
“There are Britons who upon wanting to leave have been threatened with death, either directly or indirectly,” the Guardian reported, citing a source with extensive contacts among Syrian militant groups.
The report comes after the killing of another young Muslim from Portsmouth on the frontline in Syria, the fourth to die from a group of six men known as the “Pompey lads’ who travelled together to fight for ISIS.
19-year-old Muhammad Mehdi Hassan is understood to have died on Friday during the ISIS offensive to capture the Syrian border city of Kobani.
Hassan was part of a group of five calling themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys.
ISIS is an Al-Qaeda splinter group and it has seized hundreds of square miles in Iraq and Syria.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group, declared himself as Caliph renamed the ISIS as Islamic State.
Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from the group, chiding it for its lack of teamwork in its aggressive, brutal expansion.
The former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg confirmed that he was also aware of dozens of British men keen to return to the UK but they were trapped in Syria and Iraq, in effect held by a group they wanted to leave, the paper said.
Begg said he knew of more than 30 who wanted to come back. They had travelled to join rebels fighting the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad but had subsequently become embroiled with ISIS, some for language reasons – ISIS had more English-speaking members.
“When it becomes solidified as an Islamic State, a caliph and you swear allegiance, thereafter if you do something disobedient you are now disobeying the caliph and could be subject to disciplinary measures which could include threats of death or death,” said Begg.
There are an estimated 500 Britons who have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria. Overall, 24 Britons are believed to have died after travelling to fight in the bloody civil war.

How to ask for a salary raise  and get it too | 5 ways you can lose money | ET WealthHow to ask for a salary raise, and get it too
27 Oct, 2014, 10.24AM IST
Follow these steps and strategies to ensure that you get the hike you deserve.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Devashish Chakravarty
Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested that women should have faith in good karma to get a salary hike instead of asking for one. Most people rightly disagreed. So, how does one ask for a raise that is justly deserved? Here's how to give your 'karma' a hard nudge and ensure a salary hike.
1. Learn the rules
You cannot negotiate your salary without knowing the rules of the game. So, find out about your company's compensation structure, pay comparisons across levels and the responsibilities that go with them. Know your key result areas (KRAs) and the reward policy for achieving and exceeding them.
2. Play the game
The key component to ensure you get a salary hike is documented performance. Keep an eye on your key result areas and work on them. Pull your weight to make sure that the goals of your team and boss are met because the quantum of pay hike will depend on how well you, your team and company perform.
3. Mind the score
A game can't have an outcome if you don't keep score. Hence, define performance indicators for all work and know how you are doing it vis-a-vis others, and the relative performance of your team and company, to build a case for an increase in salary.
4. Get current data
Find out about the trend for pay hikes in your company in the past three years to figure out how much raise you can ask for. Next, figure out the percentage of salary hikes across the industry for a person with your skill set and level. This will help you craft a realistic request for your raise.
5. Know your boss
Next, find out what works best with your boss when it comes to negotiating a salary hike. Does he prefer to have a direct meeting or a detailed e-mail before having a one-on-one discussion; a data-driven argument or an emotive one; an assertive approach or a gentle and polite request? It's also important to identify the right time of day or work cycle to talk to him.
6. Know your professional self
Identify your shortcomings. Do you hesitate to speak to authority, see it as an unnecessary confrontation and tend to take refusal personally? Work on an approach that will help you avoid these pitfalls and have a fruitful discussion with your boss.
7. Schedule the right time
If your firm has a fixed performance review cycle, schedule a meeting three months before it, preferably immediately after you have achieved a major target or milestone, and not after a big failure. Avoid discussions if your company is going through cost-cutting measures or layoffs.
8. Write the script
Prepare as if it is a business meeting. Make a case for the reason you and the product should be priced more. This approach forces you to think logically and build a compelling argument, instead of shooting for sympathy or personal requirements.
9. Act it out
Get mentored before you take the plunge. Rehearse with a friend on how you to deal with tough negotiations and emotional spaces. Prepare for your boss's logical answers, questions and emotions, and your responses to them. Showcase your achievements in reverse chronological order and include the additional skills you have picked on the way. Make it a meeting on salary correction rather than a salary raise .
10. Just do it
Think about it as just another meeting. Take the first step and schedule an appointment with your boss through e-mail. This will help you overcome resistance.
11. Plan for the next meeting
Treat this as an ongoing series of salary meetings. You can continue the discussion beyond the immediate raise and discuss the path ahead for your next raise or promotion. If you give an ultimatum, you are telling your employer that you are not going to be around for long and they are welcome to cut you out.

Dabur falls as reports name ex-Director in black money list
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 03.38PM IST
(It plunged 9 per cent intraday…)
MUMBAI: Shares of FMCG major Dabur plunged 9 per cent in intraday trade after the government revealed name of Pradip Burman, former Director, Dabur as one of people with illegal foreign bank accounts.
The stock ended the day on the BSE at Rs 208.00; down 3.61 per cent.
However, Dabur India has defended Burman by issuing a statement the Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels.
"We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," a Dabur spokesperson said.
The government, in an affidavit to Supreme Court, also named Pankaj Chalamanlal Lodhia, a Rajkot-based bullion trader and Radha Timloo, Director, Timblo Pvt Ltd as individuals who hold secret accounts in Switzerland.
At 01:05 p.m.; the stock was at Rs 209.65, down 2.85 per cent, on the BSE. It plunged 9 per cent intraday to touch a 196.40. Over 14.34 lakh shares were traded in the counter against two-week average of 59,000 shares.

Markets Remain in Narrow Range  Banks GainYou are here: Home Market
Sensex, Nifty Rangebound, Banking Stocks Gain
NDTV | Updated On: October 27, 2014 15:16 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
BSE Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range today after giving up most of their early gains. Sensex rose over 100 points to edge closer to 27,000 mark in early trade while Nifty jumped above 8050, driven by higher Asian markets and positive momentum from energy reforms announced by the government earlier. However, markets faced resistance at higher levels. At 3:15 p.m., the Sensex was down 104 points at 26,746 while Nifty fell to 7,990.
Top 10 Things to Know
Market experts see some consolidation in Indian markets after a five-day rally. Market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin expects Nifty to undergo consolidation after the rally, with foreign inflows to be the key driver. Technical analyst Sarvendra Srivastava sees Nifty pullback from 7,750 levels more or less complete. Nifty faces a resistance at 8030-8050 levels and has support at 7900-7950, he added.
Banking stocks were in limelight today after Finance Minister in a newspaper interview favoured a cut in interest rates to trigger demand in the construction sector. The Bank Nifty rose 0.8 per cent today, also driven by a fall in bond yields which hovered at over-a-year low levels.
Goldman Sachs had earlier slashed its 2015 oil price forecasts, making it the most bearish among major financial institutions, following a near 25 per cent fall in crude prices over the past five months. Lower oil prices will help Reserve Bank of India's efforts to curb inflation.
Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank were up over 2 per cent while Bank of Baroda gained 1.6 per cent. Shares in IndusInd Bank also got a boost after the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved the bank's proposal seeking an increase in foreign investment limit in the bank to 74 per cent.
Defence equipment makers were in focus today with Bharat Electronics and Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering rising nearly 5 per cent. The government has cleared defence projects of nearly Rs 80,000 crore, most of which would be sourced domestically. Capital goods stocks BHEL and L&T also advanced.
HUL shares fell over 2.5 per cent after the FMCG major reported a net profit of Rs 988 crore in the second quarter. It saw an exceptional gain at Rs 48.7 crore during the quarter. Analysts expected HUL to post a profit of Rs 1,000 crore in net profit. However, HUL's volume growth of 5 per cent was in line with expectations.
Wipro extended its decline after falling nearly 1 per cent today. The IT major fell over 3.5 per cent in the previous session after its Q2 earnings missed estimates.
Jindal Steel & Power Ltd fell over 7 per cent on reports of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registering a preliminary enquiry against the company in connection with diversion of forest land for mining between 2007 and 2013.
DLF shares were down more than 9 per cent on Monday after a newly inducted Haryana minister said the BJP government will investigate land deals of the previous Congress government.
Shares in Dabur India fell as much as 9 per cent on Monday after the central government revealed Pradip Burman has allegedly parked untaxed or black money in illicit foreign accounts. Mr Burman is a promoter in Dabur India. Dabur shares made a strong comeback after hitting day's low at Rs. 196.40. Dabur shares were down over 3 per cent in recent trade. A Dabur spokesperson said, "We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable."

Capital goods industry seeing green shoots: Ingersoll RandWe do not believe that a delisting is going to give us any major benefit
Venkatesh Valluri
Chairman
Ingersoll Rand
Venkatesh Valluri, Chairman & President of engineering and capital goods player Ingersoll Rand  India feels the capital goods industry is showing some signs of growth.
Although the company witnessed 15 percent growth in Q1 on year-on-year basis, it was in investment/capex mode over last 2-3 years that curtailed margins. Going forward, he sees early cues of margin improvement.
Currently, the company has Rs 500 crore cash on books with investments funded via internal accruals, he says in an interview with CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Give us an idea of what kind of sales you are expecting over FY15 and FY16?
A: In the first quarter of this year we grew by about 15 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, so that started demonstrating that the green shoots are coming up, the capital goods industry is showing some kind of signs of growth.
As I look at it in the future and as I see that the large number of capital projects are being released whether its in the area of defense, whether its in the area of ports, infrastructure, we do see Ingersoll Rand plays and all these areas are key important role. So I am hoping that the growth percentage in the future should be reasonably healthy.
What the rates would be. We essentially follow how infrastructure goes up in the country and once infrastructure grows up then we are the follower of the infrastructure growth and that’s why we see growth. So, I am quite bullish and I am quite positive that in the future Ingersoll Rand should have a reasonable growth rate coming through.
Q: What kind of trajectory are you expecting to see in terms of margins because in the quarter gone by your margin profile had slipped to about 6.5 percent? This compares to 9 percent that you use to enjoy in FY13. Going ahead what kind of margins do you think you can clock in and what will be the segments that will lead it there?
A: The reason for our margin to take a bit of a backseat has essentially been because we have been investing and from my perspective, the best time to make the investment is when the business cycle is low. So we took a decision over the last two-three years to make capital investments in setting up a new plant in Chennai and now upgrading our plant in Naroda even though the growth was not there but now when the growth comes we are completely prepared to serve the market. If you look at the operating leverage that we should get in the future should be fairly healthy and therefore the margins in the future should again get back to our original estimates or even better than that.
Q: What are the original estimates – double digits?
A: Hopefully yes, if the operating leverage of every incremental dollar revenue we get, now should start flow, the gross margin should stay afloat through to the bottomline.
Q: You spoke about when the growth picks up. Are you even seeing early signs of the orders coming in?
A: As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter this year has clocked in a growth of about 14 percent and that’s also not with full-blown investment in the infrastructure sector. Our order book looks reasonably healthy so I am assuming that as the new government starts releasing more constructive policies in the area of coal, in the area of defense, in the area of pharma, healthcare etc, which are fundamentally the markets we serve. I think it should be hopefully a lot more positive for us in terms of growth.
Q: For the year as a whole, will FY15 be better than FY14?
A: We all hope so. Hopefully, it should be better than FY14 and one of the strategies we have deployed has been even the government and the Prime Minister has now said ‘Make in India’ which is a very heartening kind of input.
Over the last three years, we have followed these three processes of saying By India, For India, In India and that has been the strategic approach. When I say ‘By India’ I meant how we create markets in India for our products and ‘In India’ has been our innovation strategy of innovating products in India for the market what we have to create and the entire design and engineering has been done by the engineering centres in India. So, we have invested in creating a space in the organisation where we create markets, where we innovate products for these markets and we manufacture these products for the markets we operate in.
Q: Can you give us couple of more numbers. How much have you invested so far in terms of capex, how much do you plan to invest and where will that money come from. What is the debt on the books and do you plan to raise any capital?
A: If you look at our numbers, we have no debt at all. Everything has been through internal accruals and some are the old cycle businesses we sold. Our cash position has been extremely healthy. We still have about Rs 500 crore in our balance sheet and the investments that we made in the last two years – one has been in a Greenfield project in Chennai and second is the state of the art facility that we are building up at Naroda in Ahmedabad. Both investments are close to about Rs 300 crore.
Q: Is delisting the share an option? Promoters stand at 74 percent.
A: No, we are not looking at delisting and I did make this comment even few years ago that we do not expect Ingersoll Rand to delist. We are fine with the kind of management control what we have and our corporate governance has been extremely good. So from that respect we do not believe that a delisting is going to give us any major benefit.
Ingersoll Rand stock price
On December 05, 2014, Ingersoll Rand (India) closed at Rs 910.05, down Rs 3.7, or 0.4 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 956.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 345.05.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 20.95 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 43.44. The latest book value of the company is Rs 289.73 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 3.14.

Clash between two groups over restaurant bill inUPBy: Press Trust of India | Etawah | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:48 pm
Two groups belonging to different communities clashed after one of the groups had an argument with a restaurant worker over payment of bill in Purbia tola, police said today. The incident took place last night here in the home district of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, when some youths entered into an altercation with the worker over payment of the bill, police said, adding, the group then resorted to damaging vehicles and set afire two shops.
As soon as the news spread, some youths who were taking out a Moharram procession joined the quarrel and clashed with the group, they said. “Some anti-social elements tried to create tension in the city and attempts are on to identified them. Strict action would be initiated against them,” Sub Divisional Magistrate Mahendra Singh said.
A large number of police personnel have been deployed in the area and the situation was stated to be under control.

Gold Struggles as Stronger Equities Hurt Safe-haven AppealGold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
Singapore: Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat US economic data and slightly better-than-expected health checks on euro zone banks, which helped revive investors' risk appetite.
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.
"In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion," Gan said.
Spot gold slipped 0.1 per cent to $1,229.73 an ounce at 0639 GMT - not too far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week.
The metal's losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain's economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown. Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher.
Bullion traders were also closely watching investors' positions in gold funds. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the price of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

It also told the court that Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases where probe has been done by I-T department.

Depression forms in Arabian Sea  may intensify soonDepression forms in Arabian Sea, may intensify soon
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 25:  
The well-marked low pressure over west-central and adjoining south and east-central Arabian Sea has concentrated into a depression.
At 5.30 am, it lay centred 1,400 km west-southwest of Mumbai and 940 km east-southeast of Salalah, Oman.
FURTHER INTENSIFICATION
An India Met Department update this morning said it would intensify another round into a deep depression by tomorrow (Sunday).
The depression would initially move west-northwest towards south Oman and adjoining Yemen, the Met said in its first assessment of its possible track.
But global models differ, with some continuing to suggest that the storm would head east mid-course towards the Sindh (Pakistan) and northwest Gujarat (India) coasts.
In any case, the system is likely to be declared a cyclonic storm by Monday, with the tag ‘Nilofar,’ a name contributed by Pakistan.
PROJECTED LANDFALL
The US Naval Observatory said this morning that the system will remain largely stationary during the next 24 hours after which it will resume gathering strength.
During the phase, it will briefly swerve to the northeast before resuming the west-northwest track towards south Oman and adjoining Yemen.
A few models see the prospective cyclone making landfall where it is currently headed to, but others are of the view that the cyclone will stay for longer in the sea.
According to them, the cyclone would approach and even graze the coast of Oman before coming under the influence of a passing westerly system.
WESTERLY INFLUENCE
Originating farther west-northwest in the Mediterranean, the western disturbance would head for Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
The cyclone would latch on to the underbelly of the westerly system before being jettisoned over the Sindh and adjoining northwest Gujarat coast, say these models.
They estimate that it would grow to a very severe cyclone ahead of landfall, on a par with cyclone Hudhud that hit India’s east coast 12 days ago.
This is the second cyclone to form in the Arabian Sea this year after ‘Nanauk’ that coincided with the onset of the southwest monsoon earlier in June.

Telcos May Raise Tariffs to Pay for Spectrum Costs: Industry Body COAINew Delhi: Industry body COAI has said mobile tariffs may go up soon as telecom operators are expected to pass on to customers the burden of spectrum cost they will incur in the upcoming auction.
The auction of airwaves is likely to be conducted in February next year.
"Definitely there will be an upward pressure on tariffs as the debt burden of telecom players will increase post auctions, they have to pass on the cost to customers," COAI director general Rajan S Mathews told PTI.
He said operators have to pay around Rs 40,000 crore for the spectrum even if the airwaves would be sold at reserve price in 900MHz and 1800 MHz bands.
"From where the money will come? Banks are also unwilling to lend to telecom operators due to high debt burden. Also the telcos have to spend on network infrastructure. So, after paying such huge amount for spectrum only, they have to pass the burden to customers," Mr Mathews said.
Telecom sector regulator TRAI had suggested a 10 per cent higher base price for the next round of spectrum auction in the 1800 Mhz band.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had recommended a price of Rs 2,138 crore per Mhz for the 1800 Mhz band and Rs 3,004 crore per Mhz for the premium 900 Mhz band.
The spectrum auction will be conducted for radiowaves in 900 Mhz held by existing telecom operators Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications through their licences that are expiring in 2015-16.
In the 900 Mhz band, about 184 Mhz of spectrum is likely to be auctioned. In 1800 Mhz, government has proposed to auction 104 Mhz of spectrum which included spectrum held by licences that are expiring in 2015-16 and unsold airwaves in February auction.
Telecom operators have been cutting back on freebies and discounted minutes to maintain profitability. Analysts say this trend may continue as they have to pay for the fresh spectrum purchases.
After the last auction held in February this year, Vodafone India CEO Marten Pieters had said the telecom industry in India has reached a point where the tariffs need to increase every year to sustain itself.
The February 2014 auctions fetched about Rs 62,162 crore.

Oil Ministry to Overhaul Exploration Policy: Dharmendra PradhanIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
New Delhi: After unveiling major reforms since BJP's storming to power, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan plans to overhaul the exploration policy to attract investors, spur energy output and revive the economy.
In parallel, the ministry is setting stiff targets for state explorers like ONGC to reverse the declining trend in oil and gas output in recent years as it looks to cut on import dependence.
Mr Pradhan, 45, wants to replace the 15-year old production sharing regime, which has produced more controversies and less oil and gas. Only three out of the 252 blocks given out have come to production stage. The new regime aims to inspire confidence in investors and require minimal government intervention.
"We want to increase ease of doing business in India. Bottlenecks have to be removed, red-tapism cut and investors given confidence so that they can come and invest in oil and gas exploration and production," he told PTI here.
The focus is on raising domestic oil and gas production beginning with state explorers ONGC and Oil India, who had in the immediate past not met their own stated targets. They have been given a 10 per cent improvement target so as to cut imports, he said.
Top most on priority is monetisation of small and marginal fields lying with ONGC with help of private investment as well as technology, he said.
Natural gas pipeline network in the country will be doubled to 30,000 kilometres by 2019 to expand the reach of environment-friendly fuel. Also, state refineries are being asked to improve efficiencies to become globally competitive even as fuel retailing is opened up for competition.
"We have set priorities and targets at every level - upstream, midstream and downstream. Efficiencies have to improve. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has showed how the same set of people under the same system can deliver better results," he said.

SIA-Airbus Joint Venture Gets Competition Commission s ApprovalAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
New Delhi: Singapore Airlines' proposed joint venture with Airbus Services Asia Pacific to provide flight pilot training services, has received green signal from fair trade watchdog CCI.
The proposed combination involves formation of a joint venture company, Airbus Asia Training Centre (AATC), to provide flight pilot training services.
In AATC, Airbus Services Asia, part of French major Airbus, would have 55 per cent stake while 45 per cent would be with Singapore Airlines.
Clearing the deal, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said there is no horizontal overlap or vertical relationship between the parties with respect to provision of flight pilot training activities.
The deal is "not likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India," CCI said in a recent order.
AATC would provide civil flight aviation training for airbus aircrafts to Singapore Airlines and other carriers.
Singapore-based Airbus Services Asia is mainly into management and performance of services on aircraft and warehousing activities related to aircraft spare parts. It is part of Airbus Group, which has presence in India.
Singapore Airlines only operates flights to India and does not have any flight pilot training centre in the country.
Airbus Group, which does not have any flight pilot training centre in India, provides such services through its arrangement with full flight simulators (FFS) providers like CAE, Bangalore and InterGlobe-CAE, the order said.
According to details in the order, the joint venture firm would provide flight pilot training services on FFS for the Airbus aircrafts belonging to the A320, A330, A350XWB and A380 family and certain other types of Airbus aircrafts.
"As regards the requirement of instructors for flight pilot training programmes, it is not mandatory for the instructors to be from the respective aircraft manufacturers," CCI said in its order.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) can grant any flight training centre a Type Rating Training Organisation (TRTO).
For providing flight pilot training, CCI said there are TRTOs and independent training centres such as InterGlobe-CAE and CAE, Bangalore in India.
Noting that most Indian carriers operate Airbus A320 family, CCI said as these aircrafts "has not been included in the non-compete and the exclusivity clause provided in the joint venture agreement, Airbus Group may use FFS facilities in India to provide flight pilot training services for the A320 aircrafts".
As per details provided to the regulator, Jet Airways -- which mostly has A330 aircrafts -- had largely used the Airbus training centre in Toulouse, France in the last 3-5 years.
Air India has only two such A330 aircrafts.
Singapore Airlines and Airbus Services had executed the deal on August 13, this year, following which they had approached CCI for approval in September.

SBI Home Loans Rocking at Rs 188 Crore a Day; Targets Rs 250 Crore
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 26, 2014 15:11 (IST)
Indian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Mumbai: Country's largest lender State Bank of India has set an ambitious target of disbursing Rs 250 crore of home loans every day during the ongoing festive season, which currently stands close to Rs 200 crore.
After it waived off the processing fee late September as part of its festive offering, the bank is disbursing close to Rs 200 crore home loans every day.
"The home loan disbursement is going up each day. It was Rs 130 crore in the beginning when we scrapped the processing fee. Then it moved up to Rs 150 crore, and then Rs 175 crore, and has now stabilised at Rs 188 crore a day. My target is Rs 250 crore a day," managing director for national banking and group executive B Sriram told PTI in an interview.
Year-to-date, the home loan sanctions stood at Rs 20,032 crore as against Rs 18,500 crore a year ago, he said, constituting around 14 per cent uptick year-on-year.
In percentage terms, the growth is 14-15 per cent year-on- year in the first half, he said, adding, "We are hopeful that it will become 18-20 per cent in the current quarter."
Stating that the bank has not launched any scheme during the festive season but has waived off the processing charges on car and home loans, Sriram said from the last week of September the bank was seeing quite traction on loan queries and disbursals.
On the average ticket size, Mr Sriram said it is improving and it is Rs 30-32 lakh now and the focus is to take it to Rs 50 lakh.
"We are focussing on high value home loans because now almost 80 per cent of our home loans are below Rs 50 lakh. So we are not very much in the above Rs 50 lakh segment. And above Rs 75 lakh we are just 12 per cent. So we need to improve that and have also brought down interest rates on par with the other segment. This is one focus areas now. We need to push the average ticket size to about Rs 50 lakh," Mr Sriram said.

Five common ways you can lose money
Oct 27, 2014, 08.00AM IST
Tags:
(If you are suffering monetary…)
By Bindisha Sarang
If you are suffering monetary losses due to laziness and ignorance, have an ECS arrangement in place or set up phone reminders to ensure that you don't.
1. Missing the insurance premium date
How you lose: Irrespective of the reason for missing the payment date for your insurance premium, you stand to lose a lot of money. Insurers usually give a 15-30 day grace period, but if you miss even this, your policy can lapse. Depending on the time lapsed, you have to pay the premium, along with the revival charges, to retain the policy after the grace period is over.
What's your loss? The revival charge varies among different insurers. Typically, it is a flat fee of around Rs 500 or an interest on the outstanding premium, which is usually around 0.75% per month. The revival charges also depend on the type of policy.
2. Forgetting your credit card payment
How you lose: Among financial products, there's nothing as easy to use and as complicated to understand as a credit card. If you miss a credit card payment, you stand to suffer losses in three ways. You will be slapped with a late payment fee; you will have to pay interest on the outstanding sum, and you will have to pay more for any purchases that you make in the next billing cycle.
What's your loss? Usually, the late payment fee ranges between Rs 300 and Rs 700, depending on the payment due. The interest charged is 2-3% on the outstanding bill. You will have to pay an extra 2-3% for the purchases made in the next billing cycle. Your credit score will also suffer.
3. Ignorance about depositing advance tax
How you lose: Advance tax is required to be paid in three instalments. At least 30% of the tax by 15 September, 60% of the tax by 15 December, and the remaining by 15 March. If you fail to pay advance tax, you will have to pay interest on the defaulted amount.
What's your loss? Penalty is 1% simple interest per month on the defaulted sum for three months. The penalty is the same (1%) if you missed the 15 December deadline. If you miss the final date of payment, you will have to pay 1% simple interest on the defaulted amount for every month until the tax is fully paid.
4. Delay in paying utility bills
How you lose: A family of four easily pays 6-8 utility bills a month, which includes mobile bills, electricity bills, Internet charges, among others. If you manage to miss these, you have to shell out the late payment fee. What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
What's your loss? Miss a couple of utility bill payments a month and you could be spending Rs 300-500 on late payment charges.
5. Forgetting the loan EMI payment
How you lose: This is again a double-edged sword. If you miss home or car loan instalment , not only are you slapped with a penalty, but your credit score also suffers.
What's your loss? A late payment fee for a missed EMI on a personal loan with HDFC Bank is 24% per annum on the outstanding sum from the date of default. A late payment charge for a missed EMI on a home loan with ICICI Bank is in the range of Rs 500-5,000.

 Brent Drops Below $86 After Goldman Cuts ForecastsYou are here: Home Commodities
Brent Drops Below $86 After Goldman Cuts Price Forecasts
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 13:31 (IST)
Gold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
Tokyo: Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, making the US investment bank the most bearish of major financial institutions that have been carving back their estimates in recent weeks, citing global growth concerns and ample supplies.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's analysts who last week pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0612 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 2 cents at $81.03 a barrel.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts ... I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
Increased domestic crude stores have depressed the price of short-term futures contracts. For the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on November 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Kuwait's oil minister said there was no negative effect on the country's development plan from lower oil prices, state news agency KUNA reported on Sunday.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.

Gold struggles on stronger economic data  higher equitiesGold struggles on stronger economic data, higher equities

Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks at the weekend were received calmly in the market.
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting , when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.
"In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion," Gan said.
Spot gold was steady at $1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn't far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week.
The metal's losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain's economy expanded 0.7 percent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown. Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher.
Bullion traders were also closely watching investors' positions in gold funds. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the price of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

DLF cracks over 8%; Vadra deal to be probedAnil Vij
(Senior cabinet minister…)
MUMBAI: Shares of realty giant DLF slumped over 8 per cent today, wiping-out Rs 1,674.7 crore from its market value, on concerns that the company may face probe by the new government in Haryana.
DLF's scrip plunged 7.84 per cent to settle at Rs 110.50 on the BSE. During the day, it tumbled 9 per cent to Rs 109.10.
At the NSE, it slumped 8.30 per cent to close the day at Rs 110.
Led by the dip in the stock, the company's market value fell by Rs 1,674.7 crore to Rs 19,690.30 crore.
The fall in DLF shares, to as low as Rs 109.10 in intra-day trade at the BSE, follows a major plunge of 28 per cent in a single day earlier this month after a Sebi order barred the company and six others from accessing the capital markets for three years.
The Sebi order has been challenged by DLF before the Securities Appellate Tribunal which would next hear the case on October 30.
While the stock had recovered some lost ground last week after being hit by Sebi order, it fell further today after reports suggested that it may face probe in Haryana.
Hours after taking oath, two new ministers in Haryana yesterday said the BJP government would order a thorough probe into the alleged land scams and not spare anyone, even Robert Vadra or former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda .
DLF has a significant presence in Haryana and is credited with creation of India's largest township set up by a private player in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital.
Notably, BJP and other parties had in the run up to the assembly polls attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal.
There have been reports about alleged irregularities in land dealings between Robert Vadra and DLF.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi while campaigning for BJP in Haryana had also kept the alleged land scams in the state at the centre of his attack.
The new ministers' remarks, however, drew sharp reactions from the Congress, which said that such statements show the arrogance of Haryana government.

11:45 am Interview: Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp witnessed a phenomenal Diwali by registering explosive sales on Dhanteras. The market leader sold over 2 lakh units on that day, which establishes the fact that the Indian economy is turning. Speaking about the cracker sales and future of the two wheelers, Sunil Munjal, Joint MD of Hero MotoCorp told CNBC-TV18 that the automotive industry saw 16 percent growth in 2-wheelers over the last six months. He acknowledged it is heartening to see healthy demand of scooters after a long time.
Despite all this, Munjal believes it is sensible to be cautious now as he expects consolidation over the next six months. Justifying his fears and hopes, Munjal said the industry is cautiously optimistic based on actions taken by the government so far but high interest rate along with deficient monsoon are deterrents. Hence, at the moment, the expectation is that the industry will see a mixed bag but general improvement on the ground, acknowledged by global rating agencies, will ensure there will be upside.
11:30 am Buzzing: Shares of DLF continued to remain under heavy selling pressure, falling 8 percent intraday. Investors are cautious as media reports suggest that the new BJP-led Haryana government is going to probe into all land scams, including the deal between UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and realty developer DLF.
The report quoted senior cabinet minister Anil Vij, “We would hold a probe into acquisition of 70,000 acres during the 10-year regime of Bhupinder Singh Hooda government. We would inquire whether the land was used for the purpose it was acquired. It would be probed if there was any violation in acquisition to benefit any individual.”
Earlier in July, Bhupinder Singh Hooda (former Haryana chief minister) government had legalised the controversial land deal between Vadra-owned company Skylight Hospitality and DLF.

New York Governor outlines policy for EbolaquarantineNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, speaks as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie listens at a news conference. (source: AP)
By: Associated Press | New York | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:21 pm
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has fleshed out guidelines for the mandatory, 21-day quarantining of medical workers returning from West Africa that he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered two days earlier, bringing the state closer in line with federal protocols.
Cuomo detailed the state’s protocols at a nighttime news conference with New York City’s mayor last night after the Obama administration said it expressed concerns to Cuomo and Christie about their states’ mandatory Ebola quarantines. The announcement also comes amid sharp criticism of the treatment of a nurse returning from Sierrra Leone who was forcibly quarantined in a New Jersey hospital isolation unit even though she said had no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola.
Under the outlined New York guidelines, medical professionals who have had contact with Ebola patients will be quarantined at home and receive twice-daily monitoring if they have no symptoms. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials. The state will also pay for any lost compensation, if they are not paid by a volunteer organization.
Cuomo had criticized Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, for not obeying a 21-day voluntary quarantine. But on Sunday, he called the health care workers “heroes” and said his administration would encourage more medical workers to volunteer to fight Ebola.
Meanwhile, Kaci Hickox, the first nurse forcibly quarantined in New Jersey under the state’s new policy, said in a telephone interview with CNN that her isolation at a hospital was “inhumane,” adding: “We have to be very careful about letting politicians make health decisions.”
Saying the federal health guidelines are inadequate, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine program Friday for medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa, either in their homes or in medical facilities, and Illinois soon followed suit. Twenty-one days is the incubation period for Ebola.
Sunday night, Christie also stressed that home confinement would be used for New Jersey residents and others when possible.
“The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home.
Non-residents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey,” said a statement from Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts.

Sena climbs down  says willing to accept any BJP chief ministerShiv Sena climbs down, says will back BJP

A cornered Shiv Sena made a last-ditch effort to patch up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be part of the new Maharashtra government as its former ally prepared to elect its chief ministerial candidate on Tuesday.

Devendra Fadnavis looks like a clear favourite for the chief minister’s job in the western state which has been gripped by political uncertainty since the BJP emerged as the single largest party but failed to get a clear majority in the assembly election.
The BJP is finalising its team of ministers ahead of the oath-taking ceremony on October 31, but it isn’t clear if the Shiv Sena will join the ministry as the BJP is not willing to accept its demands for key portfolios and an assurance to not carve out a separate state of Vidarbha.
Despite the talks with the Shiv Sena, the BJP has also prepared a plan to run a minority government instead of giving the Sena a considerable share of ministerial berths and important departments.
The first indication of the Shiv Sena softening its stand was an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana saying the party would support the BJP-led government as it has got a mandate.
“We will have to keep our political differences aside and work with the BJP chief minister for the unity of Maharashtra. We have kept ourselves together even in difficult circumstances and it will be better if it remains so,” said the editorial in Saamana, which is regarded as the opinion of Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray.
The BJP has an upper hand in negotiations with future allies because it emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly compared with the Shiv Sena’s 63 seats. The BJP’s strength reduced by one as one its MLAs, Govind Rathod elected from Nanded district, died of heart attack on Sunday.
 It has also been in talks with smaller parties and independents, which could take its tally to around 135.
Wankhede Stadium is being decked up for the oath-taking function, expected to be attended by 30,000-40,000 BJP workers from all corners of the state.

NSA Doval in Bengal  spotlight on Mamata govtNSA Doval visits Burdwan, pressure on Mamata
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 26, 2014

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and top intelligence chiefs of the country on Monday visited the blast site in West Bengal's Burdwan and assessed the progress of investigations.
 
NIA director general Sharad Kumar, NSG director general Jayanta Narayan Chowdhury and Intelligence Bureau director Syed Asif Ibrahim accompanied him during the over 30 minute visit to the house at Khagragarh where the blast took place on October 2, police said.
 
Doval and the three top officials visited the room where the blast occurred, during which two suspected terrorists were also killed.
 
They also went to the room which had served as the laboratory of the suspected terrorists and climbed the roof top of the house to check the visibility of surrounding areas.
 
Doval also inquired where the two children of the suspected terrorists stayed in the house.
 
The children, who are toddlers have since been taken into custody along with their mothers, one of whom is the widow of one of the suspected terrorists who died in the explosion.
 
Later, Doval met the district officials and asked about the progress of inquiry into the blast, the police added.
 
The four top officials then left for Kolkata to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat 'Nabanna'.
 
Earlier, the security and intelligence chiefs flew in to Burdwan by a chopper from NSC Bose International Airport. They had reached Kolkata in a IAF special aircraft this morning.
 
The present visit was the second in four days by the NIA director. Kumar after his first visit to Burdwan and Murshidabad on
Friday had said that the arrested persons in connection with the blast and their associates were members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and were making IEDs to be transported to the neighbouring country for possible terror attacks.
 
The visits by top security and intelligence chiefs come ahead of the union government's move to send a report to Bangladesh following a request from that country.
 
Three persons, including the two women were arrested in connection with the blast and were interrogated by the NIA.
The PMO is giving utmost importance to the terror issue in Bengal after the Burdwan blast and subsequent revelations of a well-oiled terror network using madrasas.
On the other hand, the Trinamool-led government came under heavy fire from the opposition for trying to keep the NIA at bay after the Burdwan blasts. It was CID, which was entrusted with the investigation, until NIA suo moto took up the case.

Chhattisgarh: Woman branded as witch  killedComments
A 55-year-old woman was beaten to death in Chhattisgarh's Bemetara district allegedly by her family members who suspected her of practising 'black magic', police said today.
Twelve persons, including five women, were arrested for killing Dukalhin Bai Patel in Banjarpur village on the night of October 25, Bemetara Superintendent of Police (in-charge) Narendra Khare said.

When she refused to treat the child, they started thrashing her with sticks, the SP said. Later, they dragged the woman out of the house and allegedly put chilly powder on her face and in her private parts following which she died on the spot, he said.
Soon after the incident, the victim's son rushed her to a local primary health centre where doctors declared her brought dead following which he lodged an FIR in this connection, he said. "The body was sent for postmortem and the autopsy report would help in ascertaining the actual cause of her death," Khare said.
Those arrested were identified as Nakul Patel, Tekaram, Nandkumar, Pradeep, Vikram, Gopal, and five women - Akalhinbai, Savanabai, Radha, Ahilya and Tejan.
The identity of another male family member arrested was not yet known. A case under section 302 (murder), other relevant sections of IPC and provisions of Chhattisgarh Witchcraft Atrocities (Prevention) Act, 2005 has been registered in this connection, he said, adding that further probe was on.

Nikhil Gandhi
Chairman
Pipavav Defence
In a move to boost domestic industry of the country, which imports up to 70 percent of its military hardware, the government on Saturday cleared defence projects worth Rs 80,000 crore.
Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company , a beneficiary from defence project announcements has put in bids of Rs 30,000 crore for new projects, as they claim to be well poised to secure and execute large government contracts, says company Chairman Nikhil Gandhi in an interview to CNBC-TV18.
The industry is delighted to see government thrust on defence orders, says Nikhil Gandhi, Chairman, Pipavav Defence adding that he expects clearance for more such proposals for Army, Navy and Air Force.
Going forward, the company hopes to benefit even more as complex assets like ships and submarines provide reasonable margins for companies, he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: The NDA government has given defence sector a priority. The latest news being that the Centre has given a nod to Rs 80,000 crore worth of projects. Could you tell us what kind of opportunity this open up for Pipavav Defence?
A: The private industries per se who are engaged into defence manufacturing are extremely delighted to see the kind of encouragement and policy initiative given by the current government. This will ensure that the industry becomes self-reliance and millions of new jobs will be created. Pipavav is the largest in terms of the infrastructure investment in the defence space particularly naval defence, will be one of the few beneficiary in a significant manner. We are very happy and delighted to know this development and we are expecting few more such actions on the part of the government that will benefit the private industry engage into defence manufacturing in the country.
Q: What is the exact order book that Pipavav Defence is sitting on at this point in time and given the increased opportunity, how much do you think your revenues could grow ballpark in the next couple of years?
A: Currently our order book is Rs 7,000 crore. We have put in a bid worth Rs 30,000 crore over the last three months and with the new opportunity, we will be able to put significant amount of bids over the next few months of time. In addition, being the largest infrastructure in the country and one of its kind in the world we will tend to benefit significantly on a very transparent and open basis.
Q: In this Rs 80,000 crore of defence projects which were clear over the weekend. What would be the quantum of orders that Pipavav Defence has won, if any?
A: This is a bid that has been approved by the government, which means people who are capable of building the complex warships and submarines will be allowed to submit the bids. Pipavav is one of the largest infrastructures in the world for naval defence, will be able to garner significant order book because of our ability to put in competitive bids as well as build the assets well on time.
Q: You did mention that you put in bids for about Rs 30,000 crore worth of order. How do you expect to service these orders? Will you be increasing your capex, will you be investing more into the company, are you looking to raise any money?
A: I think Pipavav is well invested. We have the necessary infrastructure including the second largest dry dock in the world; absolutely in place. We have a very modern modular construction facility and to replicate anything like this will take years and years. So we are happily placed and poised to secure large contracts and execute them on time.
Q: Are you aware if the Centre is planning to meet again, the defence sector will be meeting again and clearing any more contracts?
A: India has a very large amount of demand and supply gap and certainly, government has given indication that it wants manufacturers of India under the visionary policy called ‘Make in India.’ With that, government in the coming months is likely to clear many more proposals for the Army, Navy and Air Force and this is a right step, which has been in demand by the industry for a very long time.
Q: What is the current margin that Pipavav Defence is working with and with these new orders will the margin profile go up for the company?
A: When you make the complex assets like submarine or warship, there is a reasonable margin and it is not cyclical also it is ring fenced any potential threat that one sees time and again due to the several developments in the global markets.
Q: In FY14, your margins were at around 30 percent or so.
A: We are not talking about margins. I am just giving you the ballpark information only that in complex assets like this, the margins are reasonable otherwise, people will not be encouraged to make the large capex.

BSE Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range today after giving up most of their early gains.

Post your opinion here
 
ICICIdirect.com`s research report on UltraTech Cement
“UltraTech’s Q2FY15 standalone revenue of Rs 5,381.8 crore remained higher than our estimates (Rs 5190.5 crore) led by strong volumes and better realisation. On consolidated basis, its topline grew by 18% YoY to Rs5,723 crore led by capacity expansion and additional volumes from acquired unit in Gujarat. However, high input cost and additional cost relating newly plant put some pressure on margins. As a result, EBITDA of Rs 779/tonne remained lower than our estimates (Rs 859/tonne). However, it was higher by 10.7% YoY on account of better realisations. The company’s on going capex are on track. During the quarter, company commissioned 1.4MT cement mill at Karnataka and 25MW power plant at AP. With this new cement capacity along with 4.8MT Jaypee unit, its capacity has reached 60.2MT which is inline with our capacity expansion target.”
“UltraTech Cement is the largest player in terms of capacity (60.2 MT including Jaypee plant) with market share of ~17% in India. The company has consistently remained ahead of its peers in terms of capacity expansion with CAGR of 23% vs. peer’s CAGR of 13% over the past five years. During the quarter, UltraTech included earnings from the recently acquired Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd from June 12, 2014. Other than that, the company has commissioned a 25 MW thermal power plant at Andhra Pradesh and 6.5MW waste heat recovery system at Awarpur, Maharashtra. With this, the total power capacity of the company (including WHRS) stands at 733 MW, which is around 80% of the company’s power requirement. Further, the company is aiming to reach its total capacity of 70 MT by FY16E, which we believe would help it to maintain its leadership, going forward. We expect the company to grow at a higher rate than the industry in the coming years led by capacity expansion. The same has also been reflected in the current quarter result with volume growth of 13.6% YoY. Further, given the likelihood of higher spending on infra development coupled with a rebound in economic growth, we expect a strong demand recovery from H2FY15E onwards. UltraTech, being the largest pan-India player, would be one of the major beneficiaries of a demand recovery with a stronger presence in the western and northern regions.”

Buy HT Media; target of Rs 129: Angel Broking
Angel Broking is bullish on HT Media and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 129 in its October 20, 2014 research report.
Post your opinion here
 
Angel Broking`s research report on HT Media
“HT Media reported a subdued set of results for 2QFY2015, both on the top-line and the bottom-line front. The top-line growth was lower mainly due to lower growth in advertising revenue, primarily from the English edition, which although is showing signs of recovery. The company’s performance was subdued on the profitability front as well, owing to subdued sales growth and lower other income.”
“HT Media’s Hindi subsidiary - HMVL - registered a double digit advertising revenue growth of ~12% yoy to Rs142cr on back of increase in yields and volume. English advertising revenue grew by 7.0% yoy to Rs278cr owing to improvement in market sentiment with increase in ad spend from automobile and real estate sectors in particular. The Management expects English advertising yield to go up after 2HFY2015, leading to improvement in English advertising revenues. For the quarter, HT Media posted a de-growth of ~25% in earnings to Rs44cr, owing to subdued sales growth and lower other income. Other income in the corresponding quarter of the previous year carried an amount of Rs38.2cr from the Burda stake sale and an amount of Rs8.6cr pertaining to the HMVL stake sale, thus leading to a higher base for the quarter under review (2QFY2015).”
“Going forward, we believe that the company would perform well, both on the top-line and bottom-line fronts due to expected recovery in Indian economy. This would lead to increase in revenue from new businesses like HT Mumbai, Radio and the Hindi editions; further, we also expect the company to gain some traction in its Digital businesses. Moreover, the company has a strong balance sheet which would make it more capable to execute future expansion plans. Hence, we maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs129,” says Angel Broking research report.

Kolkata, Oct 27:  
City-based UCO Bank today said it has “identified” Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines as a “wilful defaulter” and will be sending a notice to the defunct carrier.
“We have identified KFA as a wilful defaulter. We are in the process of sending a notice to the company in this regard,” a source in the bank told PTI.
Other banks like State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank are also mulling this route.
United Bank of India has already declared KFA a ‘wilful defaulter’ for defaulting on a loan of Rs 350 crore.
UCO Bank will also send a notice to the company which had furnished a corporate guarantee for a loan of around Rs 450 crore, the source said.
As per RBI guidelines, a wilful defaulter tag would be given if it is found that a loan taken is diverted for some other use rather than for which it was availed, as well as the default is made in spite of having the ability to repay it.

The company did not disclose the financial details of the deal.
Alembic Global Holding (AGH) will invest to the extent of 49 per cent equity of Adwiya Mami. After the conclusion of the deal, the company will be renamed as Alembic Mami SPA, an official statement said.
However, the shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals fell nearly 4 per cent on Monday to close at Rs 406.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
“The investment in Adwia Mami will give AGH a quick entry to the attractive Algerian market, which is a large African market with a size of $3 billion (of which 70 per cent is generic and 30 per cent is innovator market),” an Alembic statement said.
At present, there are entry barriers and the local manufacturing units get a distinct advantage in marketing the products. Imports are prohibited once there is a local manufacturing, the company said.
Adwia Mami owns a latest formulation plant with annual capacity of 1.2 billion oral solids. The plant has been designed and developed by a leading European pharmaceutical company in line with the cGMP requirements. The plant has enough headroom for future expansion, Alembic said in a BSE filing.
Alembic Mami SPA will be jointly run by Alembic & Mami with equal representation from both on the board. The board has appointed Tagreed Alshunar as the first CEO of the company. A Jordanian national and professional with over 20 years of experience in the pharma industry, Alshunar will be the Alembic nominee.

Give preference to existing coal block allocatees in auction process: AssochamGive preference to existing coal block allocatees in auction process: Assocham

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India has suggested that the Government should give preference to companies who have an operational or soon to be operational end-use project but have had their coal blocks cancelled.
Assocham has written to the Prime Minsiter Office saying that coal blocks already allotted for end-use steel projects should be auctioned only for steel projects, while those for power projects should be auctioned only for power projects.
“The reserve price and upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable resource and not on the basis of geological reserves,” said the industry chamber in a statement.
“Clearances accorded to the existing coal blocks should automatically get transferred to the new allocatees. Obtaining these clearances again will lead to considerable delays in commencement of production from mines and adversely affect the end-use project,” the statement added.

Markets rose for the third straight session today with Sensex gaining 146 points to end at over one-week high of 26,575.65 and Nifty jumping 48 points to regain 7,900-mark led by power, metal and banking stocks after government laid a broad roadmap for coal mine allocation.
In line with government’s initiatives, stocks of Jindal Steel Power, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Sesa Sterlite attracted good buying and surged up to 7.46 per cent, pushing up Sensex.

The 30-share index gathered another 145.80 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close at 26,575.65 after shuttling between 26,615.41 and 26,407.00. This is its highest closing since 26,637.28 on October 9.

The move comes against the backdrop of the Supreme Court last month quashing allocation of 214 coal blocks to various companies since 1993.

The National Stock Exchange index Nifty, reclaimed the key 7,900-mark by surging 48.35 points, or 0.61 per cent, to close at 7,927.75 after moving between 7,936.60 and 7,874.35.

In broader markets, Financial Technologies (FTIL) stock tumbled 20 per cent after government ordered merger of crisis-ridden NSEL with holding firm, FTIL.
Sectorally, BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 2.63 per cent, followed by Power (2.55 per cent), Metal (1.71 per cent), Capital Goods (1.38 per cent), Banking (1.2 per cent) and Consumer Durables (1.18 per cent) among others.
Globally, mixed closing on other Asian markets and higher opening in Europe, also influenced the sentiment.

Was IAF notification on Xiaomi phones based on old F-Secure report Here is everything you need to knowPrint
There might not be a new security scare with Xiaomi phones, but the Chinese company is moving its servers out of Beijing.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 5:33 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 12:38 pm
Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi made its entry in the Indian smartphone market with its Mi 3 smartphone in July. The company made headlines after the Mi 3 handset sold like hot cakes on Flipkart. After just six weeks of massive sales in the country, Xiaomi discontinued the Mi 3 temporarily to give mileage to the much cheaper RedMi 1S smartphone, which arrived in September.
What is the data snooping concern regarding Xiaomi phones?
Before the launch of Redmi 1S, software security company F-Secure published a report in August stating that the Xiaomi RedMi 1S “sent the telco name to the server api.account.xiaomi.com. It also sent IMEI and phone number to the same server. The phone number of the contacts added to the phone book and also from SMS messages received was also forwarded.”
Commenting on the Mi Cloud service, the report stated, “the IMSI details were sent to api.account.xiaomi.com, as well as the IMEI and phone number.”
F-Secure published another report in a week, saying that Xiaomi had addressed the privacy concerns related to “MIUI Cloud Messaging Platform” by releasing an OTA update which made the messaging service “an opt-in feature, rather than a default one.”
The report confirmed that after the OTA update, the security experts “did not see any data being sent out from the phone.” Also, it stated that on logging into Mi Cloud, “base-64 encoded traffic is now sent.”
The updated report concluded by stating that Mi Cloud data was “now sent over HTTPS rather than HTTP, as seen in our previous testing.”
Is there still an issue?
Su Gim Goh, Security Advisor, APAC, F-Secure during his visit to New Delhi on September 1, the same day when Xiaomi RedMi 1S went for sale for the first time for Flipkart First subscribers, confirmed in an exclusive interaction with IndianExpress.com that Xiaomi has rectified the privacy issues raised by it. “The entire privacy issue was related to Xiaomi’s cloud messaging service. Previously, the cloud service got activated by default without asking for the user’s permission. So, related personal data were sent from the phone to Xiaomi’s servers in China. After we alerted about this privacy concern, Xiaomi has made the cloud service as an opt-in feature and not by default, said Goh.
As with every cloud service, data is obviously sent to servers located outside the country with the user’s permission. Goh further confirmed that the even if users opt for the Xiaomi’s cloud service, the data is now being sent over secured HTTPS than HTTP. “The privacy concerns were addressed by Xiaomi quickly and now it’s all good,” added Goh.
So, why did Indian Air Force issue a notification against using Xiaomi phones?
The Sunday Standard recently reported that the Indian Air Force (IAF) has notified its 1,75,000 personnel and their family members not to use Xiaomi smartphones on account of ‘spying’. The report said the IAF alert was based on the inputs from CERT-In.
What’s surprising is that the IAF notification seems to be hinting on the same report released by F-Secure in August to which the software security company had already confirmed that Xiaomi has rectified the issue and the company no longer breaches privacy.
Now, there can be two situations- either, the privacy problem with Xiaomi has returned or the IAF notification is based on older reports. We believe it to be the latter, as no new reports have surfaced since the F-Secure clarification in September.
Is this snooping or is this normal?
In every cloud service, be it Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp or in this case, MIUI Cloud Messaging Platform, data is sent and stored in servers outside the country. Xiaomi stores the data in servers based in Beijing. There is no rule or regulation from the government stating that cloud service providers will have to store data within the country only. So, if any user opts for any sort of cloud service, then its totally up to the service provider as to where they will store the data.
How has Xiaomi responded to the latest issue?
According to Reuters , Xiaomi has announced that it is moving some data of non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the US and data centres in Singapore due to the recent privacy considerations. This may be a pure coincidence, or Xiaomi may have actually reacted to the IAF notification. Anyway, for a company hoping to make a strong presence across the globe it is highly unlikely that Xiaomi will do something that will put off its customers or affect its business in the slightest way. Xiaomi has sold just over half a million handsets (Mi 3 and RedMi 1S combined) in India.

5 more Ebola vaccines to be tested in March: WHOvaccines
The agency, however, warns that it’s not clear whether any of these will work against the deadly virus that has already killed over 4,800 people this year.
The World Health Organisation says millions of doses of two experimental Ebola vaccines could be ready in 2015 and five more experimental vaccines will start being tested in March.
Still, the agency warned it’s not clear whether any of these will work against the deadly virus that has already killed over 4,800 people this year.
Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny from the agency told reporters there could be millions of doses of an Ebola vaccine in 2015 if early tests prove that the two leading candidates are safe and effective.
If the early trials hint at success, larger trials testing the vaccines in West Africa could begin as soon as December, Dr. Kieny said. She said five other possible Ebola vaccines should start being tested in March.

Auction all coal blocks in one go: Assochamcoal
The reserve price and the upfront payment should be based on the mineable reserves
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) in a letter to Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, has suggested that auction of all cancelled coal blocks should be done by March 2015 so that the operations of existing end-use plants would not be affected. It has also suggested that the auction should be done either at one go or majority of them should be put on the block together. The industry body has sought a meeting with the Minister so that it could make a presentation and put forth its views. The reserve price and the upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable reserves and not on the basis of geological reserves, Assocham suggested.
Coal blocks earlier allotted for power-plants should only be auctioned for power plants while those allotted to steel plants should be reserved for that sector.
Assocham felt that the retrospective payment of Rs.295 a tonne penalty was erroneous as CAG had calculated that figure, taking into account all grades of coal.Assocham also pointed out that the government-suggested penalty was for retention of the 40 operational blocks and not for cancellation. It further suggested that the government could file for a review of the order.
The auction process should accord the right of first refusal to the existing allocates, who have end-use plants which are either operational or are going to become so soon, Assocham said.

China to watch Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung visit closely
Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung will arrive in India on Monday for a two-day visit, and the bilateral agenda will be seen as another strong assertion of India’s interests in the South China Sea. China will be closely watching the visit.
The Hindu has learnt that India and Vietnam will sign three agreements, one an MoU on prospecting by OVL (ONGC Videsh Ltd.) in two more fields in the South China Sea. Discussions will be held on supplying naval vessels to Vietnam. Both issues had seen statements of concern from Beijing in the past. However, officials confirmed that the current blocks under discussion to be signed during this visit, part of a batch of five offered by Vietnam in November, are in Vietnamese territorial waters, and not disputed.
The agreements, which will include oil exploration, economic and cultural cooperation, will be signed after meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Nguyen in Delhi on Tuesday.
During President Pranab Mukherjee’s visit to Vietnam last month, India signed a defence agreement extending a $100-million line of credit to the country. The agreement, which came just ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India, sparked off a Foreign Ministry statement in Beijing that China would not “support any agreement” that dealt with any “waters administered by China, or is not approved by China.”
According to a source, Mr. Nguyen and his delegation will discuss placing orders for offshore patrol vehicles at Indian shipyards using the $100-million line of credit.
India has been boosting Vietnamese naval capabilities in the contentious waters.

January 24, 1929, Muzaffarpur: Beloved Bapu — And now today I have your long Monday letter! How spoiled I am!!
October 27, 1928, Sevashram, Benares: But after all, my beloved Bapu knows everything that is in my head — he knows even better then I know myself!
April 7, 1933, Sabarmati Central Prison, Ahmedabad: “I hear you have got a telescope now-a-days! I once looked at the stars and planets through a very small one of my uncle’s & even that was a wonderful sight. Every night as I look at the starts I think how you, too, must be looking at them from Yervada — and I feel, in my mind’s fancy as if I saw you in the reflection of their light.”
These are excerpts from ‘Beloved Bapu: The Gandhi-Mirabehn Correspondence’, a book by Tridip Suhrud and Thomas Weber that claims to bring out for the first time letters between Gandhi and Madeline Slade or Mira, the daughter of a British admiral who became the Mahatma’s disciple.
The book, on this companionship of 23 years, says on the flap, “Mira and Gandhi shared a connection that was as close and loving as it was troubled. She was a woman of tremendous industry and drive, a quality that Gandhi grasped and admired greatly. However, he was also deeply ambivalent about the obsessive nature of her love — indeed, her infatuation — chastising her sharply for her “idolatry” on the one hand, and apologising for his harshness and keeping her close on the other.”
Suhrud is director, Sabarmati Memorial Trust and a Sahitya Akademi winner who is known as a new age “authority” on Gandhian studies. Weber is an Australia-based author who teaches political science and has written several books on Gandhi.
The letters from Gandhi published in the book are already in public domain while those from Mira are being revealed for the first time; they are under the custody of Sabarmati Ashram.
Most of the letters are a mundane detailing of their daily life — from their trips to a number of places and even the problems that this causes to their diet, some inducing constipation — and yet the book reveals some intimate moments, especially the “unfulfilled” wish of Mira who had longed for a “life in the Himalaya with her dearest Bapu”.
In one letter, Gandhi tells Mira that he prefers to write “love letters” on Mondays, which Mira awaits impatiently.
There are even some Hindi lessons for Mira. “The negative participle should always go with the verb, when the verb is to be negative and when the subject has to be qualified by a long phrase, the qualifying phrase should precede the subject,” Gandhi writes from Bangalore on July 17, 1927.
In a chapter in the book titled, “A Catch-22 relationship” the editors note: “Some may argue that there could have been some element of latent or repressed sexuality involved. Certainly some of his letters to Mira do sound like love letters as hers to him undoubtedly were.”
The letters of Mira are more revealing than continued…

Indian mkt to give 20% returns in 1 year; buy banks: JP Morgan08:00 am
In an interview to CNBC-TV18 Adrian Mowat, Chief Asian & Emerging Equity Strategist, JPMorgan shared his views and outlook on the global equity markets.
He said the key focus of the markets will be on the US Federal Reserve meeting this week, where the Fed might announce a closure of QE3. Mowat expects Fed to maintain low interest rates for a considerable period of time. “We will watch for words “considerable time” from the Fed regarding rate moves,” he added.
Speaking about emerging markets, he said JPMorgan is looking to pump more funds into India . The research firm has downgraded Brazil to neutral and recommends moving money from Brazil to markets like India. He expects 20 percent returns from the Indian equity market in next 12 months.
Further he is betting on Indian banks and sees an attractive environment for interest rate-sensitive sectors. He prefers investing in cyclicals like autos and building materials.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Adrian Mowat’s interview with CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy.
Sonia: What is the expectation from the Fed reserve meeting this time?
A: There are two key things that we are expecting. The first is that they will finish Qe3, so the final sort of USD 15 billion of asset purchases will be completed and that they won’t continue.
There was some confusion around that with the St Louis president Mr Bullard suggesting that maybe they should continue it but we don’t see any other support within the federal open market committee for them doing that particularly as the macro economic data was basically tracking what they are expecting.
The other key item to look out for is the wording with regard to interest rates and we still expect them to maintain zero interest rates for a considerable period of time so that language will be seen as important for the market.
Latha: So you would expect that the bond purchase will be stopped in this policy statement. What will be the nuances that you will watch out for in terms of the wording?
A: The wording is whether they continue to use considerable time when describing keeping interest rates low. Remember that the start of the weakness in markets that we saw in early September was running into the federal open market committee meeting where the market was speculating that they might remove that phrase. That initially caused the markets to be concerned, the dollar appreciation to accelerate and then as the month moved on we seemed to start to worry about other things such as European growth, a falling oil price being evidenced of weak growth rather than just plentiful supply. So I don’t know whether we are doing a sort of full circle here from the meetings six weeks ago. But my suspicion is that we will look at what is the Fed’s say and we will decide not much is changing and probably we have got very low interest rates for a very long period of time.
Latha: You would not expect new phrases or concerns to make their presence. For instance Stanley Fischer referring to the strength of the dollar specially. Anything like that would make its presence felt in the Fed’s language or statement?
A: Well if it does then that would be market positive. What Fischer was referring to was potential external weakness due to dollar strength and also weak European economy and that would argue for a delay in the increase in interest rates relative to not having those negative external conditions.
Sonia: What is your view on the Indian market now because in the last couple of weeks we have seen a spate of tough reforms undertaken by the government, whether it was diesel deregulation, gas price hike? Would you add more money into the Indian markets now?
A: Yes, we would and today we had the results of the Brazilian presidential election. We had been hoping for a more constructive policy environment in Brazil. That is not going to come through we believe. So we have downgraded Brazil from an overweight to a neutral and we would advocate people taking their capital and investing in the countries that big beneficiaries of the decline in oil price.
So the countries we particular highlight would be India, Indonesia and Thailand within the Asian region add to that India getting a benefit from inflation through a more productive way of dealing with the agricultural sector, I can see agriculture inflation coming down quite a lot in India plus we have got a full momentum that the investors were getting a little bit cynical prior to Prime Minister Modi’s return from his foreign trips.
Latha: Yet we have seen Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) flows almost plateuing, and even some days of large sales in October itself. Do you see this phase playing itself out and more money flowing in in November?
A: Yes, it is always very important to put Indian flows into context to the broader emerging market flows. We have seen an increase in volatility in both bond markets, equity markets and currency markets. when that occurs people tend to sell risk assets including emerging market equities and we have seen strong outflows from emerging markets mutual fund and ETFs and India has actually done relatively well against that quite powerful negative tide.
Sonia: Since you have recommended putting in more money into the Indian markets what would the sectoral preference be now?
A: We have seen an outperformance in the last couple of months of the external sectors such as IT and pharma. So a more defensive bias to our performance. With what is happening with reduction in inflation gives you a more attractive environment for interest rates and cyclical stocks. So we are pushing the banks and we continue to advice the investors to look at some of the cyclical names particularly those that have pulled back from the peaks that they reached a few months ago.
Latha: Barring one most of the big IT boys actually underperformed the market expectation. Do we see you actively take your money out of IT and putting money into the sectors you just spoke about the cyclicals?
A: There is a context here. For me in a global emerging market portfolio the Indian IT names still look very attractive but if I was running dedicated Indian money then yes, absolutely we would be making a sector shift out of pharma and IT into some of the more cyclical names. Our preference would be near cyclicals like the banks but we would also be looking at the consumer names. You had a session on two wheelers prior to me speaking, also the auto companies. You may also want to look at some of the building material names as we move into a year where we would expect the Indian economy to be picking up pace.
Sonia: So what kind of returns do you think this market can deliver now up until the Budget. We have already put in about 27 percent since the start of the year but since you are recommending more investments into India do you think we could replicate that return in the next 6-12 months?
A: You could get 20 percent plus returns out of the Indian market. That would certainly be consistent with our broader emerging market call and the fact that we are overweight India.
Latha: The other big trend that has been pushing up Indian markets has been the kindness in the price of crude. We have seen some dramatic falls there, what is the in house view at JP Morgan. Do you expect it to continue to remain soft for the better part of 2015 and how will that determine your stock selection as well as country allocation?
A: We would look for crude to basically be tracking the forward curve. So we don’t see further weakness, maybe slight drift higher but it is still a very advantageous environment for India and many other emerging economies as it is for the developed world consumer. So this is a very important dividend coming through. There is a potential downside risk to crude. If you look at the magnitude of the increase of US production over the last seven years it is quite substantial. That increase in production is equivalent to most Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) producers. People are underestimating just how important that has been.
We are also seeing a lot of technology changes at work which is in particular making vehicle fleets a lot more efficient. So we are broadly constructive in the idea that oil can stay at these levels and perhaps there is a little bit of downside risk.
Sonia: You did mention a 20 percent growth that you are expecting on the index but do you get a sense that midcaps could outperform because we have seen a huge outperformance from midcaps since the start of the year?
A: I was fine stating whether midcaps can outperform. It is a difficult one and it rather depends on sector composition within the countries of the midcaps. There are going to be risk on attitudes in India which tends to favour small and midcaps if they are trading at discounts but also give you the added risk of less liquidity. So I am very open minded to buying these but they need to be in the right sectors and they need to have the right earnings provisions.

Brent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecastBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecast
Reuters
Tweet
Reuters Pump Jacks are seen at sunrise near Bakersfield, California. Goldman’s projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank’s oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market’s long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Tokyo, Oct 27:  
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecast for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman’s projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank’s oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market’s long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman’s forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
“The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess,’’ he said.
“It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it’s a bargain now.’’
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: “The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts ... I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman.’’
Higher supplies
The 12-member OPEC meets on November 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far, only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals that it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Dabur falls as reports name ex-Director in black money list
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 03.38PM IST
(It plunged 9 per cent intraday…)

The stock ended the day on the BSE at Rs 208.00; down 3.61 per cent.
However, Dabur India has defended Burman by issuing a statement the Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels.
"We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," a Dabur spokesperson said.

End of QE3 has D-Street nervous; but  bull run to last for 20 yearsIndian markets get cold feet ahead of crucial 2-day FOMC meet
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 03.35PM IST
(The US Federal Reserve will…)
NEW DELHI: Most of the Asian markets, including India, were down on Monday, as investors await the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting this week.
The Sensex closed the day at 26,752.90; down 98.15 points. The Nifty ended the day at 7,991.70; down 22.85 points.
The US Federal Reserve Bank, that will hold its meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to wrap up the Fed's long-running bond purchasing program, known as quantitative easing or QE, this month. Also, global investors will watch out for comments on the direction of interest rates.
Since last December, the US Central Bank has been gradually scaling back its monthly bond purchases, which now stand at $15 billion per month.
If the US Fed indicates hiking rates sooner than expected, then it may trigger some bit of sell-off in emerging markets, including India, and may cap further gains, say experts. However, the broader trend still remains on the upside.
So long as Brazil has negative turn of events as far as election is concerned, experts say it is positive for India, as allocation of funds is slowly moving from Brazil to India.
"Even though global cues are in favour for India, but you have to also consider the fact that there is certain amount of nervousness - US FED meeting which starts tomorrow and most probably, they are going to announce some interest rate policy which the market will wait with bated breath," said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, President, Destimoney Securities Pvt Ltd.
"The European banks' stress test, which has failed 25 banks, is a matter of concern. So, there is certain amount of nervousness in the global markets and investors are in a bit of cautious mode," he added.
Bandyopadhyay is of the view that things definitely look positive for India and "I would not be surprised if at some stage the market picks up and gathers momentum once again."
The Indian markets, which started on a high note, pared most of the intraday gains and was trading flat in trade on Monday. The S&P BSE Sensex, which rallied as much as 144 points in trade pared most of its gains and was trading flat.
At 01:20 pm, Asian shares were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index was trading 0.6 per cent higher at 15,388 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.68 per cent lower at 23,143.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.3 per cent higher at 1,931 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.51 per cent lower at 2,290.
Manish Singh, Strategist & Head of Investments at Crossbridge Capital, said that he is not expecting a major surprise when it comes to the FOMC. "I know that Bullard of St. Louis FED said that there could be a case for FED stopping the QE. That could cause panic in the market," he added.
Singh is of the view that India cannot be immune to what is happening in the US and Europe, and investors in India should always remember that.
However, India is again a macro story, because you are in an emerging market and are still dependent on exports more than domestic consumption, added Singh.
Experts feel that the bull market in India still remains intact and investors with a long-term horizon should not worry too much and keep adding quality stocks on every fall.
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprise, is of the view that the bull run will last for the next two decades, but of course there will be major corrections.
A normal correction in India can happen anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent, say experts. A look at the bull market of 2003 to 2007 shows that we had a deep correction in 2004 and then another correction in 2006.
"All these corrections, which lasted for a quarter or two, were of the order of 10 to 20 per cent. We have not seen anything like that so far. But can you rule it out?" said Hiren Ved, Director & CIO, Alchemy Capital Management.
Mehraboon Irani, Principal & Head- Pvt Client Group Business, Nirmal Bang Securities is of the view that the global problems have still not gone away, "but this is just to state that I remain a bull."
"I feel the markets will go up and I feel we are in for a great time over the next few years. We could be 10% to 12% higher on the Nifty and when the Nifty moves up by 10-12%, you can obviously expect many stocks to move out 25, 30, 40, 60% also from here," he added.

May not meet FY15 growth guidance: VST Tillers Tractors01:30 pm
The lack of availability of subsidies in states like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have hit the power tiller sales for VST Tillers Tractors .
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, BCS Iyengar, director, VST Tillers Tractors says the company may not meet its FY15 growth as despite demand sales haven’t been happening due to lack of subsidies.
However, tractor sales have balanced the losses and the company is now at par with its last year sales figures.
Below is the verbatim transcript of BCS Iyengar’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Reema Tendulkar
Ekta: We do understand that the company has said that they may not be able to achieve their targeted growth for the year. Can you just give us a sense on why and any new targets that you will be working with?
A: Our products are mainly to only power tiller which is about 60 percent of our market and another 30 percent is contributed by our tractor. I am talking of only power tiller where our projection has been affected very much largely because of the delay in the release of subsidy or non-availability of subsidy in many of the states particularly key states like Orissa and Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where it has recently gone through the division of state administrative factor. So this delay in non-availability of the subsidy power tiller has definitely affected the demand for our power tillers. For half year ending we will be selling 10 percent less than the previous year.
Reema: What is the amount of subsidy that is still pending?
A: It is not pending, it is the release of the subsidy, schemes for the current year has not been made available in key states like Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh. Because of that although there is demand, it is not being able to materialise into sales. Demand is there but the entire market is dependent on subsidy.
Reema: When are you expected to get the subsidy support?
A: It depends from state to state. Orissa there is a stalemate because they have already exhausted the funds for the last year so probably things may not move for another two months. Andhra Pradesh it is likely that it will materialise next month.
Ekta: Do you think your tractor sales could compensate enough for the loss that you have seen?
A: So far it is compensated to the extent of balancing the loss of sale on power tillers. We are almost on par with last year’s figures as far as the sales are concerned. So the tractor will continue to fair better than the power tillers.
Ekta: Do you think that you can maintain at least your FY15 revenue as well as profit guidance whatever the internal estimate is based on the fact that the tractors could compensate it?
A: That is exactly what we are trying to do.
Reema: What is the internal assessment, what the sales growth will be for the company in FY15 and also if you could break it up in terms of power tillers as well as tractors?
A: Very difficult to say as of now because these are all very key states like Orissa which is a major market for power tiller. It is too early to say but in worst scenario we should be in a position to almost match the quantity what we sold last year.
Ekta: You haven’t seen any impact of the delayed monsoon on your tractor sales?
A: No probably the demand for power tiller is more guided by the availability of subsidy rather than the monsoon fluctuations. Infact irrespective of the season the demand for power tiller totally depends on the availability of subsidy because it is more than 30-40 percent of the price of the power tiller.
VST Tillers stock price
On December 05, 2014, VST Tillers Tractors closed at Rs 1390.00, down Rs 6, or 0.43 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1998.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 600.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 98.26 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 14.15. The latest book value of the company is Rs 361.31 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 3.85.

Gold prices fell by Rs 350 to Rs 27,450 per ten gram in the national capital on Monday, following a long weekend and ending of festive season with demand drying up amidst a weak global trend.
Silver also eased by Rs 35 to Rs 38,200 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said fall in demand from jewellers and retailers due to end of festive season and a weak global trend where gold retreated from a six-week high as investors expected the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying programme this week, eroding safe-haven demand, mainly pulled down precious metal prices here.
Markets remained closed on October 24 and 25 on account of Vishwakarma Day and Bhai Dooj, respectively. Gold in Singapore, which normally set price trend on the domestic front, lost 0.3 per cent to $1,227.51 an ounce.

Three die  31 fall ill after eating prasadBy: Press Trust of India | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:16 pm
Three persons died and 31 others fell ill after consuming ‘prasad’ at a religious event in Chhattisgarh’s Balodabazar-Bhatapara district, police said on Monday.
As per eye witnesses, people started feeling uneasy and some of them fainted after eating the ‘prasad’ (consisting of puris and kheer) at the programme held in Boda village under Bhilaigarh police station limits on Sunday night, Balodabazar-Bhatapara Collector Rajesh Sukumar Toppo said.
They were rushed to a local hospital where three villagers were declared brought dead, Toppo said. The deceased have been identified as Kartik Ram Kewat (50), Rameshwar Kewat (45) and Gorelal Gond (38), he said.
Of the sick, 27 were referred to CIMS (Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Science) hospital in Bilaspur while four others were shifted to a hospital in Raipur after being provided primary treatment at a local hospital in Bhilaigarh, he said.
A case has been registered in this connection and matter is under investigation, the Collector said.
The Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Balodabazar has also been directed to probe the incident and register cases against those found guilty, he added.
Chief Minister Raman Singh has announced a compensation of Rs one lakh each to the kin of the deceased.

Telcom Companies May Raise Tariffs to Pay for Spectrum Costs: Industry BodyNew Delhi: Industry body COAI has said mobile tariffs may go up soon as telecom operators are expected to pass on to customers the burden of spectrum cost they will incur in the upcoming auction.
The auction of airwaves is likely to be conducted in February next year.
"Definitely there will be an upward pressure on tariffs as the debt burden of telecom players will increase post auctions, they have to pass on the cost to customers," COAI director general Rajan S Mathews told PTI.
He said operators have to pay around Rs 40,000 crore for the spectrum even if the airwaves would be sold at reserve price in 900MHz and 1800 MHz bands.
"From where the money will come? Banks are also unwilling to lend to telecom operators due to high debt burden. Also the telcos have to spend on network infrastructure. So, after paying such huge amount for spectrum only, they have to pass the burden to customers," Mr Mathews said.
Telecom sector regulator TRAI had suggested a 10 per cent higher base price for the next round of spectrum auction in the 1800 Mhz band.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had recommended a price of Rs 2,138 crore per Mhz for the 1800 Mhz band and Rs 3,004 crore per Mhz for the premium 900 Mhz band.
The spectrum auction will be conducted for radiowaves in 900 Mhz held by existing telecom operators Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications through their licences that are expiring in 2015-16.
In the 900 Mhz band, about 184 Mhz of spectrum is likely to be auctioned. In 1800 Mhz, government has proposed to auction 104 Mhz of spectrum which included spectrum held by licences that are expiring in 2015-16 and unsold airwaves in February auction.
Telecom operators have been cutting back on freebies and discounted minutes to maintain profitability. Analysts say this trend may continue as they have to pay for the fresh spectrum purchases.
After the last auction held in February this year, Vodafone India CEO Marten Pieters had said the telecom industry in India has reached a point where the tariffs need to increase every year to sustain itself.
The February 2014 auctions fetched about Rs 62,162 crore.

Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, "It is still a uptrend, now that uptrend may or may not work, that is for the markets to say but within this uptrend financials have done rather well today, surprisingly well. Bank of Baroda is one of the better PSU banks. Almost all PSU banks are giving signs of building a base and being willing to breakout.

Once it does so decisively if there is a rally that could take it all the way to Rs 300. So it is only a day trade, not only a swing trade it could also become a positional trade. You start modestly with a tight stop. If it goes in your favour, continue with the trade.”
“One may buy BHEL . It is breaking about from a very large congestion trading zone today. So, today’s breakout in spite of the fact that it is 4 percent higher, it is worth buying into. Usually we say wait for a correction but there maybe no correction here. So, BHEL is the third in the list; all for buying,” he said.

Rajam Krishnan: A Relentless RaconteurTamil literature
I think a writer dies when he/she stops writing. The common phenomenon of death does not apply to them. Rajam Krishnan, (1925-2014) once prolific and a writer with a mission and purpose passed away recently at the Ramachandra Medical College.
Rajam Krishnan’s life once again is a testimony to how literature can be created, irrespective of educational or professional qualifications. Born in a conservative Brahmin family near Tiruchi, she got married at a very young age to Krishnan and started writing at the age of 16.
Her first story ‘Oosiyum Unarvum’ (Needle and Sense) won an international award for the Tamil short story in 1952. It was given by the New York Herald Tribune. In 1953, her novel ‘Pen Kural’ (Voice of the Woman) was the recipient of the Kalaimagal Narayanaswami Iyer novel. In 1958, she won the Ananda Vikatan novel prize for her ‘Malargal.’ The Sahitya Academy award was given to her novel ‘Verukku Neer.’
These apart, she conquered the writing world with several other awards such as the Soviet Land Nehru Prize, Ilaykkiya Sinthanai, Bharatiya Basha Parishad, Tamil Nadu Government award, Thiru.Vi.Ka prize, Saraswati Puraskar, and Akshara Award to name a few. She had also written a host of short stories.
When I first read her novel ‘Malargal’ (Flowers) as a nine-year old boy, I could not understand much of its importance or layers. It was the story of a struggling, mentally disturbed teenage girl who had to find a life for herself. But, when I read the same novel after several years, seeing life and its vagaries, I could understand the pains and pangs of Chithra, the protagonist. The psychological impact on a orphaned young girl who yearns for love and affection was effectively portrayed in the novel, especially in a chapter titled, ‘Iruttarai Payir’ (sapling in the dark room). I remember to have cried after reading it.
Rajam Krishanan’s novel later moved on to a different plane; she chose a topic or subject, visit the place, meet the people and then put them in a novel. Her ‘Mullum Malarnthathu’ (The Blooms of Thorn) centred on the rehabilitation of a dacoit for which she visited the places and forests in Madhya Pradesh and met many. ‘Karippu Manigal’ (Salty Pearls) depicted the lives of people working in the salt pans. ‘Setril Manithargal’ (People of Slush) narrated the trials of farmers. She had done extensive research on female foeticide and written the novel ‘Mannagatthu Poonthuligal’ in the most touching manner.
Most of her later year writings revealed an inclination to communism and feminism and a mind strongly against the changing styles of modernity and living styles. ‘Alaigal,’ a novella on child psychology, showed the turbulent mind of a young girl, who did not have parents and hence lived under the care of others. ‘Verukku Neer’ showed how the Gandhian ideals were crushed under the materialistic world even in the 1970. ‘Valikkaram’ was a love story expertly woven in the backdrop of Goa liberation struggle; the spill over was found in another novel, ‘Puyalin Maiyam’(The Eye of the Storm). ‘Koottukkunjugal’ dealt with child labour rampant in Sivakasi and ‘Idibadugal’ showed the changing values in our lives. She also authored two biographies - one on Dr Rangachari and another on Maniyammai.
Since Krishnan was an electrical engineer and his job involved transfers to different places, Rajam’s stories and novels depict vividly the lives in Ooty, Goa, and Chennai. ‘Kurinji Then’, is a beautiful novel on Padugas of Nilgiris spanning two generations. One cannot but feel moved while reading the last chapter. The only foreign land she visited was Russia and that was also figured in her novel ‘Annaiyar Bhoomi’ (Land of Mothers).
She did not change her views and writing style with the fast changing times. Her Tamil in later days became very chaste and tough and she preferred to use complex sentences and phrases. This is a rare phenomena and in a way her strength as well. Personal problems took away her writing skills in the last phase of her life.
She was a great conversationalist and my personal experiences with her as a fan were very cordial and rewarding.
Those who have read Tamil books will find that her style and approach in the initial years and in the later stages will be different and yet underscoring the concept of feminism and the lofty ideals of life.
“My first pen name was Lekhini,” she told me once; she laughed and added: “Even 'Rajam Krishnan’ is not my real name.” I didn’t ask her what her real name was. What is after all in a name when your writings are immortal and speak a lot about you? But at this moment I wonder - what indeed was her real name?

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing business rankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:18 pm
The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Substitute non-essential imports  make in India: PMThe government is concerned by the surge in imports from China that has hit some of the domestic industries.
Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: October 25, 2014 1:05 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Union ministries to discourage “inessential imports” and leverage the country’s manufacturing skills in substituting them. Towards this end, the Union ministries are required to furnish status reports every quarter and also brief the Prime Minister.
A senior government official said that during a meeting with secretaries in the last week of September, Modi said that imports should be appraised on a regular basis and a significant part of it should be reduced, recognising India’s own capacity to manufacture these products. “Modi’s logic for pruning imports is in line with his ‘Make in India’ programme,” the official said.
“Modi has told half-a-dozen ministries to review the imports under their respective jurisdiction with a view to rationalise inessential imports within the premise of India’s international commitments under the World Trade Organization, while making all-out efforts to strengthen the nation’s capacity to produce such products domestically,” the official added. It is learnt that some of the ministries are steel, coal, petroleum, agriculture, telecom and IT. The concerned ministries will have to institutionalise a mechanism within their domain for regular review of imports to ensure that “trade deficit is not allowed to increase irrationally,” the official cited the Prime Minister as instructing these ministries.
“Commerce secretary Rajeev Kher has written to the concerned ministries on October 1 to depute a joint secretary level officer to coordinate with his ministry in this connection,” the official said. The government is concerned about the surge in imports from China that has hit some of the domestic industries hard.
The ministry of communications has already launched the ‘Digital India’ programme which includes rationalisation of tariff structure for LCD and LED TV panels and increasing the basic customs duty on telecom equipment.
Ministries dealing with metals and commodities have consistently flagged the growing imports from China that are hurting local industry.
The steel ministry has raised concerns over the burgeoning steel imports from China that has during the second quarter of FY15 exceeded “the historic (quarterly) high” of 90 million tonnes and has also demanded doubling import duty on value-added steel products.
As for minerals like coal and iron ore, legal and regulatory issues have turned India into a net importer of the two crucial minerals.

In Dantewada  Centre opens up another hill for iron ore miningRichest in the country, the site has one-third of NMDC’s total iron reserves.
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: October 25, 2014 1:10 am
The Union government has given forest clearance, which was pending for years, to India’s biggest public sector iron ore site in Bailadila hills of southern Chhattisgarh.
Situated in the Maoist-dominated forests of Dantewada district, the site, named Tenement Number 13, contains proven iron ore reserves of 319.6 MT.
Spread across just 317 hectares, the rich tenement holds nearly one-third of the total 995 MT proved iron ore reserves with public sector iron ore miner NMDC across the country. It has a production target of 10 MTPA (million tonnes per annum), nearly half of the present NMDC’s output of 25 MTPA.
The clearance came after Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh pursued the case with the Centre after the NDA came to power. Singh attributed the clearance to “speedier processes” of the Centre.
“The project will not only provide employment to nearly 2,000 people but will also be a source of raw material to sponge iron industries of Chhattisgarh leading to further employment and development. The Government of India with its speedier processes has been taking all necessary steps for development of Chhattisgarh,” Singh told The Indian Express.
While the forested hills of Bailadila have 14 proven iron ore sites, all containing world-class ore, NMDC has mining lease for only six -Number 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 14 NMZ.
Operations are yet to begin in Number 5 and 13 due to the Maoist threat. The rebels oppose mining activity in the region and have often been able to strike even inside the NMDC complex.
NMDC has been mining on two of the several hills of Bailadila for nearly 50 years and work will now begin on the third hill.
The mining will be undertaken by a joint venture company between NMDC and Chhattisgarh Mining Development Corporation.
“There is a scarcity of iron ore for plants in the state. Fresh areas were needed. It is a welcome step Though the present site is smaller in area, it has very good reserves, among the highest density in the country,” Anurag Diwan, joint director Mineral Administration, Chhattisgarh, said.
The present clearance marks the Stage One forest clearance.
Officials noted that the first stage is often difficult and the second and final clearance should be easily granted within a year. “Mining should begin in two-three years,” said an official. For decades, locals have been demanding that the minerals of Bastar should be mined by the people of the state.

We are well positioned in Indian enterprise market: BlackBerryPDAs and smartphones
Canadian handset maker BlackBerry believes it is “well positioned” for the multi-billion dollar Indian enterprise market armed with smartphones across multiple price points and end-to-end mobility solutions.
“Today, BlackBerry offers an unparalleled global infrastructure, a combination of assets that deliver security at every level and across multiple platforms and an array of value-added services like BBM. We see great opportunities ahead of us, and BlackBerry has an aggressive plan to continue to lead the enterprise mobility market,” BlackBerry Executive Chairman and CEO John Chen told PTI.
The Waterloo-headquartered firm is the clear leader in this market, with the most secure devices, software, servers and network, he added.
On the Indian market, Mr. Chen said: “We are also well positioned to provide our enterprise customers with the best, most secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions."
Mr. Chen said BlackBerry is aggressively targeting enterprise customers in India.
“In India specifically, we are aggressively targeting large, mid-level and small businesses alike. Late last year, we announced the opening of BlackBerry Enterprise Solutions (BES) Centres in Mumbai and Gurgaon as part of our focus on the enterprise mobility market,” he added.
These centres will cater to the needs of the enterprise customers and provide them with a walk-in experience of BlackBerry’s robust enterprise mobility management solutions, including BES10, Mr. Chen said.
“BlackBerry has a strong base in India, and we are continuing to build share in this priority market by listening to our customers and delivering the devices and mobile solutions they want.”
For the quarter ended August 30, 2014, BlackBerry posted revenue of $916 million with about 46 per cent coming from the hardware business, 46 per cent from services and 8 per cent from software and other revenue.

TCS Sees Digital Services as Over $5-billion OpportunityAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
New Delhi: Country's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expects digital platforms like cloud, Big Data and mobility solutions to bring in cumulative revenues of over $5 billion in next few years.
Earlier, the Mumbai-based firm had said that it expects to do $5 billion cumulative business over the next three to four years from the "digital opportunity".
"The way to look at it is that, when I originally said it, I said that over the next three to four years we will do $5 billion cumulative. But now, I think we will do much more than that on a cumulative basis," TCS CEO and managing director N Chandrasekaran told analysts.
The run rate will not touch the $5 billion mark but it will definitely touch a few billion dollars, he added.
He said the opportunity is huge as most of the ADM work that is getting replaced or rationalised is moving into digital.
"Most of the infrastructure contracts come up with outsourcing of infrastructure to maintain the service levels in a managed services model, but with a transformation component to move to cloud infrastructure," he said.
And commoditised applications, when they are transitioned, customers are willing to look at application platforms which are cloud-based, he added.
"So, all these three facts will definitely move things to Digital," he said.
Mr Chandrasekaran, who recently got a five-year extension, said at the announcement of the firm's second quarter results that TCS is contemplating whether to disclose numbers from the digital technologies stream.
For the July-September quarter, the Mumbai-based company posted 13.2 per cent jump in its net profit at Rs 5,244 crore as against Rs 4,653.9 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue jumped 13.5 per cent to Rs 23,816 crore in the second quarter ended September 30 as compared to Rs 20,977 crore in the corresponding period of last year.
However, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, net profit was down by 5.8 per cent, but revenue grew 7.7 per cent.

Tata Motors Raises $750 Million in Forex Bond Sale; Gets Better Pricing
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 26, 2014 18:44 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: The country's largest auto maker Tata Motors has raised $750 million from Asian and European investors by selling a dual tranche bond issue which got an over subscription of six times at $4.5 billion.
The company has priced the 5.5-year benchmark senior unsecured notes of $500 million at 4.625 per cent, while the coupon for the 10-year $250 million notes is fixed at 5.750 per cent/annum.
It had sold $300 million worth bonds in April at a coupon of 5.53 per cent for a five-year money, indicating better operating environment for the company.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to refinance external commercial borrowings, capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes, the company said in a statement.
"We are pleased to have completed this transaction successfully and we thank the investors for demonstrating their confidence in us," said Vijay Somaiya, vice-president for finance and head of treasury & investor relations at Tata Motors.
Global rating agency Standard & Poors has assigned BB long-term issue rating to the issue while highlighting Tata Motors' increased dependence on JLR, while rival Moody's has assigned Ba2 to the notes with a stable outlook.
"The ratings on Tata Motors reflect the company's small size and narrow product suite compared with many global peers', and its likely negative free operating cash flows because of high capital expenditure. JLR's established and improving market position in the global premium automotive segment and its strong operating performance temper these weaknesses," S&P said.
S&P further said it believes that the good operating performance of JLR, if sustained, can improve its consolidated financial strength.
Moody's also based the ratings to the continuing good show by its British arm JLR which has contributed over 90 per cent of group operating profit in FY14. "The phenomenal success of JLR continues to buy time for Tata Motors' weak domestic operations to turn around, and these are now showing some improvement.".
The stable outlook on the bond reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core domestic business of the company to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating, Moody's said.
However, Moody's added that the current fiscal is critical as JLR's sales slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations.
Tata Motors had a consolidated revenue of Rs 2,32,834 crore or $38.9 billion in 2013-14. Through subsidiaries and associate companies, it operates in Britain, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia

Focus on flagship schemes; Anant Geete leads Sena team
Ahead of the crucial winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the NDA’s close to 400-odd MPs on Sunday evening that he expected them to take his government’s “pro-poor” initiatives pro-actively to the people, as these were not the exclusive property of some political parties/governments (a snide reference to the predecessor UPA dispensation). He also said he expected them to conduct themselves in a “righteous” manner, never indulging in any activity that may bring them into disrepute.
Mr Modi’s pointed message to his flock was delivered over high tea — attended, interestingly enough by the entire Shiv Sena contingent — on the lawns of 7 Race Course Road. It was the first such gathering of NDA MPs, but Mr Modi promised that this would become a regular feature.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, playing master of ceremonies, urged MPs to contribute to enhancing the quality of debates in Parliament, explained the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s objectives, and announced that Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 would be celebrated annually as Ekta Diwas, when all government servants will take the unity pledge. BJP veteran L, K. Advani congratulated party president Amit Shah for the election victories in Maharashtra and Haryana, while presenting him with a shawl.
For two hours, from 4 to 6 pm, the focus was on the importance of all ministers and MPs being fully briefed on key programmes so that, as a government source put it, “elected representatives are empowered to become effective political communicators” both inside and outside Parliament.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed MPs on the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana, the recent ordinance on coal and Union Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari on the Adarsh Gram Yojana; among other presentations.

Brazil s Rousseff wins second termRIO DE JANEIRO, October 27, 2014

Brazil's Rousseff wins second term
AP
election
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Ms. Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and centre-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Ms. Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Ms. Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Ms. Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programmes that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Ms. Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender’s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
Ms. Rousseff and Neves fought bitterly to convince voters that they can deliver on both growth and social advances. This year’s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Neves had hammered at Ms. Rousseff over a widening kickback scandal Petrobras, with an informant telling investigators that the Workers’ Party directly benefited from the scheme.
Ms. Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
“We’ve worked so hard to better the lives of the people, and we won’t let anything in this world, not even in this crisis or all the pessimism, take away what they’ve conquered,” Ms. Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil’s biggest city of Sao Paulo, thousands of Workers’ Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Ms. Rousseff’s campaign jingles.
“I’m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,” said Liliane Viana, a 56-year-old retired federal government worker. “I was afraid we were going to move backward. Now I am extremely excited.”
Neves was a two-term governor in Minas Gerais state who left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating. He surged at the end of the presidential race to score a surprise second—place position and force a runoff vote against Ms. Rousseff.
Speaking from his hometown of Belo Horizonte, he thanked the “more than 50 million Brazilians” who voted for him.
“I will be eternally grateful to each and every one of you who allowed me to dream again of the construction of a new project,” he said. “I fought the good fight. I fulfilled my mission and I kept the faith.”

Vietnam PM Dung begins two-day India visitNarendra Modi
(Prime Minister Dung is…)
NEW DELHI: Highlighting the growing closeness in their ties and the strategic nature of their relationship, Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung begins his two-day state visit to India on Monday, the third high-level exchange between the two countries in two months.
Prime Minister Dung, who begins his India visit by touching down at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, is accompanied by a 50-member business delegation with economic engagement being top on the agenda of bilateral talks.
Dung, who begins his official engagements in India on Tuesday, will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House which would be followed by signing of agreements. The agreements are likely to include one on sister city ties between Ho Chi Minh City and Mumbai, and another one on Bank of India set to open its first branch in Ho Chi Minh City.
His visit comes just a month after that of President Pranab Mukherjee to Vietnam, during which the two sides had inked seven pacts, including between ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam) for further cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector. PetroVietnam has offered new blocks to OVL for oil and gas exploration and production, which are under consideration.
Both sides had also inked $100 million Line of Credit defence MoU for procurement of defence equipment from India during the visit. During Dung's visit the sale of Brahmos supersonic cruise missiles, which are co-developed with Russia, to Vietnam are likely to be discussed. India had last year offered four patrol vessels to Vietnam as part of the LoC, which is yet to be finalized.
The Vietnamese visit comes even as both countries are set to launch daily direct flights, with Jet Airways to start flights on Nov 5 between Mumbai, Delhi and Ho Chi Minh city, while Vietnam Airlines will start flights between Hanoi and New Delhi in 2015 under a code share agreement with Jet Airways. The direct flights are expected to give a fillip to economic and tourism ties besides boost people-to-people relations between the two countries.
External Affairs Sushma Swaraj had visited Vietnam at the end of August during which she met the Vietnamese leadership as part of the Modi government's outreach to the region.
During 2013-14, trade between the two countries stood at $8 billion, registering a growth of over 30 per cent over the previous year.
Both sides have identified certain key areas to boost trade, including textiles, chemicals and agro chemicals, machinery, leather and footwear and in finance, tourism and IT.
The visit assumes significance as from 2015 Vietnam will be the country coordinator for India in the ASEAN which will provide greater possibilities for deeper engagement with the regional bloc, the ministry of external affairs said.
Vietnam has tensions with China over the South China Sea and had appealed to India to play a greater role in maintaining maritime safety and security and in settlement of territorial disputes in the disputed South and East China Seas during the visit of Sushma Swaraj to Hanoi.

(The Home Ministry had raised…)
NEW DELHI: The government is working with all stakeholders in resolving the issue regarding use of 'Aadhaar' card as a proof of address for procuring new SIM cards in its proposed online verification system.
The Home Ministry had raised multiple concerns over using UIDAI number as an address proof in the Department of Telecom's (DoT) proposed online verification system, saying the supporting data in Aadhaar may not be authentic or genuine.
"We are working on that issue and I am sure we will be able to resolve it. The Prime Minister has directed us to link the SIM of the mobiles with the unique ID and the idea is that mobile should become a very strong factor of authentication and also a factor for getting information and doing transactions," DeitY Secretary RS Sharma said here.
He said the Department of Telecom is having discussions with all stakeholders and that two meetings have already taken place in this regard.
"DoT secretary is having deliberations and we have already participated in two such meetings to really take this forward," Sharma added.
The Home Ministry had raised concerns over supporting documents submitted by people as proof of identity and proof of address for getting a Aadhaar number, sources had said.
The DoT is working on a concept to use Aadhaar number for online verification of people seeking mobile connections along with existing process of customer verification.
Aadhaar card can be also issued to foreign nationals staying in the country. This had also been questioned by the Home Ministry fearing nationals of neighbouring country could attempt to use it to procure Indian identity documents for infiltration.
The Home Ministry had said that unlike Aadhaar, other acceptable proof of address documents such as passport, driving licence do not have the status of universality and therefore "even higher levels of error in these documents may not translate into comparable volume of security concerns".
The Home Ministry had also raised concern over involvement of foreign vendors by UIDAI for storing data and has suggested audit of data security.

New York Governor outlines policy for Ebola quarantineNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, speaks as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie listens at a news conference. (source: AP)
By: Associated Press | New York | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:21 pm
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has fleshed out guidelines for the mandatory, 21-day quarantining of medical workers returning from West Africa that he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered two days earlier, bringing the state closer in line with federal protocols.
Cuomo detailed the state’s protocols at a nighttime news conference with New York City’s mayor last night after the Obama administration said it expressed concerns to Cuomo and Christie about their states’ mandatory Ebola quarantines. The announcement also comes amid sharp criticism of the treatment of a nurse returning from Sierrra Leone who was forcibly quarantined in a New Jersey hospital isolation unit even though she said had no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola.
Under the outlined New York guidelines, medical professionals who have had contact with Ebola patients will be quarantined at home and receive twice-daily monitoring if they have no symptoms. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials. The state will also pay for any lost compensation, if they are not paid by a volunteer organization.
Cuomo had criticized Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, for not obeying a 21-day voluntary quarantine. But on Sunday, he called the health care workers “heroes” and said his administration would encourage more medical workers to volunteer to fight Ebola.
Meanwhile, Kaci Hickox, the first nurse forcibly quarantined in New Jersey under the state’s new policy, said in a telephone interview with CNN that her isolation at a hospital was “inhumane,” adding: “We have to be very careful about letting politicians make health decisions.”
Saying the federal health guidelines are inadequate, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine program Friday for medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa, either in their homes or in medical facilities, and Illinois soon followed suit. Twenty-one days is the incubation period for Ebola.
Sunday night, Christie also stressed that home confinement would be used for New Jersey residents and others when possible.
“The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home.
Non-residents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey,” said a statement from Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts.

Nilofar is now a severe cyclone  to cross Naliya in Gujarat on FridayVery severe cyclone Nilofar may weaken ahead of landfall
Vinson Kurian

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 27:  
Arabian Sea Cyclone Nilofar is now a very severe cyclone, only one step away from class-topping super cyclone status, an India Met update said this afternoon.
But all available indications suggest that Nilofar will wind down to severe cyclone status due to a combination of adverse factors.
PEAK WINDS
Westerly winds associated with the western disturbance that steers Nilofar towards Naliya in Gujarat would be the primary culprit for the weakening.
Since Nilofar will hitch a ride on the westerly system, it would get directly impacted from the top as opposing winds tear into it.
A second reason is dry air intrusion from around the land – the cyclone would be in close proximity to mainland Pakistan and western India as it runs in.
Third are the cooler waters towards the north Gujarat coast, which caps evaporation and moisture build that is needed to fuel the cyclone system.
YELLOW MESSAGE
The Met located Nilofar to 1,170 km southwest of Naliya (Gujarat) and 1,230 km south-southwest of Karachi (Pakistan) at 1.30 pm.
In a ‘yellow message’ (warning), the Met said that the coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch would receive rainfall at most places from Thursday morning.
Isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also commence along these areas around the same time.
The rainfall intensity would increase gradually with heavy to very heavy fall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls from later in the night.
Squally winds speed reaching 45-to 55 km/hr and gusting to 65 km/hr would commence along and off Gujarat coast from Thursday morning.
SEA CONDITION
They would ramp up to between 100- and 110 km/hr with gusts of 125 km/hr at the time of landfall.
Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be ‘rough’ (13 ft in height) to ‘very rough’ (13- to 20 ft) from Thursday.
It would become ‘very high’ (30- to 46 ft) to ‘phenomenal’ (46 ft) from the afternoon.
Fishermen out at sea along and off Gujarat coast have been advised to return to the coast. The Met also notified suspension of fishing operations.
Coastal hutment dwellers should be moved to safer places. People in the affected areas should keep indoors.

A cornered Shiv Sena made a last-ditch effort to patch up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be part of the new Maharashtra government as its former ally prepared to elect its chief ministerial candidate on Tuesday.

Devendra Fadnavis looks like a clear favourite for the chief minister’s job in the western state which has been gripped by political uncertainty since the BJP emerged as the single largest party but failed to get a clear majority in the assembly election.
The BJP is finalising its team of ministers ahead of the oath-taking ceremony on October 31, but it isn’t clear if the Shiv Sena will join the ministry as the BJP is not willing to accept its demands for key portfolios and an assurance to not carve out a separate state of Vidarbha.
Despite the talks with the Shiv Sena, the BJP has also prepared a plan to run a minority government instead of giving the Sena a considerable share of ministerial berths and important departments.
The first indication of the Shiv Sena softening its stand was an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana saying the party would support the BJP-led government as it has got a mandate.
“We will have to keep our political differences aside and work with the BJP chief minister for the unity of Maharashtra. We have kept ourselves together even in difficult circumstances and it will be better if it remains so,” said the editorial in Saamana, which is regarded as the opinion of Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray.
The BJP has an upper hand in negotiations with future allies because it emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly compared with the Shiv Sena’s 63 seats. The BJP’s strength reduced by one as one its MLAs, Govind Rathod elected from Nanded district, died of heart attack on Sunday.
 It has also been in talks with smaller parties and independents, which could take its tally to around 135.
Wankhede Stadium is being decked up for the oath-taking function, expected to be attended by 30,000-40,000 BJP workers from all corners of the state.

Keen to keep the reform momentum going and get a good amount of legislative business done, the Modi government has planned 22 sittings of Parliament when it opens for a month-long winter session on November 24.
As many as 67 bills — 59 in the Rajya Sabha and eight in the Lok Sabha — are pending. BJP managers were hopeful that at least 30 bills would get Parliament’s nod, sources said.
The long-pending goods and services tax bill may finally be introduced and the government was also expected to seek the passage of three bills related to labour sector reforms.
Anti-corruption legislations, especially the bill on time-bound delivery of public service and amendments to the whistle-blowers bill, are high on the Centre’s list.
The insurance amendment bill that aims to raise the FDI cap in the sector, among other things, is also expected to be passed during the session. The government may also push amendments to the land law to make it industry-friendly. The bill was referred to a select panel when Parliament met for the budget session in July.
On Monday, the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs, chaired by home minister Rajnath Singh, met to recommend session dates to President Pranab Mukherjee.
The government will also need to get bills passed to replace two ordinances, including the one that allowed private steel, power and cement firms to bid for coal mines and enable commercial mining in future.

IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
BSE Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range today after giving up most of their early gains. Sensex rose over 100 points to edge closer to 27,000 mark in early trade while Nifty jumped above 8050, driven by higher Asian markets and positive momentum from energy reforms announced by the government earlier. However, markets faced resistance at higher levels. At 3:15 p.m., the Sensex was down 104 points at 26,746 while Nifty fell to 7,990.
Top 10 Things to Know
Market experts see some consolidation in Indian markets after a five-day rally. Market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin expects Nifty to undergo consolidation after the rally, with foreign inflows to be the key driver. Technical analyst Sarvendra Srivastava sees Nifty pullback from 7,750 levels more or less complete. Nifty faces a resistance at 8030-8050 levels and has support at 7900-7950, he added.
Banking stocks were in limelight today after Finance Minister in a newspaper interview favoured a cut in interest rates to trigger demand in the construction sector. The Bank Nifty rose 0.8 per cent today, also driven by a fall in bond yields which hovered at over-a-year low levels.
Goldman Sachs had earlier slashed its 2015 oil price forecasts, making it the most bearish among major financial institutions, following a near 25 per cent fall in crude prices over the past five months. Lower oil prices will help Reserve Bank of India's efforts to curb inflation.
Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank were up over 2 per cent while Bank of Baroda gained 1.6 per cent. Shares in IndusInd Bank also got a boost after the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved the bank's proposal seeking an increase in foreign investment limit in the bank to 74 per cent.
Defence equipment makers were in focus today with Bharat Electronics and Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering rising nearly 5 per cent. The government has cleared defence projects of nearly Rs 80,000 crore, most of which would be sourced domestically. Capital goods stocks BHEL and L&T also advanced.
HUL shares fell over 2.5 per cent after the FMCG major reported a net profit of Rs 988 crore in the second quarter. It saw an exceptional gain at Rs 48.7 crore during the quarter. Analysts expected HUL to post a profit of Rs 1,000 crore in net profit. However, HUL's volume growth of 5 per cent was in line with expectations.
Wipro extended its decline after falling nearly 1 per cent today. The IT major fell over 3.5 per cent in the previous session after its Q2 earnings missed estimates.
Jindal Steel & Power Ltd fell over 7 per cent on reports of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registering a preliminary enquiry against the company in connection with diversion of forest land for mining between 2007 and 2013.
DLF shares were down more than 9 per cent on Monday after a newly inducted Haryana minister said the BJP government will investigate land deals of the previous Congress government.
Shares in Dabur India fell as much as 9 per cent on Monday after the central government revealed Pradip Burman has allegedly parked untaxed or black money in illicit foreign accounts. Mr Burman is a promoter in Dabur India. Dabur shares made a strong comeback after hitting day's low at Rs. 196.40. Dabur shares were down over 3 per cent in recent trade. A Dabur spokesperson said, "We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable."

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai:
Hindustan Unilever, controlled by consumer goods giant Unilever Plc, warned India's consumer spending will remain weak as the economy sags after its own profit rose 8 per cent on robust sales of soaps and detergents.
Net profit rose to Rs 988 crore for the three months to September 30 from Rs 914 crore a year earlier, Hindustan Unilever said in a statement on Monday. The company is two-thirds owned by its Anglo-Dutch parent, and plays a key role in Unilever's Asia operations.
Hindustan Unilever said fiscal second-quarter sales growth outstripped the broader market, but the profit number was exactly in line with an average of estimates from analysts polled by Reuters. The weak demand forecast helped send the company's shares sharply lower and pointed to future headaches for Unilever, already hit by slowdown in emerging markets which generates more than half its sales.
"We see the market continuing to remain soft. While we are conscious of this near-term concerns, we remain positive on a medium- to long-term outlook of our country's fast-moving consumer goods market," finance chief P.B. Balaji told reporters on a conference call.
Hindustan Unilever shares closed 5.1 per cent lower after the results, its biggest single-day fall since January 2011, with some dealers saying its unit sales volume growth of 5 per cent was below their expectations. The company has been hurt in recent quarters by weaker consumer demand in an economy that grew less than 5 per cent in the past two fiscal years.
Parent Unilever last week reported its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly five years, hit by persistent woes in Europe and the slower performance in emerging markets. It promised new, cheaper products and more cost cuts would help in raise profits.
Hindustan Unilever sales rose about 11 per cent, helped by soaps and detergent sales that grew at a double-digit percentage pace, the company said, along with skincare products.
As of last week, shares in Hindustan Unilever, valued at nearly Rs 27 crore, had risen nearly a third this year, outperforming the Nifty and the consumer goods index.

Centre plans to build rail network on Delhi s Ring RoadCentre plans to build rail network on Delhi's Ring Road

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
In order to decongest the national capital, the Centre today announced plans for a rail network on Delhi’s lifeline Ring Road linking various areas in the city.
“There is a lot of traffic jam in Delhi everyday. We are considering to bring ‘Ring Road Train’, which will help us decongest roads in the national capital,” Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said here.
The Centre also has plans to construct several flyovers, elevated highways and ring roads across the city.
“In the upcoming days, many new flyovers, more ring roads, expansion of Metro lines and elevated highways will come up in Delhi following which congestion will be reduced in the national capital,” Naidu said at a function here.
The Minister said that to suggest necessary measures for these projects, he has constituted a committee led by the Urban Development Secretary.
“This committee will submit its final report within 45 days and thereafter, the Centre and Delhi Government will work on these projects,” he said.
“We are also working on a project which will allow vehicles coming from Haryana and wanting to go to other states to bypass national capital, and such vehicles don’t need to enter the city due to which there will be no congestion in Delhi,” Naidu said.
The Central Government has already set a deadline of three years to complete the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressway, which aims to decongest Delhi roads.
The two expressways — each about 135 km long — were planned in 2006 following a Supreme Court order to form a ring road outside Delhi for channelling non-Delhi bound traffic bypassing the national capital.
Eastern Peripheral Expressway envisages providing signal-free connectivity between Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gautam Budh Nagar (Greater Noida) and Palwal, while the Western Expressway connects Kundli to Palwal via Manesar in Haryana.

Tree plantation in Koraput to compensate for loss in CycloneHudhudPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Koraput (odisha) | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:32 pm
To compensate for the loss of trees in Cyclone Hudhud, Jeypore forest division in Koraput district has decided to take up plantation in over 200 hectares of forest land.
Officials said the thick forest cover of Ramagiri and Boipariguda forest range under the division was lost due to the cyclone which hit the district on October 12.
“Though it is impossible to regain the lost trees as those were decades old, efforts will be made to cover more forest land under plantation. As per a preliminary report prepared by the department the new plantation will be done in over 200 hectares. If more suitable patches are found then it will also be covered under plantation,” said Jeypore divisional forest officer Bijaya Kumar Acharya.
As per the damage report of the forest department at least 1,765 valuable trees comprising sal, teak, eucalyptus and chakunda varieties in the district were uprooted in the cyclone.
“As many as 629 sal and teak trees which were decades old have been uprooted in the Gupteswar forest range. As per preliminary assessment report the loss of trees is around Rs one crore,” Acharya said.
Officials said hundreds of new tress which were two to three years-old had also been uprooted in the cyclone and it will take several years to compensate the loss of green cover in real terms.
“Trees in large numbers belonging to private parties had also been uprooted in the cyclone, but assessment of those trees has not been done,” he said.
However, the most pressing problem now was shortage of staff which is impeding the removal of the fallen trees from the forests while both villagers and timber mafias are targeting the salvaged trees.
“As it will take months together to remove the uprooted trees we have formed mobile squads to keep an eye on them. With limited manpower we are trying to collect the uprooted trees from the forest at the earliest,” Acharya said.

How to save income tax grow your money We all work hard to earn money but the government takes one third of that money as taxes (highest tax bracket). Most of us wonder, what are some of the legitimate ways of saving taxes?
While business owners have multiple avenues to reduce taxes, the options for salaried individuals are different.
Here are a few broad options by which salaried individuals can save taxes.
Save Tax via Interest payments on your Loans - Section 80 E and Section 24B
Education Loan:
Section 80E allows the entire interest paid on education loan as deduction from the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the assessee begins paying interest and seven subsequent years.
Home Loan:
A house, besides being a long-term asset, makes you eligible for significant tax breaks. You can claim deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh for repayment of home loan principal under the overall limit of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Moreover, you can claim an additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 24B for interest payment once you get possession and occupy the house. If you take a joint loan with your spouse, then each of you can claim both these deductions individually, thus optimising your tax savings further.
Save Tax via Investments - Section 80C:
Section 80 C allows for expense incurred under certain heads or investments made to be deducted from the total income. 100% of the amount invested or Rs.1,50,000, whichever is less, is available as deduction from total income. Below mentioned is the list (not exhaustive) of most popular investments u/s 80C:
>> Life insurance premium paid towards life of self, spouse or any child.
>> Contribution towards statutory provident fund, recognized provident fund, approved superannuation fund.
>> Contribution towards Public Provident Fund Scheme.
>> Any sum deposited in a 10 year or 15 year account under the Post Office Savings Bank
>> Subscription to the NSC (VIII Issue)
>> Subscription to units of mutual fund Equity Linked Savings Scheme notified by the central government.
>> Term Deposit (Fixed Deposit) for 5 years or more with Scheduled Bank.
Protect Yourself and Save Tax - Section 80D
Buy a Health Policy:
Premium paid on health insurance policies is allowed as deduction from total income, within the limits specified by section 80D. Deduction is available up to Rs. 15,000 in other cases for insurance of self, spouse and dependent children. Additionally, a deduction for insurance of parents (father or mother or both) is available to the extent of Rs. 20,000 if parents are senior Citizen and Rs. 15,000 in other cases. Therefore, the maximum deduction available under this section is to the extent of Rs. 40,000.
Now you might be wondering, if your employer provides you a medical cover, do you still need a health care policy? Most of us change our employers quite often that may leave us with inadequate medical coverage.  It is a good practice to maintain one health policy even if your employer offers a health plan.
Protect your family and save tax:
Most people buy insurance to save on tax and to get some residual retirement income. Infact, it’s not uncommon to find people with multiple LIC policies. Very few of them have the most essential and basic form of insurance, popularly known as term insurance.
An insurance policy is not meant for you. It’s meant for your loved ones and to provide them with a lump sum of money in case something was to happen to you. Get a term insurance policy if you really care for your family. Premium paid towards Term Insurance Plan qualifies for deduction u/s 80C.
Donate and Save Tax - Section 80G:
Section 80G allows you to claim deduction up to specified limits for contributions made to charitable organisations. There are various donations specified in Sec. 80G are eligible for deduction up to either 100% or 50%. The deduction is available to anyone who donates in the specified categories as defined by Income tax under Sec 80G
The New Pension Scheme - Section 80CCE:
Ask your employer to provide you New Pension Scheme (NPS). Under direct regulatory oversight by government agency (PFRDA) the scheme offers option of extra saving through tax benefit over and above 80C (employer sponsored). The returns are also linked to the market that will help to grow your savings more than return on debt. The employer's contribution up to 10% of basic plus DA is eligible for deduction under Section 80CCE over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit.
Most of us get trapped in insurance policies to save taxes but there are other better ways of saving taxes and growing your wealth. A combination of a health plan, term policy, Mutual Fund (ELSS), PPF and New Pension Scheme contribution will help you save taxes, provide adequate health and life cover and also provide growth to your portfolio.

Obama taking action to push manufacturing... 
October 27, 2014 06:05 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is expanding his push for increased manufacturing in the United States by directing federal money toward new technologies, apprenticeship programs and competitions designed to assist small manufacturers.
The White House is announcing the executive actions Monday as part of the day's focus on manufacturing, which administration officials consider one of the bright spots of the economic recovery.
The measures would:
— Allow the Pentagon, NASA and the Energy and Agriculture departments to collectively spend $300 million to develop advanced materials and new technology for sensors and digital manufacturing.
— Direct $100 million in Labor Department funds for apprenticeship programs aimed at advanced manufacturing.
— Authorize the Commerce Department to spend $150 million over five years in 10 states to help manufacturers adopt and market new technologies.

Agenda of Japan s Abe challenged as scandals mount...and
versions
TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's honeymoon with Japan's voters is fading as scandals and a slowing economic recovery take a toll on his popularity and hinder progress on his policy agenda.
The resignations of two ministers in Abe's newly reshuffled Cabinet and reports that political funds of the replacement trade minister were used in a visit to a sex show bar were just the start.
Those reports got people digging into the riches to be found in publicly available political funding disclosures. They show some lawmakers spending hundreds and often thousands of dollars a night on visits to restaurants and mahjong parlors, while ordinary households are struggling to keep up with rising costs for food, heating and other necessities.
The most recent opinion polls show Abe's approval ratings slipping to around 50 percent. They had mostly been in the 60s since 2013.
The controversies are unwelcome distraction at a time of sharpening divisions within the ruling party over whether Abe should press ahead with a sales tax hike next year that is needed to help fix the tattered finances of the world's third-largest economy.
News of possible election law and political funding violations forced the resignations last week of Abe's justice and trade ministers, both among the five women who had just taken office in the early September Cabinet reshuffle that showcased Abe's commitment to stronger roles for women in leadership.
"It's a serious setback. So much of the Abe Cabinet's shine was due to its aura of invincibility and inevitability," said Michael Cucek, a Tokyo-based analyst and fellow at Temple University Japan.
Troubles over campaign funds and related issues have long contributed to Japan's famous "revolving door" politics. Abe's first term as prime minister, in 2006-2007, ended when he was driven from office by scandals and health problems after just a year.
Abe got a rare second chance when his Liberal Democrats regained power from the Democratic Party in December 2012. Since then, the LDP's coalition with the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito, or Clean Government Party, has established majorities in both houses of the parliament.
This time around, Abe has cultivated a confident, relaxed style of leadership, repeatedly declaring "Japan is back!" while his chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga endeavors to keep their gaffe-prone allies more or less in line.
"Until this crisis it looked pretty certain he was just going to cruise," Cucek said. "Now that politics as usual has returned we could see the same sort of decay that we've seen in the past," he said.
Trade minister Yuko Obuchi, a rising star and daughter of a former prime minister, resigned on Oct. 20 after admitting to discrepancies in reporting of her political funding. Justice Minister Midori Matsushima also quit after the opposition filed a criminal complaint alleging that the distribution of "uchiwa," or hand-held fans, to her supporters violated a ban on gift giving.
Obuchi's successor as trade minister, Yoichi Miyazawa, then drew fire over an 18,230 yen ($170) tab listed in his political funds accounting for an evening's entertainment at a sadism and masochism themed establishment in his home city of Hiroshima. Miyazawa and his staff say he did not visit the club himself, and the money was paid back.
The next flap was over Miyazawa's ownership, as the minister responsible for the power industry, of shares in Tokyo Electric Power Co., whose Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant suffered meltdowns after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Miyazawa said Friday he had put the shares, worth about $2,000, in a trust.
Over the weekend, reports noted that political funds of Taro Aso, a former prime minister who is now finance minister, were used to pay monthly tabs of up to 1.5 million yen ($14,000) to a mahjong parlor in the Roppongi nightclub district.
Opposition questioning over such issues in the parliament is slowing work on the main priorities of the current Diet session: policies to revive languishing rural regions and increase female employment to help compensate for the aging and shrinking of the overall workforce.
"Abe is perceived to have made a mess of the early September reshuffle and is faced longer term with added popular doubt given a timetable of awkward policy decisions," said Stephen Church, an analyst at Societe Generale in Tokyo.
But Abe's strongest asset may be the weakness of the highly splintered opposition. The Democratic Party's rating, which had been hovering around 5 percent, has risen but remains in the single digits in most polls.
Abe appears undecided over whether to press ahead with a 2 percentage point increase to the national sales tax that is needed to offset a public debt that stands at about 250 percent of GDP.
The economy contracted 7.1 percent in April-June after a 3 point increase in the sales tax on April 1.
Instead of delaying the tax hike for the sake of political expediency, Abe will likely go ahead with it as promised before the end of the year but also announce extra economic stimulus, said Masamichi Adachi, an analyst at JPMorgan in Tokyo.
The bigger concern is whether Abe will take unpopular measures to help restore the country's waning competitiveness and ensure sustained growth after two decades of malaise.
Up to now, progress on those tasks has lagged, Adachi said.
"The process is going ahead but still quite slow and not sufficient to overcome the challenges this country is facing," he said.

Post your opinion here
02:00 pm
Kunal Bothra of LKP Securities told CNBC-TV18, "We are looking at a very strong bull market which could last at least for the next 3-5 years. Looking at the kind of texture of the markets also I think it is better to stay with frontend stocks.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) being one of the few frontline stocks, I believe it is a good buy from a long term perspective as well."
"If there is a dip below Rs 400 I think that could be a good entry point. I think Rs 350 is the longer term support for ONGC where it has given the breakout in mid 2014 somewhere. I think above that it has been on a comfortable territory but if there are corrections in the next couple of days or probably in the next week to levels of at least Rs 375-380 I think that would be a very good entry point to average out and probably hold on for the next 2-3 years," he added.

The Indian rupee gained for the third session on Tuesday, surging by another five paise against US dollar to end at over one-week high of 61.31 on sustained selling of the greenback by banks and exporters in view of strong equity market and capital inflows.
The domestic unit resumed higher at 61.26 per dollar as against Monday’s closing level of 61.36 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market.
It hovered in a range of 61.2475 per dollar and 61.3700 per dollar before concluding the day at 61.31 per dollar, a gain of five paise or 0.08 per cent. It has gained 52 paise, or 0.84 per cent, in three days.
Tuesday’s rupee closing is the strongest since 61.1 on October 13.
Exporters and banks preferred to reduce their dollar positions in view of good foreign capital inflows into equity market amid government announcing a slew of reforms.
In New York, the US dollar ended steady on Monday as foreign exchange markets braced for a batch of Chinese economic indicators amid lingering investor worries over signs of a slowdown in Asia’s economic powerhouse and global growth.
Weekend comments from members of the U.S. Federal Reserve also appeared to cement the view that the central bank will not hurry in raising rates.

Shares Of Hazmat-Suit Maker Are Soaringreddit
Shares in a company that makes hazmat suits soared 16 percent on Thursday after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in New York City .
The stock price of Long Island-based Lakeland Industries, which makes various types of protective garb, has more than doubled in the past month amid feverish news coverage of the deadly virus . The stock jumped from less than $7 a share in late September to as high as $29 on October 13, when Ebola panic in the U.S. was particularly high.
Shares have drifted lower since then, but got another boost on Thursday afternoon after the news that Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who recently returned to New York from treating patients in Guinea, had been hospitalized with Ebola symptoms. Later on Thursday he became the fourth person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.
The spike in stock price came after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.
“We’ve been getting a lot of calls in the last 24 hours,” Jordan Darrow, a spokesman for Lakeland, told The Huffington Post on Friday morning. “We’ve been getting a lot of calls for the last three months.”
He declined to comment on sales of hazmat suits.
Last month, Lakeland said it was increasing production to meet heightened demand for the suits, which cover the whole body. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids -- such as blood, vomit or feces -- of an infected person.
“We hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem,” Christopher J. Ryan, the president and chief executive of Lakeland, said in a statement last month. “With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.”
Lakeland’s stock fell about 4 percent in early trading Friday morning, to about $14.

Meet the 10 richest people in America 2014
Thanks to a buoyant stock market, the richest people in the U.S. just keep getting richer. That has made it harder than ever to join the ranks of the 400 wealthiest Americans. The price of entry to The Forbes 400 this year is $1.55 billion, the highest it’s been since Forbes started tracking American wealth in 1982. Last year it took $1.3 billion to score a spot. Because the bar is so high, 113 U.S. billionaires didn’t make the cut.
Bill Gates is the richest American for the 21st year in a row, with a net worth of $81 billion. (He’s the world’s second richest person, behind Mexico’s Carlos Slim.)
Facebook cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now the 11th richest person in the U.S., and the biggest dollar gainer on the list. His fortune soared to $34 billion, up $15 billion since last year, due to a sharp rise in the price of the social network’s shares.
All together the 400 wealthiest Americans are worth a staggering $2.29 trillion, up $270 billion from a year ago. The average net worth of list members is $5.7 billion, $700 million more than last year and a record high.
Check out the top 10 of the Forbes 400.

Make in India vs. Make in ChinaUpdated: October 26, 2014 07:58 IST
Make in India vs. Make in China

India-China
Markets across Indian towns and cities that are flooded with Chinese products, more so around festivals such as Diwali, are grim reminders of how Made-in-China has come to dominate our offices and homes.
Last Tuesday, Tata Motor’s Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) opened its first plant in Changshu, China. The luxury car-maker’s $1.78-billion Make-in-China push has come a little over a month after Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry confessed to be greatly encouraged under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to join the “Make In India” programme that, he said, brings together industry and government for crafting a new future.
This was at the glittery launch of “Make in India” in Delhi where a galaxy of global corporate leaders ranging from Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries Ltd. to Lockheed Martin India CEO Phil Shaw in response to Mr. Modi’s call had pledged to invest and manufacture in India.
The pitch had its origin in the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech when he invited global companies to pick India to locate factories, promising to replace red tape with red-carpet welcomes.
The jobs and incomes for Indians these factories would generate, he said, would in turn create the market for their output.
The goal the Modi government has set is to make India break into the top 50 in the World Bank’s ease of business index ranking from the current 134th position.
When companies such as Tata Motors choose where to locate a new factory, they consider a range of factors. But India fares badly on most of the counts. For instance, contract enforcement takes 1,420 days and going through the 12 procedures for starting business typically takes 27 days.
India’s chronic infrastructure and logistics deficit with inefficient transport networks makes it tough for manufacturing companies to achieve just-in-time production.
The Modi government has said it wants to radically de-bureaucratise, deregulate, change officers’ mindsets, cut paperwork and remove the notorious legal and infrastructure hurdles to starting and doing business in India. This is not the first time India is focussing on its manufacturing sector. In 2006, the UPA government put out a national strategy for manufacturing. It even dubbed 2006-15 as the “decade of manufacturing in India.” The five-year period of 2005-06 to 2009-10 was one of a smart 10 per cent plus growth for the manufacturing sector when several advantages — engineering skills, a growing domestic market, a raw material base and a large pool of skilled labour — trumped the vast barriers to doing business in India.
JLR’s China launch has set alarm bells ringing for the Modi government: “Make in India” will have to go quickly from being a statement of intent to real action on the ground. Markets across Indian towns and cities that are flooded with Chinese products, more so around festivals such as Deepavali, are grim reminders of how Made-in-China has come to dominate homes and offices. From furniture and gadgets to industrial equipment, India is importing almost all products from its neighbour, even yarn for saris. It is estimated that over 99 per cent of Bangalore silk saris are being made with Chinese silk yarn.
As a result, the rapidly growing bilateral trade between the two neighbours is tilting heavily in China’s favour, at a rate that India has termed unsustainable. Bilateral trade crossed $65 billion in 2013, but while India exported $15 billion worth of goods to China, but imported $51 bn. The quality of trade also goes against India. India exports raw materials such as iron ore but imports manufactured goods.
In pursuit of its reforms agenda of 1979, China has followed a more-exports-at-any-cost policy to boost its economy. The Chinese government’s support to manufacturing in the form of affordable cost of funds, cheap inputs and world-class infrastructure gives it an advantage over Indian manufacturers. The Confederation of Indian Industry estimates that Chinese manufacturing as a result enjoys a cost advantage of about 10 per cent over Indian manufacturing.
A fallout of which is dumping of products on big markets like India. To protect domestic manufacturers, India has been imposing an anti-dumping duty on 159 products — ranging from chemicals, petrochemicals, pharmaceutical, steel, fibres and consumer goods — imported from China since 1992.
The spurt in factory imports from China has coincided with a sharp slide in India’s manufacturing sector despite the UPA government’s efforts to push the sector.
Manufacturing output grew barely 1 per cent in 2012-13. In 2013-14, factory output contracted (-) 0.7 per cent. The share of the jobs-creating sector in the GDP has declined to 14.9 per cent in 2013-14 from the peak level of 16.2 per cent in 2009-10.
India’s advantage
But there is hope still. A new index of manufacturing costs, including productivity-adjusted wages, electricity, natural gas and currency movements, created by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) of the world’s 25 biggest exporters shows China’s traditional cost advantage is now under pressure denting its attractiveness. Under pressure from the U.S., China has had to appreciate its currency by 30 per cent since 2006, which is eroding its exports’ cost competitiveness. Just-in data from the International Monetary Fund show that China is no longer the largest trade surplus economy in the world.
Therein lies an opportunity “Make in India” must tap. India’s labour costs are among the lowest in the world. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average labour compensation (including pay, benefits, social insurance, and taxes) in India’s organised manufacturing sector increased only marginally, from $0.68 an hour in 1999 to $1.50 an hour currently. The average compensation in China’s manufacturing sector in contrast rose 20 percent year-on-year in the same period to $3 an hour.
Besides, the cost competitiveness, India boasts a nearly 500-million-strong labour force comprising unskilled workers and English-speaking scientists, researchers, and engineers, making it a potential destination for cost-effective research and development-oriented manufacturing.
Recent sporadic instances of the odd Chinese manufacturer setting up shop in India and a few Indian companies moving production bases back home from China are encouraging. Havells, Godrej, Micromax and auto-components maker Bosch are amongst a handful of companies that have recently moved back to India some part of their manufacturing or outsourcing in China owing to currency, labour and other cost advantages.
As Chinese factories move up the value-chain to hi-tech manufacturing, opportunities would open up for Indian entrepreneurs but they are up against stiff competition. On the BCG ranking, however, several countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, are better poised and ranked above India as of now to take gain from China’s loss of competitiveness. The coming together of smart entrepreneurs, employees, infrastructure and know-how could overtime become a durable advantage, as had happened in China’s case.

murder
Police said there were seven people in the house during the attack, and that the shooting followed an "altercation."
The captain of South Africa’s national soccer team was fatally shot when armed men broke into the house where he was staying, police said.
Goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was killed around 8 p.m. on Sunday after two gunmen entered a house in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg while an accomplice waited outside, the national police force said on its Twitter account. The three assailants then fled on foot, according to the police service, which offered a reward of nearly $14,000 for information leading to arrests in the case.
Police said there were seven people in the house during the attack, and that the shooting followed an “altercation.”
Authorities said they would do everything possible to find the killers.
South Africa has a high rate of violent crime, but it was not immediately clear whether the house where Meyiwa was staying was targeted by thieves or gunmen with another motive. Solomon Makgale, a South African police spokesman, declined to comment, referring The Associated Press to updates on the police Twitter account.
South African soccer club Orlando Pirates said in a statement that it “has learned with sadness about the untimely death of our number one goalkeeper and current captain Senzo Meyiwa.”
“This is a sad loss whichever way you look at it to Senzo’s family, his extended family, Orlando Pirates and to the nation,” Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza said.
Dean Furman, one of Meyiwa’s teammates, tweeted- “Beyond devastated at the loss of our captain & friend Senzo Meyiwa. Thoughts & prayers are with his family & friends at this terrible time.”
Meyiwa, 27, was South Africa’s captain in its four qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations this year, including its last game, a 0—0 draw with Republic of Congo on Oct. 15. He played for Orlando Pirates on Saturday in a 4—1 win over Ajax Cape Town.
It’s the second death to hit South African sports in three days, as former 800—meter world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday. At the time, President Jacob Zuma said “the nation has lost a true hero.”
Early Monday local time, the youth league of South Africa’s ruling party sent condolences to the families of Meyiwa and Mulaudzi, saying “their premature passing is indeed a great loss to the country and sporting nation.”

Centre to link mobile SIM with Aadhaar: OfficialCentre to link mobile SIM with Aadhaar number
IANS   New Delhi, October 27, 2014
First Published: 14:40 IST(27/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:32 IST(31/10/2014)
Comments
The central government is working hard to link mobile SIM with the Unique Identification (UID) number or Aadhaar, a senior official said in New Delhi on Monday.
"The prime minister (Narendra Modi) has directed us to link the SIM of the mobiles with the Unique Id. We are working on that issue and I am sure we will be able to resolve issues," said RS Sharma, secretary of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology.
"The idea is the mobile should become a very very strong factor in authentication and also a factor for getting information and transaction. If that happens, then it will an enable and empowering tool for the people of India," he said.
Sharma was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Communications and Information Technology Ministry.
He said the secretary of the department of telecom is having deliberations with various departments to facilitate the work of linking mobile SIM with Aadhaar cards. This project is a part of the Digital India programme.
"The programme that has been envisaged by Digital India will boost more ecommerce in India. We are standing in the cusp of digital revolution," Sharma said.
Speaking about his recent visit to South Korea, Sharma said: "We went to South Korea to promote domestic manufacturing of electronics in the country."
"As you know, the government has come up with a policy that gives a lot of financial incentives - both in terms of taxes and also in terms of investment incentives to establish industry - both for individuals as also for clusters."
"So, we had gone to South Korea to meet with the industry leaders there," Sharma said.
"Specifically, we met LG and Samsung and number of other industrial leaders and we emphasised to them that it will make sense to produce in India not only for domestic market, which is so huge, but also to export from India to other neighbouring countries," he said.
Sharma added that the companies have all formulated groups "which will come here and they will interact with us".

Govt likely to raise import taxes on vegetable oilsGovt likely to raise import taxes on vegetable oils
Reuters
Tweet
NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India is considering raising the import taxes on crude and refined vegetable oils to protect local farmers and the refining industry, two government sources said on Monday, as purchases by the world's top importer are expected hit a record this year.
The government could increase the duties on both crude and refined vegetable oils by more than 5 per cent, said an official who is part of the decision making process. Currently India imposes a 2.5 per cent tax on crude oils and 10 per cent on the refined variety.
"We are considering an increase in the import tax but it is not going to happen immediately because the official process will take some more time," said another government official directly involved in the decision making process.
The first source said that a final decision on the duty hikes will be taken by the Finance Ministry.
Hit by cheaper imports, industry body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) has petitioned the government to raise the duty on crude oils to 10 per cent and 25 per cent on refined products.
India is likely to import a record 13 million tonnes of edible oils in the new year beginning November, up from an estimated 11.6 million tonnes this year, including 8 million tonnes of palm oil.
New Delhi imported a record 10.4 million tonnes of edible oils in the 2012/13 year, data from SEA showed.
Nearly 60 per cent of India's annual edible oil demand of 18-19 million tonnes is met by imports, consisting mainly of palm oil sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia.
India also buys tiny amounts of soyoil from Latin America and sunflower oil from the Black Sea region.

Axis Bank eyes SME lending for growth in TNAxis Bank eyes SME lending for growth in TN
Our Bureau
Coimbatore, Oct 27:  
Axis Bank foresees Tamil Nadu region as a key SME lending destination over the next three years.
Aiming to be a partner in progress for the SMEs in the region, the bank is now proposing to roll out specially structured products to provide quick disbursement and faster credit delivery, strengthen its network and focus on supply chain finance as well, says G Edwin, Geography Head – South, SME Banking, Axis Bank.
“We've grown our SME portfolio in the region to Rs 5,800 crore. Quicker turnaround for credit, decentralised decision making, effective relationship management and a wide range of financial products and services is helping the bank emerge as a one-stop shop for all SME solutions,” Edwin told reporters here this afternoon.
He was in the city to introduce the bank's new initiative “Evolve” and one that is seen as a growth driver for the SMBs.
“We think we can be of assistance to the SMBs in non-financial areas as well,” he said, talking about this initiative.
Reverting to products and the time taken to process loan applications from the MSMEs, he said “we revert within a maximum period of three days if the papers are in order, indicating the status of the proposal to the applicant. They need not wait for a week or longer for the status. Thereafter, depending on the quantum of the loan sought, the sanction will vary between 10 days to a fortnight.''
Not only has the bank acquired a good number of new customers, but also increased its SME lending portfolio in the region significantly, Edwin said and pointed out that a-third of the bank's SME loan exposure is from the South.
“While advances to SMEs has increased by over 18 per cent year-on-year to Rs 35,500 cr and is a little more than 15 per cent of the bank's total advances, in Tamil Nadu, our SME portfolio has registered a growth of 17 per cent,'' he said, highlighting the growth potential.
Towards strengthening its network, the bank has opened a new SME centre at Erode and is looking at setting up a centre in Madurai shortly.
The bank currently operates 42 SME centres and 17 SME cells across the country. This network is expected to be strengthened further, Edwin added.

President Pranab Mukherjee
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Expressing concern over Parliament approving important legislative business without much debate, President Pranab Mukherjee today asked the Lok Sabha Speaker to find ways to devote more time for discussions on businesses such as passing of the Finance Bill.
“...as the Speaker (Lok Sabha) is present here, I would also like to take the opportunity of sharing my concern that we are not devoting adequate time in Parliament while sanctioning money, while imposing taxes, before scrutiny of the law, before scrutiny of expenditure proposals despite the establishment of an institutional arrangement like the Parliamentary Standing Committee not taking place before the passage of the Finance Bill,” he said.
“Therefore, much more time is required to be devoted either for legislations and for sanctioning money dealing with the financial transactions and both Chairman PAC (public accounts) and Speaker may ponder over and find a practical solution to achieve this objective,” he said at the inauguration of the Accountant General conference here.
The President said many studies conducted by Parliament itself indicated the time devoted for legislations in the first, second, third and fourth Lok Sabha for disposing off financial matters were much more compared to later Parliaments.
“Therefore, I do feel that the time has come to take some corrective courses. As it has been correctly pointed out by Speaker, Parliament has three important committees — PAC, estimates committee, and committee on public undertakings through which Parliament can exercise control not only over the policies, but also on how money was spent, how resources are utilised, how resources are mobilised,” he said.

Chennai-based ReGen Powertech has come up with a made-for-India wind turbine with a capacity of 2.8 MW.
The machine’s blades will sweep a circle of a diameter of 109 metres. The wind turbine has been developed by ReGen’s wholly-owned R&D subsidiary in Germany, Wind Direct GmbH, and the company intends to make the machine available for sale by the end of next year.
A prototype of the turbine is currently undergoing testing at ReGen’s test site near Coimbatore.
Unique feature
A unique feature of this (permanent magnet, gearless) turbine is that it comprises two independent power systems of 1.4 MW capacity each. This allows operation of the turbine at half the rated power, so that when one segment is working, the other could be taken up for maintenance.
Besides, the box that sits on the top of the tower – the nacelle – weighs 156 tonnes, compared with 250 tonnes of other machines of similar rated capacity, says a press release from ReGen.
ReGen Powertech, set up by Madhusudhan Khemka, has been in the Indian market for the last six years and has about 1,500 MW of standing machines in India and Sri Lanka behind it.
It currently manufactures 1.5 MW synchronous permanent magnet gearless wind turbines with a technology agreement with Vensys, Germany. Its clientele includes names such as Tata Power, Renew Power, NSL Power, Green Infra, Greenko, Mytrah, NuPower, Orange Power and Bhilwara Energy.

India to consider extending incentives for raw sugar exportsIndia to consider extending incentives for raw sugar exports

NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India will consider extending the incentives for raw sugar exports after Oct. 29 when leading cane growing states forecast their sugar output for the new season beginning October, two government sources said on Monday.
"The cane commissioners of leading cane growing states will present their estimates on Oct. 29 and that will set the ball rolling for a decision on raw sugar export subsidy in 2014/15," a government official with direct knowledge of the matter, said.
In February, the government gave Rs 3,300 ($53.82) a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
However, a delay in extending the incentives for the new 2014/15 season had led to misgivings in some quarters that New Delhi was against giving subsidy for overseas shipments of raw sugar.

Alembic Pharmaceuticals to pick up 49% stake in Algerias AdwiyaMamiPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:56 pm
Drug firm Alembic Pharmaceuticals will acquire 49 per cent stake in Algeria-based Adwiya Mami SARL for an undisclosed sum as it seeks to enter the north African country.
“The company’s 100 per cent subsidiary, Alembic Global Holding SA (AGH) announced the joint venture deal with Adwiya Mami SARL Algeria. The deal envisages investment by AGH to the extent of 49 per cent stake of Adwiya Mami,” Alembic Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
Post conclusion of the deal, the company will be renamed as Alembic Mami SPA, it added.
The joint venture entity will be mutually run by Alembic and Mami with equal representation from both sides in the Board.
Alembic nominee Tagreed Alshunar has been appointed as its first CEO, the company said.
Algeria is a large market with a size of USD 3 billion and investment in Adwiya Mami will give AGH a quick entry in the country, it added.
Highlighting the significance of the move, Alembic said: “There are entry barriers and local manufacturing units get a distinct advantage in marketing the products.”
Adwiya Mami currently has a formulation plant with the capacity of 1.2 billion per annum oral solids. The plant has enough headroom for future expansion, the company said.
Shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals were trading 2.35 per cent down at Rs 412 per scrip during afternoon trade on the BSE today.
 

Mutual Funds exposure to bank stocks drops to Rs 55 398 cr inSeptPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:54 pm
Mutual fund (MF) managers dropped their exposure in bank stocks to Rs 55,398 crore in September, after raising it for seven consecutive month.
According to the latest data available with Securities and Exchange Board of India, MF investments in bank stocks as on September 30 declined to Rs 55,398 crore, accounting for 18.84 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 2.94 lakh crore.
In comparison, the MF industry’s exposure to banking sector had reached to an all-time of Rs 56,625 crore in August this year.
However, MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs, last month with an exposure of Rs 31,834 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,908 crore), auto (Rs 18,892 crore) and finance (Rs 16,358 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market and the current decline is mainly due to profit booking.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in banking stocks by equity fund managers and fund infusion has grown from Rs 30,339 crore in January to Rs 56,625 crore in August.
In percentage term, exposure has risen from 16.6 per cent to 20.10 per cent during the period.

UCO Bank identifies Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines as wilful defaulterBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:49 pm
Kolkata-based UCO Bank today said it has “identified” Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) as a “wilful defaulter” and will be sending a notice to the defunct carrier.
“We have identified KFA as a wilful defaulter. We are in the process of sending a notice to the company in this regard”, a source in the bank said.
Other banks like State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank are also mulling this route.
United Bank of India has already declared KFA a ‘wilful defaulter’ for defaulting a loan of Rs 350 crore.
Beside KFA, UCO Bank will also send a notice to the company which had furnished a corporate guarantee for availing a loan of around Rs 450 crore, the source said.
As per RBI guidelines, a wilful defaulter tag would be given if it is found that a loan taken is diverted for some other use rather than for which it was availed, as well as the default is made in spite of having the ability to repay it.
 

Black money: Lodhya denies having a Swiss bankaccountBy: Press Trust of India | Rajkot | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:47 pm
City-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, today denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list. “I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media…. I am shocked,” Lodhya told reporters here.
“I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department,” he said. Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, “We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us.” Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers. The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said. It has two subsidiaries – Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya’s firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008. The central government today filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court in the black money case, naming three prominent businessmen Pradip Burman, formerly of Dabur group, Goa-based miner Radha S Timblo and Lodhya. The Centre told the court that it had no intention to withhold names of persons who have stashed black money abroad and stated that information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established.
Foreign bank account legal, followed all rules: Burmans
With one of its members, Pradip Burman, being named as an account holder in a foreign bank in the black money issue, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans today said the account complied with all legal requirements. “We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added. Pradip Burman currently holds no position in the homegrowm FMCG major although he was once a Whole Time Director of Dabur India.
Regretting that there was a lack of differentiation between legal and illegal foreign bank account holders, the spokesperson further said: “It is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush.” “The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels,” the spokesperson added.

Jeb Bush to run for Presidency in 2016?
PTI Oct 27, 2014, 03.48PM IST
Tags:
George H W Bush
(A former Republican governor…)
HOUSTON: Jeb Bush , a scion of the Bush dynasty that has given America two presidents, is "more than likely" to make a run for the White House in 2016, his son has said.
"I think it's more than likely that he's (Jeb) giving this a serious thought in moving forward," George P Bush told a news channel.
Asked if it was "more than likely" that his father will run for presidency as the Republican candidate, George said, "If you had asked me a few years back, I would've said it was less likely. The family will be behind him 100 per cent if he decides to do it."
While Jeb's brother George W Bush and father George H W Bush , both former presidents, have encouraged him to run, other members of the family, including his mother, Barbara Bush, have aired reservations.
A former Republican governor of Florida, 61-year-old Jeb is a favourite of the party's establishment wing. If he runs, he is expected to draw on a deep well of support among the donor network cultivated by his father and brother.
Jeb has said he will only launch a bid if he can campaign unapologetically on the issues that are important to him. He has said he is likely to decide on a run after November's midterm elections, by the end of the year.
While Jeb still assesses a bid for the presidency, his son George is making his first run for elected office, campaigning for the position of Texas land commissioner.
The position carries a portfolio ranging from managing the state's land and mineral resources to administering programmes for veterans.
It also oversees the Permanent School Fund, which is the nation's largest educational endowment at USD 37.7 billion.
Though this is his first run for office, George was immersed in Republican politics at a young age.
When he was 12-years-old, he recited the pledge of allegiance at the 1988 Republican National Convention, which nominated his grandfather, George H W Bush. In his 20s, he campaigned for his uncle George W Bush's presidential run.
"It's an overall positive for me," George said of the Bush family name.
"But I said from day one of my campaign, 23 months ago, that I am a man of my own right, who stands on my own two feet with my vision. And I need folks to evaluate me based on what I bring to the table," the 38-year-old said.
If George wins next Tuesday, he will hold the distinction of being the only Bush to win their first campaign.

As new and old e-retailers focus on handlooms, lesser known weaver groups are beginning to reap the benefits
Little known rural groups in different parts of the country bring out hand-woven and hand-knitted shawls, stoles and jackets for the colder months. Most buyers wouldn’t have access to the products of these groups unless one knows how to source such products through specialised stores or travelling exhibitions. But now, with the help of online retailers, these groups get their space in the sun.
E-retailers have moved a step ahead from cataloguing products from different vendors, both established designer labels and small groups, and feel the need to have ‘promotional events’ just like brick and mortar stores to create a buzz. At the moment, jaypore.com is curating an ‘event’ showcasing vibrant hand-knitted stoles and shawls from Himalayas by Kilmora, a label promoted by Kumaun Grameen Udyog.
Meanwhile, on tjori.com, the focus is on cotton and silk quilted jackets by Jaipur Pitara group. From North East weaves and tribal jewellery to Chettinad checks, Afghani stoles to indigo-dyed apparels, e-retailers are tapping into the rich canvas of Indian weaves. And eager customers don’t seem to mind forking out a little more to lay their hands on exquisite handlooms and handicrafts.
Closer home, Kaumudi studio and Chenetha weaves are among the groups taking baby steps into e-retailing. Sharmila Nagraj Nandula of Kaumudi is gauging the buying patterns through portals skewed towards handlooms. “There is greater visibility when we sell online. But I am not sure if shoppers browsing through Amazon or Flipkart specifically look for handlooms. If one types a search term ‘handloom kurta’, I don’t know the probability of my brand showing up,” she says. Kaumudi unveiled exclusive lines on indianroots.in and craftsvilla.com. The group also retails through its portal kaumudistudio.com . “The mark-up price, when we sell through other portals, is comparatively higher. I was in a dilemma about this. If I was a buyer, I’d try to place an enquiry with the vendor directly and see if there is a difference in price. On the other hand, popular e-retailers have better visibility and a clientele that is willing to pay for handlooms,” says Sharmila.
Chenetha weaves is also studying the e-commerce market to see how it can benefit weavers. Karghaa, the label by Chenetha weaves, now sells through gocoop.com. “We’ve been selling online for six months and have clients from North Carolina, Australia and Malaysia. NRIs show interest in saris while the foreigners purchase home-linen and stoles,” says Sudha Rani, CEO. The group is happy that the weavers have a steady flow of work.
However, the smaller production scale of handlooms remains a concern. “Groups that supply both handloom and powerloom fabrics will be able to meet the growing online demand. Others will have to work harder. We also need staff to cater to online queries and do necessary photo shoots for product visibility,” she says.
Despite such challenges, both Sharmila and Sudha feel online retailing has opened up new possibilities for the handloom sector. Several groups have been tapping online consumers in their own way. Chanderiyaan.net, which showcases Chanderi weaves, is managed by a network of weavers’ self-help groups through Chanderi Weavers Resource Integrated Information Resource Centre. Handsofindia.com , based in Vrindavan, retails handloom apparels with tie-and-dye technique, soof and ahir embroidery from Kutch, hand made laces, batiks and more. Boyanika.com showcases products from the looms of Orissa — Sambhalpuri ikats, natural dyed Kotpad fabrics, hand spun wild silk, hand-woven brocades, Bomkai saris woven by Jala technique and more.
As Sharmila sums up, “Online platforms have widened our reach and will help us stay in public consciousness.”

Ukraine: Pro-European parties take leadvoting
With more than one-third of the votes counted, two allied pro-European parties in Ukraine that ran on a platform to enact tough reforms took a joint lead on Monday in a parliamentary election.
Partial figures showed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk’s Popular Front with 21.6 percent of the vote and President Petro Poroshenko’s party at 21.5 percent.
Mr. Poroshenko said after Sunday’s election that he wanted Western-oriented parties elected to quickly form a broad reformist coalition. Negotiations on forming that coalition are expected to begin Monday and be completed within 10 days.
A recently formed pro-European party based in western Ukraine, Samopomich, was running third with almost 11 percent of the vote.
The vote has led to an overhaul of a parliament once dominated by loyalists of former President Viktor Yanukovych, who sparked the protests that caused his ouster with a decision to deepen ties with Russia.
Anti-Russian sentiment has spiked in Ukraine as the country battles with separatists in the east many believe are supported by Moscow.
As a result, the election has favoured the chances of parties with staunchly pro-Western or nationalist agendas.
Nonetheless, the Opposition Bloc, which pundits believe largely drew its support from Mr. Yanukovych’s once-ruling Party of Regions, has put in a strong showing with a 9.8 percent, with around 33 percent of the vote counted.
Mr. Poroshenko last month laid out an ambitious agenda envisioning root-and-branch changes to the justice system, police, tax system, defence sector and health care to be completed by 2020.
Corruption has been an intensely discussed issue in Ukraine in recent months and was one of the main seeds of the discontent that precipitated Mr. Yanukovych’s downfall.
Among the tougher decisions likely to lie ahead will be allowing costs of basic utilities in the cash-strapped country to float in line with market demands. With the economy in a freefall this year, there is no imminent sense of a surge of prosperity that could temper policies that would prove agonizing to bear for the poor.
International observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were due to share a preliminary assessment of the election later Monday.
While around 36 million people were registered to vote, no voting was held on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March, or in parts of Ukraine’s easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where shelling remains a daily constant. The fight against armed separatists on the border with Russia has claimed the lives of more than 3,600 people.
With almost 3 million people in areas near Russia’s border unable to vote, it seems probable pro-Western parties were given an advantage.
Slightly more than half of the incoming members of parliament are being elected by means of party lists, and the remainder are picked in direct local contests. That has opened the door to likelihood of victories by candidates from smaller parties, such as the Right Sector ultranationalist group.
With half the votes counted in his district in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh was leading comfortably with 30 percent, almost twice as much as his nearest rival.

Climbdown by Sena  says willing to accept any BJP leader as CMShiv Sena climbs down, says will back BJP

A cornered Shiv Sena made a last-ditch effort to patch up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be part of the new Maharashtra government as its former ally prepared to elect its chief ministerial candidate on Tuesday.

Devendra Fadnavis looks like a clear favourite for the chief minister’s job in the western state which has been gripped by political uncertainty since the BJP emerged as the single largest party but failed to get a clear majority in the assembly election.
The BJP is finalising its team of ministers ahead of the oath-taking ceremony on October 31, but it isn’t clear if the Shiv Sena will join the ministry as the BJP is not willing to accept its demands for key portfolios and an assurance to not carve out a separate state of Vidarbha.
Despite the talks with the Shiv Sena, the BJP has also prepared a plan to run a minority government instead of giving the Sena a considerable share of ministerial berths and important departments.
The first indication of the Shiv Sena softening its stand was an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana saying the party would support the BJP-led government as it has got a mandate.
“We will have to keep our political differences aside and work with the BJP chief minister for the unity of Maharashtra. We have kept ourselves together even in difficult circumstances and it will be better if it remains so,” said the editorial in Saamana, which is regarded as the opinion of Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray.
The BJP has an upper hand in negotiations with future allies because it emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly compared with the Shiv Sena’s 63 seats. The BJP’s strength reduced by one as one its MLAs, Govind Rathod elected from Nanded district, died of heart attack on Sunday.
 It has also been in talks with smaller parties and independents, which could take its tally to around 135.
Wankhede Stadium is being decked up for the oath-taking function, expected to be attended by 30,000-40,000 BJP workers from all corners of the state.

NSA Doval visits Burdwan  pressure on MamataNSA Doval visits Burdwan, pressure on Mamata
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:58 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 15:26 IST(27/10/2014)
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and top intelligence chiefs of the country on Monday visited the blast site in West Bengal's Burdwan and assessed the progress of investigations.
 
NIA director general Sharad Kumar, NSG director general Jayanta Narayan Chowdhury and Intelligence Bureau director Syed Asif Ibrahim accompanied him during the over 30 minute visit to the house at Khagragarh where the blast took place on October 2, police said.
 
Doval and the three top officials visited the room where the blast occurred, during which two suspected terrorists were also killed.
 
They also went to the room which had served as the laboratory of the suspected terrorists and climbed the roof top of the house to check the visibility of surrounding areas.
 
Doval also inquired where the two children of the suspected terrorists stayed in the house.
 
The children, who are toddlers have since been taken into custody along with their mothers, one of whom is the widow of one of the suspected terrorists who died in the explosion.
 
Later, Doval met the district officials and asked about the progress of inquiry into the blast, the police added.
 
The four top officials then left for Kolkata to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat 'Nabanna'.
 
Earlier, the security and intelligence chiefs flew in to Burdwan by a chopper from NSC Bose International Airport. They had reached Kolkata in a IAF special aircraft this morning.
 
The present visit was the second in four days by the NIA director. Kumar after his first visit to Burdwan and Murshidabad on
Friday had said that the arrested persons in connection with the blast and their associates were members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and were making IEDs to be transported to the neighbouring country for possible terror attacks.
 
The visits by top security and intelligence chiefs come ahead of the union government's move to send a report to Bangladesh following a request from that country.
 
Three persons, including the two women were arrested in connection with the blast and were interrogated by the NIA.
The PMO is giving utmost importance to the terror issue in Bengal after the Burdwan blast and subsequent revelations of a well-oiled terror network using madrasas.
On the other hand, the Trinamool-led government came under heavy fire from the opposition for trying to keep the NIA at bay after the Burdwan blasts. It was CID, which was entrusted with the investigation, until NIA suo moto took up the case.

HUL Misses Estimates  Q2 Net Grows 8%; Stock Falls 5%You are here: Home Corporates
HUL Shares Fall Most in Nearly 4 Years on Weak Outlook

Mumbai:
Hindustan Unilever, controlled by consumer goods giant Unilever Plc, warned India's consumer spending will remain weak as the economy sags after its own profit rose 8 per cent on robust sales of soaps and detergents.
Net profit rose to Rs 988 crore for the three months to September 30 from Rs 914 crore a year earlier, Hindustan Unilever said in a statement on Monday. The company is two-thirds owned by its Anglo-Dutch parent, and plays a key role in Unilever's Asia operations.
Hindustan Unilever said fiscal second-quarter sales growth outstripped the broader market, but the profit number was exactly in line with an average of estimates from analysts polled by Reuters. The weak demand forecast helped send the company's shares sharply lower and pointed to future headaches for Unilever, already hit by slowdown in emerging markets which generates more than half its sales.
"We see the market continuing to remain soft. While we are conscious of this near-term concerns, we remain positive on a medium- to long-term outlook of our country's fast-moving consumer goods market," finance chief P.B. Balaji told reporters on a conference call.
Hindustan Unilever shares closed 5.1 per cent lower after the results, its biggest single-day fall since January 2011, with some dealers saying its unit sales volume growth of 5 per cent was below their expectations. The company has been hurt in recent quarters by weaker consumer demand in an economy that grew less than 5 per cent in the past two fiscal years.
Parent Unilever last week reported its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly five years, hit by persistent woes in Europe and the slower performance in emerging markets. It promised new, cheaper products and more cost cuts would help in raise profits.
Hindustan Unilever sales rose about 11 per cent, helped by soaps and detergent sales that grew at a double-digit percentage pace, the company said, along with skincare products.
As of last week, shares in Hindustan Unilever, valued at nearly Rs 27 crore, had risen nearly a third this year, outperforming the Nifty and the consumer goods index.

Bangalore/Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Value and Budget Housing Corporation (VBHC), a provider of affordable housing, after four years of operations in India, has opened its office in Dubai.
The company plans to facilitate customer interaction and engagement when servicing its NRI customers based out of Dubai and the entire West Asian zone who have displayed significant interest in purchasing properties in India. The launch was attended by bankers, investors and prospective customers.
Commenting on the development, Jerry Rao, Chairman and founder, VBHC, said: "It is an extremely gratifying moment for us to spread our wings internationally. We have made substantial achievements in the Indian real estate market, having delivered quality and commitment to our customers. We intend to start our global journey with the same mission and vision and believe we will be equally successful in the international market by continuing to deliver value to our customers."
VBHC in a statement said it has a large number of West Asian customers; hence the global expansion came as the next logical step for a company growing very rapidly in the domestic market.
Though buying property online has been a much adopted trend, having an operational office allows its customers the opportunity to have a better, wider and clearer knowledge of the properties, it added.
VBHC was co-founded by former MphasiS Chairman Jaithirth (Jerry) Rao and former Citibank Consumer Banking Head P S Jayakumar.
With marquee investors like HDFC, IFC, Carlyle and Caspian Advisers, VBHC has large-scale expansion plans and intends to deliver 18,000 homes in the next three years as it expands its national footprint across India.

TOPICS
inflation and deflation
Acknowledging that private investment is stifled in India due to “lots of regulations” and also scarcity of coal and electricity, new Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian has said that removing these bottlenecks will be key to kick start growth in the country.
“The Indian economy needs a couple of big things, better governance, a stronger state delivering security of contract, protecting property rights, providing infrastructure,” Dr. Subramanian said in a podcast interview to IMF.
“You need a bigger role for the private sector, means getting rid of the lots of regulations that stifled the private sector, which stifled employment creation that stifled the ability of the private sector to grow, to become big. These are the kind of broad twin challenges that India faces,” said the former IMF economist, who was appointed Chief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry on October 16.
Responding to a question, Dr. Subramanian said “a lot of projects are stalled, because there is not enough power, there is not enough coal, or the companies are over indebted.”
“So clearing these bottlenecks is going to be the biggest kick start to private investment and growth,” he said.
Bureaucrats were not taking some crucial decisions fearing that they would be sued in courts, he said.
“So I think, just creating the conditions for more expeditious decision making and then you need to get the infrastructure going again, making power and coal and addressing those would be a big priority,” he said.
Dr. Subramanian said a five per cent growth rate is “remotely not enough” for India to grow and provide the jobs for the expanding labour force.
“Growth would have to be brought back to seven-and-a-half and eight per cent consistently for about 10, 15, 20 years, if India is to really address all these challenges,” he said.
The Chief Economic Advisor said, “As reforms were lagging, inflation was very high and growth decelerating for many consecutive quarters and there seemed to be a kind of government paralysis, there was a sense in 2012 of India lagging behind.”
“But it is clear that there is a real optimism, because there is a sense that the new government can remedy some of those problems. Stock markets have risen tremendously; foreign capital has come pouring in and initial steps have been taken that kind of validate all that optimism,” he said.
“But that is just a start. A lot more needs to be done,” he said, adding that the Narendra Modi Government is trying to replicate the “Gujarat model” all over India of good governance and attracting private sector.
He emphasised that there are a set of macro challenges that needs to be addressed to bring down inflation further and to get the fiscal deficit down.
At the same time there is a need to provide the conditions for greater infrastructure and create conditions for the private sector to start coming back again, he said.
Dr. Subramanian, an Oxford-educated and an economist with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) like his predecessor Raghuram Rajan, said private sector investment needs to rise again if India has to achieve eight per cent growth rate.

Shares Of Hazmat-Suit Maker Spike On NYC Ebola Newsreddit
Shares in a company that makes hazmat suits soared 16 percent on Thursday after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in New York City .
The stock price of Long Island-based Lakeland Industries, which makes various types of protective garb, has more than doubled in the past month amid feverish news coverage of the deadly virus . The stock jumped from less than $7 a share in late September to as high as $29 on October 13, when Ebola panic in the U.S. was particularly high.
Shares have drifted lower since then, but got another boost on Thursday afternoon after the news that Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who recently returned to New York from treating patients in Guinea, had been hospitalized with Ebola symptoms. Later on Thursday he became the fourth person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.
The spike in stock price came after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.
“We’ve been getting a lot of calls in the last 24 hours,” Jordan Darrow, a spokesman for Lakeland, told The Huffington Post on Friday morning. “We’ve been getting a lot of calls for the last three months.”
He declined to comment on sales of hazmat suits.
Last month, Lakeland said it was increasing production to meet heightened demand for the suits, which cover the whole body. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids -- such as blood, vomit or feces -- of an infected person.
“We hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem,” Christopher J. Ryan, the president and chief executive of Lakeland, said in a statement last month. “With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.”
Lakeland’s stock fell about 4 percent in early trading Friday morning, to about $14.

US tech firm fined for underpaying IndiansUS tech firm fined for underpaying Indian workers
Michael Liedtke     San Francisco   Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 18:14 IST
Picture for representation purpose.
A Silicon Valley company is paying more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after labour regulators found eight employees brought from India were grossly underpaid and overworked while assigned to a special project in the US.
The probe announced this week by the US Department of Labour uncovered several egregious violations at Electronics for Imaging Inc, a printing technology specialist that generated revenue of $728 million last year, when the misconduct occurred.
Among other things, Electronics for Imaging paid the eight workers far below California's required minimum wage - $8 per hour at the time - while they helped the company move its headquarters from Foster City, California, to Fremont, California, during a three-month period, according to the Labour Department.
While assigned to the project, some of the Indian workers logged as many as 122 hours in a week without being paid overtime. As result, they received as little as $1.21 per hour.
Electronics for Imaging says it "unintentionally overlooked" US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least minimum wage, with overtime for more than 40 weekly hours on the job.
Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US.
Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California.
"This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops," Eastwood said on Thursday.
The Electronics for Imaging case serves as a reminder of the economic divide between high-tech workforces in the US and less-developed countries.
While engineers and other technology employees are paid more than $100,000 salaries and lucrative stock incentives, workers handling other jobs for the same employer often receive paltry pay if they are based in countries such as India, China and Mexico.
Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.
Electronics for Imaging is paying more than $40,000 in back wages and damages to the eight Indian workers and a $3,520 fine.

Widening the activities coming under CSR ambit, contributions made by corporates towards Narendra Modi-led government’s two key initiatives — Swachh Bharat and Clean Ganga — will now be considered as social welfare spending work.
Making amendments to the Companies Act, the Corporate Affairs Ministry has said that contributions to ‘Swachh Bharat Kosh’ and ‘Clean Ganga Fund’ would come under CSR framework.
‘Swach Bharat Kosh’ has been set up to attract funds, from various entities including corporates, for activities related to Swachh Bharat initiative. The ‘Clean Ganga Fund’ is aimed at pooling money for taking up works to clean the Ganga river.
These two initiatives are the latest ones to be brought under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ambit where contributions made to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund has been included already.
Through a notification, the Ministry has inserted the words ‘including contribution to the Swach Bharat Kosh set up by the central government for the promotion of sanitation” in Schedule VII of the Act, which pertains to CSR activities
Besides, the words “including contribution to the Clean Ganga Fund set up by the central government for rejuvenation of river Ganga” have been inserted in the Schedule.

Delhi s realty estate sector stuck in no man s landUrban areas in and around Delhi constitute 40% of unsold real estate in top eight cities
Ravi Teja Sharma, M Rajshekhar & Avinash Celestine, ET Bureau Oct 27, 2014, 04.42AM IST

India
(The NCR has a total of 303.48…)
NEW DELHI: Guess who probably had a terrible Diwali? The capital's builders. Just look at one simple statistic. Urban areas in and around Delhi account for a stunning 40% of unsold real estate in India's top eight cities. So, why is it so gloomy in NCR? Why does Bangalore and even Mumbai look better?
THE PROBLEM
The NCR has a total of 303.48 million sq ft (about 303,000 apartments) of unsold real estate, according to property research firm Liases Foras. At the current pace of sales, this stock requires another 53 months to be completely sold off. In comparison, for the Mumbai region, the figure is about 48 months while it is the lowest for Bangalore at 19 months. For the top eight cities combined, the 765 m sq ft of unsold space will require at least 35 months to be sold.
The festive season this year has failed to bring cheer to builders despite many of them doling out offers which include ones where buyers have to pay 10% of the apartment cost upfront and the rest at the time of possession. Brokers say they are getting a lot of enquiries from buyers but not too many conversions.Riding on improved sentiments, home sales in the NCR are up about 10% over the previous quarter, but sales are still not happening at the pace that is usually associated with the festive period. In good years, builders were able to garner almost 30-40% of their sales for the entire year during this threemonth period.
BUILDING NOWHERE
But it's not just the size of the unsold 'inventory' that makes Delhi the worst off among the real estate markets of larger cities. 56% of the unsold real estate in NCR is in areas which are currently uninhabitable. In other words, while the apartments have come up, the other essential infrastructure — roads, sewage systems, or water connections — have not. In comparison, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 168 m sq ft (168,000 apartments) and Bangalore has 113 m sq ft (113,000 apartments) of unsold space of which just 2% of the inventory is in undeveloped areas in each city. While sales have slowed down in Mumbai as well, the real reason is more to do with high prices.
"NCR is a very inefficient market where a lot of projects were launched in undeveloped areas," says Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras. Take for instance the Dwarka-Manesar Expressway. Its location in Gurgaon is closest to Delhi and several projects were launched here a few years back but work on the expressway has not been completed yet though some builders are close to giving possession to buyers.
"As the level of sales dropped, the interest of developers in creating social infrastructure also reduced," says Samarjit Singh, managing director of IndiaHomes, a real estate brokerage firm. Over the last few years, a number of scams and project related issues that have cropped up across NCR have also scared buyers. While project delays are a big issue, cases against developers such as the one where the Competition Commission of India slapped a fine of Rs 630 crore on DLF for unfair trade practices in a few of its Gurgaon projects, or environmental concerns such as those around development near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, have added to the gloom.
SPECULATORS
And while the real estate market in every city has its share of speculators - investors who don't really want to live in the flats they buy and essentially see them as an investment they can flip quickly to other buyers — the NCR has far more than its fair share. In NCR, well over 50% of those who buy property think of it as a short-term investment, pushing builders to launch hundreds of projects over the last few years without so much as a thought to the main premise of real estate — location. "The problem in the NCR is peculiar," says Mudassir Zaidi, national director - residential at Knight Frank India.
"Prevalence of investors is compounding the problem as they are also selling their inventory, undercutting developers on price as they do not have the holding capacity." When the economy was riding high, these investor-buyers flipped properties at ease within six months of buying them, thus making a killing and raising prices. But the same market is now gasping for breath as actual buyers started to pull back in an uncertain market.
 
"There is a logjam in NCR because the trust deficit about the builder community here is the worst compared to other cities," says Singh, pointing out that the list of developers still maintaining their reputation is now very small in the NCR. Buyers, he says, now prefer buying apartments in completed projects or in ones that are at a very late stage of construction.
Kapoor of Liases Foras says in locations where social infrastructure is in place and the price too is compelling, home sales are still robust.

Subsidy Shake-up to Undercut Asian Diesel DemandIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Singapore: A recovery in Asia's diesel demand growth is likely to be pushed back as governments of major oil consumers in the region take advantage of a tumble in oil prices to cut fuel subsidies and bolster their budgets.
A prolonged period of weak demand is expected to reduce margins for refineries that produce the transport and industrial fuel, traders and analysts said. The Asian gasoil margin is already set for its worst quarter in October-December since late 2010, according to Reuters data, hurt by slower economic growth and a supply glut from new refining capacity.
"Diesel demand will continue to be weak in 2015 and we see a slight rebound in 2016 overall in Asia, but we are not positive on diesel growth next year and price deregulation is not going to improve matters," said Sri Paravaikkarasu, an analyst at energy consultancy FGE.
India's government removed diesel price controls this month, following a 25 per cent fall in global oil prices since June, while Indonesia's new President Joko Widodo plans to order the steepest rise in subsidised fuel prices in nine years.
Cutting subsidies would normally increase prices, lowering demand. Given current low prices, cutting subsidies may not have immediate impact on demand - Indian diesel prices will actually be about 6 per cent lower - but demand could turn south once oil prices rise, analysts said.
Indonesia is Asia's third-largest importer of diesel, while India is one of the region's top diesel exporters.
Indonesia price hike
Widodo aims to raise the gasoline price in Indonesia by 46 per cent, and diesel by 55 per cent in a move that will save the government nearly $13 billion a year, an adviser told Reuters.
Diesel demand has been falling in Indonesia since the country first hiked diesel prices by more than 20 per cent in 2013, and has been hurt also by a mining slowdown and the mandated use of biodiesel.
Although Widodo's minority coalition may face some difficulties on subsidies, sentiment will be affected by the proposal, JBC Energy said in a market note.
"The news will certainly prolong the current weakness in the middle distillates market for much longer, even if Indian price cuts boost short-term consumer sentiment and the Indonesian government fails to raise domestic prices," it said.
Indonesia's diesel demand is expected at about 270,000 bpd in 2014, according to JBC Energy, and about half of that is currently subsidised.
Diesel demand in Southeast Asia's biggest economy is expected to decline by 3.5 per cent in 2015 and 3.3 per cent in 2016, after falling 6.9 per cent this year, FGE's Sri said.
Despite moves to further raise prices, full deregulation may not happen in Indonesia until 2020, said Sushant Gupta, an analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
He estimated full deregulation would cut road demand for diesel and gasoline by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd).
India demand cuts
In India, where diesel use makes up nearly half of fuel consumption, about 40,000 to 50,000 bpd of diesel demand growth has been cut since September, 2012, Gupta said.
The growth rate for diesel vehicles had slowed because diesel's price advantage over gasoline had narrowed, he said.
Since late 2012, India has implemented various reforms to its fuel subsidy programme, including allowing oil companies to increase diesel prices incrementally and withdrawing subsidies on diesel sold in bulk.
India's diesel demand could still grow by 2.4 to 2.8 per cent next year from 1.1 to 1.5 per cent growth this year as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to boost the manufacturing sector to generate growth and jobs, analysts said.

(Through its indigenously…)
I wanted to contribute to the society in some way ever since I was a child. So, after graduating in commerce, in 1985, and completing my Applied Computer Science course, both from Hyderabad, I looked around for ways to make my dream come true. By then, I had already made up my mind to have an enterprise of my own. So, when I chanced upon an opportunity to develop software and networking solutions for the armed forces and the police, I seized it. However, I made little money on this project. Despite this, I started meeting senior defence and police officials to find out if I could come up with solutions to the pressing problems faced by the armed forces.
During one such interaction, I discovered that there was a severe shortage of shooting ranges and ammunition for training and it was a problem to which the forces had no answer. This got me thinking. I knew how armed forces in the West used simulators to equip their personnel with flight, gunnery and marksmanship skills.
With the help of my software programmer friends, I started working on a pilot project to develop a simulator, and it took us a couple of years to build one. Finally, Zen Technologies was born in Hyderabad, in 1993. To start with, there were only three of us and I invested Rs 5 lakh, which included all my savings as well as a loan from my family members and a few close friends.
However, convincing people on the use of virtual shooting ranges was no easy task and the going was extremely difficult for the next three years. This, despite the immense and clear cost advantage that simulators offered. The other challenge was to work with government departments: they would demand past credentials and testimonials from existing clients. We could not produce these because we had none at that point.
We also realised that the procurement cycle was going to be too long for us to sustain. Apart from these issues, every time we were asked for a demonstration, carting the simulator to the customer location and back cost us over Rs 50,000, an extraordinarily high amount in those days.
Finally, we worked out an arrangement with the National Police Academy, where we installed a simulator free of cost. This decision paid off. We were almost on the verge of bankruptcy when a team of senior Delhi Police officers visited the academy and tested the product first-hand. They were delighted with the performance and we bagged our first order in the summer of 1996, almost three years after we had first demonstrated the simulator.
Immediately after we got the first order, we managed to raise funds from the IDBI's Venture Capital Division and gained financial stability. However, unlike in the developed countries, where the government finances private players to provide defence solutions, Zen had to self-financed research and development of new product categories. Therefore, we had to be very careful about the type of projects we could take up. Still, we invested in the best resources because of competition from the world's best companies. We also priced our products very aggressively keeping in mind the international companies.
 
The going was good in the late 1990s and we managed to get our second round of funding of Rs 2 crore in 2000 through an initial public offering. We were the first Indian company to commercialise PC-based visual simulation technology for training simulators and have patents for our key technologies. Zen has a very robust product portfolio and has been the largest supplier of simulators for the Indian security forces. Our efforts were recognised in 2012, when we won the National Technology Award. Recently, we have launched three new simulators—Containerized Tubular Shooting Range (CTSR), Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).
Today, we have a large team comprising 243 employees and our total revenue for 2013-14 stood at Rs 49.89 crore. Of this amount, we have spent Rs 20 crore, or over 40per cent of the gross turnover, on research and development.
The company is now planning to expand its export business even as we continue to focus on being a reliable indigenous player. Our recent tie-up with the US-based Rockwell Collins to provide high fidelity solutions to the Indian military is a step towards achieving this goal. We also expect to benefit immensely from the 'Make in India' campaign and foreign direct investment in the defence equipment manufacturing sector.

(Facebook now has a fifth…)
By Ravi Somaiya
MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA: Many of the people who read this article will do so because Greg Marra, 26, a Facebook engineer, calculated that it was the kind of thing they might enjoy.
Marra's team designs the code that drives Facebook's News Feed - the stream of updates, photographs, videos and stories that users see. He is also fast becoming one of the most influential people in the news business.
Facebook now has a fifth of the world - about 1.3 billion people - logging on at least monthly. It drives up to 20 percent of traffic to news sites, according to figures from the analytics company SimpleReach. On mobile devices, the fastest-growing source of readers, the percentage is even higher, SimpleReach says, and continues to increase.
The social media company is increasingly becoming to the news business what Amazon is to book publishing - a behemoth that provides access to hundreds of millions of consumers and wields enormous power. About 30 percent of adults in the United States get their news on Facebook, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. The fortunes of a news site, in short, can rise or fall depending on how it performs in Facebook's News Feed.
Though other services, like Twitter and Google News, can also exert a large influence, Facebook is at the forefront of a fundamental change in how people consume journalism. Most readers now come to it not through the print editions of newspapers and magazines or their home pages online, but through social media and search engines driven by an algorithm, a mathematical formula that predicts what users might want to read.
It is a world of fragments, filtered by code and delivered on demand. For news organizations, said Cory Haik, senior editor for digital news at The Washington Post, the shift represents "the great unbundling" of journalism. Just as the music industry has moved largely from selling albums to songs bought instantly online, publishers are increasingly reaching readers through individual pieces rather than complete editions of newspapers or magazines. A publication's home page, said Edward Kim, a co-founder of SimpleReach, will soon be important more as an advertisement of its brand than as a destination for readers.
"People won't type in WashingtonPost.com anymore," Haik said. "It's search and social."
The shift raises questions about the ability of computers to curate news, a role traditionally played by editors. It also has broader implications for the way people consume information, and thus how they see the world.
  In an interview at Facebook's sprawling headquarters here, which has a giant, self-driving golf cart that takes workers between buildings, Marra said he does not think too much about his impact on journalism.
"We try to explicitly view ourselves as not editors," he said. "We don't want to have editorial judgment over the content that's in your feed. You've made your friends, you've connected to the pages that you want to connect to and you're the best decider for the things that you care about."
In Facebook's work on its users' news feeds, Marra said, "we're saying 'We think that of all the stuff you've connected yourself to, this is the stuff you'd be most interested in reading.'"
Roughly once a week, he and his team of about 16 adjust the complex computer code that decides what to show a user when he or she first logs on to Facebook. The code is based on "thousands and thousands" of metrics, Marra said, including what device a user is on, how many comments or likes a story has received and how long readers spend on an article.
The goal is to identify what users most enjoy, and its results vary around the world. In India, he said, people tend to share what the company calls the ABCDs: astrology, Bollywood, cricket and divinity.
If Facebook's algorithm smiles on a publisher, the rewards, in terms of traffic, can be enormous. If Marra and his team decide that users do not enjoy certain things, such as teaser headlines that lure readers to click through to get all the information, it can mean ruin. When Facebook made changes to its algorithm in February to emphasize higher-quality content, several viral sites that had thrived there, including Upworthy, Distractify and Elite Daily, saw large declines in their traffic.
Facebook executives frame the company's relationship with publishers as mutually beneficial: when publishers promote their content on Facebook, its users have more engaging material to read, and the publishers get increased traffic driven to their sites. Numerous publications, including The New York Times, have met with Facebook officials to discuss how to improve their referral traffic.
The increased traffic can potentially mean that the publisher can increase its advertising rates or convert some of those new readers into subscribers.

UPDATE 1-Ukraine leader wins pro-West mandate but wary of RussiaUPDATE 1-Ukraine leader wins pro-West mandate but wary of Russia
Ukraine voters embrace West and peace withrebelsBy: Press Trust of India | Kiev | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:01 pm
Ukraine’s pro-Western and moderately nationalist parties were on course today to score a crushing election win that boosted President Petro Poroshenko’s bid to merge his ex-Soviet country with Europe and end a pro-Russian revolt. A partial vote count and exit polls showed overwhelming support for Poroshenko’s drive to break his nation of 45 million out of Russia’s orbit despite the painful economic measures the Kremlin has levied on its western neighbour in reprisal.
Results with 30 percent of the precincts reporting had Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk’s People’s Front leading with 21.7 percent of the vote. The president’s Petro Poroshenko Bloc was a a hair behind with 21.6 per cent. Many in Kiev and the West blame the six-month uprising that has killed 3,700 on an attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to destabilise Ukraine’s new government and create a “frozen conflict” in its vital industrial east.
Parties with links to Moscow or the old Viktor Yanukovych regime that was ousted after his abrupt rejection in February of a landmark EU pact were routed at the ballot boxes yesterday. “I want the war to end and for our country to join the European Union, although I doubt this will happen very soon,” pensioner Bogdan Golobutskiy said as he trudged up to a Kiev polling station yesterday.
Radicals that rejected Poroshenko’s peace deal with the insurgents that gave the separatists limited autonomy also had a poor showing as did corruption-tainted politicians who had steered Ukraine through two decades of stuttering reforms. Analysts said it was almost certain that Poroshenko would now have to share power with Yatsenyuk as premier.
“Voters did not want a monopoly of power in one pair of hands. They voted for a Poroshenko-Yatsenyuk tandem,” said Vadym Karasyov of Kiev’s Institute of Global Strategies. A buoyant Poroshenko told the nation that “more than three quarters of voters who took part in the polls gave strong and irreversible backing to Ukraine’s path to Europe.”
The 49-year-old chocolate baron said a majority also supported his search for “political methods” to end the war in the country’s industrial east. Poroshenko and his slightly more hawkish prime minister are within striking distance of the majority needed to form a stable government that could pursue similar policies to those both back now. Yatsenyuk is widely expected to keep his premiership post and help Ukraine negotiate new loan agreements with the West.

Modi-Shah think beyond caste-region in making statepicksPrime Minister Narendra Modi being welcomed by BJP President Amit Shah during the party's parliamentary board meeting to assess the assembly poll results in New Delhi on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:58 pm
The appointment of Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister of Haryana, and the likely elevation of Devendra Fadnavis to the post in Maharashtra, indicate a preference in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah for “organisational work and electoral merit” over traditional calculations of caste and community.
Khattar is only the fifth non-Jat Chief Minister of a state that has traditionally been Jat-dominated. And Fadnavis is a Brahmin, who are only 3.5 per cent of the population of Maharashtra.
The Congress and NCP have always preferred a Maratha as head of government — of the 17 Chief Ministers so far, only seven have been non-Marathas. The Marathas are 30 per cent of the state’s population.
In his 25 years in the BJP, Fadnavis (44), has never been identified as the leader of a particular caste group. The MLA from Nagpur South West is, rather, seen as a meritorious politician who could win the support of people cutting across caste and community lines in all of Maharashtra.
Fadnavis has also been seen as a “neutral” politician who has steered clear of both the Nitin Gadkari and Gopinath Munde camps in the state BJP.
Some 24 hours ahead of the BJP legislature party meeting, a BJP MLA, echoing the view of several dozen colleagues who have already arrived in Mumbai, said on Monday, “The central leadership of the party has taken a decision (on the next Chief Minister) based on merit, which is acceptable. We leave it to higher-ups.”
A senior leader from Marathwada who was close to Munde said, “It is a lesson for all of us. In the past, we would keep switching from one camp to the other to ensure our political security. Modi and Shah have now sent the signal that what matters is loyalty to the organisation. Let your work speak.”
According to a general secretary of the state BJP, “The Modi-Shah combine has signalled a political culture in which merit and hard work alone will count, and the space for manipulators would shrink.”
Several party insiders acknowledged the long hours put in by Shah in producing the BJP’s 123-seat victory in the assembly election. A senior leader told The Indian Express, “Shah would begin work at 10 am at the party headquarters, and would continue well past 4 am the following morning.” According to these insiders, the BJP president receives reports of every development that takes place in the states.
After the central leadership put the lid on the clamour for Nitin Gadkari to lead the state, some voices from North Maharashtra made a pitch for the former Leader of Opposition continued…

Pradeep Burman s foreign bank account is legal: DaburPradip Burman's foreign bank account is legal, says Dabur
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 17:44 IST

Pradip Burman's foreign bank account was "opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account", Dabur India said on Monday in an official statement. Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who was also named by the government in Supreme Court having black money account, has denied having an account in Swiss Bank.
Pradip Burman is a member of the promoter family of Dabur India.
"The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels. We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," the official statement said.
Pradip Burman was once a wholetime director of Dabur India but he does not hold any executive position in the company now.
Dabur India is a 130-year-old fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company that started its journey from erstwhile Calcutta and has around 200 plus products in its portfolio.
Meanwhile, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list.
"I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media, I am shocked," Lodhya told reporters in Rajkot.
"I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department," he said.
Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, "We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us."
Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers.
The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said.
It has two subsidiaries - Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya's firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008.
The central government on Monday disclosed names of three people,  including Pradeep Burman, who are holding bank accounts in foreign  countries and are now under the lens of Income Tax authorities.

Dabur said that Pradip Burman’s account was opened when he was a non-resident Indian, Lodhya denied having a foreign bank account, and Radha Timblo said she needed to study the affidavit before reacting.
“The intention of the present government is clear and unambiguous. The government is keen to unearth black money held abroad and for that purpose it will use all diplomatic and legal means and also all investigative agencies to obtain information that can assist in such unearthing,” the Centre said in the affidavit.

The Congress asked the Modi administration to refrain from “political titillation and playing games”, calling for disclosure of names of all those who had illicit money abroad.
“They are the government. They control ministries and departments. They should act....Do not play games,” said party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
Monday’s affidavit was filed by the income tax (I-T) department in response to a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking that the government take action to bring back India’s black money, estimated by some at nearly $500 billion.
Read:  Govt trying to protect politicians, businessmen, says Ram Jethmalani
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu will hear the black money case on Tuesday. The government is seeking that the court modify an earlier order insisting that all names be revealed; its view is that names should be disclosed only after prosecution is launched against the tax evaders.
The affidavit said that the prosecution against Burman began after the government received information against him from French authorities. It was silent on the sources of information on the others.
The government also informed the court that Switzerland had assured its cooperation, including reaching a treaty on automatic exchange of information with India. It said Swiss authorities had agreed to assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank documents.
HT had on last Wednesday reported the Centre was likely to tell the apex court names of people against whom strong evidence exists of stashing away black money in Swiss banks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is moving fast to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in slush funds or black money stashed abroad, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The government is building pressure particularly on Switzerland, seeking details of Indians who have parked unaccounted for money in the Alpine country's highly secretive banks. It has quickly implemented a Supreme Court directive to set up a high-powered special investigation team , headed by retired judge MB Shah, to look into the issue.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
According to PTI, the Union government told the apex court that Switzerland had indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases probed by the income tax department.
Information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established, the government said.
Even though the government pointed out that it had no intention to withhold names of people who have stashed black money, it also said such names could not be disclosed unless there was prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.
The Centre also noted that every foreign account held by an Indian may not be illegal.
Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had told the Supreme Court that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
There were murmurs of protest within the ruling BJP that not disclosing names would hurt the party's image after it had made bringing back black money, a key issue in a general election that it won by a landslide. The Centre's stand also drew a strong response from the Congress, which accused it of hypocrisy.
Turning the tables on the Congress, finance minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the disclosing of names of people holding black money accounts will embarrass the opposition party.
The previous UPA government had submitted the names of 18 persons who had illegally stashed away money in Liechtenstein to the Supreme Court.
It had come under flak after it opposed the Supreme Court’s direction to set-up a special investigation team (SIT) and its review petition against the court’s verdict was dismissed. The SIT was finally set up by the Modi government within days of its taking over at the Centre.

Chiquita Abandons Plan To Dodge U.S. Taxes In IrelandChiquita Abandons Plan To Dodge U.S. Taxes In Ireland

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Chiquita shareholders have rejected plans to merge with Irish fruit importer Fyffes that would have made the world's largest banana supplier.
Chiquita Brands International Inc. said Friday that the shareholders didn't approve a revised transaction agreement between the two companies during a special shareholders meeting. Chiquita and Fyffes PLC have given notice to terminate their agreement.
The proposed agreement with Fyffes was an all-stock deal, with the companies planning to incorporate in Dublin to take advantage of lower tax rates. Chiquita is now based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
On Monday proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that Chiquita investors support the Fyffes deal because it is the best option for shareholders. ISS had previously said shareholders should vote against the deal because Chiquita might get a better offer elsewhere.
Chiquita President and CEO Edward Lonergan said in a statement that while the company was convinced Fyffes would have been a strong merger partner, the companies "will now go forward as competitors."
Chiquita said it now expects to enter talks with investment firm Safra Group and juice company Cutrale Group on their competing offer of $14.50 per share in cash, or $681 million. Chiquita received the latest bid from the pair on Wednesday after previously rejecting buyout offers from the two Brazilian companies. The prior offer from Safra and Cutrale was $14 per share. They had bid $13 per share in August.
Shares of Chiquita added 49 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $14.25 in morning trading.

Free speech vs. voting rights and abortion rightsBy Will Baude October 25
Dahlia Lithwick has a piece in Slate complaining that the Supreme Court is more protective of some rights than others. It begins:
The Supreme Court of the John Roberts era gets one thing very right: It’s one of the most free-speech-protective courts in modern history. There is no purveyor of semi-pornographic crush videos, no maker of rape-aspiring violent video games, no homophobic funeral protester, no anti-abortion clinic counselor, and no filthy-rich campaign contribution–seeker whose rights and privileges will not be treated by the court with the utmost reverence and solicitude.
This is important and vital, and one doesn’t want to slag the court for the boundless attention and care it lavishes upon the most obnoxious speakers in America. After all, the First Amendment is kind of the constitutional gateway drug, the portal to the rest of the Bill of Rights. And without securing meaningful protection for the rights to speak, assemble, worship, and publish, so many of our other rights might be illusory. Great. Stipulated.
That makes it extra weird whenever the assorted (lets call them largely “conservative”) justices of the Roberts court, and judges on lower courts across the land, turn their attention to the protection of other rights—equally crucial but perhaps less sexy—like, say, the right to vote or to obtain an abortion. …
Lithwick’s basic point is that the right to vote and to obtain an abortion ought to get, but do not get, the same strong protection from the Court as free speech does. She suggests that this is because the Court doesn’t “see the poor and the powerless,” “the hundreds and thousands of voiceless voters and abortion-seekers” or belittles their claims “because they are poor or minorities or just women.”
[This makes me somewhat puzzled by this criticism by Scott Greenfield ( endorsed by Judge Kopf) which reads Lithwick as trying to "horse-trade" or "attack" the free speech cases. I'm not sure that's really a fair characterization of Lithwick's piece, which advocates leveling up, not leveling down.]
But I can’t help but noticing one interesting and important difference between the right to free speech, and the rights to vote or to obtain an abortion. The right to free speech is enumerated in the text of the Constitution. The rights to vote and to obtain an abortion are not — at least not as explicitly.
It’s true that the right to vote is mentioned in a series of constitutional amendments that protect the right from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, etc. But there’s no textual provision that just protects the right in and of itself. And while the voter ID laws that Lithwick writes about have been challenged as discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act, the main constitutional claim against them is that they burden the unenumerated right to vote. Similarly, while there are arguments to derive abortion rights from various textual provisions, I think everybody acknowledges that they aren’t as explicit as the right to freedom of speech.
That makes me wonder if it’s possible that there’s a different explanation for the pattern Lithwick alleges. Maybe it’s not that the Court lacks sympathy for the poor or the vulnerable, or that the other rights are not “sexy.” Maybe the Court thinks that rights that derive from the constitutional text are more powerful, or less subject to common-law doctrinal balancing, than rights that are derived from judicial precedent.
Now maybe this pattern wouldn’t hold if we brought other rights into the picture too. And even if it’s true that the Court treats the constitutional text with greater solicitude than non-textual rights, one could certainly mount arguments against that. Maybe the right to vote and the right to obtain an abortion should be placed on doctrinally equal footing with textually enumerated rights. But since that’s the glaring difference between the three rights Lithwick compares, it seems like that’s the argument she ought to confront.
Will Baude is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he teaches constitutional law and federal courts. His recent articles include Rethinking the Federal Eminent Domain Power, (Yale Law Journal, 2013), and Beyond DOMA: State Choice of Law in Federal Statutes, (Stanford Law Review, 2012).

Yechury waves a red flag over party resolutionCPI(M) leaders at the party office in New Delhi on Sunday. (Express photo by Amit Mehra)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:14 am
The CPI(M)’s bid to change tactics to meet present day political challenges has brought out divisions within the party, with senior leader Sitaram Yechury opposing the stand taken by the Politburo and, by extension, general secretary Prakash Karat. The CPI(M) central committee, during a four-day brainstorming session which started on Sunday, was attempting to revise its political-tactical line, adopted at the party’s Jalandhar Congress in 1978.
During the session, Yechury moved an “alternative document” to the draft review report finalised by the Politburo. He is learnt to have repudiated the conclusions made in the draft report, presented by Karat.
Yechury’s five-page document, circulated among members of the central committee, is learnt to have questioned the Politburo’s opinion that the political-tactical line adopted in 1978 had many shortcomings, which hampered its expansion outside Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, and its consolidation in the three states. This comes in the wake of a drubbing received by the party in the Lok Sabha elections.
One of the key directives of the Jalandhar Congress, held in the aftermath of the Emergency, was to forge the unity of Left and democratic forces to defeat the Congress. The party applied the “united front tactics” with what it called “various bourgeois-landlord parties” in several states and at the national level over the years fairly successfully.
The draft finalised by the Politburo is learnt to have concluded that the effort to mobilise the regional parties into a third front has proved to be unrealistic and erroneous.
Yechury, on the other hand, believes that there is nothing wrong with the 1978 line and argues that it failed because of shortcomings and “subjectivism” in implementation in the last decade. He further argues that this, along with organisational weaknesses, is to blame for the electoral setbacks.
Yechury’s repudiation of the official draft is the latest incident in the tug of war between him and Karat. His stress on shortcomings in implementation in the last decade is significant, given that Karat succeeded Harkishan Singh Surjeet as general secretary in 2005. Karat’s stint at the CPM’s helm comes to an end next year and the latest tiff comes in the backdrop of a succession war.
Sources said that Yechury had conveyed his point of view in the Politburo meeting held on October 13 and 14, but the Karat camp had the upper hand, because of which the draft was accepted for consideration by the central committee. Yechury, however, did not relent and moved his objections in the form of a note.
What complicated the exercise is the decision of another Politburo member, B V Raghavulu, to place his “views” in the form of a separate note. It is rare for Politburo members to present such notes before the central committee after the Politburo reaches a conclusion on an issue.

Tharoor lauds PM again for bringing sanitation to forefrontPrint
Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:35 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 2:39 am
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appreciating the clean-up campaign he launched in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram a day ago. He also lauded Modi for catapulting the sanitation programme to the “forefront of the national consciousness.”
Tharoor was recently removed from the post of Congress spokesperson after the Kerala unit of the party sought action against him for his praise of Modi and his support to Swachh Bharat initiative.
Disregarding the opposition he faced, Tharoor launched the cleanliness drive at Vizhinjam coast on Saturday, which was promptly acknowledged by Modi who called Tharoor’s effort a “great effort” and tweeted that Tharoor’s “active participation in the Swachh Bharat mission is very encouraging”.
On Sunday, Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive. “Thank you narendramodi ji. Here’s a video of my clean-up & a request to you,” he tweeted. The request was for central assistance to clean up a polluted water body — Parvathy Puthanar — in Thiruvananthapuram. Tharoor, however, said that his action has no political significance.
“To my mind there is no political significance to this event. I didn’t see it as a political activity. But rather to me it was part of a national mission. After all, it was Mahatma Gandhi who declared before Independence that sanitation was more important than Independence… The first Congress government of India led by Jawaharlal Nehru gave the nation its first rural sanitation programme.
The NDA under (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee turned it into a total sanitation programme. The UPA government under Manmohan Singh expanded and enlarged this progamme. And I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has continued the UPA’s good work by re-baptising it as Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and raising it to the forefront of the national consciousness,” Tharoor said in his video message.
His Twitter bonhomie with Modi has once again raised the hackles of his partymen.
Senior Congress leader from Kerala K Muraleedharan said: “It could be because of his (Tharoor’s) political immaturity. He could have done all this before Modi’s announcement. He ceased to be a minister four five months ago. He could have led the cleanliness drive immediately after that. He could have done it when the Kerala government launched the clean Kerala mission.”

Police to submit report to Mudgal panel todayTweet
0
Dhoni and Raina - under the scannerA high-ranking police team investigating the 2013 IPL betting-fixing scandal is scheduled to submit its report to the Supreme Court-appointed Mukul Mudgal committee here on Monday.
The Mudgal committee will meet for the next four days consecutively, and submit its final report to the Supreme Court on November 3, said a source close to the panel. The next date of hearing is on November 10.
The police team was tasked to probe 13 persons, whose names the Mudgal committee had submitted to the apex court in a sealed envelope in February, along with its first investigation report into the scandal.
Of the 13 persons, the court only disclosed the name of BCCI president N. Srinivasan. The source said that among the rest, there are six international cricketers - widely believed to include India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina - and three first-class players. It is learnt that Dhoni and Raina were quizzed in Delhi recently when they came to the city to play the second One-Day International against West Indies on October 11.
AMONG the other three persons, one is Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of the sidelined BCCI president Srinivasan, who allegedly placed bets on IPL matches, and the other two are said to be small-time Bollywood actor Vindoo Dara Singh and Raj Kundra, co-owner of Rajasthan Royals, whose players were in the thick of the betting-fixing action.
"Whatever interrogation is being done this time, it's being done by the police team. The panel will collect the report from the police and then it'll decide," said the source. "The panel had told them to do it [probe] on their own and that's the best way," the source told MAIL TODAY.
The committee is likely to base its final report on the findings of the police team, besides its own analysis. "The panel will submit the report based on whatever they [the police investigators] have found. It will discuss the evidence and their report, and will then come to a conclusion," said the source.
The four-member police team is headed by 1983 batch IPS officer Bibhuti Bhusana Mishra, currently a Deputy Director General (Operations) of the Narcotics Control Bureau based at its New Delhi headquarters.
"The final discussions will start tomorrow and will go on for the next three days consecutively after that - from October 27 to 30. And the report will be submitted to the Supreme Court on November 3," the source informed.
"The police team has finished interviewing people and will submit its report to the panel tomorrow. The committee members will discuss the police report and analyse it before submitting their own report to the Supreme Court," he said.
"The police team is very good and doing a very thorough job. After all, the police commissioners of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have deputed them for the probe. The panel is very happy with them."
About the identity of the 13 persons under the scanner, the source said: "There are six international players and three non-internationals. We cannot name them because if their names don't come out [as guilty]... we cannot spoil their careers. He said the Supreme Court itself has disclosed Srinivasan's name and added that another would "obviously be Meiyappan", besides Vindoo and Kundra.

BJP approach over black money reflects black mind of its leaders: NitishKumarBy: Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:05 pm
Janata Dal (United) Monday made a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi government over its affidavit on black money saying it reflected BJP leaders’ “black mind” and mocked the party as “Bhrasht Jhoothi Party”.
“Kale dhan par BJP ka rukh unke kale maan ko dikhata hai (The approach of BJP on the issue of black money reflects black mind of its leaders),” senior JD(U) and former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on his facebook account.
He has also lampooned the PM and his predecessor Manmohan Singh through pictures to drive home his point.
“The party which had sought votes in the general election on the issue of corruption and black money during its five month tenure has come out with only three names which also they are not confirming,” Kumar, a known rival of Prime Minister Modi, said reacting to the Centre’s affidavit before the Supreme Court in the black money case.
“Kya is desh mein kewal teen logo ke pass kala dhan hain (do only three persons in the country have blackmoney)?” he said in his sarcastic comment.
“Everyday a new issue of BJP falsehood and fraud comes before people…BJP has become synonymous with ‘Bhrasht Jhooti Party’,” the senior JD(U) leader, who led his party’s snapping of ties with BJP last year over elevation of Modi, said.
Kumar’s hard-hitting comments came on a day when he is meeting JD(U) MPs, MLAs and office bearers on his 16-day “Samparak yatra” starting from November 13 ahead of crucial Assembly poll next year.

India to consider sugar export incentive af...The govt gave 3,300 rupees a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 mn tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India will consider extending the incentives for raw sugar exports after Oct. 29 when leading cane growing states forecast their sugar output for the new season beginning October, two government sources said on Monday.
"The cane commissioners of leading cane growing states will present their estimates on Oct. 29 and that will set the ball rolling for a decision on raw sugar export subsidy in 2014/15," a government official with direct knowledge of the matter, said.
In February, the government gave 3,300 rupees ($53.82) a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
However, a delay in extending the incentives for the new 2014/15 season had led to misgivings in some quarters that New Delhi was against giving subsidy for overseas shipments of raw sugar.

Rajiv Gandhi assassination: Apex court dismisses Nalinis pleaRajiv Gandhi assassination: Apex court dismisses Nalini’s plea
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Supreme Court today dismissed the plea of S Nalini, undergoing life imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, challenging the law mandating the Centre’s approval for her release and that of six other convicts.
“Sorry, we are not interested,” a Bench comprising Chief Justice HL Dattu and justices MB Lokur and AK Sikri said.
Nalini had challenged Section 435(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which mandates the state government to consult the Centre before premature release of a convict if the case was investigated by the CBI.
She has been in jail for the last 23 years and undergoing life imprisonment after her death sentence was commuted. She was sentenced to death by the trial court in the case on January 28, 1998.
Nalini’s death sentence was commuted to life term by the Tamil Nadu Governor on April 24, 2000.
“Though 2,200 life convicts who had put in less than 10 years of imprisonment were prematurely released by the Tamil Nadu Government during the last about 15 years, she was excluded from consideration for premature release only on the ground that her offence was investigated by the CBI, that is, her case was covered by Section 435(1)(a) CrPC. The said Section is unconstitutional,” her petition said.
The Centre had earlier contended that the Tamil Nadu Government can’t release the convicts without its approval and had derailed the state government’s decision to release them.
After the apex court had commuted the death sentence of convicts Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan, the Tamil Nadu government on February 19 had proposed to remit the sentences of all seven lifers, including the three, and release them.

Kolkata, Oct 27:  
Development financial institution IFCI Ltd has planned to reduce its non-performing assets by two percentage points this financial year. Achal Kumar Gupta, Deputy Managing Director, IFCL, told presspersons that the non-deposit taking NBFC recently executed an NPA sale deal worth Rs 200 crore with an asset reconstruction company.
"After the RBI allowed us the CDR window this year, we are also actively looking at using that route for reducing the net NPA," he added.
Sudhir Garg, Executive Director of IFCI, said by the end of the first quarter, IFCI's net NPA dropped to around 10 per cent from 11.39 per cent on March 31, 2014.
Garg said a significant part of the net NPA of the development financial institution was related to the legacy loan book. "We have made 100 provisionings against such loan accounts," he added.
The size of net advances as of June 30, 2014, stands at Rs 19,848 crore, up from Rs 13,946 crore a year ago.
The officials were here for a road show for its secured redeemable non-convertible debentures worth Rs 2,000 crore. The officials said IFCI's funding requirement for 2014-15 was set at around Rs 10,000 crore, of which it has raised Rs 2,000 crore through borrowing already.
Sravanthi Energy, DB Hospitality, Surana Industries, Shiv Vani Oil and Gas, Blue Coast Hotels, Orchid Chemicals, Skill Infrastructure, Era Housing, Murli Industries and Coastal Projects were the top ten NPA accounts of IFCI, collectively worth 1,449.24 crore of credit exposure.

Counter-edit: Why the Sena must not succumb to temptation of joining thegovtMonday's editorial is a publicly offered olive branch -- but Sena leaders have also been accepting in private that the party's stand on taking the BJP head-on is in the process of unravelling. (Source: IE archive)
Written by Kavitha Iyer | Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:37 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 5:37 pm
 
Hungering for power after 15 years on Opposition benches, the Shiv Sena seems to be wolfing down humble pie. Monday’s editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna, heaping praise on Amit Shah for the BJP’s “win”, is a far cry from the self congratulatory observation, on the morning after counting, that it had robbed the BJP of a clear win.
Monday’s editorial is a publicly offered olive branch — but Sena leaders have also been accepting in private that the party’s stand on taking the BJP head-on is in the process of unravelling.
While it appears increasingly likely that the Sena will make a delayed entry into the Maharashtra government following negotiations, the arguments for it to refrain from doing so appears compelling. Here’s why the Sena might want to stay off the gravy train for now:
1. For the sake of the future: The decision to go it alone was not based only on who gets to be chief minister. Some hard-nosed analysis had produced the conclusion that ceding seats to the BJP carried with it a real danger of the national juggernaut destroying the smaller party, even if it was an ally of 25 years. The Sena has grown from 44 MLAs to 63 — despite the fact that the party has always had limited presence outside Mumbai and Konkan, and it has come in the face of the BJP’s exceedingly well-oiled election machinery, with a starcast of campaigners led by the Prime Minister himself.
2. To not be seen as having sold out: The voice of the average Shiv Sainik is different from the voice of the small group within the party that stands to gain from entering the government. The Marathi manoos who found appeal in the Shiv Sena’s Marathi versus Gujarati pitch, even if it appears to be bringing diminishing returns, would no doubt see the party’s decision to join the government as a sellout.
3. To give Uddhav a chance: If the huge turnouts at his election rallies and some emotional, rousing speeches were any indication, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has come of age. He has steered the Sena to a position where it is currently the only regional party to have withstood the BJP’s electoral might. In the Opposition, he would hold the moral high ground — not only over the discredited Congress and NCP, but also over the BJP that would require the NCP to abstain on every legislation or policy matter. This could be an opportunity — and a force-multiplier — for the Sena.
4. Because the gains aren’t that much: There are minimal gains from being in power. Issues of urban development that the Sena has been unable to tackle effectively in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation could get a leg-up, continued…

On suspicion of witchcraft  woman stripped  killed inpublicPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:31 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 4:37 pm
Twelve persons have been arrested for the alleged daylight murder of a 55-year-old woman Dukulhin Bai on suspicion of practising witchcraft in Bemetra district. All the accused are the relatives of the victim including her brother-in-law Nakul Patel and his wife Ankalhin Bai. According to Bemetara SP Narendra Khare, Patel’s son was unwell for several months and he suspected that Dukulhin had practised witchcraft on him.
Patel and Ankalhin led a mob of nearly two dozen relatives and barged into Dukulhin’s home in Banjarpur village late on Saturday evening. The village is around 50 km from the district headquarters.
They dragged her outside, took her to the village chowk and stripped her before public. All the while her husband, son and entire village remained silent spectator.
“They dragged my mother out of the home. I and my father tried to resist but they were too many,” Dukulhin’s 20-year-old son Ashok Patel said.
The crowd inserted red pepper in her mouth, nostrils and private parts, kicked her and thrashed her badly with sticks. “Entire village watched her but no one came forward for help,” Ashok said.
She sustained serious injuries and was taken to a nearby health centre later at night where doctors declared her dead. All the accused were arrested on Sunday evening.
“This is a family dispute. They killed her on suspicion of witchcraft,” Khare said.
Chhattisgarh has enacted a penal law that invites strict punishment for causing injury to women on suspicion of witchcraft.  Even calling a woman “tonhi” ( a woman who practices witchcraft) may bring imprisonment for three years, but tribal and rural areas of the state often see such violence.
Such is the extent of violence against women on this account, that even the relatives of ruling BJP leaders have complained of it. In March 2013, Hemanti Sai, the daughter-in-law of BJP’s tribal MP Nand Kumar Sai, blamed her in-laws for terming her a “tonhi” and expelling her from home.
In a related incident, two villagers were killed and at least six were injured in police firing in a village of Gariyaband district in June. The police had gone to the village following a complaint by a woman that some villagers tortured her and called her a “tonhi”.  As the police reached the spot, villagers got angry, set her home on fire and attacked the police team.

Pradeep Burman s foreign bank account is legal  says DaburPradip Burman's foreign bank account is legal, says Dabur
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 17:44 IST

Pradip Burman's foreign bank account was "opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account", Dabur India said on Monday in an official statement. Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who was also named by the government in Supreme Court having black money account, has denied having an account in Swiss Bank.
Pradip Burman is a member of the promoter family of Dabur India.
"The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels. We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," the official statement said.
Pradip Burman was once a wholetime director of Dabur India but he does not hold any executive position in the company now.
Dabur India is a 130-year-old fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company that started its journey from erstwhile Calcutta and has around 200 plus products in its portfolio.
Meanwhile, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list.
"I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media, I am shocked," Lodhya told reporters in Rajkot.
"I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department," he said.
Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, "We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us."
Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers.
The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said.
It has two subsidiaries - Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya's firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008.
The central government on Monday disclosed names of three people,  including Pradeep Burman, who are holding bank accounts in foreign  countries and are now under the lens of Income Tax authorities.

What s Really Killing McDonald sreddit
Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. Photographer: Noriyuki Aida/Bloomberg via Getty Images
As sales and profits have crumbled at McDonald's recently, some observers have blamed low-income Americans, saying they must not be able to afford Big Macs any more.
But that's wrong. If anything, Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. The real problem is that the iconic chain needs to win back its true base: middle-class Americans looking for a cheap, quick meal.
For the past 11 months, sales at U.S. McDonald's restaurants open at least a year -- a key measure of an eatery's health -- have fallen or remained flat. The company announced earlier this week that U.S. same-store sales fell 4.1 percent in September, the worst monthly drop in more than a decade, and that profits plunged 30 percent in its latest quarter. The company's stock price has tumbled about 11 percent over the past six months.
One common explanation for McDonald's woes is that low-income Americans are suffering from a sluggish recovery and unable to afford eating out at McDonald's any more.
But the numbers don't back up that take. For one thing, McDonald's has actually become more of a bargain relative to other food options in recent years: McDonald’s prices haven’t risen as quickly as prices at fast-casual eateries like Panera Bread, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. Nor have they risen as quickly as broader food inflation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data:
McDonald's menu prices grew more slowly than prices at fast-casual chains and food inflation overall between 2009 and 2014.
And yet diners are still flocking to other chains despite their typically higher costs. When Chipotle raised menu prices earlier this year, customers didn’t bat an eye -- the chain reported a profit jump of 25 percent the following quarter. That suggests McDonald's problem isn't so much pricing, but a perception that its food isn't worth any price -- unlike, say, Chipotle, which has positioned itself as offering fast, fresh and quality food for which customers are willing to pay more.
Unlike Walmart, whose fortunes have largely mirrored that of the poor , McDonald’s doesn’t take food stamps. That makes it an unlikely regular destination for low-income Americans, according to Joel Berg, the author of “All You Can Eat? How Hungry Is America?”
In fact, a 2011 study from the University of California-Davis found that fast-food consumption actually rises with income, until incomes reach about $60,000.
“That conventional wisdom is wrong,” Berg said of the notion that poor people are more likely to eat at places like McDonald’s.
Given the strength of that conventional wisdom, it's likely going to take a full revamp of McDonald's image to convince the middle-class customers who have fled the chain that it offers more than just cheap burgers for people who can’t afford anything better. What has been the quintessential McDonald’s experience for decades -- inexpensive food that tastes the same everywhere -- just isn’t as appealing any more.
To fix this, the company is working to convince diners it sells “fresh, quality food” at a reasonable price, partly through "transparency initiatives" like a campaign last week asking people to submit questions about its food, according to Heidi Barker, a McDonald's spokeswoman.
"McDonald’s appeals to customers of many diverse backgrounds and lifestyles," Barker wrote in an e-mail statement. "There’s value at every level of the menu, from our Dollar Menu and More to our premium sandwiches and salads, and McCafe beverages."
It could be a hard sell, as McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson acknowledged on a conference call with analysts Tuesday.
“The question is whether or not our value and our food options are resonating as strongly," he said. "I believe that that is the fundamental basis of some of the challenges that we are having.”

Ottawa shooter made video before attack: Policeprint
The shooter who rampaged through Canada's parliament took a video of himself just before the attack and was inspired by ideological and political motives, police said Sunday, contradicting the claims of his estranged mother.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who was shot dead by police in the parliament in Ottawa after killing a soldier Wednesday, was mentally ill and wanted to die, his mother wrote in a lengthy separate statement to the public.
But labeling it "a terrorist attack," Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Bob Paulson said that the 32-year-old "was driven by ideological and political motives. Zehaf-Bibeau had prepared a video recording of himself just prior to conducting this attack.
A man identified by Royal Canadian Mounted Police as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is seen on Wednesday as he exits a car and runs toward the parliament buildings in a still image taken from surveillance video released by the RCMP.  REUTERS
"The RCMP is conducting a detailed analysis of the video for evidence and intelligence."
In her letter to Postmedia News, published in Sunday's edition of the National Post, the killer's mother Susan Bibeau said her estranged son had wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to study Islam and the Koran, not Syria to join militant fighters -- as stated before by police.
But when his passport application was repeatedly denied, Zehaf-Bibeau felt trapped, "unable to stay in the life he was in, unable to move on to the next one he wanted to go to," his mother wrote.
"He was mad and felt trapped so the only way out was death."
She stressed that, while "horrified" by her son's actions, he had suffered from deep psychological problems.
Zehaf-Bibeau killed a soldier and attempted to storm parliament before the assembly's sergeant-at-arms shot him dead.
The attack -- the second in a week targeting Canadian military personnel on home soil -- came as Canadian jets were to join the US-led bombing campaign against Islamist militants in Iraq.
Police were investigating Zehaf-Bibeau's interactions with "numerous individuals" in the days leading up to the attack, Paulson said, adding that the young Canadian had saved up a considerable amount of money from working in oil fields.
Also in the National Post, RCMP Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana acknowledged that earlier police statements that Zehaf-Bibeau had intended to travel to Syria were incorrect.

Rite Aid  CVS block Apple Pay  as a rival ma...Two drug chains disable Apple Pay, as a rival makes plans

(Over the weekend, Rite Aid…)
By Mike Isaac
Apple Pay, the Silicon Valley giant's highly anticipated mobile wallet, has been available for only one week but already may be inciting a battle within the payments industry.
Over the weekend, Rite Aid and CVS disabled Apple Pay from working in their stores nationwide. The reason was not immediately clear.
Ashley Flower, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said the company "does not currently accept Apple Pay." She added that Rite Aid was "still in the process of evaluating our mobile payment options."
Representatives from CVS did not respond to repeated telephone and email requests for comment on Sunday.
Analysts said disabling acceptance of Apple Pay was a way to favor a rival system that is not yet available but is being developed by a consortium of merchants known as Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX. Rite Aid and CVS are part of that consortium, not part of the group of retailers that had teamed up with Apple on its payment system. Nonetheless, over the week, Apple Pay technology was working in Rite Aid and CVS stores.
"Clearly Rite Aid and CVS are making a business decision over a customer satisfaction decision," said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy.
He added that the move could upset consumers who believe Apple's new product is easier and safer than paying with a traditional credit card.
Apple declined to comment on the stores' action. An executive at MasterCard, which has teamed with Apple on its new system, said Rite Aid and CVS made the wrong decision.
"We think consumers should have the ability to pay any way they want," said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.
"Rite Aid and CVS have been accepting contactless payments for quite a long time," McLaughlin added. "We look forward to them turning the functionality back on in their stores."
Apple has not released data on how popular its new product is. But on Apple Pay's first day, at Chase banking services seven times more people added Chase credit cards to Apple Pay than signed up for new credit cards, Avin Arumugam, Chase's digital executive director, said in an interview with Bloomberg.
A great deal is at stake. MCX's payments system helps merchants keep track of customer shopping habits across the dozens of merchants who plan to accept the payment product. That is a potential treasure trove of data for retailers, who wish to better target consumers with deals and loyalty programs.
This also gives retailers the potential ability to cut credit card companies out of the payments process entirely. MCX's system, CurrentC, will be linked to a consumer's debit account, according to the company's description of the product. By bypassing credit card companies, MCX merchants could potentially save money on the fees they pay per transaction.
MCX retailers include large chains like Best Buy , Gap Inc. and Wal-Mart . Overall, they represent more than $1 trillion in annual sales, 110,000 total stores and more than one-fifth of total U.S. retail sales volume, according to the coalition.
Technology companies like Google and PayPal, as well as mobile carriers like Verizon and AT&T, have all tried - and failed - to persuade consumers to pay for things with their smartphones.
But many believe that if any company can gain consumer adoption quickly, it's Apple.
"Apple actually has a really good shot at being successful here because they've solved a lot of fundamental issues that others haven't in the past," Moorhead said. "In particular, the user experience issue. It's simple, easy and secure to use."
Apple Pay, which works only with the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices, essentially supplants traditional credit cards, allowing users to pay for items at a retailer's cash register with little more than a wave of their smartphone. The product communicates with payment terminals equipped with so-called near-field communication technology at the checkout counter; currently more than 220,000 retailers accept this technology.
CurrentC will not be available until 2015. When it is released, consumers will be able to download an app and connect it to their debit accounts. Then, every time a person makes a purchase, the merchant must scan a QR code, a special symbol that acts much like a bar code and initiates the payment transfer.
MCX naysayers say that CurrentC is more difficult to use than Apple Pay, which does not require customers to unlock their phones or open an app. And they say it is far more complicated than paying with cash or a credit card.
MCX has time, however, to alter its strategy before releasing its product. And since MCX merchants are all working together, CurrentC could offer consumers enticing deals and loyalty rewards for shopping at any one of the dozens of participating stores.
The battle will surely escalate in the coming months as companies like PayPal and Google update their mobile wallet strategy to deal with the fast-changing market. But for now, many are betting on Apple Pay as the mobile wallet to beat.
"Apple Pay is the most convenient, most secure, and what's best for consumers," McLaughlin of MasterCard said. "That's what will win out in the end."

Why America needs public investmentWhy America needs public investment

(Banks are holding almost…)
By Paul Krugman
America used to be a country that built for the future. Sometimes the government built directly: Public projects, from the Erie Canal to the Interstate Highway System, provided the backbone for economic growth. Sometimes it provided incentives to the private sector, like land grants to spur railroad construction. Either way, there was broad support for spending that would make us richer.
But nowadays we simply won't invest, even when the need is obvious and the timing couldn't be better. And don't tell me that the problem is "political dysfunction" or some other weasel phrase that diffuses the blame. Our inability to invest doesn't reflect something wrong with "Washington"; it reflects the destructive ideology that has taken over the Republican Party.
Some background: More than seven years have passed since the housing bubble burst, and ever since, America has been awash in savings - or more accurately, desired savings - with nowhere to go. Borrowing to buy homes has recovered a bit, but remains low. Corporations are earning huge profits, but are reluctant to invest in the face of weak consumer demand, so they're accumulating cash or buying back their own stock. Banks are holding almost $2.7 trillion in excess reserves - funds they could lend out, but choose instead to leave idle.
And the mismatch between desired saving and the willingness to invest has kept the economy depressed. Remember, your spending is my income and my spending is your income, so if everyone tries to spend less at the same time, everyone's income falls.
There's an obvious policy response to this situation: public investment. We have huge infrastructure needs, especially in water and transportation, and the federal government can borrow incredibly cheaply - in fact, interest rates on inflation-protected bonds have been negative much of the time (they're currently just 0.4 per cent). So borrowing to build roads, repair sewers and more seems like a no-brainer. But what has actually happened is the reverse. After briefly rising after the Obama stimulus went into effect, public construction spending has plunged. Why?
In a direct sense, much of the fall in public investment reflects the fiscal troubles of state and local governments, which account for the great bulk of public investment.
These governments generally must, by law, balance their budgets, but they saw revenues plunge and some expenses rise in a depressed economy. So they delayed or canceled a lot of construction to save cash.
Yet this didn't have to happen. The federal government could easily have provided aid to the states to help them spend - in fact, the stimulus bill included such aid, which was one main reason public investment briefly increased. But once the GOP took control of the House, any chance of more money for infrastructure vanished. Once in a while Republicans would talk about wanting to spend more, but they blocked every Obama administration initiative.
And it's all about ideology, an overwhelming hostility to government spending of any kind. This hostility began as an attack on social programs, especially those that aid the poor, but over time it has broadened into opposition to any kind of spending, no matter how necessary and no matter what the state of the economy.
You can get a sense of this ideology at work in some of the documents produced by House Republicans under the leadership of Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Budget Committee . For example, a 2011 manifesto titled "Spend Less, Owe Less, Grow the Economy" called for sharp spending cuts even in the face of high unemployment , and dismissed as "Keynesian" the notion that "decreasing government outlays for infrastructure lessens government investment." (I thought that was just arithmetic, but what do I know?) Or take a Wall Street Journal editorial from the same year titled "The Great Misallocators," asserting that any money the government spends diverts resources away from the private sector, which would always make better use of those resources.
Never mind that the economic models underlying such assertions have failed dramatically in practice, that the people who say such things have been predicting runaway inflation and soaring interest rates year after year and keep being wrong; these aren't the kind of people who reconsider their views in the light of evidence. Never mind the obvious point that the private sector doesn't and won't supply most kinds of infrastructure, from local roads to sewer systems; such distinctions have been lost amid the chants of private sector good, government bad.
And the result, as I said, is that America has turned its back on its own history. We need public investment; at a time of very low interest rates, we could easily afford it. But build we won't.

Goldman cuts 2015 oil price forecast as output tops demandGoldman slashes 2015 oil price forecast as output tops demand
Aaron Sheldrick     Tokyo/Singapore   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 17:56 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Goldman Sachs has slashed its 2015 oil price forecasts, making it the most bearish among major financial institutions, following a near 25 per cent fall in crude prices over the past five months.
The US investment bank said rising output will outstrip demand - and its new numbers weighed further on benchmark Brent crude prices - as forecasters generally pare back estimates for oil due to slowing global growth, a strengthening dollar and ample supplies.
Goldman analysts said in a report released late on Sunday that they expect US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)crude to fall to $75 a barrel and Brent to $85 a barrel in the first quarter of 2015, both down $15 a barrel from their previous forecast.
WTI could fall as low as $70 in the second quarter and Brent as low as $80, when oversupply would be the most pronounced, before returning to first-quarter levels, Goldman said.
Goldman's projections contrast with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago. He is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team cut their first quarter Brent forecast to $98 but pared back their forecast for calendar 2015 by just $5, to $105 a barrel.
Brent crude futures dipped 0.3 per cent on Monday to less than $86 a barrel, extending their decline despite a continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery, said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research & Consulting.
"I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman," Akuta said.
NYMEX crude for December delivery was up 4 cents at $81.05 a barrel by 0848 GMT, after settling down $1.08 on Friday following a spike up on Thursday.
If WTI fell to $70 a barrel next year, as Goldman Sachs is forecasting, it would be the US benchmark's lowest level since mid-2010.
RISING OUTPUT
Goldman said production outside OPEC countries was expected to accelerate, led by Brazil and drilling in the Gulf of Mexico with the end of extensive deep-water maintenance following the 2010 Macondo disaster.
Non OPEC-production outside the US lower 48 states is forecast to increase by 412,000 barrels per day this year, 573,000 bpd in 2015 and 505,000 bpd in 2016.
Output from Brazil's Santos basin is forecast to start to pick up, increasing Brazilian output by 206,000 bpd in 2014 and 325,000 bpd next year. Gulf of Mexico production is expected to increase by 155,000 bpd in 2015.
Among OPEC countries, Iraqi production is seen increasing by 200,000 bpd and Libya's output stabilising at about 700,000 bpd, compared with recent production of about 900,000 bpd.
Iranian production and exports are unlikely to see further growth because Goldman analysts do not expect a resolution to the country's nuclear dispute with the West by the Nov. 24 deadline, meaning sanctions on Tehran will not be lifted.
On the demand side, growth has only averaged 630,000 barrels per day year-on-year so far, less than half Goldman's initial forecast for 2014, the report said.
Global economic growth is forecast by Goldman analysts to increase to 3.5 per cent next year but there is a "risk that the historical relationship between global GDP growth and oil demand has weakened," the report said.
SHALE IMPACT
In the United States, rising shale production is increasingly affecting global energy flows and eroding OPEC's pricing power, Goldman said.
Anthony Jude, a senior adviser on energy and sustainable development matters for the Asian Development Bank , cited falling US oil imports as the primary reason for lower global oil prices.
The United States is "producing an additional 3 million barrels per day because of shale oil", he said on Monday on the sidelines of Singapore International Energy Week.
US crude oil imports have fallen to 7.0 million-7.6 million bpd from peaks above 10 million bpd in 2005 and 2006 since the advent of the shale oil and gas boom, according to data posted on the website of the US Energy Information Administration.
"US shale is the marginal swing barrel in the new order," Goldman said, adding that a slowdown in production will happen when WTI falls to $75 per barrel.
"US shale oil production has continued to surprise to the upside with US domestic oil prices incentivising strong investment," the report said.
Once prices fall and US production slows, Goldman expects cutbacks among OPEC producers including Saudi Arabia, which has been content to let prices fall in the hope of forcing US shale producers out of the market.
"Any near-term OPEC production cut will be modest until there is sufficient evidence of a slowdown in US shale oil production growth," the report said.

One killed in clash between TMC and BJPsupportersPolicemen carry an injured villager after the clash at Makra village in Birbhum on Monday. (PTI)
Written by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata | Posted: October 28, 2014 2:06 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 2:54 am
Three persons were killed and one sustained critical bullet injuries while at least five housed were gutted in a clash between Trinamool Congress and BJP supporters Monday at Makra village under Parui police station area in Birbhum district of West Bengal.
A strong police contingent under Additional Superintendent of Police Ananda Roy was present on the spot, sources said, adding that it failed to stop the violence.
The deceased were identified as Tausif Sheikh, 16, Soleman Sheikh, 25, and Mozzamel whose age could not be ascertained, police sources said.
While Tuasif and Mozzamel were from Makra village, Soleman was a resident of neighbouring Dubrajpur village. All three sustained bullet injuries from country-made pistols. Another Makra villager, Enamul Sheikh, too sustained bullet injuries and was admitted to a local hospital.
No arrests were made till the last reports came in.
The nearly three-hour-long violence, which broke out early morning, saw gunbattles and bomb attacks. It came at a time when National Security Advisor Ajit Doval along with NSG DG J N Chowdhury, and special secretary (internal security) Prakash Misra were inspecting the October 2 blast site in neighbouring Burdwan, just about 50 km away.
The clash, the sources said, broke out as the TMC tried to capture Makra village, which is considered a BJP stronghold and which has a mostly Muslim population. The violence captured live by regional channels showed villagers, even women, running with firearms, bombs and other weapons.
A police team lead by Alok Rajoria, SP, Birbhum, could enter the village nearly three hours after the clashes broke and started rescuing the injured.
Trading charges, both TMC and BJP have blamed each other for the violence.
District BJP leaders claimed that Tausif was a party supporter as he belonged to Makra village, their stronghold. They claimed a large number of villages in the area have become their supporters and the TMC was targeting them.
District TMC president Anubrata Mondal, however, claimed that all three victims belonged to his party.

Guwahati, Oct 27:  
The missing Executive Director designate of Indian Oil Corporation Kaushik Bora was found today near a jungle inside the complex of an oil well near Digboi in Upper Assam, police said.
Tinsukia Additional Superintendent of Police Lamhao Dongol said Bora was spotted this afternoon within just one kilometre from where his car was found last evening.
“Bora was perfectly fine and was found towards the jungle side within the oil well compound in the area. It is not a case of kidnapping. What we could gather from our investigation is that he is suffering from depression and he went himself,” Dongol said.
He said Bora’s wife had informed that he was taken to Apollo Hospital in New Delhi earlier this month.
Bora, who was to be promoted to the post of Executive Director of the Digboi Refinery of IOC, left his home yesterday in the afternoon for work but no news of him was received till evening.
His car was found from Digboi-Pengeri road near an oil well.

New Delhi, Oct. 27:  
Software services firm Infosys today said it has worked with UCAS on its busiest day of the year to place a record number of students at universities and colleges in the UK.
Infosys was appointed to support the technology system of UCAS earlier in 2014. A joint UCAS and Infosys team worked over a number of months to ensure the systems could handle the massive workload required on August 14, A-level results day.
“Five million exam results were successfully uploaded to UCAS systems from over 130 files supplied by 36 awarding bodies. Around one million student logins were received from countries across the globe on multiple different channels and devices and the highest load recorded was a peak of 239 logins per second,” Infosys said in a statement.
Months of advanced planning with Infosys enabled UCAS to deliver A-level results day Confirmation and Clearing service, meaning hundreds of thousands of students were able to log in that morning to see if they had secured their place at university or college, UCAS Director IT James Munson said.

Shiv Sena talks sweet  backs BJP for CM post  favourscoalitionComments
Shiv Sena on Monday appeared resigned to backing it in government formation but there was no clarity yet on whether it will join the ministry.
As BJP prepared to elect the leader of its legislature party on Tuesday who will be the party’s first Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena on Monday appeared resigned to backing it in government formation but there was no clarity yet on whether it will join the ministry.
The newly elected BJP MLAs will meet here at 11 am tomorrow in the presence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and party’s general secretary in-charge of the state J P Nadda to elect their leader.
“After the legislature party leader is elected, we will call on Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and stake claim to form government tomorrow itself,” BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told PTI.
State BJP president Devendra Fadnavis, 44, is being seen as clear favourite for Chief Minister’s post.
According to party sources, the new government will be sworn in on October 31 in the presence of top central leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several of his Cabinet colleagues and BJP Chief Ministers.
Speaking openly in favour of a BJP-led coalition government for the first time, senior Sena leader and spokesman Sanjay Raut said it will be a “stable” dispensation.
“If Shiv Sena and BJP come together to form a government it will be stable. Our ties with BJP are very old. Whatever happened during the election we have have forgotten. Ours is not like an India-Pakistan fight.
“The people have given mandate to BJP. It has got more seats. It is our duty (to lend support to BJP). Sena’s support will always be there for a Chief Minister who works in the interest of Maharashtra,” he said.
Though back channel talks were on between the leaders of the two parties which had parted ways just before the poll following failure of seat-sharing talks, there was no clarity yet on whether Sena will be part of the government or support it from outside.
Sharad Pawar’s NCP, with 41 MLAs, has already offered unconditional outside support to BJP, which has 121 MLAs and pre-poll ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha one in the 288-member Assembly, in its bid to form government.
Making things easier for BJP further, the party made it clear that it will bail out the new government during the trust vote if Shiv Sena does not join it.
“If Shiv Sena joins the government, there will be no problem. We will not be part of the government but do not want to create instability by voting against a minority government.
So, NCP will abstain, if there is voting,” party spokesman Nawab Malik told PTI.
NCP would like to honour the people’s mandate which is in favour of BJP, the single largest party, he said. BJP had won 122 continued…

Screen local films at least for one week  ULFA faction tells theatre ownersBy: Press Trust of India | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:25 pm
For a change, fugitive rebel leader Paresh Barua’s anti-talk faction of ULFA is not talking about his armed struggle for a “sovereign” state. Instead, he has asked theatre-owners in Assam to screen films made in Assamese and other local languages at least for one week so that the state’s film industry did not collapse.
The ULFA faction’s statement signed by its chairman Abhijit Asom and issued through email, came close on the heels of award-winning filmmaker Prabin Hazarika complaining that theatre-owners were not inclined to screen his latest film “Shrinkhal” and preferring Hindi films over his.
The ULFA anti-talk faction chairman, who issued a statement from his hideout in Myanmar, picked up from Hazarika’s complaint made two days ago after theatres removed his Assamese film for a Hindi movie and said the outfit was “concerned” over the “attitude” of theatre owners.
“It is a matter of concern that theatre-owners were not interested in screening Assamese films and preferred Hindi films instead,” he said.
“If theatre-owners can earn huge profits by screening Hindi films throughout the year, what is the harm in promoting the growth of Assamese films by screening each local film at least for one week?” the ULFA leader asked.
“Moreover, it would also be a kind of social responsibility,” he said, mildly warning that those who do not screen Assamese and local films were not well-wishers of Assam. Even if each theatre screened each Assamese film for one week, it is more than enough, he added.
Meanwhile, “Shrinkhal” director Prabin Hazarika, when contacted said it was true that most theatre-owners were not interested in screening his film. “My film is not a typical boy-meets-girl film. The story is by an eminent filmmaker like Bhabendra Nath Saikia. Moreover, the turn-out was very good in the first one week, which is one reason why it should have been continued,” Hazarika said.
His film which is currently running to full house in the second week in two theatres in Guwahati, is partly financed 60 per cent by the Assam Film Finance & Development Corporation and has two well-known Bollywood actors from Assam, they being Adil Hussain and Jaya Seal.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.

The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

ONGC oil output jumps 10 percent

In a turnaround, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ) has reported a 10 percent jump in crude oil production from its western offshore fields this fiscal, reversing the downward slide of past few years.
The nation's largest oil and gas producer wants to take advantage of multi-year low oil prices to aggressively acquire oil and gas fields in the US, Russia, Central Asia and Africa so as to meet its 20 million tons oil equivalent target from overseas assets by 2018.
"Crude oil production has risen from 285,642 barrels per day in April to over 315,000 bpd this month," ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf told PTI here.
Also read: ONGC on the hunt for overseas producing assets
ONGC, which had over the last few years seen output not matching targets, plans to quickly develop discovered fields to boost oil and gas production. "The more than 10 percent increase in output in current year is quiet an achievement for a company having old fields," he said.
Western offshore is the home for India's largest oil and gas field of Mumbai High and Bassein. It also has several smaller discoveries which ONGC has now tied up with main production system and begun producing.
Sarraf said the company will continue to focus on bringing newer fields into production as also arrest decline in ageing field through use of technology and interventions. It plans to develop a series of oil and gas discoveries in Daman offshore. About 8.5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output is projected from the discoveries.
ONGC is also focused on bringing to production its major oil field in the KG-D5 block in Krishna Godavari basin by 2019.
The oil discovery in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block, will be the first large oil production from the east coast. The block also has 10 gas discoveries.
First gas from the block is planned for 2018 and first oil in 2019, he said.
While a bulk of ONGC's near 25 million tonnes crude oil production comes from western offshore and fields in states like Gujarat and Assam, KG-D5 will produce up to 90,000 barrels per day (4.5 million tonnes per annum) - the largest from any field on the east coast. ONGC will produce 17 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the block.
On overseas acquisition, Sarraf said ONGC was looking at "the globe" for buying producing oil and gas fields.
ONGC stock price
On December 05, 2014, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation closed at Rs 365.85, down Rs 5, or 1.35 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 472.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 264.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 26.00 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 14.07. The latest book value of the company is Rs 159.81 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 2.29.

5 Powerful Ways To Boost Your Confidence5 Powerful Ways To Boost Your Confidence
 | By                                                                Peter Economy

Self-confident people are admired by others and inspire confidence in others. They face their fears head-on and tend to be risk takers. They know that no matter what obstacles come their way, they have the ability to get past them . Self-confident people tend to see their lives in a positive light even when things aren't going so well, and they are typically satisfied with and respect themselves.
Wouldn't it be amazing to have this kind of self-confidence, every day of the week? Guess what? You can.
"Low self-confidence isn't a life sentence. Self-confidence can be learned, practiced, and mastered--just like any other skill. Once you master it, everything in your life will change for the better." -- Barrie Davenport
It comes down to one simple question: If you don't believe in yourself, how do you expect anybody else to?
Try some of the tips listed below. Don't just read them and put them on the back burner. Really begin to practice them daily, beginning today. You might have to fake it at first and merely appear to be self-confident, but eventually you will begin to feel the foundation of self-confidence grow within you. With some time and practice (this is not an overnight phenomenon), you too can be a self-confident person, both inside and out, whom others admire and say "Yes!" to.
1. Stay away from negativity and bring on the positivity
This is the time to really evaluate your inner circle, including friends and family. This is a tough one, but it's time to seriously consider getting away from those individuals who put you down and shred your confidence. Even a temporary break from Debbie Downer can make a huge difference and help you make strides toward more self-confidence.

Yet Another Reason to Watch Your Body Language: It Can Make You Happier
Be positive, even if you're not feeling it quite yet. Put some positive enthusiasm into your interactions with others and hit the ground running, excited to begin your next project. Stop focusing on the problems in your life and instead begin to focus on solutions and making positive changes.
2. Change your body language and image
This is where posture, smiling, eye contact , and speech slowly come into play. Just the simple act of pulling your shoulders back gives others the impression that you are a confident person. Smiling will not only make you feel better, but will make others feel more comfortable around you. Imagine a person with good posture and a smile and you'll be envisioning someone who is self-confident.
Look at the person you are speaking to, not at your shoes -- keeping eye contact shows confidence. Last, speak slowly. Research has proved that those who take the time to speak slowly and clearly feel more self-confidence and appear more self-confident to others. The added bonus is they will actually be able to understand what you are saying.
Go the extra mile and style your hair, give yourself a clean shave, and dress nicely. Not only will this make you feel better about yourself, but others are more likely to perceive you as successful and self-confident as well. A great tip: When you purchase a new outfit, practice wearing it at home first to get past any wardrobe malfunctions before heading out.
3. Don't accept failure and get rid of the negative voices in your head
Never give up. Never accept failure. There is a solution to everything, so why would you want to throw in the towel? Make this your new mantra . Succeeding through great adversity is a huge confidence booster.
Low self-confidence is often caused by the negative thoughts running through our minds on an endless track. If you are constantly bashing yourself and saying you're not good enough, aren't attractive enough, aren't smart enough or athletic enough, and on and on, you are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. You are becoming what you are preaching inside your head, and that's not good. The next time you hear that negativity in your head, switch it immediately to a positive affirmation and keep it up until it hits the caliber of a self-confidence boost.
4. Be prepared
Learn everything there is to know about your field, job, presentation -- whatever is next on your "to conquer" list. If you are prepared, and have the knowledge to back it up, your self-confidence will soar.
5. For tough times, when all else fails: Create a great list
Life is full of challenges and there are times when it's difficult to keep our self-confidence up. Sit down right now and make a list of all the things in your life that you are thankful for, and another list of all the things you are proud of accomplishing . Once your lists are complete, post them on your refrigerator door, on the wall by your desk, on your bathroom mirror -- somewhere where you can easily be reminded of what an amazing life you have and what an amazing person you really are. If you feel your self-confidence dwindling, take a look at those lists and let yourself feel and be inspired all over again by you.

A Handshake and a Drink in a Digital Worldreddit
If you are in business in the 21st century, you've heard from multiple sources that you need to have an optimized digital presence if you hope to succeed. This message may ring a little louder if you are an independent worker. But what does an "optimized digital presence" even mean? In so many words, it means an updated LinkedIn profile, active social accounts, participation in online discussions, and so forth, all with the goal of popping up in a potential client's search results.
Now, think about your last few projects. How did you find them?
If you answered Facebook or Twitter, good for you. You've finally broken through the independent consultant's glass ceiling. But you're in the minority; in-person referrals are still the best way for solopreneurs to get their next contract. In a study released last spring by The Career Advisory Board (CAB), 82% of independent workers claimed that word of mouth was their top source of work. Supporting this number is MBO Partners own State of Independence report that found that 75% of independent workers cited word of mouth as their main source of work. As for social media, 6% (CAB) and 2% (MBO) cited this as a top source of work.
However, small business owners (including the self-employed) aren't getting the memo . Forty-three percent of small businesses spend 6 or more hours per week twiddling around on social accounts, with 11% spending up to 20 hours a week! Sixty-six percent of small businesses report spending more time on social media this year than they did last year, and the vast majority reported that they aren't spending the same amount of time talking to potential customers; they're spending it looking for something to say.
What do the numbers mean for you?
If updates and shares are not converting to new business it may be time to rethink your strategy. How many social sites are you on? Whittle the number down to one or two that you've gotten the most traction on. Define a strategy, set a time limit per week, and stick to it. The two hours you save in a week just may be the happy hour that wins you the next big deal.
Better yet, do you have the cash to bring on a part-time social media guru to manage your accounts for you? If you found a service that costs a few hundred dollars a month, ask yourself this: how much is a billable hour worth to me, and how many hours do I spend on social? The service could pay for itself.
Even if that's not the move for you, it's ok to tone it down on social and refocus on good old-fashioned face-to-face networking.
If you've spent hours and hours on social each week, and don't have a dime to show for it, it's time to get back to your roots. A handshake and a drink is still the best way to seal a contract, as well as learn about others who need your services. At least we know that type of networking will never go out of style.

Still Need A Halloween Costume Print Thisreddit
Halloween is right around the corner, but some of us undoubtedly have yet to decide on a costume. A British company has the solution: printable masks.
Wintercroft is a company founded by Steve Wintercroft, an artist with a passion for craftsmanship and conservation. He came up with the idea for his geometric masks when he himself was struggling to come up with a Halloween costume a few years ago, according to his website .
A photo posted by Steve Wintercoft (@wintercroft) on
Aug 8, 2014 at 5:50pm PDT
"I sat down with a pile of old cardboard, some parcel tape, a pair of scissors and plenty of hot tea," he writes. "An hour or so later, and after some trial and error, I had made myself a fox mask ... The goal is to create a set of masks that could be built by anyone using local materials, removing the need for mass manufacturing or shipping and with the minimum environmental impact."
Wintercroft sells mask kits -- with designs including a pumpkin, tiger and stormtrooper -- at Wintercroft.com and on Etsy . The company provides downloadable masks with instructions to create the 3D product, which Wintercroft says takes between two and three hours with the help of some scissors and glue.
The masks cost around $8 each.

Rupee rises 8 paise against dollar in early tradeRupee snaps four-session rally, ends 3 paise down
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 18:41 IST

The Indian rupee on Monday snapped a four-session rally and softened by three paise to end at 61.30 against the Greenback on dollar demand from oil importers amid weakness in local equities.
A better dollar overseas ahead of two-day monetary policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve starting on Tuesday and slowing capital inflows also weighed negatively on the market.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic currency resumed strong at 61.19 a dollar from last Wednesday's close of 61.27 and immediately touched a high of 61.18 following initial rally in local stocks.
Later, it met with strong resistance in line with fall in domestic equities amid fresh month-end dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners, to day's low of 61.36 before settling at 61.30, a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent.
In the previous four trading sessions, the rupee had risen by 56 paise or 0.91 per cent. The Forex market was closed on October 23 and 24 on account of holidays.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, which was up by nearly 144 points in early stages, fell back and closed down by 98.15 points or 0.37 per cent. FPIs/FIIs sold shares worth Rs 12.38 crore last on Thursday as per provisional data.
The dollar index was up by a marginal 0.03 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: "Monday Rupee opened on a strong note taking cues from local equities. As the day progressed, rupee lost his way and closed in red due to month end dollar buying pressure from oil marketing companies. The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 60.80 to 61.80."
"We believe that the Rupee could remain weak as importers could continue to purchase Dollars for the month-end payments for defense and oil imports," said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India Pvt Ltd.

AIPA urges DGCA to stop low air fare schemesAir passengers' body AIPA urges DGCA to stop low air fare schemes

Describing the frequent special discount fare offers by domestic carriers as "non-existent", the Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday urged regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to permit such schemes.
"We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger," APAI president D Sidhakara Reddy said in a communication to the DGCA.
In the latest instance over the last few weeks, budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday launched its 'Diwali Dhamaka' sale , with one-way fares starting as low as Rs.899 (including taxes).
According to the company, tickets can be booked October 21-26, 2014 for travel between November 1 to December 15, 2014.
" SpiceJet has fundamentally changed the air travel paradigm in India this year, with offers that are frequent and often lower than train fares," chief operating officer Sanjiv Kapoor said announcing the scheme.
"We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline's portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings," Reddy said.
Pointing out that it has become routine by airlines to announce such schemes almost once every 10-15 days, their aim appears to achieve cheap publicity for the airline, APAI said.
The association asked the regulator whether the carriers inform about the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with the DGCA showing the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered under the bucket pricing method.
"If they are not, then what action do you propose for not following the procedure?" APAI asked in its letter.
Reddy also said the association would explore the Right to Information (RTI) route if the DGCA did not respond in the matter.

Cairn India fell 3 per cent on Monday after Brent dropped below $86 as Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts.
Brent was below $86 after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil by $15 in the first quarter of next year.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $75 a barrel from $90, and its prediction for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
Lower crude oil prices can hit revenues of oil explorers.

over at the TelegraphStock markets threatened by collapse in Chinese consumer demand
A shocking slump in Chinese consumer demand will undermine World economic    growth and stock markets

The capitulation of the Chinese consumer threatens to drag stock markets    around the world into a death spiral as one of the pillars of global growth    is undermined.
Figures from the world’s largest consumer goods groups last week laid bare the    shocking weakness of consumer demand in China, which threatens to pull down    global stock markets that have been priced to perfection by more than five    years of extraordinary monetary policy and asset price inflation.
For China to avoid a hard landing it was essential for consumer spending to    pick up from where centrally planned infrastructure spending left off, but    there are signs this simply isn’t happening. Unilever, the world’s third    largest consumer goods company, said they were surprised by the “unusually    rapid” slowdown in Chinese consumer demand.
The company said that sales growth had slumped to about 2pc during the nine    months ended September, down from about 8pc growth last year. The slowdown    in Chinese sales growth to about 2pc is also an average – there are pockets    where trading is far worse. The company added that sales to the big hypermarkets in the country are less than 2pc or even negative in some    cases.
Nestle, the worlds largest food company, recently reported falling sales for    the first nine months of the year and also warned of “challenging” Chinese    trading conditions. The fear of China going backwards is now becoming a    reality, as the Chinese consumer is not picking up from where capital    investment left off.

Immediately after the 2008 banking crisis China launched the largest stimulus    package and infrastructure investment program the world has ever seen. China    has used 6.6 gigatons of cement in the last three years compared to 4.5    gigatons the USA has used in 100 years.
The stimulus package increased fixed capital investment to 50pc of GDP, while    domestic consumption withered to only 35pc. The lopsided economy led Hu    Jintao, the President of China until 2012, to call the period of growth “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable.” The hope was it    would eventually kick start consumer spending.
Those hopes have been shattered by the bursting of the Chinese housing bubble    that is having a devastating impact on consumer confidence. Chinese house    prices in September have fallen for the fifth month in a row and wiped out    all the gains of the past year, according to National Bureau of Statistics    (NBS) data last week.
House prices across 70 major Chinese cities declined by 1.3pc in September    from a year earlier. The housing correction is widespread with prices    falling month-on-month in a record 69 out of 70 major cities, up from 68 in    August, according to NBS data. This will have wide ranging effects on the    Chinese economy as according to French bank Societe Generale: “the aggregate    exposure of China’s financial system to the property market is likely to be    as much as 80pc of GDP.”
The unravelling of the China housing bubble is a serious problem for the world    economy. China is expected to be the largest constituent with almost $1    trillion of global GDP growth in 2015. Combined with the US the two    countries are estimated to generate more than 90pc of growth. In stark    contrast the next largest contributor is the UK with less than $200bn.
Undershooting global growth targets wouldn’t usually be a problem but stock    markets around the world are priced to perfection after more than five years    of extraordinary monetary policy. Last week the S&P 500 rallied by more than    3.7pc to 1,957, and has now nearly erased October’s sharp losses. According    to the Shiller  price earnings valuation for US markets they are 54pc    overvalued.
The US markets cheered signs that the Federal Reserve and the European Central    Bank could act in concert to pump more money into the system after the    October selloff spooked investors.  The Vix, the so-called “fear index” that    measures market volatility, has fallen back to more normal levels in a sign    investors believe everything is ok. The Vix spiked to two year highs in    mid-October as growth fears gripped markets.
UK markets are likewise staging a tentative recovery. The FTSE 100 index of    leading shares was up 1.3pc to 6,388 last week, still some way short of    highs of 6,904 in early September.
While stock markets may have been lulled into a false sense of security by the    soothing words from central bankers, investors should take a look out of the    window at the brutal reality in the real world.
The number of UK companies issuing profit warnings in the third quarter has    reached the highest total since the 2008 banking crisis, according to this    mornings survey from accountants EY. Having spent the past five years    pushing through price increases while wages remained static many companies    have now hit a profit ceiling.
Consumer’s disposable income is also reaching breaking point. In order to    shift goods retailers are facing a deflationary spiral. Unilever last week    reported European sales down 4.3pc, far worse than market consensus for a    1pc decline. Worryingly the group reported sales volumes down 1.7pc, and    price deflation of 2.7pc during the third quarter.
It is not just those exposed to consumers that are experiencing a sharp    slowdown. Engine maker Rolls-Royce, shocked investors with its second profit    warning of the year, blaming the shaky economy and the effect of Russian    trade sanctions for a revenue crunch this year and no earnings growth next    year.
The profit warnings are no longer isolated to one-off weather events, or    industries either, the slowdown is engrained in the real economy.
Bellwether corporates in the US such as MacDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Ford have    all reported dismal numbers. McDonald’s was particularly eye opening, as    last week the company said that U.S. same-store sales fell 4.1pc in    September, the worst monthly drop in more than a decade, and that profits    plunged 30pc in its third quarter.
Historically the last week in October tends to be good for UK stocks, but    investors shouldn’t use this as a buying opportunity. The clouds are    gathering and the 2015 global growth story looks holed beneath the water    line.
 

re-election as Brazil s presidentRousseff: Brazil's 'Iron Lady'
President Dilma Rousseff has promised to re-unite Brazil after narrowly winning re-election to a second term in office with 51.6% of the vote.
She said "dialogue" would be her top priority after a bitterly fought campaign against centre-right candidate Aecio Neves, who got 48.4% of the vote.
The left-wing leader said she wanted to be "a much better president than I have been until now".
She faced mass protests last year against corruption and poor services.
But Ms Rousseff, who has been in power since 2010, remains popular with poor Brazilians thanks to her government's welfare programmes.
Political reform
The vote split Latin America's biggest country almost evenly in two, along lines of social class and geography.
Whereas Dilma Rousseff did well in the poorer northern states, her opponent from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) took many of the wealthier and more developed southern parts of Brazil.
After an acrimonious and closely fought campaign, Rousseff supporters were clearly relieved to have won
Mr Neves's supporters saw their chance of ousting the PT from power vanish for another term
The president said that during the campaign "the word repeated most often was change and the idea most often invoked was reform".
Analysis: Wyre Davies, BBC News, Rio de Janeiro
The president's appeal for unity and dialogue was an important recognition that, despite 12 years of tangible social benefits under Workers' Party (PT) rule, millions of Brazilians are less than satisfied.
The standards of public services across the country in health, education and basic sanitation are too low for a country that prides itself on having the seventh largest economy in the world.
This government deserves credit for helping to bring millions of people out of poverty but, as a result, public expectations here are now much higher.
By the time Dilma leaves office in 2018, the Workers' Party will have been in power for 16 years.
That may prove too much for some to bear but it is undeniable that life for most Brazilians has improved immeasurably during the PT's mandate thus far.
Brazil's president preaches unity after hard-won victory
"Sometimes in history, close outcomes trigger results more quickly than ample victories," she said.
"It is my hope, or even better, my certainty that the clash of ideas can create room for consensus, and my first words are going to be a call for peace and unity," she told a cheering crowd in the capital, Brasilia.
"Instead of widening differences and creating a rift, I have the strong hope that we can use this energy to build bridges."
She also thanked her supporters, especially her political mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Ms Rousseff thanked her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
"I thank from the bottom of my heart our number one militant, President Lula."
Her Workers' Party (PT), which has been in power since 2002, will now govern for another four-year term starting on 1 January 2015, but with a considerably weaker mandate than before.
Analysis: Katy Watson, South America Business reporter
Poorer Brazilians voted in Dilma Rousseff for a second term because of her party's track record in lifting millions out of poverty.
But the business community is more worried about the future. The election race was full of twists and turns - all closely followed by the financial markets.
On Monday, the benchmark Bovespa index plunged more than 5%; all of its gains this year have been wiped out.
Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil's economic woes. Key to this will be who she names as her new finance minister and what policies her government will adopt.
Will it be more of the same interventionist policies that businesses say stifle confidence and trade? Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday's election.
The divided nature of the vote was palpable in Sao Paulo, where disappointed supporters of Mr Neves chanted "Kick the PT out!" while PT voters waved flags and celebrated in the streets.
Mr Neves admitted defeat and thanked the "more than 50 million Brazilians who voted for the path to change".
He said that the "overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians".
Ms Rousseff promised wide-spread reform and a "rigorous fight against corruption", one of the grievances which led to mass protests last year.
She said she would "strengthen control mechanism and propose changes to the legislation to put an end to impunity".
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
She said she would "continue to fight inflation and make improvements in the field of fiscal responsibility".
With Brazil's once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.

It has ordered all the accused to appear before it on October 30
A local court trying the case of multi-crore accounting fraud in erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) may announce a date for verdict on October 30.
CBI special public prosecutor K Surender said the court has ordered all the accused to appear before it on that date.
The 10 accused in the case include prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju, his brother and Satyam’s former MD B Rama Raju, ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, Raju’s another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch Srisailam, and Satyam’s former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The trial in Satyam fraud case had concluded in June before the special court, which examined 216 witnesses and marked 3,038 documents during the course of the hearing.
Touted as the country’s biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009 after Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company’s account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees.
Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother.
In February that year, CBI took over the investigation and filed three charge sheets (on April 7, 2009, November 24, 2009 and January 7, 2010), which were later clubbed into one.
Raju and others were charged with offences like cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust, under relevant sections of IPC, for inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of various I-T laws.
During the trial, the CBI alleged that the scam caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to Satyam shareholders, while the defence countered the charges, saying the accused were not responsible for the fraud and all the documents filed by the central agency relating to the case were fabricated and not according to law.

Daily Record calls a "power grab"SNS/Action Images/Reuters
Graham Wallace (R) is axed as Ashley (L) flexes his muscles while fans can only look on
RANGERS chief executive Graham Wallace has been fired as part of Mike Ashley ’s Ibrox power grab.
Wallace – who is expected to be replaced by Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias – was axed on Saturday morning, moments after the club’s beleaguered board accepted a £2m crisis loan from the Sports Direct magnate and his departure was confirmed this morning.
It’s hotly anticipated his £300,000-a-year role will now be given to Llambias as part of a boardroom shake-up.

Ashley also wants another close pal, Stephen Mucklow, to replace finance director Philip Nash, who resigned on Friday. In return for his cash, Ashley demanded the right to make two changes to the board and also has security over two of the club’s main assets, the Albion car park and Edmiston House.

Record Sport can also reveal that, after learning of Brian Kennedy’s late counter offer of a £3m funding package on Friday morning, Ashley threatened the club’s directors with legal action if his own deal was rejected .
A source said: “Ashley was apoplectic when he heard Kennedy made a bigger offer.
“His lawyers made it clear to the board there could be devastating repercussions for those who tried to stand in his way. It’s no surprise a few bottles crashed. Ashley is not someone to be messed with.”
Wallace had approached Kennedy on Thursday in a desperate bid to block Ashley’s power grab. He then left for a holiday in Greece on Friday. Details of his severance package are as yet unclear.

 Foreign Bank Account Legal  Followed All Rules: BurmansArvind Subramanian Likely to Be Chief Economic Adviser
New Delhi: With one of its members, Pradip Burman, being named as an account holder in a foreign bank in the black money issue, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans on Monday said the account complied with all legal requirements.

Among those refused cover was Keith Dowley, a commercial property adviser from south west London, who bought a Range Rover this month after his previous one was stolen.
He said Range Rover told him it was his matter to resolve.
‘I had to tell them, ‘No, this is your problem, I have just bought a £100,000 car from you, if I can’t get insurance, I can’t drive it, and if I can’t drive it, I don’t want it’,’ Mr Dowley said.
He eventually secured cover from another provider.
A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said: ‘Our line-up continues to meet the insurance industry requirements as tested and agreed with relevant insurance bodies.
‘Nevertheless we are taking this issue very seriously.’

Black money: Govt discloses more names to SC | Foreign account legal: BurmansAnna C Timblo
(Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya…)
NEW DELHI: The Centre today disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and Goa miners against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing blackmoney in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited and its five Directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the government.
The affidavit, filed days after the government came under attack from political rivals that it was chary of revealing names, said that these names have been received from French authorities and other countries.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under its scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as "illegal".
The additional affidavit on the black money issue was filed today in furtherance of its affidavit recently when it had said that names of account holders in foreign banks cannot be disclosed till there is evidence of tax evasion against them and prosecution is launched in India.
While Burman's name was received from French authorities the names of Lodhia and others have been received from "other countries".
The list names Timblo Private Limited and its Directors Mrs Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Mrs Anna C Timblo and Mrs Mallika R Timblo . It was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its Directors.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans said the account complied with all legal requirements.
"We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account," a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
"We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department , and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable," he added.
Lodhiya denied having a Swiss bank account. "We have already declared in the income tax and there is nothing...we don't have any Swiss account that is the only thing which I can say," he said.
Radha Timbo declined to comment on her name being mentioned in the affidavit, saying she has to first study it before commenting.
The government in its 10-page affidavit submitted that it cannot disclose all the information and names of account holders in overseas banks, received from foreign countries, unless there is a "prima facie" evidence of wrongdoing for launching prosecution for tax evasion.
"The government is committed to disclose names of persons holding illegal money abroad. However, every account held by an Indian in a foreign country may not be illegal and the fundamental right of citizens to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be ignored and has been recognised by this court," it said, adding the names and information/ documents cannot be disclosed even even under a proceedings under Article 32(1) of the Constitution.
It submitted the apex court to clarify its earlier order directing it to reveal even the names of foreign bank account holders against whom no evidence was found for stashing black money saying the government would have a problem entering into tax agreements with other countries.
"There is absolutely no intention on the part of the government to withhold information, including names of persons who have stashed black money abroad, but only to seek certain clarification that will enable the government to enter into agreements with other countries under which information relating to unaccounted money lying abroad can be obtained," it said.
"The information received under these tax treaties and agreements will be disclosed after following the due process of law, in all cases where evasion of tax is established. The intention of the present government is clear and unambiguous.
"The government is keen to unearth black money held abroad and for that purpose it will use all diplomatic and legal means and also all investigating agencies to obtain information that can assist in such unearthing," the affidavit said.
The government said various tax agreements authorise disclosure of information in public court proceedings that are consequent to establishing of tax evasion and thus in all cases of tax evasion where a complaint/prosecution is filed, the names/information/documents will be made public.
"Several more cases are under process and the names of persons prosecuted will become public in due course. The SIT will also be kept informed about the outcome of the investigations," it said.

Government to Consider Raw Sugar Export Incentive After October 29: ReportIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
New Delhi: The government will consider extending the incentives for raw sugar exports after October 29 when leading cane growing states forecast their sugar output for the new season beginning October, two sources said on Monday.
"The cane commissioners of leading cane growing states will present their estimates on Oct. 29 and that will set the ball rolling for a decision on raw sugar export subsidy in 2014-15," a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
In February, government gave Rs 3,300 ($53.82) a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
However, a delay in extending the incentives for the new 2014-15 season had led to misgivings in some quarters that New Delhi was against giving subsidy for overseas shipments of raw sugar.

Instead of using 10 to 12 different Apps, a tourist now can use only one App which will cater to all his or her travel related requirements in a particular city, Tourism Secretary Parvez Dewan said after launching the Android App.
The application, named 'Tripgator Android App', has been launched by Tripgator.com , in partnership with Incredible India.
"You will get to know how to get from one place to another, what are the attractions there, information about hotels, restaurants, ATM kiosks and other necessary details for a tourist," Dewan said.
The App will also provide information about health facilities available in a particular area. "You Will get all these informations including indicative rates on real time basis so that you will be able to plan your itinerary in an effective and hassle-free way," he said.
However, since this is a non-commercial App one cannot book hotels or tickets through it, but will only get indicative rates on air fare and hotel charges.
The App also has a price index which will offer cheaper available options as well as medium and high budget options.

re-election of president Dilma RousseffRousseff: Brazil's 'Iron Lady'
President Dilma Rousseff has promised to re-unite Brazil after narrowly winning re-election to a second term in office with 51.6% of the vote.
She said "dialogue" would be her top priority after a bitterly fought campaign against centre-right candidate Aecio Neves, who got 48.4% of the vote.
The left-wing leader said she wanted to be "a much better president than I have been until now".
She faced mass protests last year against corruption and poor services.
But Ms Rousseff, who has been in power since 2010, remains popular with poor Brazilians thanks to her government's welfare programmes.
Political reform
The vote split Latin America's biggest country almost evenly in two, along lines of social class and geography.
Whereas Dilma Rousseff did well in the poorer northern states, her opponent from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) took many of the wealthier and more developed southern parts of Brazil.
After an acrimonious and closely fought campaign, Rousseff supporters were clearly relieved to have won
Mr Neves's supporters saw their chance of ousting the PT from power vanish for another term
The president said that during the campaign "the word repeated most often was change and the idea most often invoked was reform".
Analysis: Wyre Davies, BBC News, Rio de Janeiro
The president's appeal for unity and dialogue was an important recognition that, despite 12 years of tangible social benefits under Workers' Party (PT) rule, millions of Brazilians are less than satisfied.
The standards of public services across the country in health, education and basic sanitation are too low for a country that prides itself on having the seventh largest economy in the world.
This government deserves credit for helping to bring millions of people out of poverty but, as a result, public expectations here are now much higher.
By the time Dilma leaves office in 2018, the Workers' Party will have been in power for 16 years.
That may prove too much for some to bear but it is undeniable that life for most Brazilians has improved immeasurably during the PT's mandate thus far.
Brazil's president preaches unity after hard-won victory
"Sometimes in history, close outcomes trigger results more quickly than ample victories," she said.
"It is my hope, or even better, my certainty that the clash of ideas can create room for consensus, and my first words are going to be a call for peace and unity," she told a cheering crowd in the capital, Brasilia.
"Instead of widening differences and creating a rift, I have the strong hope that we can use this energy to build bridges."
She also thanked her supporters, especially her political mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Ms Rousseff thanked her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
"I thank from the bottom of my heart our number one militant, President Lula."
Her Workers' Party (PT), which has been in power since 2002, will now govern for another four-year term starting on 1 January 2015, but with a considerably weaker mandate than before.
Analysis: Katy Watson, South America Business reporter
Poorer Brazilians voted in Dilma Rousseff for a second term because of her party's track record in lifting millions out of poverty.
But the business community is more worried about the future. The election race was full of twists and turns - all closely followed by the financial markets.
On Monday, the benchmark Bovespa index plunged more than 5%; all of its gains this year have been wiped out.
Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil's economic woes. Key to this will be who she names as her new finance minister and what policies her government will adopt.
Will it be more of the same interventionist policies that businesses say stifle confidence and trade? Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday's election.
The divided nature of the vote was palpable in Sao Paulo, where disappointed supporters of Mr Neves chanted "Kick the PT out!" while PT voters waved flags and celebrated in the streets.
Mr Neves admitted defeat and thanked the "more than 50 million Brazilians who voted for the path to change".
He said that the "overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians".
Ms Rousseff promised wide-spread reform and a "rigorous fight against corruption", one of the grievances which led to mass protests last year.
She said she would "strengthen control mechanism and propose changes to the legislation to put an end to impunity".
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
She said she would "continue to fight inflation and make improvements in the field of fiscal responsibility".
With Brazil's once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.
Aecio Neves admitted defeat in a speech to supporters in the southern city of Belo Horizonte

Among comic Jim Carrey's better performances on NBC's Saturday Night Live was his parody of Matthew McConaughey in those Lincoln commercials.
"You don't buy a Lincoln because it makes sense," Carrey says in that distinctive McConaughey twang as he tools around in an MKC. The parody was so good that Carrey made it a running joke with three different fake ads for The Lincoln Motor Co. during the show.
The third was actually a double spoof, combining a takeoff on the Allstate "in good hands" commercial with, once again, McConaughey in his Lincoln.

John Sculley, CEO of Inflexionpoint, an investment and acquisition technology firm, is looking to start an NBFC in India called Extend Credit, which would look to provide working capital credit for “middle-class economy businesses” in the country, he told CNBC-TV18’s Kritika Saxena in an exclusive interaction.
Sculley was chief of Apple between 1983 and 1993, and under him, sales at the firm grew from USD 800 million to USD 8 billion though he is best known for his fallout with co-founder Steve Jobs, who resigned from Apple only to return later after a few years.
Recently, Sculley’s Inflexionpoint, launched Obi smartphones in India, sales of which he said are off to a “very good start”.
In the chat, he also discussed the government’s steps towatds digitalization and whether India would attract more foreign investment under the new government regime.
Below is the edited transcript of the interview.
Q: What are the expectations from the new government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi?
A: The expectations are very positive right now. I think Modi had a very successful trip to New York. He filled Madison Square Garden, which is quite an accomplishment for any world leader. And I think there is a lot of enthusiasm that the government is going to be more open for foreign investment than it has been in the past.
Q: By when are you expecting a significant uptick when it comes to foreign investment and especially investment coming into the digital and technological capability that India has?
A: I have been quite enthusiastic about India for several years. We acquired a company last year called Iris Computers, which is one of the largest IT distributors. We are growing extremely rapidly organically.
Two months ago, we launched our first smartphone business in India called Obi Mobiles. It is off to a very strong start and we are hoping in the next few weeks to get our credentials for an NBFC, which will enable us to start a business called Extend Credit. It will provide working capital credit for many of the middle-class economy businesses that we think are going to be a big opportunity in India.
Q: How many more companies are you looking at investing in, how much more capital are you looking at deploying in India?
A: We have been building Inflexion Point throughout South Asia and in India. We are expanding very rapidly, we are an aggressive acquirer of existing businesses particularly in supply chain and we are interested in any business that touches the growing middleclass. So it could be a product business or service business.
We really are quite enthusiastic about growth opportunities because if you look at where the world economic growth is, it is really in the Asian markets and so we are quite comfortable in this part of the world, we have a strong team with a lot of experience and I am quite bullish and have been for several years.

Chennai, Oct 27:  
Public sector general insurer United India as part of its plans to have presence overseas, was keen on setting up its first office in Sri Lanka, a top official said today.
“We are looking at Sri Lanka. We have not yet finalised. It is still in the early stages..”, United India Insurance Company Ltd Chairman and Managing Director, Milind Kharat told reporters here.
The company had earlier set up office in Hong Kong but was shut in 2002.
Elaborating, he said, “We are keen in starting one office in Sri Lanka. We have to get the regulatory approvals, clear the formalities...”.
United India Insurance, Director and General Manager, M Vasantha Krishna said the company was serious about setting up the footprint in Colombo.
“We are serious about it. Hopefully, we are looking at setting up an office this year...,” he told PTI later.
Asked on whether the company would set up the overseas office through a joint venture partner, Kharat clarified that the company would set up its office on its own. “We will be going alone there“.
To a query on the common third-party administrators mooted by public sector general insurers, Kharat said it was expected to function from next year.
“Yes, it is taking shape. IT consultants have been appointed. From next financial year, it will start functioning. It will be operating in New Delhi and Mumbai“.
On the wage revision issue, Kharat said the company has completed two rounds of talks with employees and offered 10.5 per cent increase in revision. “Discussion has been going on.
Of course, the demand is more. We have offered 10.5 per cent (increase)...,” he said.

Tripura medical college loses half PG courses  three de-recognized byMCIPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:35 pm
Tripura’s main medical college has lost half of its post-graduate courses after the Medical Council of India de-recognised six of them this year, three this month alone.
The Agartala Government Medical College is now left with permission to run just half of the courses it initially had, according to meeting minutes of the MCI through this year.
And, as things stand now, the college appears unable to expand in other areas as well – proposals to start four new PG courses have already been rejected.
In its latest meeting this month, the MCI recommended against granting further recognition to post-graduate courses in Pediatrics Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Psychiatry.
General Surgery had already been de-recognised in August 2014, following the same fate as the college’s Anaesthesia and Radio Diagnosis courses two months prior.
Their final fate appears to have been prophesied somewhat with the MCI having disapproved the college’s proposals to increase the seats available in all these courses as early as February.
That was the same month the apex medical body disapproved similar proposals to increase seats in Ophthalmology and Orthopedics.
The MCI had then also shot down proposals to start PG courses in Respiratory Medicine, Pathology, Anatomy and Physiology as well as a diploma course in Child Health.
Interestingly, all the proposals to start these four new courses cited one Professor Dr H Sharmah as the in-charge principal of all these planned new departments, something the MCI could not accept.
But those were not the only reasons, as repeated reports cited a lack of faculty and infrastructure needed to host or operate these courses, the same reasons cited in the decisions to de-recognise the PG courses that did exist.
In some measure of consolation, however, the MCI has recommended for the continued recognition of four courses, including in Forensic Medicine, ENT, Community Medicine, Microbiology (although a proposal to increase seats in the latter was rejected in February).

Screen local films at least for one week  ULFA faction tells theatreownersBy: Press Trust of India | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:25 pm
For a change, fugitive rebel leader Paresh Barua’s anti-talk faction of ULFA is not talking about his armed struggle for a “sovereign” state. Instead, he has asked theatre-owners in Assam to screen films made in Assamese and other local languages at least for one week so that the state’s film industry did not collapse.
The ULFA faction’s statement signed by its chairman Abhijit Asom and issued through email, came close on the heels of award-winning filmmaker Prabin Hazarika complaining that theatre-owners were not inclined to screen his latest film “Shrinkhal” and preferring Hindi films over his.
The ULFA anti-talk faction chairman, who issued a statement from his hideout in Myanmar, picked up from Hazarika’s complaint made two days ago after theatres removed his Assamese film for a Hindi movie and said the outfit was “concerned” over the “attitude” of theatre owners.
“It is a matter of concern that theatre-owners were not interested in screening Assamese films and preferred Hindi films instead,” he said.
“If theatre-owners can earn huge profits by screening Hindi films throughout the year, what is the harm in promoting the growth of Assamese films by screening each local film at least for one week?” the ULFA leader asked.
“Moreover, it would also be a kind of social responsibility,” he said, mildly warning that those who do not screen Assamese and local films were not well-wishers of Assam. Even if each theatre screened each Assamese film for one week, it is more than enough, he added.
Meanwhile, “Shrinkhal” director Prabin Hazarika, when contacted said it was true that most theatre-owners were not interested in screening his film. “My film is not a typical boy-meets-girl film. The story is by an eminent filmmaker like Bhabendra Nath Saikia. Moreover, the turn-out was very good in the first one week, which is one reason why it should have been continued,” Hazarika said.
His film which is currently running to full house in the second week in two theatres in Guwahati, is partly financed 60 per cent by the Assam Film Finance & Development Corporation and has two well-known Bollywood actors from Assam, they being Adil Hussain and Jaya Seal.

Honda to replace airbags in Brio, Amaze, CR-V
Our Bureau
This is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Honda Cars India (HCIL) on Monday said that it would carry out preventive replacement of Driver Side Air Bag Inflator of 1,040 units of Brio, 1,235 units of Amaze and 63 units of CR-V manufactured between September 2011 and July 2014.
The company said it is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator.
In case of certain vehicles, due to incorrect assembly of the baffle plate, the pressure within the inflator may rise excessively when the driver side airbag deploys in an accident or other situation, causing damage to the container, HCIL said in a statement.
“HCIL is carrying out the part replacement as part of a global exercise by Honda Motor Company to ensure stringent quality standards for its products. There has been no reporting of any incident related to this part in India,” it said.  
The replacement would be carried out free of cost at HCIL dealerships across India, and the owners will be contacted individually, it said.
The customers can also check whether their car will be covered under this campaign by submitting their 17 character alpha-numeric vehicle identification number (VIN) on its microsite, which has been created on the company’s website, HCIL said.  
This is the second such case over the last one week. Nissan India on Friday had announced to replace 9,000 units of Micra hatchback and Sunny sedan due to defective driver airbags in the cars.
This was also part of the Japanese car major’s recall of 2.6 lakh cars manufactured by it globally between 2008 and 2012.

The minority consumer may be the unlikely hero of holiday 2014.
With the economy mostly back on its feet thank to an improving economy, job gains and lower gas prices, minority consumers — Hispanics, African Americans and Asian Americans — will boost their holiday purchases more than the general population this Christmas, and be a central driver of seasonal spending, according to an eye-opening 2014 Holiday Sales Forecast that the research specialist, Nielsen, shared exclusively with USA TODAY.
While the overall population says it will spend about 10% more on holidays gifts this year than last year, African Americans say they plan to spend 17% more, and both Asian Americans and Hispanics says they plan to spend 13% more, says the national study of 25,000 demographically-representative households conducted in September.  The survey also found that middle income consumers — with household income under $50,000 — say they will spend an average 12% more than last year on holiday items vs. 8% more for consumers with household incomes exceeding $50,000.
"This is a wake-up call," says James Russo, vice president of consumer insights at Nielsen. "Holiday is just a reflection of what's happening across the larger consumer retail landscape. This will continue well beyond the holiday season."
For retailers and marketers, this information is invaluable.  Shoppers are expected to spend $616.9 billion over the holidays, according to projections from the National Retail Federation, up 4.1% from 2013. The Nielsen research highlighting the projected growth of minority spending can help retailers and marketers focus on who to target — and where.  And it's a powerful reminder how rapidly the face of the American consumer is changing — particularly Hispanic consumers. Hispanics now number about  54 million in the U.S., up 50% from 2000  and nearly six times larger than 1970, reports the U.S. Census Bureau.  There also are 44 million African Americans and 19.4 million Asian Americans,
"The wake-up call for marketers is about the need to learn what multicultural consumers want and then bringing those insights to how clients go to market," says Jo Muse, chairman of Muse Communications, a multicultural marketing firm. "If they are not slicing and dicing consumer data so that the purchase motivational insights of multicultural consumer are close at hand, I'm afraid they will miss this opportunity."
But there's another twist to the Nielsen findings: although multicultural consumers expect to spend considerably more this holiday, they will wait longer to spend.  While 65% of the general population says it plans to "wait until later in the season" to do the bulk of their holiday shopping, that number jumps to an average 70% among minorities, says Russo.
"They are going to spend more, but they're going to wait longer," says Russo. "That makes the timing of messaging even more important."
The Nielsen report also found that  Asian Americans are expected to exceed all consumers in the use of online shopping. While one in four Asian-Americans said they will holiday shop online about one in five mainstream consumers do.
Minorities also are leading the way in smartphone use.  While 68% of the general population said they carried smartphones, that number jumped to 78% among African Americans; 79% among Hispanics and 82% among Asian Americans, the study found.
The survey also detailed the top product categories that consumers say they will spend more on this holiday season:
• All shoppers: Will spend 12% more on gift cards; 10% more on electronic merchandise and 10% more on toys.
• African Americans: Will spend 17% more on electronics, 17% more on food and 15% more on apparel.
• Asian Americans: Will spend 14% more on food, 13% more on electronics and 12% more on apparel.
• Hispanics. Will spend 15% more on gift cards, 13% more on electronics and 13% more on toys.
"The marketplace is being driven by multicultural consumer behavior," says Muse.  "The more retailers and brand marketers increase their multicultural I.Q., the greater their chances of capitalizing."

How  Charlie  aims to brief you on people you re about to meet0
The platform connects software to users’ Google calendars and syncs with their social media profiles. It uses names of meeting participants to search networks such as Google News, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, then builds a profile that includes things such as company information and common interests, founder and CEO Aaron Frazin said.
“It looks for anything that can help them build a relationship with that person or company,” said Frazin, 24, a Deerfield native.
The company says Charlie will deliver the profile summaries one hour before every scheduled meeting. The service also will deliver, on request, scouting reports on people not associated with a scheduled meeting.
Charlie is free for now, and Frazin said he is looking toward a “freemium” model, in which users get the service for free on a limited basis but pay for a more comprehensive product. He said the company hasn’t determined prices.
“We’re focused on growth now,” he said.
John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas, called Charlie “a very interesting idea because it reflects habits people have already.”
Challenger said he advises job-seekers to find out before meetings about people they’ll be talking to. “You can use information to get much more quickly to common ground with someone,” he said.
The idea for Charlie came about two years ago when Frazin was graduating from Indiana University. He said he was frustrated with the time it took him to research people he was meeting in job interviews.
“I wound up turning down a job offer and starting this company,” he said.
He since has teamed up with Rob Volk, former CTO of Beyond Diet and now co-founder and CTO at Charlie.
Frazin said he and Volk originally planned Charlie as a mobile app but that they now believe “most executives want a personal assistant to email them a one-pager, as opposed to showing it on a mobile app.” Yet their plans include mobile.
The company graduated from the DreamIt Ventures accelerator in Philadelphia, then settled in Chicago and worked out of 1871. Charlie is now based at Space a co-working space in River North.
Other investors joining the seed round were Confluence Capital Partners, Patrick Spain and Apex Venture Partners’ Lon Chow and Armando Pauker, said a company statement announcing the launch.  
Frazin said he plans to use the seed funding to improve the product and to invest in marketing.

Nine easy riders  resurrectedEvolution of Design | 23 October 2014
Nine dead motorbike names revived for the 21st Century

Rockets from the crypt
The 21st Century has put lumberjack beards onto men’s couture runways, banjos into rock music and weariness into riders assessing the so-called Universal Japanese Motorcycle. The generic UJM lasts forever but can run light on character. Motorcyclists are demanding tradition, authenticity and uniqueness. In response, and inspired by the resurgence of Triumph, entrepreneurs have revived names dormant for decades. Most can claim heydays with speed records, military service and celebrity riders – Marlon Brando and Lawrence of Arabia among them. The trend is doing wonders for wire-spoked wheels and crowned steel fenders, and for nostalgists keen to make contact with riding’s halcyon early days, it's irresisitible. Here is a look at nine prime examples driving the trend. (Photo: Midual)
Indian
Country of origin: United States
Dossier: Indian’s return, with sales internationally, was justifiably big news in 2013. Between 1901 and 1953, the company from Springfield, Massachusetts, wielded a magic touch, dominating the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race in 1911 and setting US distance records with Cannonball Baker in the saddle. Among production models, the Scout and Chief, both powered by a V-twin engine, solidified the brand and fostered an obsession whose depth is characterised in the 2005 film The World’s Fastest Indian. But – get used to these words – the company stumbled after World War II. Various attempts to revive Indian finally succeeded after acquisition by Polaris Industries in 2011. In addition to the beautifully crafted Indian Chief models, buyers will also find an entry-level Scout ($10,999 in the US, minus delivery charge) and barge-like Roadmaster touring bike ($26,999), pictured.

Ariel Motor
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: Having produced motorcycles since 1902, Ariel Motor reached a high point with the 1931 Square Four. It hooked up a pair of upright twin cylinders for a compact 500cc of total engine displacement. The Square Four kept evolving until 1959, but Ariel would be out of business by the same time Mick Jagger found his fullest swagger. Roughly a decade ago, Ariel Motor began to develop its Honda-powered Atom sports car. And in June 2014, it announced the Ace (pictured), which features a provocative perimeter chassis machined from solid aluminium. Honda’s 1.2-litre V-4 engine, one of the best in the business, will be used. Ariel plans to produce up to 150 highly individualised examples annually starting in 2015, from £20,000 (about $32,000).

Horex
Country of origin: Germany
Dossier: Fritz Kleemann’s single-cylinder Horex-Fahrzeugbau bikes began collecting victories in 1923. (The name “Horex” fused Kleeman’s home of Bad Homburg and Rex, his family’s glass jar company.)  Within 10 years, Horex had muscled up with the S8, a sophisticated 800cc twin. Although the Imperator 500cc twin represented an important post-war achievement, sales faltered and production had already ended by Daimler-Benz’s 1960 takeover. Fifty years would pass before Horex’s revival. Since 2012, the company has made VR6 models – Roadster, Classic and Cafe Racer 33 Ltd (above) – in a factory located in the Bavarian city of Augsburg. Sold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland starting at 24,500 euros (roughly $31,000), the bikes carry minimal bodywork – the better to gives maximum display to their engines, a complex and untraditional 1.2-litre V6. Horex claimed insolvency in September 2014, reportedly without suspending production, and at last notice was seeking additional investment. (Photo: Horex)
Norton
Country of Origin: Britain
Dossier: In 1902, Norton set to work building an impeccable pedigree. The marque eventually won at the Isle of Man and Brooklands, as well dominating the gruelling contests on the Continent. Norton was the last word in motorcycle performance in the ‘30s and immediately after World War II. Chassis engineering took on a lightly poetic aspect when the Featherbed frame arrived in time for the ‘50s. Next, the Commando’s success transcended sales figures as it became a touchstone of the Swinging ‘60s. A late-century malaise, the kind that plagued much of British industry after the rise of Japanese manufacturing, followed, but in 2010, after fresh investment, the Commando 961 (pictured) brought Nortons back to the streets of Britain and mainland Europe. They eventually found nostalgia-bitten bikers in distant markets such as California and even Japan. (Photo: Norton Motorcycles)
Midual
Country of origin: France
Dossier: Striving for timelessness through retro-futurism, the Midual Type 1 brings together aspects of French Art Deco cars, England’s post-war Douglas motorcycles and Swiss watches. Olivier Midy intended to revive Douglas, but in failing to get rights, he and his team renewed that marque’s spirit with the Midual Type 1. Prototypes were shown on 3 September in London. The first series of 35 bikes goes on sale in Europe in 2016 for the stutter-inducing equivalent of $185,000 apiece. The Type 1’s in-line, 1,036cc twin banks forward at 25 degrees in a cast-aluminium chassis that incorporates internal fuel storage of 3.7 gallons (14 litres). "We love metals, rare leather, and instruments with needle gauges,” Midual notes on its website. Customers who love same – only more so – can individualise their bikes nearly without limit. (Photo: Alexis Goure/Midual)
Matchless
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: Who could resist Kate Moss on Marlon Brando’s bike from 1953’s The Wild One? Certainly not the Malenotti brothers, who introduced their Matchless London clothing collection in 2013 with help from the fashion model and the film’s iconic Triumph. Expected in Milan for next month’s EICMA show – Europe’s largest motorcycle trade fair – is the Matchless Model X Reloaded. The return of Matchless began with the Malenottis’ acquisition of the marque in 2012. Matchless had built motorcycles from the year 1901 at Plumstead Road, London. The seductive Model X was born in 1929. Matchless also pioneered the development of protective clothing, marketed as Matchless Wear, which was sold at a factory store and through a catalogue. But it ended for the company by 1966. For the sake of subtlety, the forthcoming, steampunk-ish Model X Reloaded (pictured) will have S&S Motors’ 1,916cc V-twin engine and a front brake with a 12-piston caliper. Further details are to be revealed. Whatever the price, were Jules Verne alive and riding, he would put down a deposit. (Photo: Matchless London)
Bultaco
Country of origin: Spain
Dossier: When the Montesa team left racing in 1958, engineer Paco Bultó left Montesa. (The Bultaco moniker for his start-up fused first and last names together, in reverse order.) Bultaco made speedy road bikes such as the Metralla Mk2; meanwhile, off-road models excelled by adapting lightweight, powerful and dirty two-stroke engines. The Pursang was deeply revered in the US, and the Sherpa T won five consecutive world trials championships. Yet production in Barcelona ended by 1983. The new Bultaco, announced early in 2014, plans 2,000 examples of the Rapitán and Rapitán Sport (pictured), low-maintenance electric bikes coming from a Madrid factory by late 2015. The Rapitán’s proprietary powertrain relies heavily on energy recapture to provide projected in-town range of 200km (120 miles). Meanwhile, Bultaco is already offering apparel, gloves and even a little balance bike that helps kids from 18 months old “develop a sense of equilibrium and mobility”. (Photo: Bultaco)
Crocker Motorcycle
Country of origin: United States
Dossier: Al Crocker developed a series of single-cylinder speedway bikes in the depths of the Great Depression. In 1936, the Crocker Twin – over-engineered, over-strong, and very large-capacity – introduced new standards in American riding. The V-twin engines displaced up to 91 cubic inches (1.5 litres), and an astonishing 110mph was achievable. Manufacturing ended during World War II, with only about 100 Crockers made. In 2012, the new Crocker Motorcycle Company, located near Los Angeles, revealed its first “continuation” bike, exactingly made to original specification using silicon bronze, high-strength stainless steel and other premium materials. Three have been built, and enough parts exist for another nine or 10 bikes, according to  Michael Schacht, the bike’s builder and holder of Crocker naming rights. The price: $150,000. Schacht adds: “For a hand-manufactured bike, we’re giving it away.” (Photo: Crocker Motorcycle)
Brough Superior
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: The gleaming Brough Superior SS100 that surprised observers of the 2013 EICMA exhibition is two parts locomotive, one part coffeepot. Is the Tin Man is still around? it would be his favourite motorcycle if production begins, as projected, later in 2014. After going on sale in 1921, Brough Superior was advertised as the Rolls-Royce of motorcycles, and 3,000 were sold worldwide before production ended in Nottingham after 20 years. TE “Lawrence of Arabia” Lawrence, owner of many Broughs, perished in 1935 after swerving his SS100 to miss two bicyclists. Brough ended production in 1940. The new Brough comes about after entrepreneur Mark Upham purchased the name in 2008. The SS100 prototype’s titanium chassis and magnesium fork will provide the exotic aspects, and the 997cc V-twin will get it all moving. Upham says he hopes to sell a few hundred at £50,000 ($80,000) each, but he may entertain reviving other models. (Photo: Brough Superior Motorcycles)

Former radio host convicted of mortgage fraud15
Prosecutors alleged that Ballentine acted as the real estate lawyer at closings involving nearly 30 fraudulent loans. He knew that the buyers did not qualify to buy the properties in Chicago and the suburbs, authorities said.
Outside the courtroom, Ballentine's attorney, Lewis Myers Jr., vowed to appeal, saying Ballentine was ignorant of the scheme and made only about a combined $8,000 for his work at the closings while the real masterminds reaped millions.
Myers noted that several of Ballentine's co-defendants cut deals with the government and testified against him.
"The people who concocted this scheme, they never talked to (Ballentine). ... They never had a single conversation with him about it," Myers said.
Ballentine, 43, who formerly lived in suburban Country Club Hills but now resides in Durham, N.C., had professed his innocence in a Facebook posting at the time he was charged early last year.
"I made a standard fee on closings," he wrote at the time. "I know some may say everybody says their (sic) innocent. Well I am."
In a posting before the trial started earlier this week, Ballentine thanked God "for the vindication that will surely come."
Ballentine's trial was delayed from last week after Myers tried to pull out of the case at the last minute, claiming his client was not cooperating with him. Ballentine told the judge he'd been suffering from depression and family health issues and admitted he'd stopped returning his lawyer's phone calls. Kennelly, however, refused to let Myers off the case.

Norway: the road to a sustainable economyeconomy (general)
If forewarned is forearmed, Norway has a pretty big arsenal.
Oil discovery in the 1960s made the country one of the richest in the world with high wages and free education. In fact, it is still very much a part of the oil age with about 70 per cent of its exports being hydrocarbons.
But pegging the fortunes of a welfare state on the vagaries of the oil market is a high-risk proposition, and the question on everyone’s mind is ‘what do we do after the oil’? Sure, the country has a huge savings from oil money invested in the world markets, but what is a trillion dollar these days — an ageing population heavily dependent on pensions and social support means there is a constant drain on the assets.
The quest for an alternative economy has occupied the top business and political leadership of Norway for many years and one of the solutions that have been put in place is Innovation Norway, an organisation that acts as a trade council, a business incubator, angel investor and promoter rolled into one. Formed in 2004, the state-owned company spearheads the government’s efforts to transition to a diversified economy that is stable and green. Not an easy task when the country is chest deep in an industry that produces the world’s worst pollutant.
Anita Krohn Traaseth, who took over as CEO of Innovation Norway in September, is quite aware of the challenge. “We as a people don’t feel enough pain yet because we still have a very healthy economy,” she told The Hindu in Oslo recently. “And going through this transition — moving on from being a pure, vulnerable oil-and-gas economy to a sustainable, renewable or you can call it bio economy — when we don’t feel enough pain, is a challenge.”
How Innovation Norway helps the country
On the bright side, there is no lack of awareness among Norwegians on the need for a transition to a renewable, sustainable economy, she said. The transition is being seen as an opportunity to revive Norway’s traditional industries such as agriculture and fisheries and the sector that formed the backbone for oil exploration, shipping.
Innovation Norway swallows some of the risks of this transition. It identifies the companies and industries that need to be invested in or need to be helped during the change. “It cannot be driven by the market alone as it is too early,” said Ms. Traaseth. It has handheld all sorts of industries, from wind farm clusters to innovative oil exploration technologies, claiming to have delivered for these entrepreneurs a growth 21 percentage points higher than comparable ventures.
It is also the funnel through which the government pours money into the transition — funding start-ups as well as realignment of existing industries. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries and other stakeholders in the company, including county municipalities, poured nearly half a billion dollars into the transition process in 2013 through this vehicle.
To expand presence in India
Innovation Norway is also the Norwegian government’s official trade representative abroad, and has offices in over 30 countries including in India, in New Delhi.
Ms. Traaseth made clear Norway’s interest in the opportunities that India offers in the transition. But she also pointed to the need for Norway to be ‘very humble’ while approaching India “because it is obvious that the Indian market is interesting for Norway. [But] it is not that obvious to India what specific knowledge from Norway can be useful in developing India 2.0.”
Information and communication technology, she said, was one possible area of cooperation. Norway has one of the greatest research environments in the field but not much commercialisation like in India. “There is lot to learn from each other here.” India could also draw on Norway’s tradition and expertise when it comes to hydropower and waste management, she added.
She saw the Modi government’s ‘red tape to red carpet’ statement as good signal for Norway. “Defining what the red carpet means and how they are going to make it possible will help us,” she said.
Innovation Norway is also looking to expand its presence in India with an entrepreneurship programme in 2015.

Hilton Foundation Invests $12 Million to End Homelessnessreddit
The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation is receiving well-deserved attention and accolades for its $12 million investment in efforts to increase the supply of supportive housing throughout Los Angeles County, California, helping thousands of long-term, chronically homeless people transition from homelessness and build new lives. http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-12-million-homeless-housing-20141014-story.html
Supportive housing combines the stability of a home with wraparound community services that keep people housed. Initial investments from the Hilton Foundation have leveraged nearly $270 million in public financing and over $336 million in private financing for homes for people experiencing long-term homelessness. Their commitment has been instrumental in funding dozens of supportive housing projects, including many that were stalled during the last economic downturn.
The Hilton Foundation investment is multiplying capacity in the housing and human services sectors to serve more clients. Because public costs such as health care and public safety decline after people move from the streets to supportive housing, the Hilton Foundation's generosity is saving local governments money with each individual moved into housing. The average annual public cost for a chronically homeless person is over $63,000. That number drops to $17,000 after the client is placed in supportive housing, a reduction in public costs of almost 75%.
We know chronic homelessness is solvable and the data and outcomes prove supportive housing is the right approach. It's more cost-effective for taxpayers, and it's more humane for people struggling with homelessness. Over 80% of people in supportive housing stay in their homes and avoid ending up back on the streets.
The Hilton Foundation is looking to the future. In collaboration with key partners such as Home For Good, CSH, other foundations, and city and county agencies, they are embracing smart and innovative tools and investments, such as:
• Encouraging the use of a triage tool in hospitals that can identify the highest-need, highest-cost homeless persons so they can be targeted for supportive housing.
• Working with Los Angeles County and community partners to reach people with long histories of homelessness who are incarcerated in jails to connect these men and women to supportive housing upon release, reducing their likelihood of becoming homeless or returning to jail.
• Promoting the use of a tool to assess homeless transition age youth ages 18-24 to determine risk for long-term homelessness.
The Hilton Foundation's partners will loan at least $7.5 million to providers in the next five years, resulting in at least 200 new units of supportive housing.  Also, funds will be used for small rehab loans for private property owners to make improvements to units for supportive housing, security deposit loans for supportive housing tenants, and incentive and stalled project loans. Together, these financing mechanisms will lead to an additional 580 supportive housing units.
Because of the caring leaders at the Hilton Foundation, who eagerly embrace evidence-based solutions and results, Los Angeles is getting the assistance it needs to help homeless people turn around their lives.

Markets get cold feet | Bull run to last for 20 yrs: JhunjhunwalaIndian markets get cold feet ahead of crucial 2-day FOMC meet
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 27, 2014, 03.35PM IST
(The US Federal Reserve will…)
NEW DELHI: Most of the Asian markets, including India, were down on Monday, as investors await the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting this week.
The Sensex closed the day at 26,752.90; down 98.15 points. The Nifty ended the day at 7,991.70; down 22.85 points.
The US Federal Reserve Bank, that will hold its meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to wrap up the Fed's long-running bond purchasing program, known as quantitative easing or QE, this month. Also, global investors will watch out for comments on the direction of interest rates.
Since last December, the US Central Bank has been gradually scaling back its monthly bond purchases, which now stand at $15 billion per month.
If the US Fed indicates hiking rates sooner than expected, then it may trigger some bit of sell-off in emerging markets, including India, and may cap further gains, say experts. However, the broader trend still remains on the upside.
So long as Brazil has negative turn of events as far as election is concerned, experts say it is positive for India, as allocation of funds is slowly moving from Brazil to India.
"Even though global cues are in favour for India, but you have to also consider the fact that there is certain amount of nervousness - US FED meeting which starts tomorrow and most probably, they are going to announce some interest rate policy which the market will wait with bated breath," said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, President, Destimoney Securities Pvt Ltd.
"The European banks' stress test, which has failed 25 banks, is a matter of concern. So, there is certain amount of nervousness in the global markets and investors are in a bit of cautious mode," he added.
Bandyopadhyay is of the view that things definitely look positive for India and "I would not be surprised if at some stage the market picks up and gathers momentum once again."
The Indian markets, which started on a high note, pared most of the intraday gains and was trading flat in trade on Monday. The S&P BSE Sensex, which rallied as much as 144 points in trade pared most of its gains and was trading flat.
At 01:20 pm, Asian shares were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index was trading 0.6 per cent higher at 15,388 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.68 per cent lower at 23,143.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.3 per cent higher at 1,931 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.51 per cent lower at 2,290.
Manish Singh, Strategist & Head of Investments at Crossbridge Capital, said that he is not expecting a major surprise when it comes to the FOMC. "I know that Bullard of St. Louis FED said that there could be a case for FED stopping the QE. That could cause panic in the market," he added.
Singh is of the view that India cannot be immune to what is happening in the US and Europe, and investors in India should always remember that.
However, India is again a macro story, because you are in an emerging market and are still dependent on exports more than domestic consumption, added Singh.
Experts feel that the bull market in India still remains intact and investors with a long-term horizon should not worry too much and keep adding quality stocks on every fall.
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprise, is of the view that the bull run will last for the next two decades, but of course there will be major corrections.
A normal correction in India can happen anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent, say experts. A look at the bull market of 2003 to 2007 shows that we had a deep correction in 2004 and then another correction in 2006.
"All these corrections, which lasted for a quarter or two, were of the order of 10 to 20 per cent. We have not seen anything like that so far. But can you rule it out?" said Hiren Ved, Director & CIO, Alchemy Capital Management.
Mehraboon Irani, Principal & Head- Pvt Client Group Business, Nirmal Bang Securities is of the view that the global problems have still not gone away, "but this is just to state that I remain a bull."
"I feel the markets will go up and I feel we are in for a great time over the next few years. We could be 10% to 12% higher on the Nifty and when the Nifty moves up by 10-12%, you can obviously expect many stocks to move out 25, 30, 40, 60% also from here," he added.

Tree plantation in Koraput to compensate for loss in Cyclone HudhudPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Koraput (odisha) | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:32 pm
To compensate for the loss of trees in Cyclone Hudhud, Jeypore forest division in Koraput district has decided to take up plantation in over 200 hectares of forest land.
Officials said the thick forest cover of Ramagiri and Boipariguda forest range under the division was lost due to the cyclone which hit the district on October 12.
“Though it is impossible to regain the lost trees as those were decades old, efforts will be made to cover more forest land under plantation. As per a preliminary report prepared by the department the new plantation will be done in over 200 hectares. If more suitable patches are found then it will also be covered under plantation,” said Jeypore divisional forest officer Bijaya Kumar Acharya.
As per the damage report of the forest department at least 1,765 valuable trees comprising sal, teak, eucalyptus and chakunda varieties in the district were uprooted in the cyclone.
“As many as 629 sal and teak trees which were decades old have been uprooted in the Gupteswar forest range. As per preliminary assessment report the loss of trees is around Rs one crore,” Acharya said.
Officials said hundreds of new tress which were two to three years-old had also been uprooted in the cyclone and it will take several years to compensate the loss of green cover in real terms.
“Trees in large numbers belonging to private parties had also been uprooted in the cyclone, but assessment of those trees has not been done,” he said.
However, the most pressing problem now was shortage of staff which is impeding the removal of the fallen trees from the forests while both villagers and timber mafias are targeting the salvaged trees.
“As it will take months together to remove the uprooted trees we have formed mobile squads to keep an eye on them. With limited manpower we are trying to collect the uprooted trees from the forest at the earliest,” Acharya said.

Govt considers raising import taxes on vegetable oils

India is considering raising the import taxes on crude and refined vegetable oils to protect local farmers and the refining industry, two government sources said on Monday, as purchases by the world's top importer are expected hit a record this year.
The government could increase the duties on both crude and refined vegetable oils by more than 5 percent, said an official who is part of the decision making process. Currently India imposes a 2.5 percent tax on crude oils and 10 percent on the refined variety.
"We are considering an increase in the import tax but it is not going to happen immediately because the official process will take some more time," said another government official directly involved in the decision making process.
The first source said that a final decision on the duty hikes will be taken by the Finance Ministry.
Hit by cheaper imports, industry body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) has petitioned the government to raise the duty on crude oils to 10 percent and 25 percent on refined products.
India is likely to import a record 13 million tonnes of edible oils in the new year beginning November, up from an estimated 11.6 million tonnes this year, including 8 million tonnes of palm oil.
New Delhi imported a record 10.4 million tonnes of edible oils in the 2012/13 year, data from SEA showed.
Nearly 60 percent of India's annual edible oil demand of 18-19 million tonnes is met by imports, consisting mainly of palm oil sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia.
India also buys tiny amounts of soyoil from Latin America and sunflower oil from the Black Sea region.

Maha govt swearing-in on Oct 31 | Sena talks sweet  backs BJP for CM s postSena talks sweet, backs BJP for CM's post, favours coalition

(According to party sources,…)
MUMBAI: As BJP prepared to elect the leader of its legislature party tomorrow who will be the party's first Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena today appeared resigned to backing it in government formation but there was no clarity yet on whether it will join the ministry.
The newly elected BJP MLAs will meet here at 11 am tomorrow in the presence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and party's general secretary in-charge of the state J P Nadda to elect their leader.
"After the legislature party leader is elected, we will call on Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and stake claim to form government tomorrow itself," BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told PTI.
State BJP president Devendra Fadnavis , 44, is being seen as clear favourite for Chief Minister's post.
According to party sources, the new government will be sworn in on October 31 in the presence of top central leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several of his Cabinet colleagues and BJP Chief Ministers.
Speaking openly in favour of a BJP-led coalition government for the first time, senior Sena leader and spokesman Sanjay Raut said it will be a "stable" dispensation.
"If Shiv Sena and BJP come together to form a government it will be stable. Our ties with BJP are very old. Whatever happened during the election we have have forgotten. Ours is not like an India-Pakistan fight.
"The people have given mandate to BJP. It has got more seats. It is our duty (to lend support to BJP). Sena's support will always be there for a Chief Minister who works in the interest of Maharashtra," he said.
Though back channel talks were on between the leaders of the two parties which had parted ways just before the poll following failure of seat-sharing talks, there was no clarity yet on whether Sena will be part of the government or support it from outside.
Sharad Pawar's NCP, with 41 MLAs, has already offered unconditional outside support to BJP, which has 121 MLAs and pre-poll ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha one in the 288-member Assembly, in its bid to form government.
Making things easier for BJP further, the party made it clear that it will bail out the new government during the trust vote if Shiv Sena does not join it.
"If Shiv Sena joins the government, there will be no problem. We will not be part of the government but do not want to create instability by voting against a minority government. So, NCP will abstain, if there is voting," party spokesman Nawab Malik told PTI.
NCP would like to honour the people's mandate which is in favour of BJP, the single largest party, he said.

Expect RBI to turn dovish in Dec, cut rates in Feb: BofA-ML
BofA-ML said Rajan may not go in for a rate cut at the December 2 review as it wants to make sure the inflation is "truly coming off", especially given the fact high rates result in some sacrifice on the growth front.
Post your opinion here
 
As concerns on inflation front ebb, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan will adopt a dovish stance in the December policy review meet and cut rates in February, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) today said. "We expect Governor Rajan to sound more dovish in December and cut rate in February. After all, we see CPI inflation well set to meet the RBI's targets of 8 per cent in January 2015 and 6 percent in January 2016 (with normal monsoon rains)," the top foreign brokerage said in a note.
Rajan had overturned the majority opinion of the members in RBI's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and chose to hold the rates at the last monetary policy review in October, according to minutes of the meeting. BofA-ML said Rajan may not go in for a rate cut at the December 2 review as it wants to make sure the inflation is "truly coming off", especially given the fact high rates result in some sacrifice on the growth front.
Before the September 30 policy review, wherein he left the rates unchanged, Rajan had told a banking summit what was the point in cutting interest rates at the first instance of a cooling off in inflation only to be increased again to fight price rise. In the note, the US brokerage said India's GDP growth will slip below 5 percent in the September quarter as against the handsome 5.7 percent print in the April-June period of the current fiscal. Rajan will opt for the cut at the February monetary policy review, once the 8 per cent inflation target is met and also after indications on the rabi (winter crop) output are received, BofA-ML said.
The rabi crop is expected to be good as the late rains have helped and the same is visible in the higher sown area, the brokerage said, adding this will help cool food prices. Inflation measured by consumer prices has been trending down for over four months, and came in at 6.7 percent in September, much below the RBI's targets. The recent cuts in the petrol and diesel prices will also help cool inflation, the brokerage said.

Corruption has taken deep root in Mizoram  govt unable to stamp out on its own: CM LalThanhawlaPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:56 pm
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Monday said “corruption has taken deep root” in Mizoram and hit out at the “idleness” among the state’s government employees while saying corruption is not only mean swindling public money, but includes “laziness, idleness, lack of passion for one’s work and expecting a higher income than what one’s work is worth.”
Speaking at the opening of RTI week in Aizawl, Lal Thanhawla said, “The government cannot fully stamp out corruption on it’s own, so we need the support of the public as well as the media, and one way is for people to use RTI to help the government.”
“In Mizoram, the best things are owned by the influential and the rich and common man does not get benefits,” the five-time CM said.
Elaborating on his dismissal of state government employees’ work culture, Lal Thanhawla said, “We pay little heed to filing property returns and while elsewhere people pay close attention we do not even border to intimate the government and we buy movable property like TV sets and cars as if it was paan.”
Lal Thanhawla’s two consecutive terms in office have been partly based on his party’s promise of a corruption-free government in an apparent bid to score over the Mizo National Front’s perceived corruption during the rebel-group turned political party’s ten-year rule, which ended in 2008.

Creative Muvo MinireviewPrint
The Muvi Mini is water-resistant, which makes it great to carry outdoors.
Written by Mihir Patkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:47 pm | Updated: October 29, 2014 4:29 pm
What Is It?
The Creative Muvo Mini is a Bluetooth speaker that emphasises its portability. It’s small, its rubber-coated body gives a nice grip, and a fall from a height of 5 feet didn’t cause any damage in looks or sound. The Muvo Mini packs two 1.3-inch full range drivers and an oversized passive driver for bass. There’s Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC connectivity, and you can also plug in standard 3.5mm audio input.
Price:  Rs. 5,999 (Rs 4,200 in stores)
Anything That Makes It Special?
The Muvi Mini is water-resistant (IP66 for the technically inclined), which makes it great to carry outdoors. You can’t dunk it into a swimming pool or carry it out in pouring rain, but it will be fine if you spilled a drink on it or had it by the pool with water splashing on it. This ruggedness gives you a sense of security and makes you worry less about a gadget when everything seems fragile these days.
What Sounds Good and What Sounds Bad?
The Muvo Mini isn’t the best set of Bluetooth speakers we have heard in this price range, but it’s still very good. If you’re listening to bass-heavy music, the Muvo Mini is going to sound flat compared to other speakers like the JBL Flip or Osaki Jukebox. However, playing Bollywood songs, Western classical, and classic rock is a good enough experience.
In Real-World Conditions, Can You Actually Use It For Hands-Free Calling?
It depends on how far you will be from the Muvo Mini. At a distance of about 5-6 feet, the Mini could pick up our voice clearly and the call was smooth. At 7-8 feet, the person on the other line could barely hear what we were saying.
How’s The Battery Life?
The Muvo Mini’s most impressive feature is its battery life, given its small size. Even though it is more portable than any other Bluetooth speakers we’ve used, it managed to eke out 11 hours of continuous music playback, and 10 hours with intermittent calling. Plus, it can be charged by a standard microUSB cable, so you don’t need to carry a separate charger for it.
Should I Buy It?
If you’re going to use your Bluetooth speakers in your room and not carry it around, then no, the Muvo Mini isn’t the best purchase. But if you’re looking for speakers that you can take to the beach or out on the lawn for a winter evening, we strongly recommend the Muvo Mini.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Pakistan’s army says military jets and helicopters have destroyed nine hideouts of militants in two separate airstrikes killing 33 militants in an ongoing offensive in the North Waziristan tribal region.
An army statement on Monday says early morning airstrikes near the Datta Khel area destroyed five such hideouts killing 18 militants during the offensive. Later in the day, helicopter gunships struck four more hideouts in Gharlami area killing another 15 militants, the army said.
North Waziristan was a safe haven to a mix of local and foreign militant groups until the military launched its operation there in the middle of this year.
The military offensive has driven out over 800,000 residents from North Waziristan, where the army says it has cleared of militants in 90 percent of the tribal region.

Ward Farnsworth guest-blogging about his new book  RestitutionI’m delighted to report that Ward Farnsworth , who is now Dean of the University of Texas School of Law, will be guest-blogging this coming week about his new book, “Restitution: Civil Liability for Unjust Enrichment”. I’ve long much liked Ward’s work, including his “The Legal Analyst” (about which he guest-blogged here ; see also Ken Anderson’s post praising the book) and his “ Classical English Rhetoric .” His new book likewise looks excellent; here’s a summary (paragraph break added):
Restitution is the body of law concerned with taking away gains that someone has wrongfully obtained. The operator of a Ponzi scheme takes money from his victims by fraud and then invests it in stocks that rise in value. Or a company pays a shareholder excessive dividends or pays them to the wrong person. Or a man poisons his grandfather and then collects under the grandfather’s will.
In each of these cases, one party is unjustly enriched at the expense of another. And in all of them the law of restitution provides a way to undo the enrichment and transfer the defendant’s gains to a party with better rights to them. Tort law focuses on the harm, or costs, that one party wrongfully imposes on another. Restitution is the mirror image; it corrects gains that one party wrongfully receives at another’s expense. It is an important topic for every lawyer and for anyone else interested in how the legal system responds to injustice.
In Restitution, Ward Farnsworth presents a guide to this body of law that is compact, lively, and insightful — the first treatment of its kind that the American law of restitution has received. The book explains restitution doctrines, remedies, and defenses with unprecedented clarity and illustrates them with vivid examples. Farnsworth demonstrates that the law of restitution is guided by a manageable and coherent set of principles that have remarkable versatility and power.
This is an important area of the law, to which law students, lawyers, and law professors often pay too little attention; I much look forward to Ward’s posts on the subject.
Eugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.

NASA observatory captures largest sunspot in two decades

AP This image provided by NASA shows the sun emitting a significant X3.2-class flare erupting from the lower half of the sun, peaking at 5:40 p.m. EDT Friday Oct. 24, 2014. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly and captured images of the event.
TOPICS
space programme
NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has spotted an image of a gigantic sunspot - the largest in last 24 years.
The flare erupted from a particularly large active region dubbed as AR 12192. The sunspot soon grew to be the largest active region observed in the current solar cycle - a periodic change in the Sun’s activity and appearance - which began in 2008.
This is the fourth substantial X-class flare from this active region since October 19. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.
Giant sunspot erupts today with 4th substantial flare since Oct 19. Details: http://t.co/Ft2qernaxP @NASASunEarth pic.twitter.com/npepZgLP7d

“The sunspot region is about 80,000 miles across, which is wide enough for 10 Earths to be laid across its diameter,” NASA said in a statement.
Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. These can also disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

Coal scam: SPP differs with CBI s conclusion...Bharat Parashar
(The Supreme Court-appointed…)
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) today differed with the conclusion of the CBI seeking closure of a case involving JAS Infrastructure and Power Ltd and others in a Coalscam case, saying that the special court should proceed against the accused.
SPP R S Cheema told the court that there was evidence against the accused and if the court feels, it can take cognizance on CBI's closure report in which the agency has said "no prosecutable evidence" was found against the company and others, arrayed as accused in its FIR.
"It is basically a case of cognizance...The person who should be liable for this (misrepresentation of facts to get coal blocks) is Manoj Jayaswal (businessman)," Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar .
If the court takes cognizance on the closure report, it implies that there is sufficient evidence to proceed against the accused.
Cheema, however, clarified that no tangible evidence could be found against officials of the Coal Ministry .
The court, after hearing Cheema's submissions, fixed the case for further proceedings on November 12.
"Arguments on the closure report have been heard... Put up for consideration on November 12, 2014," the court said.
CBI filed a closure report in the matter in which it had lodged an FIR against Nagpur-based businessman Manoj Jayaswal and others for alleged irregularities by JAS Infrastructure and Power Limited in acquiring coal blocks.
On October 14, CBI had filed a revised closure report in the court.
This had come after the court had earlier observed that the probe was "incomplete" and nothing was clear in CBI's closure report and it was irked over the agency adopting different yardsticks in different cases and not following a uniform policy in its investigation.

The 160 MW projects would be set-up in the three districts of Anantapur, Kurnool and Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh.
The new residual State of AP had invited bids from developers to procure 500 mw of solar power. However, it has received good response with bids of more than 1296 MW.

PE investments touch $3.1 bn in July-Sept q...Grant Thornton
(PE investment in the July-September…)
NEW DELHI: Private equity investment in the July-September quarter reached $3.1 billion, registering a growth of 47 per cent over the corresponding period last year driven by the Flipkart deal, says a report.
According to the assurance, tax and advisory firm Grant Thornton, private equity investments witnessed a significant improvement both in terms of value (47 per cent) as well as volume (37 per cent) in the July-September quarter this year.
In the quarter, PE investments amounted to $3.12 billion through 157 deals, while in the corresponding period last year there were 115 such transactions worth $2.12 billion.
"Private equity witnessed a 47 per cent increase in values led by the billion dollar investment in Flipkart and 37 per cent increase in volumes driven by the IT&ITeS sector with over 40 per cent share in total deal volume," the report said.
There were several big ticket deals in the quarter. As many as 15 investments were over $50 million each, including two over $100 million and one billion dollar investment, the report said. In the third quarter of 2013 there were only nine investments worth over $50 million each.
Sectorwise, IT/ITES, mainly driven by e-commerce, dominated PE deal values and volumes and going forward the sectors that are expected to see renewed deal activity include infrastructure, energy, consumer and financial services.
"We expect valuations to go up given the renewed business sentiments which in our view, would be both a challenge and an opportunity for dealmakers to close deals in the coming quarters," Grant Thornton India Partner Raja Lahiri said.
"We believe that this momentum of deal activity will continue to increase and we look forward to closing the year on a high note," Lahiri added.
PE investment so far in 2014 stood higher at $8.4 billion as against $7.8 billion in 2013, with 38 per cent higher volumes in 2014 as compared to 2013, led by the technology sector.

Honda to replace airbags in Brio, Amaze, CR-V
Our Bureau
This is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Honda Cars India (HCIL) on Monday said that it would carry out preventive replacement of Driver Side Air Bag Inflator of 1,040 units of Brio, 1,235 units of Amaze and 63 units of CR-V manufactured between September 2011 and July 2014.
The company said it is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator.
In case of certain vehicles, due to incorrect assembly of the baffle plate, the pressure within the inflator may rise excessively when the driver side airbag deploys in an accident or other situation, causing damage to the container, HCIL said in a statement.
“HCIL is carrying out the part replacement as part of a global exercise by Honda Motor Company to ensure stringent quality standards for its products. There has been no reporting of any incident related to this part in India,” it said.  
The replacement would be carried out free of cost at HCIL dealerships across India, and the owners will be contacted individually, it said.
The customers can also check whether their car will be covered under this campaign by submitting their 17 character alpha-numeric vehicle identification number (VIN) on its microsite, which has been created on the company’s website, HCIL said.  
This is the second such case over the last one week. Nissan India on Friday had announced to replace 9,000 units of Micra hatchback and Sunny sedan due to defective driver airbags in the cars.
This was also part of the Japanese car major’s recall of 2.6 lakh cars manufactured by it globally between 2008 and 2012.

Centre to name only those having prosecutable case: Arun Jaitley on black moneyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:18 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:27 pm
The Central Government will make public names of only those people against whom there is a prosecutable case in connection with tax evasion through offshore accounts, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday, amid the Congress asking for disclosure of all names of black money holders.
“We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence,” he told reporters.
READ: Black money case: Centre names three account holders
His remark comes hours after the government disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and a Goa miner against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under the scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal”.
Earlier, Congress leader Digvijay Singh attacked Jaitley for his comments that Congress would be embarrassed when all names of those who stashed money abroad were made public.
Terming Jaitley’s remarks as “mischievous”, Singh said: “If he (Jaitley) has guts, he should reveal those names.” He said if any Congress member is found to have stashed money abroad illegally, the party would “punish” the person.
READ: Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre to SC
Another Congress leader and a former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said the party has no problem if all names are put out in public domain.
Jaitley had earlier said the government would not be pushed into an act of adventurism and jeopardise the chances of getting cooperation of other countries in future.
The NDA government’s approach on black money, he had asserted, “is doggedly persistent, not adventurist.”
He had also blamed the agreement entered into by the Congress government with Germany in 1995 as a constraining factor in disclosing details of black money stashed abroad.
In the run-up to Parliamentary polls, BJP had promised to bring back black money kept by Indians in overseas banks while targeting the UPA government for not taking effective action on the issue.

Imposition of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centres involvement in the issuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre to SCPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:25 pm
The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Swiss government has indicated its willingness to provide information on “stolen data” containing names of Indians who had allegedly stashed black money in banks there.
The government said the “development” is very significant as the Swiss government had earlier refused to provide any information regarding it.
“Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information in respect of cases where investigations have been carried out by the IT Department independently from what Swiss government considers as stolen data. This development is very significant because there are several cases of account holders which were investigated by the Department independently.
“Earlier the Swiss government had not agreed to provide any information in such cases on the ground that these were stolen data and have been obtained in breach of Swiss law,” it said in its affidavit.
The government said the Swiss Federal Tax Administration has agreed that their counterpart authority would assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank accounts.
“The Swiss authorities have also agreed to provide the requested information in a time bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline,” the Centre said.
It told the apex court that Switzerland has also assured it of commencing talks with India for concluding an Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement between the two sides at the earliest after completion of their domestic procedures.

Kerala-born businessman tops list of powerful Indians in GulfBy: Press Trust of India | Dubai | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:19 pm
Kerala-born businessman and the Managing Director of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali MA, has retained his top position in the annual list of powerful Indians in Gulf countries for the fifth time in a row.
The ‘Indian Power List’, published Sunday by Arabian Business, named Ali as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf countries.
His Lulu Group has a strong presence in the Middle East’s retail sector and is planning expansion in new markets.
A key reason for Ali being considered as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf is also his close proximity to the various ruling family members of GCC countries.
Ali has recently been elected as Director Board Member of Abu Dhabi Chamber for the third consecutive time, becoming the first and only Indian till date to occupy such a position.
He also featured in the Forbes Top Global Billionaire 2014 list.
Lulu Group has operations in 32 countries, with staff strength of 31,000 and has reported revenues of USD 5.2 billion (Rs 33,500 crore) in 2013.

A spokesman for South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority says prosecutors will appeal the verdict and sentencing of Oscar Pistorius, who was handed a 5-year prison term after being convicted of culpable homicide.
Prosecution spokesman Nathi Mncube said on Monday that the next step is to file papers in court.
Pistorius started serving his prison sentence on Oct. 21 after he was acquitted of murder by a judge and found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a toilet door in his home.
Under the current terms, the Olympic runner is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest.

Ford system tracks cops' driving

LOS ANGELES — Police officers, many of whom are already wearing body cameras, now may have their police car driving skills scrutinized, as well.
The Los Angeles Police Department is testing new technology in 50 police cruisers that will allow supervisors to keep a close eye on whether officers are hot-dogging around the city instead of setting an example of careful driving. It also monitors whether officers are wearing their seat belts.
The system is the joint effort between Ford and a technology company, Telogis, of Aliso Viejo, Calif. It's a factory-installed option for police agencies ordering either the Police Interceptor sedan — a redone Taurus — or SUV — a law-enforcement version of the Explorer.
Both companies say they see the system as an important step forward.
"The leading cause of death of police officers is crashes," says Gary Oldham, manager of public safety business development for Telogis. And with little more than four of 10 police officers believed to be wearing seat belts on a regular basis while patrolling, "We're losing too many cops where it is preventable."
The new system, called Ford Telematics powered by Telogis for Law Enforcement, measures factors like speed compared to the posted limit, seat belt usage, harsh braking and acceleration, whether the car has spun out, the status of the anti-lock braking system, yaw and airbag status. While telematics systems like this have become popular among fleet operators in recent years to keep track of their vehicles in real time, this one is customized for police use. For instance, it can tell supervisors when the telematics correlate with use of the light bar — the red and blue emergency lights on a top of a car — indicating the car was on an emergency call or pursuit.
"We expect police cars to drive fast because (officers) are out there saving lives," says Gred Dziewit, a Telogis vice president. "There are times when it is acceptable and when it is not acceptable."
But the system could be controversial in the rank-and-file, where the system could raise questions about privacy.
The head of the L.A. Police Protective League, which represents the city's officers, says the organization is deeply concerned about officer safety, but doesn't want a system that's intrusive. It's the kind of issue that will require a meeting with police supervisors, says PPL President Tyler Izen, a detective. "They have a requirement for letting my people know about ramifications," he says.
The city's director of police transportation, Vartan Yegiyan, says the system "will give us a bird's-eye view of what is taking place" and help the department get "100% compliant on seat-belt use." Seat-belt use is a problem in police agencies across the country because of officer concerns about being about get out the car fast in emergencies or if they come under attack.
If an air bag deploys in a cruiser, signaling a crash, the system will detect it, allowing dispatchers to send help sooner, Yegiyan says. If the test succeeds, there is a chance it could come to some or all of the city's 1,800 cruisers.
The system could be one more factor helping Ford gain an edge in the hot competition against General Motors and Chrysler Group to supply the nation's police agencies. It's a market that Ford dominated with the Crown Victoria, but now it's wide open since the old Crown Vic was discontinued. Ford plays up the safety, not sales, angle.
"Even the slightest improvements in driver training and behavior within law enforcement organizations can potentially save lives," said Bill Frykman, a Ford manager, in a statement. "Whether in emergency operation or not, the combination of vehicle data from this technology taken in context with different driving situations will help illustrate to police organizations where changes can be made that will have a profound effect on officer safety."
The system comes to departments next year. Pricing has not been disclosed.

00:03  I'm Susan Page question bureau chief of USA today and
00:06  this is capital download. We're in the DC offices of the
00:10  former solicitor general Theodore Olson thanks so much for being with
00:13  us please thank you. You're famous for arguing the case of
00:16  bush V gore in 2000 against David Boyce a democratically lead
00:20  attorney. And then in 2009 the two of you joined forces
00:24  to challenge. Proposition eight in California. The outcome of that effectively
00:29  allowed marriages between same sex couples to resume in California and
00:33  so much. Has happened on this area in recent days this
00:37  month. The Supreme Court surprised many by letting appeals court will
00:41  understandable allowed same sex marriage we've seen a huge expansion. In
00:45  the number of states that now allow this would we'll back
00:49  with hindsight will this turn out to be. A pivotal month
00:52  do you think in this style. Yeah I believe it will.
00:55  When we started the case that you mentioned in May of
00:59  2009. Only three states permitted persons to get married to someone
01:04  of the same sex. Today it's up to 32 people on
01:08  the 32 states it's up to 32 states now. On just
01:12  five years later so it's a and that's 65%. Of the
01:15  American population. Are now living in states where they can marry
01:19  the person I love. If it's a burst from the same
01:22  sex and so this has been an overwhelming very rapid change
01:26  an issue that used to be exceedingly controversy. Did you think
01:30  in 2009 at five years later you be in a situation
01:34  where a third of the State's two thirds of Americans would
01:36  be in a situation where. They could marry someone of the
01:39  same we never thought would move this fast we were hoping.
01:42  The we could help change people's attitudes. As well as change
01:46  the law for the people who we represented and people all
01:49  over America like them. We've never envisioned that would go this
01:53  past. No we still haven't had the Supreme Court recognized that
01:56  constitutional right to same sex marriage. President Obama said in an
02:00  interview that was just published in The New Yorker that. He
02:02  thought there was a constitutional guarantee but this incremental approach that
02:06  the court has taken may be the right way to go
02:08  making it less controversial more lasting given people a time to
02:11  get. That you straight do you think that's right. No. If
02:15  President Obama himself has had what he calls an evolution. His
02:20  first of all started. I'll politically saying he was opposed to
02:25  same sex marriage and and he gradually changed that you Denny
02:28  said it should be up to the states. And now he
02:31  says that it should be incremental. I think the thing that
02:35  he overlooks when they have the greatest respect for President Obama
02:38  and positions that he's taken because it's meant a lot. To
02:41  gay and lesbian people and he supported the cases that the
02:44  winner before the Supreme Court a year or so ago. But.
02:48  It still is true that there are people in. Eighteen states
02:53  the United States and don't have this fundamental rights that he
02:57  has just announced that he believes him. And that we believe
03:00  in the right to marry the pershing that you love. Who
03:03  happens to be of the opposites of the same sex. This
03:07  affects the lives of those individuals in those states that affects
03:11  the children they're living in their homes. It affects everyone and
03:16  every day that we withhold. Constitutional fundamental constitutional rights from individual
03:22  citizens in this country every day that's wrong. If appeals courts
03:26  continue to report gay marriage we can get fifty states with
03:29  out a Supreme Court decision with that even. Well it would
03:34  not be good enough because it's not now. When will that
03:38  happen and how much misery and how much suffering. Do individuals
03:43  in this country have to experience before that happens. Why do
03:48  you think the court this man decided to let those appeals
03:51  court decision stand without. An explanation and pat taking the cases
03:55  on her own well I think the court I don't. No
03:57  no one knows and anybody who says that they know they're
04:01  wrong. As you know and to justices don't tell us but
04:05  they may have wanted. The process to be delivered to allow
04:10  them rapidly changing public opinion to catch up. With the entire
04:14  country and they may have they've had a very contentious term
04:18  last year. They decided a lot of very controversial cases. They
04:22  mean not who wanted to walk into that controversy. Yet again
04:26  so soon. Especially since federal judges all over the country were
04:31  coming to the same conclusion. And they've just decided we can
04:34  wait another year. Hess a court reached up sort of point
04:38  of no return. On this issue is it. Conceivable to you
04:43  that the court would now weigh in and say no there's
04:45  no passengers come right isn't it where I couldn't be wrong
04:48  course. But I do believe that this is a point of
04:51  no return I do not believe that the United States Supreme
04:54  Court could rule that all of those laws prohibiting marriage. Are
04:59  suddenly constitution. Constitutional after all these individuals have gotten married. And
05:05  their rights you've changed from their families are living under a
05:08  regime in which they do helpful constitutional rights to have that
05:12  snatch away. It seems to me would be inhuman it would
05:15  be cool. And it it would be inconsistent was what the
05:19  Supreme Court has said about these issues in the case is
05:22  that it has rendered. You've been voted the most contentious issues.
05:27  Over the past decades that we face in this nation won't
05:29  happen of the court. Anything we can't say what the court's
05:32  gonna do a white department's decision what would happen if the
05:35  court did suddenly decide there is a constitutional right well I.
05:40  Think that in the American people have come to a point
05:43  where they would do something to repeal these laws in the
05:47  states where they still exist. That prevent loving people from coming
05:52  together and forming an enduring relationship with the person that they
05:56  love. Sense now of the population. Moves and pulls you tell
06:02  us that the population has changed. When we started the case
06:05  David Boies I started the case five years ago. There was
06:08  a seventeen point differential between people that approve same sex marriage
06:13  and people who disapproved. 17%. More people disapprove. Now it's ten
06:18  or 15%. More approve than disapprove. So and young people. Young
06:24  people under the age of thirty are 75 to 80%. Supportive.
06:29  Of same sex marriage the people where what we call marriage
06:32  equality so I think that the public would catch up but
06:36  I would hate to see something like that had come out
06:38  of this or. And courts are Supreme Court correspondent Richard wolf
06:41  is winning every day for decision out of the sixth district
06:45  that sixth circuit in Ohio. Oral arguments in August that panel
06:49  seemed to be one judge 400 against and Jeffrey Sutton uncertain
06:53  what your gut tell you happening case. Well I don't know
06:57  why. Happened in that case I know Jeff Sutton is a
07:00  very very fine judge she's a conservative and it's possible he
07:03  might rule in favor of sustaining the prohibition. But even if
07:09  a panel decision that so that would be 21 decision presumably.
07:13  That decision can be taken up to the full six circuit
07:16  on and all of the judges on the circuit I think
07:20  would come up the other way. You worry analog turn the
07:22  big changes in public opinion but we we've seen on the
07:25  issue of abortion that overtime that was a kind of backlash.
07:29  To the Roe vs. Wade decision that continues today didn't any
07:32  chance that that's gonna happen politically in this country. Now the
07:36  trend is there's so far along. In support of marriage equality
07:40  we all have friends or neighbors or relatives who are gay
07:44  we respect their rights and respect the way that they live.
07:48  Abortion is about taking whether you agree or disagree it's about
07:51  taking a life distinguished extinguishing. A life. I'll marriage is about
07:57  to loving people coming together and forming a part of our
08:00  community and one we see people get married. And we see
08:04  the smiles on their faces. And then tears of happiness in
08:08  their eyes we feel good that's what public opinion has changed
08:11  so much that's why it's so different than abortion. May your
08:14  Republican. You've been a high ranking figures I understand your Republican
08:19  yes it's not a secret. You've been official and Republican Republican
08:22  administrations and private counsel to two Republican president sure conservative so
08:27  it. Your fellow Republicans tell you about this issue is they
08:31  disagree with you do you find. We'll song conservatives disagree with
08:34  me some Republicans disagree with me but the number who disagree.
08:38  Is getting smaller and smaller. The younger younger that the number
08:42  of young Republicans. Are are. Extraordinarily supportive in larger numbers. As
08:49  you get older you have more resistance to marriage equality. But
08:53  as you get younger in the population the other people of
08:55 people that are under thirty whether they're Democrats or Republicans. Don't
08:59  even understand why this is an issue. They have friends that
09:04  what they want to see happy. And this is changing it
09:09  it's changing in the Catholic Church. Mussina polls of Catholics eat
09:14  under thirty. Are supportive of marriage equality. You see changes in
09:19  conservatives who see changes in Republicans. This is an issue of
09:23  human rights human decency. And basic constitutional protections and I think
09:28  the whole country is moving in the right way including conservatives.
09:32  So let's look ahead what you think about. The battles to
09:36  come will that are now being legal battles over religious freedom
09:40  issues for instance where there. Businesses are open to the public
09:43  like bakeries are florist can choose. Not to sell their services
09:49  to gay couples from their marriage. I don't think that's going
09:51  to happen I think there could be if pocket or two
09:55  of isolated outlying cases where that might be an issue. But
09:59  we've crossed that bridge along time ago with the Civil Rights
10:02  Act of 1964. We've told people that if you run a
10:06  business you run hotel you run a motel. I'll be running
10:09  gas station whatever the public business that your in the commercial
10:13  enterprise uranium may not discriminate. Against individuals on the basis of
10:17  their race their religion on their sex on all of those
10:21  things and the same should be true if people enter. Into
10:25  commercial world they should not be permitted to discriminate. Against certain
10:30  things out aspects of an individual's life or you're. In any
10:34  new businesses if you're in tuxedos. I don't think that you
10:37  should be permitted to say role are you marrying the right
10:39  person because we won't rent to the right tuxedo. And how
10:42  about. Battles over religious institutions performing gay marriage is reliving parts
10:47  of that no I don't think so I think religious institutions
10:50  have the right to sanctified the marriages that are consistent without
10:54  their religious conviction. You have talked about the evolution that President
10:58  Obama ahead on this issue and that many Americans. Have had
11:01  on this issue has there been an evolution of your view
11:03  on this issue. When I first started to think about marriage
11:06  equality I thought that was only right. That persons who are
11:10  gay or lesbian have the same freedom I do to you
11:13  marry the person that I love. They should have that freedom
11:17  and I almost thought that was a conservative value to loving
11:21  people. Who want to come together in an enduring relationship. And
11:25  formal part of our community our society and our economy. Conservatives
11:30  or liberals ought to support that. You have argued I guess
11:34  61 cases before the Supreme Court isn't right. On some of
11:37  the biggest issues we face in the country including the election
11:41  for president. Most proud of what do you hope this is
11:44  the first thing on your legacy. Well I don't think about
11:48  my legacy I hope. Two more years left to help do
11:52  whatever. One does to have a legacy I don't really think
11:55  about that I am very very proud of the work that
11:59  David Boies. And I and our respective law firms did on
12:04  behalf of our the GBT community. To bring them freedom and
12:09  equality and decency and respect in their personal relationships. That case
12:15  that litigation we also handled the Virginia case together all of
12:18  which came to the same conclusion recognition. Of marriage equality. That
12:23  is affected so many people. And liberated them. To be a
12:28  part of our community and to be respected and treated as
12:31  equals that is the legal accomplishment I think I was in
12:36  the most of me. Ted Olson thanks for joining us on
12:39  capitol now must think he's earned.

WASHINGTON -- Former solicitor general Theodore Olson, the Republican lawyer who argued Bush v. Gore and the challenge to California's Proposition 8, says the Supreme Court through action and inaction this month passed "the point of no return" on same-sex marriage.
"I do not believe that the United States Supreme Court could rule that all of those laws prohibiting marriage are suddenly constitutional after all these individuals have gotten married and their rights have changed," he said in an interview on Capital Download. "To have that snatched away, it seems to me, would be inhuman; it would be cruel; and it would be inconsistent with what the Supreme Court has said about these issues in the cases that it has rendered."
This month, the high court let stand without explanation appeals court rulings permitting gay marriage in five states. In an interview with The New Yorker published last week, President Obama said he believes it is a constitutional right but endorsed the court's incremental approach.
Olson disagrees with that, saying the Supreme Court should take a case and affirmatively endorse marriage as a constitutional right. "I think the thing he overlooks...(is) that there are people in 18 states of the United States that don't have this fundamental right that he has just announced that he believes in."
Waiting for the process in lower courts to open the door to gay marriage in all 50 states "would not be good enough because it's not now," Olson said on USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. "When will that happen? And how much misery and how much suffering do individuals in this country have to experience before that happens?"
Given his Republican credentials, Olson has been an unlikely champion in the gay-marriage movement. He served in the Justice Department as assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration and solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration. He was the lead attorney facing Democratic counterpart David Boies in the landmark Bush v. Gore case that finally settled the 2000 election and argued the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that changed campaign finance law.
In 2009, he and Boies joined forces to challenge California's ban on same-sex marriage. Just five years later, the number of states permitting couples of the same gender to marry has exploded from three to 32. Two-thirds of Americans now live in states that allow gay marriage.
"We never thought it would move this fast," Olson says, attributing the change in legal status and public opinion both to "the work of a lot of lawyers" and the actions by individuals in Hollywood and across the country who have "revealed their sexual identity and told their story."
Last week, a U.S. District Court judge in Puerto Rico dismissed a challenge to a law there that limits marriage to one man and one woman, but Olson predicts that decision will be overturned by the Appeals Court. He notes that a closely watched case before a three-judge panel in the 6th Circuit of Ohio could go either way, with Judge Jeffrey Sutton as the apparent swing vote.
"He's a conservative and it's possible that he might rule in favor of sustaining the prohibition," Olson says. But if that happens, "all of the judges on the Circuit, I think, would come out the other way."
At age 74, Olson has argued 61 cases before the Supreme Court, on issues ranging from the First Amendment to the separation of powers. He says he doesn't think about his legacy: "I hope that I will have a few more years left." But he adds that his work on gay marriage "is the legal accomplishment that I think will always mean the most to me."

Quarantined Nurse Who Tested Negative for Ebola in NJ Is Being ReleasedEbola Nurse Kaci Hickox Will 'Understand' Her Quarantine, New Jersey Governor Says

The nurse who was angrily battling her enforced quarantine at a New Jersey hospital after treating Ebola patients was released today, and Gov. Chris Christie said the nurse will understand "when she has time to reflect."
"I know she didn’t want to be there," Christie said at an event in Florida this morning. "No one ever wants to be in the hospital, I suspect. And, so, I understand that. But, the fact is I have a much greater, bigger responsibility to the people of the public."
5-Year-Old Boy Under Observation at NYC Hospital Over Ebola Concerns
Kaci Hickox , who tested negative for the lethal virus after she returned to the United States from Sierra Leone, has been outspoken about being held in quarantine since her arrival at Newark International Airport Friday.
She also hired a lawyer and they announced their plan to file a federal lawsuit against her mandatory 21-day quarantine.
Handout image
Kaci Hickox is seen sitting inside the isolation tent she has been housed in at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey.
"I’m so thankful for the immense attention and support I’ve received. I just hope this nightmare of mine and the fight that I’ve undertaken is not in vain!” she wrote in a text to ABC News' Chief Health and Medical Editor Dr. Richard Besser.
The New Jersey Department of Health issued a statement this morning that Hickox has been "symptom free for the last 24 hours," and that it decided to discharge her after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hickox has asked that she be taken to her home in Fort Kent, Maine and the New Jersey Health Department said she would be taken there by car, and not by public transportation. Senior officials in the Christie administration said she will be driven in a car and escorted by officials from the state and Doctors Without Borders, the agency the Hickox worked for in West Africa.
"Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives," the New Jersey statement said.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention released their own set of guidelines today saying that anyone who did come into direct contact with "Ebola-positive individuals" will require active monitoring and will be quarantined in their home.
Fort Kent's town manager Donald Guimond said Hickox moved to Fort Kent recently and he met her at the town hall shortly before she left for West Africa.
"She never should have been held like that," Guimond told ABC News. "She should be applauded for the work she did trying to contain Ebola in Africa, not held against her will."
"This is her home and we would welcome her back home," he said.

Hickox's release was viewed by some as a reversal of Christie's position, but the governor said, "I didn’t reverse any decision."
The decision to move Hickox to her home state of Maine so that she can be quarantined in her own home is not a break in Christie's protocol, he said, since she will still be serving out the remainder of the 21 day quarantine.

Christie maintained that if she lived in New Jersey, and she had no symptoms, she would have been allowed to be in her home. Christie said Hickox was initially quarantined because she didn't live in New Jersey and they didn't have immediate arrangements to get her to Maine. But while in New Jersey, she developed a fever, so she was kept quarantined in a Newark hospital through the weekend.
Hickox's legal team still plans to move forward with a lawsuit arguing her human rights were violated by the mandated quarantine.
The Republican governor, who is widely seen as one of the party's top presidential hopefuls for 2016, didn't back down from his policy or reach out to Hickox.
"I have no reason to talk to her," Christie said.
"The fact is I’m not going to step away for a minute from protecting the people of my state and our region," Christie said. "So I understand that she didn’t want to be there. She made that very clear from the beginning. but my obligation is to all the people of New Jersey and we’re just going to continue to do that."
He added that "there’s confirmation that she’s being treated quite well in New Jersey."

PHOTO: Kaci Hickox, a nurse, is shown in this undated photo. She was the first person in New Jersey placed under a mandatory 21-day quarantine for people who had direct contact with Ebola patients.
Hickox, 33, hired civil rights attorney Norman Siegel to fight her mandatory quarantine. The nurse has said she feels that her "basic human rights are being violated," kept in a isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, despite showing no symptoms of the Ebola virus.
"Medically speaking there's no reason for the state of New Jersey to keep her quarantined," Siegel said outside the hospital on Sunday. "She very simply wants to be released. We will advocate for the state of New Jersey and the governor to release her as soon as possible."
Hickox never registered a fever, Siegel said, but the Health Department's statement this morning she did briefly have a fever. It did not say what her temperature was.
She was the first person quarantined under a new strict policy instituted by Christie on Friday.
New York, Illinois and Florida also instituted mandatory quarantines for anyone exposed to people infected with Ebola health. Those quarantines can be spent in their homes if they have no symptoms of Ebola.
The policies have drawn the attention of the Obama administration, which told the governors of New Jersey and New York that there are "concerns" about the mandatory quarantines, a senior administration official said today.
Hickox told CNN she is being held in a "tent structure" outside of University Hospital, "with a port-a-potty like structure and no shower and no connection to the outside world except my iPhone."
"This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated," Hickox told CNN.
Christie has said he concluded the quarantine was necessary to protect public health in his state and that he thinks the CDC "eventually will come around to our point of view on this."

A New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who returned from treating Ebola patients in Africa has tested positive for the virus and is being treated at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. His fiancee, Morgan Dixon, and two other people he came into close contact with have also been quarantined, but they haven't shown any symptoms.
In addition, a 5-year-old boy who returned from Guinea on Saturday was taken to a New York City hospital on Sunday with Ebola-like symptoms. When the boy's temperature spiked this morning, doctors decided to test him for Ebola.

NHTSA says airbags may fail on 4.7 million Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, BMW and GM vehicles.
Takata airbag issue potentially affects 4.7 million more vehicles from the early 2000s, NHTSA says.
NHTSA urges owners of 4.7 million vehicles equipped with Takata airbags to get vehicle serviced immediately.
If you drive a car made in the early 2000s, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants you to see your dealer -- right now.
The federal agency issued a rare alert Monday, warning that owners of vehicles fitted with airbags made by Takata Corp. should have their vehicles inspected as soon as possible. The airbags could fail to deploy properly, the agency said.
TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T and other Japanese automakers on Monday recalled almost 3 million cars with potentially explosive air bags supplied by Takata Corp 7312.T, bringing the total recall so far to about 10.5 million vehicles over the past five years. ( Yoko Kubota and Ben Klayman )
The warning is particularly urgent for owners of vehicles in Florida and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other regions of the Caribbean and South Pacific, because humid weather could aggravate the problem.
The warning affects more than 4.7 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, BMW and General Motors. A full list of the affected cars and model years is below.
At the same time, Toyota Motor Sales issued its own Takata-related warning, saying it would conduct a “supplemental safety recall” of 247,000 of its own Corolla, Matrix, Sequoia, Tundra and Lexus SC vehicles manufactured from 2001 to 2004. These vehicles are all equipped with the same suspect Takata airbags.

Artist and his kingdompeople
Artist and organiser of all things cultural, T. Kaladharan calls the city, in its entirety, his creative space; the place that nourished the creative in him. His alma mater, he calls it. He says he is richer for having been able to work here. “Kochi is my kingdom,” he says.
Kaladharan belongs to a generation of artists who were able to look beyond the narrow confines of their ‘area of specialisation’. He embraced art in it is many forms – as drama, cinema, music, literature and others. He had his art education under MRD Dethan, M.V. Devan, C.N. Karunakaran and Artist Namboodiri. When M.V. Devan founded Kerala Kalapeetom in 1978, Kaladharan found his karmabhoomi under his guru. Over the years he has become synonymous with Kalapeetom, the identities seem to have merged.
When Devan was looking for a space for Kalapeetom, Kaladharan offered the property on Karikkamuri Cross Road that belonged to his father. And Kerala Kalapeetom got an address. Later on it moved to PT Usha Road before returning to its original location in the early 2000s.
In time, Kalapeetom became Orthic Creative Centre and in 2008 Nanappa Art Gallery, as a tribute to his father Narayanankutty Menon known as Nanappa. That Kerala Kalapeetom has all but ceased to be pains him. He says, “my family and friends have advised me not to revive it and I trust them.”
More than as an artist, his creative space is also as an organiser. Kerala Kalapeetom organised the popular ‘Sahitya Sandhya’, ‘Nataka Sandhya’, ‘Sangeetha Sayhanam’ and ‘Nritya Sayhanam’ through the 80s, 90s and sporadically in the last decade.
He says his is a case of the mountain coming to Mohammed. “I wasn’t able to travel much. But so what? I have had the privilege of hosting greats such as Mulk Raj Anand, Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna, Kamala Devi (in both her avatars), M.T. Vasudevan Nair, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and so many others I wouldn’t have been able to meet otherwise.”
The airy, well-lit Nanappa Art Gallery doesn’t see as much activity as it did in the past. The well-loved space is perfect for artistic pursuits and also a good place to listen to stories about a long ago Ernakulam before it became Kochi. Among the paraphernalia of art shows – brochures, remnants of art shows and art works – there are stories. Stories of how Balamuralikrishna offered to sing as a fund-raiser for Kalapeetom, disagreements, artists’ tantrums, heated discussions, and some wonderful memories of a bygone passionate era. The bamboo wind chime’s soothing notes sound the background score for the art gallery. This is Kaladharan’s personal space, his home, his work – “my life.”
“Times have changed. In the past Kalapeetom used to be packed with youngsters – as volunteers and participants. Today, participation of youngsters is nil. Those days parents gave children the space to engage in activities other than academics. Art was a collective effort in those days,” there is a touch of sorrow in Kaladharan’s tone. Physically too “the road blocks due to work on the Kochi Metro should not become a mental block to getting here to Nanappa Art Gallery.”
The city has grown in stature, artistically it has moved to greater things like the art biennale. But, one can’t help wondering if the genesis of it all lay in Kaladharan’s Kerala Kalapeetom which to many, is Orthic Creative Centre and to many others Nanappa Art Gallery.

Millennials are actually really good at saving moneyBy Jonnelle Marte October 23 Follow @jonnelle

Millennials are looking beyond beach vacations and nights out when it comes to finding the best way to use their cash.
More of them are putting money away for retirement, according to a new analysis released Thursday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. About 40,000 workers in their 20s and early 30s signed up for their employer’s 401(k) plan for the first time during the first half of this year, the report found. That is up 55 percent from the same time last year and more than the 37 percent increase seen for all age groups.
“If you look at the millennials, they’re actually by nature better savers,” says Kevin Crain, managing director and senior relationship executive for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank analyzed data from its 401(k) business, which has $128.9 billion in assets and includes 2.5 million participants.
What’s pushing millennials to be more responsible? It’s not all due to strong will power. More companies are taking the work out of the saving process by automatically enrolling workers into savings plans and automatically boosting their saving rates by a certain percentage amount each year, the report found. As of June, 213 plans used both auto enrollment and auto escalation to help people save, up 19 percent from a year earlier.
However, millennials might deserve some credit for not opting out of the plans after being automatically signed up, Crain says. And some of the growth was due to choice: The number of people who voluntarily signed up for automatic rate increases grew by 27 percent over the past year, according to the report.
The higher saving rates might also be spurred by a feeling among millennials that they are on their own for retirement. Workers between the ages of 25 and 37 expect to receive 32 percent of their income in retirement from personal savings and investments, compared to 19 percent for baby boomers, according to a separate survey by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave . In contrast, millennials expect 12 percent of their retirement income to come from an employer-sponsored pension, compared to 19 percent for boomers.

Indeed, more employers are asking workers to carry the burden of saving for retirement. Many companies are freezing pension plans , even when they’re over funded, as a way to reduce future liabilities and lower operating costs. As a result, the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for retirement saving, yet many people are not saving enough . For recent college graduates in particular, goals of setting aside money for retirement are often trounced by more immediate needs like  student loan payments .
Often, the biggest advantage younger workers have when it comes to retirement savings is time — since money that is stashed away and invested can grow tax free for decades. But Crain points out that saving isn’t enough. People who are too conservative with their investments when they’re young may end up short in their later years, he says.

Multiple Grammy nominee Ric Fierabracci on being part of a music workshop in the city
For someone who entered the music field quite late, Ric Fierabracci has done well for himself — he is a multiple Grammy nominee and has performed and recorded for a number of artistes such as British jazz and rock drummer Gary Husband, American jazz fusion and blues guitarist Scott Henderson, former guitarist of The Police Andy Summers (with Sting as a special guest), Stevie Wonder, and others.
In the city to host a five-day workshop in association with Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music (SAM), Ric says his experience at the academy has been fantastic, “I feel that the environment is friendly and inviting for both beginners and advanced students.”
Ric’s tryst with music started when he was 14: “I had a friend who was a bass player and I bought his old bass when he upgraded.” When he turned 16, he accompanied a friend to the University of Miami: Frost School of Music where he was offered a four-year scholarship in their Studio Music and Jazz programme. In 2003, Ric moved to New York and started playing with The Chick Corea Elektric Band. Five years later, he debuted with an album called Hemispheres that was nominated for a Grammy.
Ric has since played with Dave Weckl, Chick Corea, Virgil Donati and others. “When I was playing with Corea, Stevie (Wonder) came down and sat in one night. It was great to hear him blend in with our band. Corea is one of my favourite musicians. Gary Husband is a musical genius and my friend and I always look forward to any musical journey he is involved with.”
This is Ric’s first visit to India and he says that he has listened to Indian percussionist and composer Trilok Gurtu’s work. “His concept of time is a  special thing. I hope to have a chance to play with him in the near future.” Talking about Indian music in America, Ric says that it’s highly regarded “especially in the rhythmic sense and in the use of 1/4 step intervals. I played a handful of concerts around 2000 with L. Subramaniam. He and his wife are wonderful musicians. Those were fun gigs,” he explains. 
Ric cites Michel Petrucciani, Michael Brecker, Allan Holdsworth, Vinnie Colaiuta, Phil Turcio, Brett Garsed, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald as some of his influences and says that he enjoys Chennai and has made some new friends as well.

Four-step fitness testphysical fitness
How much do you score?
Are you fit? No, I’m not asking you how far you can run or how much weight you can lift. I’m asking you if you consider yourself fit. Think about it and come up with a strong yes or no. 
I understand you can run many hundreds of miles or can lift monstrous weight at the gym or are amazing at yoga. But for the next couple of minutes, I need you to set aside your ego, look past your biases and consider the following simple practical tests of mobility. Give yourself one point for each test you pass. 
Can you squat? 
And I’m not talking about the silly quarter squats you do at the gym. I’m talking about being mobile enough to squat low enough to get your hips below your knees, stable enough to keep your heels on the floor, upright enough to make eye contact with someone standing in front of you and strong enough to hold that position for an easy couple of minutes. 
I know you think this is a ridiculous standard. But let me tell you that the squat is the most basic human movement there is: you, and every other baby, squatted before you stood up. Squatting was a natural resting position before chairs ruled over us. Squatting is the most recommended excretory position for colon health and the squat is a movement that helps with strength, mobility, endurance and, in turn, fat loss. So, can you squat? 
Can you lie down and stand up? 
Seriously, can you? No, it’s not too easy. Try it for yourself. Lie down completely on the floor. Now, slowly, sit up and then stand up completely but without using any support from your hands or any momentum by rolling. Being able to stand up like that requires core strength, coordination and a whole lot of mobility. So, can you, slowly and under complete control, lie down and stand up without assistance? 
Can you tie your shoe laces without support? 
One more of those things you probably think are beneath your fitness level. You wear shoes at least once a day. How often do you find yourself searching for a stool or a chair? Do you really need it? How comfortable are you wearing your shoes without any support? 
Can you pick up a pen? 
You can? That’s awesome. Now can you bend forward at your waist and lift that pen from the floor without bending your knees? It’s not about how heavy a pen you can lift but about whether you’re able to fold at the waist and touch the floor without feeling any strain on your lower back. So, are you fit enough to lift that pen? 
The second one was harder than you thought, wasn’t it? While some of these tests may be hard for the elderly or for those with specific health or joint conditions, anyone considered to be in good health and fitness irrespective of sex, age or nationality should be able to score at least 3 on 4. How did you do? Are you fit?

Despite Swachh Bharat  taking Poo to the Loo isnt easyDespite Swachh Bharat, taking ‘Poo to the Loo’ isn’t easy
Zia Haq , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 26, 2014
First Published: 23:57 IST(26/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:02 IST(27/10/2014)
Comments
Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, last year launched a public service advert in India through a character called Poo, with the tagline — ‘It’s time to take Poo to the Loo’. The target was open defecation, a serious problem.
 
Taking Poo to the toilet, it turns out, is a formidable task before the Modi government.
 
About 40% of rural households in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana that have a functioning toilet still have a “revealed preference” for open defecation, a new study has found.
Unicef estimates close to 600 million Indians practise open defecation, piling up more than 143 million pounds of solid human waste and putting the public at risk for “life-threatening infections, diseases and epidemics”.
Just giving people a toilet, as announced by Prime Minister Modi, isn’t going to work unless appropriate strategies are drawn up, researchers associated with the study point out.
Nearly 47% of those surveyed said defecating in the open was “pleasurable, comfortable, or convenient”. Some considered open defecation as a way to a “wholesome, healthy virtuous life”.
 
Experts say strategies have to go beyond mere campaigning and include surveys to track changes in open defecation. “The government cannot credibly claim to be attempting to end open defecation by 2019 or any year if it is not measuring and monitoring it,” Princeton economist Diane Coffey, lead researcher of the study, told HT.
India has increased access to toilets since 1990, when 75% of the population defecated in the open, mainly through government-built toilets.
 
That doesn’t mean people are using them. According to Unicef’s 2014 Drinking Water and Sanitation Update, “India continues to be the country with the highest number of people (597 million) practising open defecation”.

Book tracks Tata Group s journey to success  respectBook explores Tata Group's journey to success, fame
PTI        Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 15:32 IST
Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus at Tata Sons.
The values at the heart of the Tata Group as well as the role played in its development by the philanthropic trusts that own two-thirds of the company are explored in a new book that is a brief history of the Tatas.
How did Tata transform itself from a family-owned venture to the position it is today in an array of unrelated businesses? What is the 'Tata Way', which has earned it much admiration and respect?
These are among several aspects that the book "The Greatest Company in the World?: The Story of Tata" by Peter Casey looks into.
It charts the contribution of every Tata chairman - from Jamsetji Tata, who set up the company in 1868, to Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry in transforming the company into one of the most professionally-managed enterprises in the world.
As founder and Executive Chairman of Claddagh Resources, Casey decided to write the book initially to help his recruiters and executive search consultants have a better understanding of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which over 14 years, had become his company's biggest client.
"It was supposed to just be a short 15-page summary, but the more I started studying TCS and Tata, the more captivated I got and the project developed a life of its own," he says.
According to the writer, while other successful capitalists and captains of industry started companies to create profit and, thereby, wealth, Jamsetji Tata planted the seeds of philanthropic trusts, which now own 66 per cent of the Tata Group.
"In harmony with his religion, Tata's company would exist to finance and initiate projects to improve the lives of the people of India," he says.
"So, Jamsetji Tata became not only a catalyst for sweeping change in his vast homeland, but, in the process, conceptualised an entirely new way of doing business as well as philanthropy. What he began has changed the lives of billions, as the company he founded continues to work for the betterment of society," he says.
In the words of Jamsetji, "We think we started on sound and straightforward business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and the health and welfare of the employees, the sure foundation of our success."
Today, the Tata Group employs nearly half a million people, and earns revenues of $100 billion. It reported a profit of $6.23 billion in 2011-12, and controls assets valued at $77.7 billion.
"The philanthropic trusts control a majority of the Tata holding company, Tata Sons. The Tata family is a very small shareholder. Yet, the owners are only one of four stakeholders Tata sets out to serve. In addition to the owners (which include shareholders) are employees, customers, and society itself," the book, published by Penguin, says.
"The guiding principle for everyone at Tata is sharing the wealth. With Tata reporting annual profits in 2012 of $6.23 billion, this means that a very large amount of money is invested back into the economy every year just from this one source," it says.
The members of the Tata family have established a set of philanthropic trusts to which the majority of the family's personal wealth has been dedicated and bequeathed.
Like their father, Dorabji Tata and Ratan Tata also donated the majority of their personal wealth to trusts they established.
The book also talks about Jamsetji Tata's successor Dorabji Tata's passion for sports and how he advocated India's participation in the Olympics as early as 1919, much before the nation had established its own Olympic committee.

New Potter short story to be released on Halloween
IANS
arts, culture and entertainment
Author J.K. Rowling made Harry Potter fans excited as she recently announced that a new short story set in the magical world of wizards will be released on Halloween.
The upcoming story, around 1700 words, will focus on the spiteful Hogwarts professor Dolores Umbridge, who first appeared in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was published in 2003, reports contactmusic.com.
The witch is well known for forcing Harry to scar himself on the hand while he reportedly wrote the sentence, “I must not tell lies” with a Blood Quill.
“Umbridge is not only one of the most malicious Potter characters, she is the only person other than Lord Voldemort to leave a permanent physical scar on Harry,” said the update posted to Pottermore.com on October 24.
“The new exclusive J.K. Rowling content provides a rich, 1,700-word back story about Umbridge’s life filled with many new details, as well as Rowling’s revealing first-person thoughts and reflections about the character.”
Professor Umbridge was portrayed by British actress Imelda Staunton in the film series, first appearing in 2007.
This will be the latest spin-off of Harry Potter that Rowling will have released since publishing another short story in July, which was a 1,500 word tale depicting the adult lives of the young wizard, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, many years after their storied adventures, reuniting at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, all aged 34.

The Supreme Court on Monday declined to entertain a writ petition filed by Nalini Sriharan, convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, challenging Section 435 CrPC which provides for consultation with the Centre before a State government exercises its powers of remission to release a life convict.
The apex court had stayed the order passed by the Tamil Nadu government directing the release of the death row and life term convicts in the case.
On Monday, a three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice H.L. Dattu and Justices Madan B. Lokur and A.K. Sikri refused to entertain the petition after hearing counsel M. Radhakrishnan.
Ms. Nalini said she has been undergoing imprisonment for life in the Special Prison for Women, Vellore. She has already served more than 23 years and is awaiting release under the scheme for premature release of life convicts available in Tamil Nadu.
As per Section 435 (1) (a) of the CrPC, a State government cannot exercise its powers under Sections 432 and 433 of the CrPC except after consultation with the Central Government if the State government wants to remit or commute a sentence in a case investigated by the CBI.

Kerala-born businessman tops list of powerful Indians inGulfBy: Press Trust of India | Dubai | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:19 pm
Kerala-born businessman and the Managing Director of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali MA, has retained his top position in the annual list of powerful Indians in Gulf countries for the fifth time in a row.
The ‘Indian Power List’, published Sunday by Arabian Business, named Ali as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf countries.
His Lulu Group has a strong presence in the Middle East’s retail sector and is planning expansion in new markets.
A key reason for Ali being considered as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf is also his close proximity to the various ruling family members of GCC countries.
Ali has recently been elected as Director Board Member of Abu Dhabi Chamber for the third consecutive time, becoming the first and only Indian till date to occupy such a position.
He also featured in the Forbes Top Global Billionaire 2014 list.
Lulu Group has operations in 32 countries, with staff strength of 31,000 and has reported revenues of USD 5.2 billion (Rs 33,500 crore) in 2013.

Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre toSCPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:25 pm
The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Swiss government has indicated its willingness to provide information on “stolen data” containing names of Indians who had allegedly stashed black money in banks there.
The government said the “development” is very significant as the Swiss government had earlier refused to provide any information regarding it.
“Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information in respect of cases where investigations have been carried out by the IT Department independently from what Swiss government considers as stolen data. This development is very significant because there are several cases of account holders which were investigated by the Department independently.
“Earlier the Swiss government had not agreed to provide any information in such cases on the ground that these were stolen data and have been obtained in breach of Swiss law,” it said in its affidavit.
The government said the Swiss Federal Tax Administration has agreed that their counterpart authority would assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank accounts.
“The Swiss authorities have also agreed to provide the requested information in a time bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline,” the Centre said.
It told the apex court that Switzerland has also assured it of commencing talks with India for concluding an Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement between the two sides at the earliest after completion of their domestic procedures.

Vietnam seeks India's 'active support' on South China Sea row

Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(As disputed South China…)
NEW DELHI: As disputed South China Sea witnesses increased Chinese influence, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung today pitched for India's "active support" to peacefully resolve all disputes and sought its greater linkages across the region.
Tan, who will hold talks on a range of issues with Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow, also made it clear that Vietnam has and will continue to allow ships from India. The remarks came a month after an Indian naval ship INS Airavat was asked to exit Chinese waters as it was approaching a Vietnamese port.
"The proper settlement of disputes in the East Sea for peace, stability, maritime security and safety and freedom of navigation in the region is in the common interest of countries in the region and beyond.
"In that spirit, Vietnam hopes that India, as a major power in the region and the world, will actively support the parties concerned to peacefully resolve all disputes, refrain from actions that may further complicate the situation, thus contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability, maritime security and safety and freedom of navigation in the East Sea," the Vietnamese Prime Minister told PTI in an interview.
Noting that Vietnam always attaches great importance to the friendship and cooperation with all countries including China, Tan said,"Accordingly, Vietnam supports India to increase multi-dimensional linkages with South East Asia. For the purpose of friendship and exchange, we have and will continue to allow ships from other countries including India to visit Vietnam."
"Vietnam hopes that India, with its increasingly important role, will make positive and responsible contributions to the maintenance of peace and stability and the region and the world," he said.
The remarks may not go down well with China, which has been objecting to Indian presence in the disputed South China Sea in oil exploration projects. Last month, China had asked Indian naval assault vessel, INS Airavat, which was on a routine call at a Vietnam port and was travelling in open international waters in the South China Sea, to leave the waters terming them as "Chinese waters".
Making clear its position on the East Sea issue, Tan said Vietnam and other ASEAN countries have consistently underlined the importance of complying with international law, the 1982 UNCLOS and maintaining peace, stability, maritime security and safety and freedom of navigation in the East Sea.
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea involve both island and maritime claims among seven sovereign states within the region -Brunei, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Burdwan blast: Doval visits blast site  takes stockComments
National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval told the West Bengal chief minister on Monday that the border district of Jalpaiguri had emerged as a new terror hub in the state, sources said, suggesting the terror network extends beyond the southeastern town of Burdwan and neighbouring areas.
Sources said Doval handed a list of 180 Bangladeshi militants hiding in West Bengal to the government after visiting the site of the October 2 blast in Burdwan.
The NSA and other members of a delegation of top security and intelligence chiefs told chief minister Mamata Banerjee about how operatives of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) had used the state as a safe haven over the past two years.
“Besides pointing out that Jalpaiguri has turned into yet another terror point for JMB, the central representatives also handed over a list of unrecognised madrasas in the state operating as terror-breeding hubs,” said a state government source on condition of anonymity. “The central team also informed the chief minister on how during the last couple years the number of terror modules in West Bengal has gone beyond 50.”
The Mamata Banerjee government said it would cooperate with a central investigation into the Burdwan blast, in which two JMB operatives were killed while making bombs in a house. The chief minister initially resisted a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the incident that exposed a terror network of Bangladeshi infiltrators spread over several West Bengal districts.
“The chief minister and the West Bengal government have assured that the Centre and the state will work together in unearthing the entire case,” Prakash Mishra, special secretary for internal security in the Union home ministry, told the media after the meeting with Banerjee.
The NSA and his team also referred to the alleged links of a Rajya Sabha member from West Bengal with two Bangladeshi militant groups – JMB and Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (JIB).
An NIA report says that the JMB, a shadowy organisation formed in 2005, has plans to establish an Islamic state encompassing Bangladesh and Murshidabad, Nadia and Malda districts of West Bengal.
Three people, including two women, were arrested in the Burdwan case and questioned by the NIA that took over the probe after the state government faced a barrage of criticism for allegedly mishandling the investigation.
Opposition parties have accused Banerjee of allowing extremist elements to flourish in the state for vote-bank politics.
“It is clear that Trinamool Congress is allowing jihadi elements in Bengal. Mere assurances will not drive them out,” said state BJP president Rahul Sinha.
Apart from SIM cards, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), detonators and watch dials, some leaflets and papers with names of al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri and Chechen rebels were reportedly recovered from the Burdwan house, which the suspected militants had rented a few months ago.
The central delegation’s visit comes as the Union government prepares to send a report on the issue to Bangladesh following a request from the Sheikh Hasina government.

SAN FRANCISCO —  What would it take to get you to wear a fitness band? How about one that costs $12?
Entrepreneur David Donovick's Pivotal Living startup is taking on market leaders Fitbit and Jawbone with the Life Tracker 1 — a wristband and smartphone app that promise to do the things modern fitness bands can do, at the cost of about $1 a month.
Slapping on any one of these lightweight bracelets can help you get fit by counting your steps, helping you track sleep, weight or even how much water you drink. They all work with companion smartphone apps.
For anyone who has tried one (I wear a Jawbone UP24), it's a no-brainer proposition. They really can motivate you to get up from your desk, move around, get more sleep (or try) and generally get on track to better health goals.
So far though, the market is growing fast but still very small. In a recent report, research firm Canalys said shipments of basic "wearable" bands will grow to 15 million in 2015, up from 7 million in 2014. (Consider: Apple sold 10 million new iPhones in their first weekend.)

Donovick — a nine-year Microsoft veteran before jumping to the startup world  — said he thinks his Pivotal Living company can change the equation by making the cost of entry relatively painless. Life Tracker puts the Pivotal Living app in charge of the physical horse, with a new membership model pricing structure.
You pay a $12 annual fee for the app, and the company comps you the tracker, Donovick said in a visit to USA TODAY's San Francisco offices. Say you lose the band, or crush it somehow: You can renew at any time and Pivotal will send you a new band.
The company is taking pre-orders now , with apps for Android and Apple devices. The company is promising delivery of Life Tracker bands in time for the holidays if you order by Dec. 10.
The skinny on the band: It's a nice-looking (think Fitbit-like) device with an OLED screen that displays calories burned, steps, distance, sleep mode and the like at the touch of a button. Yes, watch-wearers: It will show you the time.  It is water and sweat resistant (don't swim with it). The battery will last five-seven days on a charge, the company says.
Social tools in the app include the ability to create teams — for family members, say, or colleagues at work.
As attractive as the band is, Seattle-based Pivotal has broad aspirations. "What Nest has done for the smart home we want to do for mobile health tech," says Donovick.
Donovick is Pivotal's CEO. He and co-founder Eli Almo started the nine-person company this year and have self-funded it so far. Life Tracker 1 grew out of research begun in 2010 at the University of Washington, Donovick says.

ATLANTA (AP) — An exhibition at Atlanta's High Museum of Art showcases a group of impressionist and post-impressionist works amassed by a private collector who described the pursuit and acquisition of the pieces as an adventure.
The exhibition, "Cezanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection," includes 50 pieces, including works by Paul Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh, Edouard Manet, Amedeo Modigliani, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin and Henri De Toulouse-Lautrec. It opens Saturday at the High.
The centerpiece of the exhibition is 24 works by Cezanne, including 16 rarely exhibited watercolors.
One of the first paintings visitors see in the exhibition, Chaim Soutine's "View of Ceret," in which a cityscape is hardly recognizable, was Henry Pearlman's first major acquisition made in 1945. In Pearlman's "Reminiscences of a Collector," which is printed in the exhibition's catalog, Pearlman writes that he would get a "lift" when he saw that painting whenever he arrived home.
"This first pleasant experience with a modern painting started me on a road of adventure that has been both exhilarating and satisfying. I haven't spent a boring evening since that first purchase," he wrote.
Pearlman, whose Eastern Cold Storage Company made significant contributions to marine shipbuilding during World War II, and his wife Rose went on to build an impressive collection that has been housed at the Princeton University Art Museum since 1976.
The collection includes works that are considered among the best by the respective artists, including van Gogh's "Tarascon Stagecoach," Modigliani's portrait of Jean Cocteau and Cezanne's "Mont Sainte-Victoire." But it also lacks anything by Pablo Picasso and others that would seem natural inclusions for a collection of works from that era.
"There are relationships between things, but it's not a textbook collection," said High director of collections and exhibitions David Brenneman. "It's really Pearlman looking at things and drawing relationships."
Pearlman greatly admired Cezanne, and his collection includes works featuring familiar subjects for the artist — landscapes set in the countryside of Provence in southern France and still lifes of objects from his studio.
Some of the oil paintings seem incomplete with patches of canvas showing through, and it's not clear whether Cezanne had reached a point at which he was satisfied or whether he meant to come back to the paintings later, Brenneman said. Graphite drawings provide the framework for the watercolors, with colors added in varying intensity and the bright white of the paper shining through in places.
Soutine, the second most represented artist in the exhibition, is perhaps less familiar to the casual art consumer. But Brenneman said he hopes the exhibition will help expose more people to the works of the French expressionist who painted with thick strokes that leave markedly raised ridges of paint on the canvas.
To that end, the High borrowed five Soutine portraits from a private collection to supplement the seven other Soutine works included in the exhibition. Just as Soutine's landscapes verge on abstraction, his portraits nearly cross the line into caricature, Brenneman said.
Other highlights of the exhibition include "The Sacred Grove" by Toulouse-Lautrec, a parody of a classical scene by academic painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes that includes objects and people from Toulouse-Lautrec's time, and carvings by Gauguin and Modigliani.
The exhibition runs through Jan. 11 at the High. Then it will be at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, Canada, (Feb. 7-May 18) and will finish its tour at the Princeton University Art Museum (Sept. 12-Jan. 3, 2016). It previously was shown at museums in England and France.

Angel Broking`s research report on UPL
“United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL) posted a good set of numbers for 2QFY2015. For the quarter, the company posted sales of Rs2,618cr V/s Rs2,269cr in 2QFY2014, registering a yoy growth of 15.4%. The OPM for the quarter stood at 16.7% V/s 16.0% in 2QFY2014, mainly driven by a higher GPM of 50.5% (V/s 48.7% in 2QFY2014). The expansion in the OPM was lower than the expansion in the GPM owing to the 24.4% rise in other expenditure. This along with a lower other income, which dipped by 32.2% yoy, led the Adj. net profit to come in at Rs178cr V/s Rs171cr in 2QFY2014, ie a yoy growth of 4.5%. We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs424.”

National Republic's two branches will reopen as branches of State Bank of Texas, which is assuming all $915 million of National Republic's deposits.
State Bank of Texas also agreed to buy $626 million of the failed bank's $954 million assets, which typically consist of loans.
The last bank to fail in Illinois was GreenChoice Bank in Chicago on July 25.
As of June 30 there were 76 banks owned by Asian or Pacific Islander Americans, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. records. National Republic Bank of Chicago ranked in the top 10.

Data migration from China has nothing to do with IAF alert: Xiaomi India headPrint
The data migration process had started in early 2014; part of this migration will be completed by the end of the year.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 25, 2014 10:29 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 10:02 am
Xiaomi has again made headlines but this time for something serious. Days after it was reported that the Indian Air Force (IAF) had issued an advisory asking its personnel and their families not to use Xiaomi smartphones on account of ‘spying’, Xiaomi’s global vice president Hugo Barra’s blog post on Google Plus on Wednesday titled “ We’re moving your data ” has sparked a new row.
Manu Jain
It seemed like Xiaomi’s decision to migrate data from Beijing to US and Singapore was in response to the recent IAF notification. However, Xiaomi has denied this completely.
“The process for data/server migration started in early 2014, part of this migration will be completed by the end of the year. We believe that this migration will help improve the performance of our services. It will also provide some peace of mind for users in India in ensuring that we treat their data with the utmost care and will always maintain the highest privacy standards,” Manu Jain, head of Xiaomi’s India operation, told IndianExpress.com.
(Here is all you need to know: Indian Air Force alerts its personnel not to use Xiaomi phones )
IndianExpress.com had reported earlier that the advisory issued by IAF might be based on an old F-Secure privacy report. The same has been confirmed by Xiaomi now.
“We are not sure, but this might be some kind of misunderstanding. We do not have full information about the circular issued by IAF, however we believe that this advisory circular is based on events about 3 months back. We believe, it refers to the F-Secure test done on the Redmi 1S in July 2014 about the activation of our Cloud Messaging service by default,” said Jain.
F-Secure had confirmed, in a week, that Xiaomi had fixed the issues in its RedMi 1S smartphones through an update. “We immediately addressed the concerns raised by F-Secure. We scheduled an OTA system update on August 10, 2014 to implement a change, which ensured that all the users had to manually activate the Cloud services, instead of being activated by default. This change was directly acknowledged by F-Secure 4 days later, where they confirmed that their concerns were addressed,” added Jain.
The same was confirmed by Su Gim Goh, Security Advisor, APAC, F-Secure during his visit to New Delhi on September 1.
If the IAF advisory is totally based on the old F-Secure report, then it makes little sense now as the issue has been confirmed to be solved by the same software secure company who was the first to report the privacy breach incidence. The IAF advisory claims to be based on ‘inputs’ from Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). However, nothing specific has been mentioned.
The OTA update has now made Xiaomi’s cloud services as an opt-in feature, rather than a default one. Mi Cloud is turned off by default. Users must log in with their Mi accounts and manually turn on Mi Cloud. Users can also turn it off at any point of time.
Responding to the privacy concerns, Jain said, “Xiaomi never uploads photos, text messages, or any other data without the user’s consent. The storage of data in Mi Cloud fully respects the local laws of each country and region. When the data is sent to the cloud, we take rigorous precautions to ensure that all data is secured when uploaded to Xiaomi servers and is not stored beyond the time required. Strict encryption algorithms are implemented to protect user privacy. This is no different from other cloud backup services. If users want, they can use cloud services from Google, Dropbox and many others.”
Xiaomi is yet to reach out to IAF to get more clarity as to why the advisory was issued against using their smartphones. “We would be happy to talk to IAF to explain the entire situation to them. I am confident that we would be able to resolve any concerns / questions that they might be having,” said Jain.

Ranbaxy Falls on Buzz of Losing Nexium Exclusivity Period
NDTV | Updated On: October 27, 2014 11:51 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Shares in Ranbaxy Laboratories fell over one per cent to a day low of Rs 589 on Monday as reports suggest that the company may lose six-month of exclusivity period for the generic version of Nexium, if it fails to get regulatory clearances for the US market by end of November.
Nexium is a blockbuster drug from AstraZeneca which is used to treat heart burn. Ranbaxy is awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to market the generic version of the drug in USA. As per experts the ban on selling drugs manufactured at the Punjab and Himanchal plants of Ranbaxy has resulted in the delay in getting approval from the USFDA.
As per analysts Nexium sales in the exclusivity period can be to the tune of $170-$180 million. Ranbaxy was expected to launch Nexium's generic version in May 2014. If Ranbaxy fails to launch the drug by November, then it may forgo an opportunity revenue of $170-$180 million.
The company will report its earnings for the July-September quarter on Tuesday.
As of 11.35 a.m. Ranbaxy shares traded 0.13 per cent lower at Rs 597 apiece against 0.3 per cent gain in the CNX Pharma index.

As per media reports, the unprecedented demand for timepieces manufactured by the country's first watch-maker has led the government to rethink its decision to close the loss-making public sector company.
According to reports, after the government announced closure of the sick state-run company, demand for HMT watches has shot up sharply.
"The company has been incurring cash losses since last 15 years as can be seen in our Annual Reports submitted to you and other stakeholders from time to time. The Company is on budgetary support for payment of salaries and statutory dues since over past 10 years," the company had said last month in a filing to the BSE.
The present manpower of the company is 1,045 with an annual wage bill of around Rs 45 crore, it had said.

Corruption has taken deep root in Mizoram  govt unable to stamp out on it s own: CM Lal ThanhawlaPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:56 pm
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Monday said “corruption has taken deep root” in Mizoram and hit out at the “idleness” among the state’s government employees while saying corruption is not only mean swindling public money, but includes “laziness, idleness, lack of passion for one’s work and expecting a higher income than what one’s work is worth.”
Speaking at the opening of RTI week in Aizawl, Lal Thanhawla said, “The government cannot fully stamp out corruption on it’s own, so we need the support of the public as well as the media, and one way is for people to use RTI to help the government.”
“In Mizoram, the best things are owned by the influential and the rich and common man does not get benefits,” the five-time CM said.
Elaborating on his dismissal of state government employees’ work culture, Lal Thanhawla said, “We pay little heed to filing property returns and while elsewhere people pay close attention we do not even border to intimate the government and we buy movable property like TV sets and cars as if it was paan.”
Lal Thanhawla’s two consecutive terms in office have been partly based on his party’s promise of a corruption-free government in an apparent bid to score over the Mizo National Front’s perceived corruption during the rebel-group turned political party’s ten-year rule, which ended in 2008.

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Private equity investment in the July—September quarter reached $3.1 billion, registering a growth of 47 per cent over the corresponding period last year driven by the Flipkart deal, says a report.
According to the advisory firm Grant Thornton, private equity investments witnessed a significant improvement both in terms of value (47 per cent) as well as volume (37 per cent) in the July—September quarter this year.
In the quarter, PE investments amounted to $3.12 billion through 157 deals, while in the corresponding period last year there were 115 such transactions worth $2.12 billion.
“Private equity witnessed a 47 per cent increase in values led by the billion dollar investment in Flipkart and 37 per cent increase in volumes driven by the IT&ITeS sector with over 40 per cent share in total deal volume,” the report said.
There were several big ticket deals in the quarter. As many as 15 investments were over $50 million each, including two over $100 million and one billion dollar investment, the report said. In the third quarter of 2013 there were only nine investments worth over $50 million each.
Sectorwise, IT/ITES, mainly driven by e—commerce, dominated PE deal values and volumes and going forward the sectors that are expected to see renewed deal activity include infrastructure, energy, consumer and financial services.
“We expect valuations to go up given the renewed business sentiments which in our view would be both a challenge and an opportunity for dealmakers to close deals in the coming quarters,” Grant Thornton India Partner Raja Lahiri said.
“We believe that this momentum of deal activity will continue to increase and we look forward to closing the year on a high note,” Lahiri added.
PE investment so far in 2014 stood higher at $8.4 billion as against $7.8 billion in 2013, with 38 per cent higher volumes in 2014 as compared to 2013, led by the technology sector.

AP to fund women self help groups  village bodies for sand miningAP to fund women self help groups, village bodies for sand mining
V. Rishi Kumar
Tweet
Hyderabad, Oct. 27:  
The Andhra Pradesh Government has decided to provide a Rs 5 lakh loan to village organisations from banks for sand mining and sale which has been entrusted to women self help groups.
The women self help groups of DWCRA (Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas) started sand mining and sale as part of Pedarikam Pai Gelupu (victory over poverty) campaign.
The State Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has decided that a loan of Rs 5 lakh would be provided to each Village Organisation through bank linkages for sand mining and sale.
At a meeting with AP Mineral Development Corporation and other departments, the Chief Minister said that DWCRA women should be motivated to work as if they are running their own organisation. This will enable them to make the sand sale a robust business and reap profits.
The Chief Minister added that eight women could be chosen from local self help group or Village organisation. They could work in two shifts, four in each shift, to monitor operations.
The Chief Minister was informed that consumers could order for sand online by registering with their Aadhar number through Mee Seva or through website. The consumer can pay the amount online through a bank transaction.
He added that the consumer could be informed about the status or movement of vehicle carrying sand by continuously monitoring it through GPS tracker from the control room at the stock point centre.
Naidu suggested that closed circuit television (CCTV) and global positioning system (GPS) trackers and other installations could be outsourced to support the sand mining and sale. This would help the outsourcing agency monitor operations without any discrepancies.
Of the 81 identified sand reaches in the State, sale of sand has begun in 70 of them. Eleven reaches (four of them in Odisha, one in Karnataka, four in Puducherry and two in Telangana) are inter-State sharing sites.
In a pilot project carried out in East Godavari district, 1.9 lakh cubic metres of sand has been excavated. Of this, 40,000 cubic metres has been sold and has fetched Rs 2.95 crore.
The Chief Minister said 75 per cent of this amount would be transferred to Farmers’ Empowerment Corporation.

Rupee Ends Flat at 61.30; Focus on US Fed Meet

IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The rupee closed little changed on Monday as improved sentiment from upbeat US data and smaller-than-feared capital shortfalls at European banks were offset by weaker local shares and caution about recent gains in the domestic currency.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.30/31 per dollar, little changed from its Wednesday's close of 61.31/32. Markets were closed on Thursday and Friday for holidays.
All eyes are now the Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday. The US central bank is expected to end its government bond purchases, while giving accompanying assurances that it will respond if a global downturn threatens the US economy.
Analysts add any indication of earlier-than-expected U.S. rate hikes could hit emerging market currencies. The rupee is up around 0.77 percent so far this year, thanks to $35 billion in foreign investments into debt and stocks.
"If the Fed gives out clear signals that a rate hike may not be very far away, then we can expect some pressure on the rupee," said Chintan Karnani, chief analyst at Insignia Consultants, a currency risk advisory firm in New Delhi.
Sentiment improved as Asian currencies were lifted after upbeat U.S. home sales data and after the European Central Bank said fewer than one in five of the euro zone's top lenders failed stress tests at the end of last year.
But gains in the rupee were kept in check as domestic shares faltered, ending a five-session gain.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.59, while the three-month contract was at 62.18.

Gasoline prices continue to plummet across the United States, with the average price hovering around $3.04 nationwide, down $.18 in the past 2 weeks. Gas prices are now at their lowest level in four years, sparked chiefly by the rapid decline in crude oil prices, which continue to sink to new lows.
“It is safe to say that further gasoline price declines will depend on the direction of underlying crude prices,” says Antoine Halff, head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division at the International Energy Agency. “Recent crude price declines have been both supply- and demand-driven, with the rise in the U.S. dollar playing a supporting role.”

Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misquoted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's statement in defense of his regulations for medical workers returning from Ebola-stricken West Africa.
In the face of mounting criticism, the New Jersey Department of Health said Monday it is discharging a nurse who had been forcibly confined to a hospital isolation tent upon arrival from West Africa despite apparently showing no signs of Ebola.
Kaci Hickox, 33, who works for Doctors Without Borders, was the first person pulled aside at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday under new state regulations after her return from Sierra Leone, where she was working with Ebola patients.
Hickox, who is from Maine, had been ordered confined to the isolation tent for 21 days.
New Jersey and New York introduced the stricter regulations last week, followed quickly by Illinois. The regulations apply to aid workers operating in West African, regardless of whether they showed symptoms of the deadly virus.
Gov. Chris Christie announced the nurse's imminent release Monday in a Tweet , quoting from the Health Department statement .
The department said Hickox had been monitored since going into isolation and was found to be symptom free for the past 24 hours.
As a result, and after being evaluated in coordination with the CDC and her clinicians at University Hospital, "the patient is being discharged."
At her request, the statement said, she would be sent to Maine by a private carrier, not mass transit or commercial aircraft.
"She will remain subject to New Jersey's mandatory quarantine order while in New Jersey," the department said. "Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives."
The ordeal deteriorated into a dispute over why and how she displayed a momentary spike temperature, which the department now calls Ebola "symptoms" but Hickox said was a faulty reading.
On arrival at Newark, Hickox said, an initial forehead scanner recorded a normal 98.6 degree reading, but that she was then left unattended for several hours.
"Four hours after I landed at the airport, an official approached me with a forehead scanner," she told The Dallas Morning News . "My cheeks were flushed, I was upset at being held with no explanation. The scanner recorded my temperature as 101."
She was then rushed to a hospital where an oral thermometer recorded a normal 98.6 degree reading while the forehead scanner -- at the same time -- continued to show 101 degrees.
"There's no way you have a fever," she said the doctor told her. "Your face is just flushed."
In a telephone interview with CNN, Hickox, a native Texan who now lives in Maine, said her confinement at University Hospital in Newark was "inhumane" and akin to being in prison. She said she has no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola.
"This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated," Hickox who said on CNN's State of the Union.
The decision to release her Monday followed a sharp backlash from the White House and health officials, as well as threats of legal action from the nurse.
The Infectious Diseases Society of American said Monday that it opposes mandatory involuntary quarantine except in high-risk cases because of possible negative, unintended consequences. Among them were the possible limiting of the medical response to the crisis in West Africa and a decrease in the willingness by U.S. workers to participate.
in its statement, the Health Department sought to counter Hickox's depiction of her "inhumane" living conditions, saying that while in isolation "every effort was made to insure that she remained comfortable with access to a computer, cell phone, reading material and nourishment of choice."
On Sunday, Christie had defended the stricter regulations for medical workers returning from Ebola-stricken West Africa, saying on Fox News Sunday, "I don't believe when you're dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system.
"This is the government's job," he said, adding, "I think this is a policy that will become a national policy sooner or later."
Top Ebola questions answered
Hickox had blasted the policy and hired a lawyer to challenge her forced confinement.
New York was the first of the front-line states to ease the quarantine rule, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, saying that health care workers can instead be quarantined at home, receive twice-daily monitoring from medical professionals, and the state will also pay for any lost compensation. On Friday, Cuomo had said the workers would be held in a government-regulated facility.
The states introduced the the tough new quarantine rules last week after a New York City physician, Craig Spencer, was hospitalized and tested positive for Ebola last Thursday.
Before Spencer, who recently treated Ebola patients in Guinea, had developed symptoms he rode the New York City subway, went bowling and ate at a restaurant.
Nurse: 'Worst day of my life' when Ebola patient died
Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn on Monday defended his decision to establish a mandatory quarantine for some health care workers returning to Illinois from Ebola-stricken areas of West Africa.
Quinn told reporters that Illinois' policy, which he announced by executive order on Friday, was "common sense." Illinois health officials noted that the new rules are not as strict as the one rolled out in New Jersey.
"Having this mandatory period I think is the best way to go," Quinn said. "It's common sense. We should not have optional or voluntary situations if someone has been directly exposed to the virus."
The Illinois policy, like the revised plan by New York,  allows workers to be quarantined in their homes.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican locked in a tough battle for re-election next month, on Saturday ordered twice daily monitoring for 21 days for anyone returning from places affected by Ebola.
Virginia on Monday announced additional Ebola screening and monitoring for travelers from West Africa. Dulles International Airport, located in Virginia, is one of the designated airports for travelers arriving from the areas hardest hit by Ebola.
The White House, which has expressed concern over the new restrictive measures, is working on new guidelines for such health care workers, according to a senior administration official.
The new guidelines are expected to be unveiled in the coming days, the official said.The official added that the administration is consulting with the states as they develop the new rules.
President Obama met Sunday with his Ebola response team, including "Ebola czar" Ron Klain and other public health and national security officials. According to the White House, the president said any measures concerning returning health care workers "should be crafted so as not to unnecessarily discourage those workers from serving."
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power said quarantines may discourage health workers from traveling to West Africa to help block the disease at its source.
"If you put everyone in one basket, even people who are clearly no threat, then we have the problem of the disincentive of people that we need," Fauci said on ABC's This Week. "Let's not forget the best way to stop this epidemic and protect America is to stop it in Africa, and you can really help stopping it in Africa if we have our people, our heroes, the health care workers, go there and help us to protect America."
Norman Siegel, Hickox's attorney, told CNN earlier that he would go to court seeking a hearing, saying her quarantine was based on fear. "People are panicking, and people are scared," he said.
Siegel, an attorney who specializes in civil and human rights cases involving the government, told J. David Goodman of The New York Times that he asked Hickox if she "wanted this to be a test case and she said yes."
Hickox also wrote a first-person account for the Dallas Morning News, which was posted on the paper's website Saturday.
"This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me," Hickox wrote of her quarantine. "I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa. I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine. … The U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity."
U.S. ambassador Power, who is traveling in West Africa, told NBC News that quarantine plans in the three states are "haphazard and not well thought out," and could discourage health workers from going to West Africa in the first place.
"We cannot take measures here that are going to impact our ability to flood the zone," Power said. "We have to find the right balance between addressing the legitimate fears that people have and encouraging and incentivizing these heroes."

00:45  that man to territory quarantine.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a sharp opponent of restrictive rules, said Hickox had been treated with disrespect."We owe her better than that,'' he said.
De Blasio visited the treatment ward at Bellevue Hospital and spoke with Spencer, the New York City physician who had been treating Ebola patient in Guinea. At a news conference later he said health workers should be regarded as heroes and likened them to U.S. Marines on the front-lines of danger.
"They are the first responders and they are doing an absolutely extraordinary job,'' he said.
Hospital officials said on Saturday that Spencer was experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms and "entering the next phase of his illness."
In a related development, a Pentagon spokesman said about dozen U.S. military personnel returning from Liberia were isolated at their home base in Vicenza, Italy, this weekend. None have shown any symptoms of exposure to Ebola.
Army Col. Steven Warren said Monday that the personnel, who were part of Operation United Assistance in West Africa, were being kept at a separate unit at the base for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. Maj.Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of U.S.Army Troops, is among those being isolated.
The operation in West Africa is providing logistics, training and engineering support to the U.S. humanitarian program fighting the Ebola outbreak in the area.
Monday evening, a 5-year-old boy who recently traveled from Guinea to New York  tested negative for Ebola after he was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Sunday with symptoms consistent with the disease.

Modi effect: Japan s SoftBank to invest $10 billion in IndiaJapan's SoftBank to invest $10 billion in India
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 20:40 IST
Telecom giant SoftBank has pledged an investment of $10 billion (over Rs 60,000 crore) in India's IT and communications space, one of the biggest investment commitments from a Japanese firm after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to that country.
Softbank-one of the major telecom and internet corporations of Japan-will look for opportunities in telecom and the fast-growing e-commerce sectors in India.
The proposed investment was committed by Softbank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son in a meeting with Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, an official statement said on Monday.
"Mr Son today assured the Minister that SoftBank would like to invest approximately $10 billion in India in the coming years. He placed it on record that India is the top most priority for SoftBank," the Telecom Ministry statement said.
Son told Prasad the visit of Prime Minister to Japan has created a climate of hope and optimism about greater economic cooperation between the two countries, it added.
With a market cap of $92 billion, SoftBank has operations in broadband, fixed line telecom, e-Commerce, finance, media and marketing. SoftBank already has made investments in Indian companies including InMobi and Hike.
"He (Son) further expressed immense faith in the great eCommerce potential of India. He estimated it to become a $0.5 trillion business in the next 10 years," the statement said.
Sources said that SoftBank has plans to invest in ecommerce firm Snapdeal. However, Softbank and Snapdeal did not immediately respond to queries on the matter.
SoftBank Chairman also asked Prasad to develop a robust mobile phone infrastructure and resolve spectrum issues.

Fast-moving markets can be a nitro boost for certain stocks — making them look like a streaking blur. Investors are watching which of these stocks are racing ahead of the market — but pros still think they have room to run.
There are six stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including medical firm Mylan (MYL) , industrial giant Textron (TXT) and energy firm Tesoro (TSO) , that are in a fast track of their own. All these stocks are up 10% or more over the past 30 days, up this year and still have 10% or more upside before hitting analysts’ 18-month price targets, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. All the stocks have average “outperform” ratings from the analysts.
During fast-changing markets, like the one investors have endured this month so far, some stocks can show the kind of speed they’re capable of. But recent volatility is a reminder investors can’t just chase after winners and blindly hope the stocks keep up the pace. That’s why it’s wise to consider which stocks not only have momentum — but still have open road to keep it going.
When it comes to blisteringly fast stocks that analysts still see plenty of upside for it’s hard to beat Mylan.  The maker of both generic and branded drugs has raced ahead 10.3% over the past 30 days to $51.22. That’s an impressive run if you consider the S&P 500 during the same time is down 1.7%. And even though shares of Mylan are up 18% this year, analysts see even more blazing trails ahead. Analysts say this stock could rise rise 14% before hitting the average price target of $58.46. That’s well above the 9.9% average gain analysts are forecasting for all the S&P 500 stocks, on average.
Textron, the industrial giant which makes everything from helicopters to golf carts, has been lighting it up lately. Shares have added 7.2% over the past 30 days to $38.76. The recent surge is putting the stock back on track. Textron shares are up 5.4% year-to-date, while positive, lags the S&P 500’s 2014 gain so far of 6.3%. Perhaps that’s one reason why analysts feel so confident to see the stock rising another 13% before hitting the 18-month price target of $43.64.
Certainly, the analysts could simply be getting swept up in the excitement of stocks on the move and assuming the run can continue. But there’s no question these stocks have plenty of speed going into the end of the year. And investors hope this speed might even push the stocks beyond what the analysts are calling for.

Chris Paul: Becoming a Mentor Like the Ones Who Helped Me Succeedreddit
Working with the My Brother's Keeper program gives me an opportunity to look back through my life and realize how blessed I am to have had mentors and coaches who have helped me become the man I am today. My wife, Jada, and I are also using the advice, shared experiences and love that our parents and extended family have shown us to be the best parents we can.
My parents taught my brother and me about the importance of family.  We watched them make sacrifices for us to ensure that we had a good education and understood the importance of keeping God first in our lives. I also learned the importance of discipline that has shaped me now that I am a parent.
My grandfather taught me about the importance of hard work and setting a goal and reaching it. He was the first African American owner of a gas station in North Carolina. My brother and I spent summers changing oil, rotating tires and learning to be respectful to his customers.
When I went to Wake Forest Coach Skip Prosser taught me about the importance of discipline on the basketball court. He shared with our entire roster the importance of playing like a team, trusting each other and understanding the importance of being a student of the game, so we could achieve greatness on an off the court.
My bother CJ has been at my side all my life. When I was drafted he was there and he continues to be a sounding board for me to talk to, bounce ideas off of and encourage me. He is always honest with me regardless if I agree with him or not. He is one of my most trusted advisors.
I have had teammates who mentored me like Chauncey Billups and Willie Green. They both taught me how to be a better leader, on and off the court.
And I have Doc Rivers as a coach and mentor. He navigates the waters for our entire team and is a constant source of advice, both from the perspective of being a player and a coach. He is always available and because he knows the pressures of being a player, he knows how to motivate each of us. Doc will tell you the truth, plain and simple. He doesn't mince words and because of what he has achieved in his career, you know you are getting the best advice from someone who can back up what he says. His guidance is priceless.
When I have an opportunity to mentor someone, I find the most important thing is to listen to them when they tell you about themselves. That will always give you an idea of what type of support they need.  For example, at my basketball camps I always look for the young man who is a bit shy. He might stand back and you don't see him being confident in some of the drills we may be doing. I will make sure that I have time to talk to him during our drills and will seek him out during breaks and when we are having meals together. I listen to him and share stories about myself that I think he can relate to in his own life.
There are times when I will also look to mentor a young man who is a bit too confident, which can sometimes make his teammates and friends feel insecure or unimportant. That is an opportunity for me to share the importance of being humble and using ones talents to help others, whether it is on the court, in the classroom or other areas of his life.
I am proud to be a member of the NBA and as president of the National Basketball Players Association I get to see the kind of impact players in the NBA can have on their communities and on young people. That is why are working together to support President Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative and helping to recruit 25,000 new mentors over the next five years.
We want mentors who are passionate and understand the opportunity they are being given to change and motivate young men. I continue to monitor myself as I know that young men are looking at what I am doing. I want to be my very best to make certain that my activities off the court and through my foundation, ensure that young men see the entire package.

Brooklyn Bowling Alley  The Gutter  To Reopen After Ebola CleanupPost by The Gutter .
Although bowling alleys where people rent shoes and share balls are notorious incubators of germs, it's extremely unlikely that you can get Ebola from a bowling ball. "There is no evidence that it has been passed, as colds or flu sometimes are, by touching surfaces that someone else touched after sneezing into their hand," says a separate article in The New York Times .
Still, closing its business down for cleaning was probably a smart move for the bowling alley. "They’re losing some money obviously by being closed, but what they gain in peace of mind and goodwill I think is worth a lot to them," said Lynda Maddox, a marketing and advertising professor at George Washington University. Maddox noted that this is the first time Americans are dealing with ebola on their soil and there's currently a lot of skepticism with regards to how the CDC is handling the virus. A little extra care is going to be well-perceived.
Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old doctor who contracted New York's first case of Ebola , told authorities that he had gone bowling at The Gutter on Wednesday night before taking an Uber back to his apartment in Manhattan .
Uber said on Thursday that the car and driver involved were not a risk for ebola.
The following morning, Spencer felt feverish and was diagnosed at Bellevue Hospital.
The Gutter said it had been told by doctors advising the New York Health Department that there was no risk to its staff or to any customers . The New York Health Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.
While there have been some reports saying Spencer also "caught some music" at The Brooklyn Bowl, a larger bowling and concert venue nearby, Brooklyn Bowl said on its Twitter page that Spencer did not go there.
The musician Questlove, who plays a regular show at Brooklyn Bowl on Thursday nights, said Thursday that the venue was safe to hang out at :
Ladies & Gents @brooklynbowl is safe (*said* bowling alley in WB is called "The Gutter") out bowling alley is open and clean #BowlTrain

The death toll in U.S. airstrikes in Syria  broken downBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe

The United States launched its first airstrikes on militants in Syria on Sept. 23, and has continued the onslaught since.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday that 533 people have been killed in airstrikes since they began. That group counted 32 civilian deaths, including six children and five women. The Observatory has been tracking conflict in Syria for years, and has a large network of activists on the ground.
Visually, the deaths look like this:
The human rights organization said that the number of militants could be much higher. Most of the deaths occurred around Kobane, the border town in northern Syria where militants have been locked in a fierce fight with Kurdish forces trying to protect it from falling. More than 130 U.S. airstrikes have been launched on targets around Kobane.

Facebook announced a new stand-alone mobile app that enables people to communicate anonymously—a change in the company's long-standing policy.
Called "Rooms," the app is a sort of updated version of chat rooms or web forums, as it enables people to communicate around different topics.
The idea, says the blog announcing the new product , is that people can create "places for the things you're into, and invite others who are into them too." Users can customize the look and feel of forums, and share photos and videos about any topic—the app suggests 'City Gargens' and 'Pug Lovers.

This is a departure for Facebook, which has had a long-standing policy against using fake names. In contrast, Rooms allows people to contribute anonymously, under multiple pseudonyms. Other anonymous and private apps, like Secret and Whisper, have seen rising popularity, as have sites like Reddit.

Why Humble  Empathic Business Leaders Are More Successfulreddit
It's increasingly evident that business leaders who are capable of experiencing and demonstrating empathy, compassion, and humility have greater success. Research as well as direct business experience confirms this. One recent example is a study of 1500 leaders and their employees . It found that humble leaders who have increased self-awareness and insight experience greater commitment and performance from their employees.
According to the research findings , "Leaders with a strong self-insight demonstrate a good understanding of their own needs, emotions, abilities and behavior. On top of that, they are proactive in the face of challenges." The study found that when employees experience this type of leadership, it has a positive effect, and that's especially true when the leader is humble.
More broadly, research in recent years indicates that the capacity for compassion and empathy are innate, and it can be strengthened through conscious effort and focus. These capacities reflect letting go of ego-driven attitudes and behavior; and they enhance positive, effective relationships. We are now seeing evidence that they are linked with greater business success, especially in the form of increased competitive advantage. For example, billionaire founder/CEO of Virgin Group, Richard Branson has pointed out that "In business... companies that want to survive...are smart enough to know that caring and cooperation are key."
Today's organizations require what the New York Times columnist Adam Bryant has described as a "quick and nimble" management culture. This, in turn, requires leaders to let go of focusing so much on themselves; to let go of the "alpha male" role, as Georg Vielmetter of the Hay Group has called it. Then, they are more able to engage with diverse employees, and from a more humble perspective. Vielmetter pointed out that
The time of the alpha male -- of the dominant, typically male leader who knows everything, who gives direction to everybody and sets the pace, whom everybody follows because this person is so smart and intelligent and clever -this time is over. We need a new kind of leader who focuses much more on relationships and understands that leadership is not about himself...who knows he needs to listen to other people...to be intellectually curious and emotionally open...(and) needs empathy to do the job.
These capacities are also evident in a study from Catalyst , described in Jeanine Prime and Elizabeth Salib's Harvard Business Review Blog. It found that when employees observed diminished ego in their managers -- such as humbleness and empowering workers -- they reported being more innovative and engaged; more likely to suggest new product ideas and ways of doing work better.
In a global marketplace where problems are increasingly complex, no one person will ever have all the answers. As Google's SVP of People Operations, Lazlo Bock, says , "Your end goal is what can we do together to problem-solve. Without humility, you are unable to learn." In fact, Bock says that humility is one of the traits he's looking for in new hires. "Your end goal is what can we do together to problem-solve. I've contributed my piece, and then I step back." And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute, says Bock--it's "...intellectual humility. Without humility, you are unable to learn."
That's consistent with the Catalyst study , which shows that altruism makes employees more innovative and engaged - especially when working with employees from diverse backgrounds, which is increasingly common. In fact, it found that humility is one of four critical leadership factors for creating an environment where employees from different demographic backgrounds feel included. Employees who perceived altruistic behavior from their managers also reported being more innovative, suggesting new product ideas and ways of doing work better. Moreover, they were more likely to report engaging in team citizenship behavior, going beyond the call of duty, picking up the slack for an absent colleague -- all indirect effects of feeling more included in their workgroups.
In a similar vein, Richard Branson stresses the importance of seeking and supporting a wide, diverse range of people ; and, being open to input and potential solutions through active listening: "Over more than 40 years of building our businesses at the Virgin Group, (we have seen) that employing people from different backgrounds and who have various skills, viewpoints and personalities will help you to spot opportunities, anticipate problems and come up with original solutions before your competitors do."

Scaling Up: What It Takes To Create Responsible Practices On A Global Scalereddit
The complexity -- and potential for good -- of global reach.
Companies that are the largest in their industry, such as Unilever or Nike, face a unique challenge each time they make a move in sustainability. Should they use their scale to change their industry globally for the greater good, or should they prioritize quick wins, creating aspirational, sustainability-based fame for their products?
Think of Starbucks and disposable coffee cups. For years they tried to chip away at the issue of waste on their own, but they ground to a halt at the point where they were leading the industry and couldn't move the needle any further than 10 percent post-consumer recycled content. But in 2008, they took the issue to the industry. Multiple "Cup Summits" took the cup from something they led alone on to something that transformed the pulp and paper, packaging, and catering industries and even re-imagined the way waste streams functioned globally. It took years to change the fundamental ways food packaging is produced and taken back into the waste stream, and today, Starbucks is even going beyond recycled content, targeting 100 percent reusable or recyclable cups by 2015 and working in partnership with competitors like Tim Horton's. What started as a Starbucks project ended up bigger than the industry.
Why am I telling you about recycled coffee cups? The reason is goose down, the material that fills many of our comforters, jackets, sleeping bags and pillows. In the past few years we've seen rising concern over where down comes from. When we dug into this, we saw many disturbing vulnerabilities -- practices like force-feeding ("gavage" for foie gras) and a potential for live plucking in the related food industry. We also saw that in many cases, down used in products could not be traced back to its origin.
Other companies began to pay attention to these types of issues, too. IKEA began making down alternatives. Gap and Zara said goodbye to angora -- which was going through a similar moment of transparency. However, due in part to limited regulations on animal welfare and food-down supply chain complexities, the industry struggled to find a way to source responsible materials at scale. Some companies have tried to develop ways to mitigate risks and mistreatment of animals; however, these approaches have typically only been applicable to a single company's own supply chain or specific supply chain type. Good for one brand -- not great for all.
So we faced a choice: Do we ensure The North Face brand's down is from responsible sources, or do we take on the challenge as a leader and bring our industry -- and other industries -- along with us? Going it alone would have been the easier choice.
While many people know The North Face for its jackets and gear, not as many know the story behind the name. The north face of a mountain (in the northern hemisphere) is the most formidable route to climb. Taking the toughest route means forging a path that might be more challenging -- you might have to lead a new route -- but this is the legacy and the company culture that helped support us in establishing a standard that brings the whole industry along -- creating a source of responsible down not just for our company, but building an economically viable, global market for responsible down. It is still a new path that will continue to change and adapt.
To develop the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), we worked with farmers, collectors and processors across Eastern Europe and Asia to create what is today the largest global, publicly available certification system for the responsible sourcing of down that addresses animal welfare and material traceability. From the outset, we knew that we needed help creating a quality standard that could be applied globally and used by anyone. We worked with several partners, including the animal welfare group FOUR PAWS , down suppliers like Allied Feather & Down and Downlite , third party, independent auditor Control Union, and certification standards experts at Textile Exchange , which now owns and governs the standard on behalf of the industry. We even worked with our competitors to develop a standard the entire industry could access.
For us, responsible down doesn't mean only prohibiting animal mistreatment such as force-feeding and live-plucking. We took a holistic approach by including requirements and guidelines on things like food and water quality, housing, stock density and outdoor access, animal hygiene, and pest and predator control in the standard. To ensure validation of these practices, the standard also includes strict requirements to document the traceability of the down from its origination through to the final product.
We set a goal of 30 percent of all of the down that goes into our fall 2015 products to be RDS-certified material, including all of our technical Summit Series products and all products we sell in Europe. Thirty percent is an aggressive goal given the volume of down we use and the infancy of the standard. However, widespread adoption of the standard within the down supply chain has yielded enough certified down for us to exceed our 30 percent goal.
Why are we sticking with 30 percent? This is actually a crucial strategy for building a global market for certified down. By sharing the supply of certified down with others in the apparel, bedding and hospitality industries, a more diversified and stable market for responsible down can take root.
Making change at a large organization can be tough. But when your efforts can help improve the welfare of animals across an entire global supply chain, it can be worth every obstacle on the "hardest side of the mountain."

Kaiser Permanente Is Failing Its Mental Health Patientsreddit
In September, after more than a year of stonewalling its patients and employees, Kaiser Permanente finally paid a $4-million fine levied against it by state regulators because of the HMO's chronic, illegal, and too often tragic failures in mental health care.
Spurred by whistleblower complaints from Kaiser's own mental health clinicians, an investigation by the state's Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) found the HMO guilty of "serious" and "systemic" violations of California law that put mental health patients at risk. The result: In June 2013 the DMHC hit Kaiser with a $4-million fine -- the second largest in the agency's history -- for forcing thousands of patients to endure illegally lengthy waits for care, falsifying patients' appointment records, and violating the California Mental Health Parity Act, which requires HMOs to provide psychiatric services that are on par with their primary health services.
Kaiser appealed, of course, but, faced with the prospect of a hearing during which patients and whistleblowers would have given public testimony regarding Kaiser's deficient care, the HMO's lawyers finally threw in the towel. Kaiser had attempted to negotiate a settlement with the DMHC in hopes of avoiding such a spectacle but failed. And when, on the hearing's first day, Administrative Law Judge Ruth Astle declined to seal all the hearing's documents and questioned the ethics of Kaiser's star witness -- a former DMHC prosecutor now in private practice defending HMOs against regulators -- Kaiser's attorneys finally saw the writing on the wall .
The National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), which represents 2,500 mental health professionals at more than 100 facilities throughout California, stands with the thousands of patients who have suffered as a result of Kaiser's violations in applauding the DMHC for holding Kaiser accountable. But Kaiser's mental health care crisis is far from over. Kaiser clinicians have provided the DMHC with ample evidence that Kaiser continues to delay and deny care to its mental health patients, in violation of state and federal law.
Kaiser simply does not staff its psychiatry departments with enough psychologists, therapists, and social workers to handle the caseload. And that caseload is growing rapidly. This year Kaiser's enrollment has increased by 387,000 members in California under the Affordable Care Act. Withholding services while increasing membership is an effective way to score record profits -- Kaiser has made more than $13 billion since 2009, and this year's profits are on pace to double last year's -- but it has led to woefully inadequate care, as well as five class-action lawsuits filed by patients and families who say Kaiser's violations contributed to tragic outcomes, including suicides.
And the violations continue:
• As of September 2014, pediatric patients requiring neuropsychological testing waited 22 weeks before receiving a phone call from Kaiser's San Francisco psychiatry department to schedule an appointment, according to Kaiser's records.
• In August 2014, Kaiser's psychiatry department in San Francisco was so severely understaffed that dozens of patients' calls to the "Triage Team" languished in the voicemail system for more than a week before staff could even listen to them, let alone respond to them.
• In July 2014, Kaiser instructed employees in at least one clinic to falsify appointment records rather than provide patients with urgent appointments within 48 hours, as mandated by state law.
• In May 2014, Kaiser failed to provide timely mental health appointments to more than 60 percent of the patients seeking care at Kaiser's Oakland and Richmond facilities, according to data supplied by Kaiser.
• In April 2014, one of Kaiser's Southern California clinics required patients with acute conditions -- including auditory hallucinations -- to wait more than seven weeks for an appointment.
The parallels with the scandal that engulfed the Veterans Affairs Administration earlier this year are striking and prompted NUHW in June to call for a federal investigation into Kaiser's mental health services.
The DMHC is expected to release a follow-up survey of Kaiser's mental health services in November. While the findings in that survey are not yet known, a hint was proffered last month by a DMHC official. At a mental health forum in Santa Rosa , California, hosted by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson and Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane, during which Kaiser was blasted by patients who had suffered as a result of its inadequate psychiatric services, Sherrie Lowenstein, the DMHC's deputy director for legislative affairs, vowed, "We are not done with Kaiser."
Considering the severity of the violations, and considering the preponderance of evidence that Kaiser continues to violate the law, NUHW strongly urges the DMHC to stay true to its mission by forcing Kaiser to fix its dangerously inadequate mental health services.
Without strict enforcement, Kaiser mental health patients will continue to endure illegal and unethical wait times for appointments; patients in need of ongoing one-on-one therapy will be forced to seek care outside Kaiser; and many patients in need of acute care will go untreated, sometimes with tragic consequences.

Ford to spend more than $2.5 billion to overhaul Lincoln brandFord to spend more than $2.5 billion to overhaul Lincoln brand
By Paul Lienert and Bernie Woodall, Reuters
Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers The Lincoln Motor Company Mercedes-Benz
Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, Mark Fields, is giving the automaker's long-moribund Lincoln brand what his predecessor Alan Mulally never could: a little love and a lot of cash.
Lincoln, a storied Detroit brand which Ford has owned since 1922, has been in a swoon for the past two decades, leaving dealers and customers wondering if Ford management had left the brand for dead.
Now, with the renewed backing of Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the company's board, Fields has committed the automaker to a multiyear, multibillion-dollar overhaul of Lincoln that includes a significant investment in a new premium vehicle platform that will underpin several future Lincoln vehicles, four sources told Reuters.
Ford could spend $5 billion or more over the next five years to revive Lincoln, revamp its product portfolio and reposition it as a true competitor to such global luxury leaders as Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG , the sources said. Details of the new platform and the size and scope of the investment have not previously been reported.
"It's really important for us to have a relevant and vibrant luxury brand," Fields told Reuters on Friday. "You need to make the investment and build this brand over time."
He declined to discuss details about Ford's spending and product plans.
Fields said Ford is looking at the Lincoln rebuilding effort "in terms of generations of products," an effort that will stretch well into the next decade.
Hire some Honda and Toyota engineers and designers. Bring back a full-size RWD sedan for the limo industry. That's how you save Lincoln.

Ford executives said last month that the immediate goal of the latest Lincoln turnaround effort is to triple the brand's global sales to 300,000 vehicles by 2020.
Several industry analysts have challenged that mark as overly optimistic, as have some former Ford executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A longer-range target is to restore Lincoln's luster as a premium automotive marque in the United States and build it into a formidable competitor in China, where Ford is just now launching the brand years after most of its global luxury rivals entered the China market. On Friday, Ford delivered its first Lincoln in China, an MKZ sedan.
The springboard for the Lincoln revival plan is a new family of vehicles that will be built on a highly flexible premium platform that can be configured for front-, rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles, according to industry sources familiar with Ford's plans.
That is a critical element that has been lacking in several previous, under-financed attempts to resuscitate the brand. Versions of the platform will be used by both the Lincoln and Ford brands, the sources said.
Former CEO Mulally, who stepped down in July, declined to make more than a nominal investment in Lincoln - and even considered selling or closing the brand, according to two sources.
But his successor, Fields, has directed his management team to try to reverse a long-term U.S. sales skid that has seen Lincoln sink from the No. 1 spot in 1998 to eighth place among luxury brands, with about half the sales of General Motors Co's Cadillac and one-quarter the sales of segment leader Mercedes. Last year, Lincoln sales were 81,694, less than half of the 187,121 cars it sold in 1998.
 
FLEXIBLE DESIGN
The revival effort is backed by the first significant investment in Lincoln in years, one that will see every product redesigned or replaced over the next five years.
Ford already has spent about $2 billion on Lincoln in the past two years, according to one source, about half of that to prepare for the brand's introduction this week in China and half to update and expand its product stable to tide Lincoln over until the new family of vehicles is ready toward the end of the decade.
Ford has said in some years it spent only $500 million or less on Lincoln. In September, the automaker told investors it plans to spend more than $2.5 billion through 2019 on Lincoln product development, facilities and tooling.
But that figure does not include spending on engineering, advertising and other sales-related expenses for Lincoln, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Friday.
Much of the new investment is earmarked for development and tooling of the new premium platform, known internally as D6, sources said. The development is being overseen by new Lincoln President Kumar Galhotra, an engineer.
The flexible architecture of the D6 will provide the mechanical base for a wide variety of sedans and crossovers starting in 2019, all designed to give Lincoln more differentiation from its Ford-branded siblings, as well as a stronger foundation on which to build more competitive luxury models to pit against the sector leaders.
Before the first of the new D6-based models arrive, Lincoln will update most of its existing products, starting with a redesigned MKX midsize crossover in spring 2015 and a replacement for the MKS large sedan in spring 2016, sources said. The latter model will include a long-wheelbase version with more room inside for Chinese customers, Galhotra said.
The Navigator fullsize utility vehicle is slated for an extensive overhaul in autumn 2017, according to sources, when it will share a version of the new Ford F-150 chassis and will get aluminum body panels.
A redesign of the compact MKC crossover is tentatively scheduled in autumn 2018, the sources said.
The first of the all-new D6 models, due in 2019, are a midsize sedan that could replace the MKZ and a large seven-passenger crossover that could replace the MKT, sources said. Both new models are expected to be offered in front- and all-wheel-drive versions.
 

Air travellers  body questions non-existent low fare offersAP The association sought to know as to what action the regulator intends to take against the carriers on the issue.
TOPICS
air transport
Apex air travellers’ association, Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday questioned the frequent “special fare” offers by domestic carriers and termed them as “non-existent”, even as it urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to allow such schemes.
The association, in a communication to the DGCA, also sought to know as to what action the regulator intends to take against the carriers on the issue.
“We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger,” APAI president D. Sidhakara Reddy said.
Domestic carriers, incuding SpiceJet and Jet Airways , have been rolling out limited period “special sale” offers in the last few weeks.
“We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline’s portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings,” Mr. Reddy alleged.
Pointing out that it become a routine practice by all the airlines to announce such schemes almost once in 10-15 days, APAI said: “the airlines seem to be doing this with certain objectives in mind as it gives them tremendous publicity at no cost.”
The association has also sought to know from the regulator whether the carriers do inform of the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with DGCA, indicating the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered by them under the bucket pricing method.
“If they are not then what action do you propose (to take) for not following the procedure?,” Mr. Reddy questioned in his communication.
APAI will explore the RTI route if the DGCA did not respond to its communication, Mr. Reddy added in his communication.

Engagement season: Is that romance in the air - or pumpkin spice0
Naturally, the arrival of fall in all its pumpkin-spiced glory means that the Wedding-Industrial Complex shifts into high gear, which makes Engagement Season nearly as dangerous for the soon-to-be affianced as Duck Season is for mallards.
That's not just because the average wedding cost $29,858 last year, or because one out of every eight couples end up with significant wedding debt (and corresponding money squabbles) because of overspending on their Perfect Day. Or even because nearly half of all weddings now end in divorce, which guarantees both parties will be poorer than if they'd stayed single, and also are likely to die sooner.
No, it's because the actual things you do during Engagement Season could very well doom your marriage before the flower girl drops the first perfect satin rose petal ($12.50 per package) from her $65 Isabella Flower Girl Basket while also bearing the $54 Here Comes the Bride Canvas Wedding Banner.
Exhibit A: The engagement ring.
Ring-a-ding dud
According to new research from Andrew Francis and Hugo Mialon of the economics department at Atlanta's Emory University, the more expensive the engagement ring, the shorter the marriage. Their survey found that men who spent $2,000 to $4,000 on the ring had a 30 percent greater risk of divorce than if they'd spent $500 to $2,000.
Why, you ask? Well, maybe it's because of the financial stress that comes from buying an expensive rock and the fact that a guy who drops four grand on a ring will likewise spend like crazy on the wedding, which is another factor associated with short marriages. Or it could just be that his new bride comes to her senses when she realizes she married the kind of chump who spends $4,000 on an engagement ring.
Despite all that, getting -- and staying -- married is an investment that means you'll be more prosperous, happier and live longer than singletons. So, if you do pop the question this Engagement Season, make sure that instead of blowing your dough on a big wedding bash or a shiny finger bauble, you spend your money on the important things -- like a home with separate bathrooms.
With, of course, pumpkin-spice air fresheners.

Brent crude falls to $86 on Goldman forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Homelands failures as message TVSuraj Sharma as Aayan in “Homeland.” (Season 4, Episode 1). (Joe Alblas/Showtime)
This post discusses the plot of the Oct. 26 episode of “Homeland,” “About a Boy.”
It is very easy to make a highly entertaining spy drama if you do not care very much about the morals or ethics of the people involved in the spy trade. If you are free to spend your mental energy choreographing great chase sequences or tense fights constrained by the need to avoid discovery, you can make movies and television that feel tense and exciting. But if you have set yourself the task not simply of making espionage look cool but of saying something serious about both the trade and the positions of the participants, everything gets a lot harder.
In recent years, we have had a couple of movies about spycraft that managed to deploy style and substance, if not in exactly equal measure.
Sam Mendes’ “Skyfall” is every inch in the James Bond tradition, but despite a flamboyant villain and a lot of snazzy explosions, it is also a melancholic meditation on the limitations of the British empire . And while I know some critics found Thomas Alfredson’s adaptation of John le Carré’s “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” difficult to follow, his chronicle of spy George Smiley’s (Gary Oldman) redemption and rise to power is told with a sense of both agonizing love and ethical squalor.
One of the problems “Homeland” has at present seems to be a sense that, in order to pronounce judgment on the War on Terror and what it has done to us, only extreme dourness will do. To a certain extent, the show has locked itself into this position as a result of past artistic choices and events: Carrie’s (Claire Danes) mental illness, her doomed affair with Brody and the abandoned child that resulted all cast a depressive fog over the series.
But I wonder if digging into that tone is a mistake. Part of what is powerful about le Carré’s work or the best adaptation of Ian Fleming’s is that it conveys just how satisfying it can be to pull off a perfect operation, how powerful you can feel when you have access to a secret world. If intelligence is a quick route to misery and emotional illness, and if the people in it are fated to fail in painful and embarrassing ways, we would not have to frown in sorrow about its dangers and appeal. Showing spies being competent and exercising great power is critical both to entertaining and audience and leading them to an authentic moral judgment on this work and the people who do it.
Take Carrie’s seduction of Aayan (Suraj Sharma). On a different, shallower show he might be an adult, and their romp would be a flirtation of equals. At the very least, there might be something genuinely sweet about Aayan’s sexual awakening. But “Homeland” digs in on the grubbiness of her tactics.
“It’s against my faith,” Aayan tells her the morning after. “I don’t want to sin, I want to be devout.” “It’s all right,” Carrie tells him. “We don’t have to do anything.” Of course, she proceeds to seduce him again, promising to be his sexual tutor so he will know what to do, for his pleasure and for hers. She emotionally connects to him, which of course means he is in for some sort of disaster, and even confides that she would have liked to be married to Brody. And if it was not all seedy enough, Quinn (Rupert Friend) shows up tell Carrie that while she may think she is recruiting Aayan, “to me it looks like you’re f—ing a child.”
Then, there is the pathetic dissolution of Dennis (Mark Moses) and Martha’s (Laila Robins) marriage. “Don’t make up a story. If you want to leave, say it to my face,” Martha tells Dennis, who slinks off to drink himself silly in a bar. “Men secretly fear their wives are crazy, and wives secretly fear their husbands are losers,” Martha tells John (Michael O’Keefe) when he fetches Dennis home. “He was dashing. A bright light. That guy is gone.”
There is absolutely truth in the idea that marriages can fall apart when gender roles are reversed to one partner’s displeasure, when one partner does not have meaningful work, or when the couple lacks a social network. But taken with Carrie’s latest seduction, this kind of grinding misery makes it hard to stick around for the lessons “Homeland” is supposed to impart to me. The show sometimes feels like the equivalent of burying vitamins not in ice cream but in castor oil.
Thank goodness for the few people in Islamabad who appears to have a sense of style. John wanted Carrie’s job as station chief; he may be bitter, but he hasn’t let that cramp his killer deadpan. “I don’t know how great he was, but he was all right to drink with,” he says in the bar with Dennis. And then there’s Ghazi, who may be a thug and a killer, but who has enough game to lure Saul (Mandy Patinkin) into a trap.
This season of “Homeland” may be a reboot. But for it to work as both morality tale and entertainment, the series and its main characters could learn from its villains and the minor players on their own side that they have shunted aside.

Volvo launches new range of trucks in IndiaVolvo launches new range of trucks in India

Dynafleet also enables customers to see in real time the location of their vehicle and vehicles' performance data that are critical to have control on their fleet.
BANGALORE: Volvo Trucks today announced the launch of new range of trucks in India, including the flagship Volvo FH which was voted 'International Truck of the Year 2014' in Europe.
Comprising Volvo FH, the Volvo FM and the Volvo FMX, the range is the most technologically advanced in India, boasting improvement in all crucial areas from productivity, fuel efficiency, safety and maximising uptime, company officials said.
They said the range also introduces unique features such as the intelligent I-Shift automated gearbox technology optimised for tough and rugged mining operating conditions, as well as Volvo's unique Dynafleet telemetrics system which allows following up on fuel consumption over time.
Dynafleet also enables customers to see in real time the location of their vehicle and vehicles' performance data that are critical to have control on their fleet, letting the customer fully focus on running their core business, they added.
"Volvo has invested more than USD 3 billion and 14 million engineering hours in this project. And just to make perfectly sure of the outcome, we have tested the vehicles for 21 million kms," Philippe Divry President , Volvo India and Senior Vice President, Volvo Group told reporters.
"We are the undisputed leaders of the premium truck segment in India, and this new range will keep moving the bar further in terms of productivity and efficiency for our customers," he added.
Divry said the Volvo group has always been extremely confident about the future outlook of India.
" ....we have always said that we are not scared by the short term cycle. We remain confident about the India's growth story. Now we believe that this is the moment for growth story about to be delivered. We are very positive on the market and we think that there is no best moment than now to introduce new trucks."

JSW Steel plans to add 6 mtpa capacity at Bellary plant
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
JSW Steel plans to raise capacity at its Bellary plant by 60 per cent to 16 million tonnes a year at an estimated investment Rs 30,000 crore that will make the unit the largest single-location steel facility.
The proposal to raise the capacity from 10 mtpa now was put up by the Sajjan Jindal-led steel maker earlier the month to the Steel Ministry which has forwarded to Environment and Forest counterpart for its approval, sources in the know said.
The capacity addition plan is in line with JSW Steel’s overall target of achieving a portfolio of 40 mtpa by 2025 which in turn would help the steel maker to retain its market share of 13-14 per cent.
JSW Steel has 14.3 mtpa installed capacity spread across Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. In July this year, company Chairman Sajjan Jindal had announced plans to increase the overall steel capacity to 40 mtpa by 2025, which will entail a capital outlay in the range of $ 22 billion.
M V S Seshagiri Rao, JSW Steel’s Joint Managing Director and Group Chief Financial Officer, could not be reached for comments immediately.
The capacity raising plan of the company is in sync with government’s plan of more than trebling country’s steel making capacity to 300 mtpa by 2025 requiring a whopping $ 200 billion investment over the next decade.
It generally takes $ 1 billion investment to create a one million tonne steel capacity. Going by the industry thumb rule, JSW Steel may have to invest $ 6 billion or roughly about Rs 36,000 crore to crate the additional capacity.
However, since the expansion would be brownfield in nature, it might require less for the company, but not less than Rs 30,000 crore, an industry source said.
With the objective of touching 40 mtpa in next decade, it is expanding capacities at its existing sites and setting up plants in new locations.
“On the anvil are two 10 million tonne greenfield facilities in West Bengal and Jharkhand,” it said in its website.
The company was the largest exporter in the country during the April-September period of the current fiscal, contributing 61 per cent of the total shipments.

Names out in black money case  BJP calls it historic but Congress claims blackmailBJP calls black money affidavit historic, Cong claims blackmail
Agencies  New Delhi, October 27, 2014
First Published: 18:42 IST(27/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:22 IST(28/10/2014)
Comments
Political reactions were sharp after the government revealed on Monday the names of seven persons and a company facing prosecution for keeping illegal wealth in foreign banks.
The government's first list of black money account holders has named Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya (L), Radha Timblo (C) and Pradip Burman. (PTI and ANI photos)
The government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court naming Pradip Burman of the Dabur group, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and directors of Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited — Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. Timblo Private Limited, a firm identified by Association for Democratic Reforms as a donor to both the BJP and the Congress, was also named.
Sambit Patra, a BJP spokesperson, called disclosure of the names "a historic day in the black money case".
 
"The process of disclosure of names has started," Patra told reporters, referring to a list that allegedly contains hundreds of names.
 
But opposition Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh accused the BJP of "selective revelation" of names and said the process smacked of "blackmail, not black money".
Several prominent figures of the Congress party, dogged by multi-billion-dollar graft scandals while in power, are reportedly on the list of people with untaxed funds abroad but their names have not been disclosed.

BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said he did not understand why the government had not disclosed all of the names of alleged offenders at once. "I do not see any legal issues in releasing all 700 names. I hope the government will release all the names very soon," he told CNN-IBN news channel.
 
D Raja, national secretary of Communist Party of India, asked the government to reveal "all the names".
 
"The government has to answer a lot of questions as there is a reluctance on its part to give out all the names. This shows that the government lacks the political will and determination to fulfil its election promises," said Raja.
 
Raja demanded finance minister Arun Jaitley follow on his statement that some names in the black money list would embarrass the Congress. "What happened to those names? Why are the names of politicians not being revealed as claimed by the BJP," he asked.
 
The Dabur group said in a statement that Burman opened his foreign account while a non-resident Indian and "was legally allowed to open this account".
 
Lodhiya told reporters he was in compliance with all tax laws, adding, "I have no foreign bank account".
 
Radha Timblo, while speaking to reporters in Panaji, said that she would issue a press statement after going through the government's affidavit.
 
Swiftly after taking office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up a team of regulators and ex-judges to repatriate illicit funds kept in Swiss and other foreign bank accounts to avoid taxes. There is no firm estimate of the amount of black money at home and abroad, but it is believed to amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tripura Congress file PIL over multi-crore RD block scam  demands CBIprobePrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:32 pm
The opposition Congress on Monday filed a PIL in the Tripura High Court demanding a CBI probe into the multi-crore Bishalgarh RD block scam unearthed by an internal audit of the state government.
Congress spokesperson Dr Ashok Sinha, the petitioner, said the PIL was filed because “the state police is unlikely to conduct an impartial probe into the scam,” in relation to which one official has been suspended and an FIR lodged against 11 others by incumbent Block Development Officer Subrata Das.
The Bishalgarh RD block financial scam has become a major political issue with the opposition parties attacking the Left Front government, which has been in power for more than two decades, over several financial irregularities that has surfaced over the past few months.
Another scam involving the apparent misappropriation of almost Rs 25 crores of NRHM funds over eight years has also resulted in the sacking of at least one official and an investigation by higher officials instituted.
The main accused in the RD block scam, Bimal Chakraborty, has been arrested and is currently in police custody. He was Deputy Director of the state’s Information and Cultural Affairs Department before he was suspended, and was formerly the BDO at Bishalgarh, West Tripura.

Centre to name only those having prosecutable evidence : Arun Jaitley on blackmoneyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:18 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:27 pm
The Central Government will make public names of only those people against whom there is a prosecutable case in connection with tax evasion through offshore accounts, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday, amid the Congress asking for disclosure of all names of black money holders.
“We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence,” he told reporters.
READ: Black money case: Centre names three account holders
His remark comes hours after the government disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and a Goa miner against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under the scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal”.
Earlier, Congress leader Digvijay Singh attacked Jaitley for his comments that Congress would be embarrassed when all names of those who stashed money abroad were made public.
Terming Jaitley’s remarks as “mischievous”, Singh said: “If he (Jaitley) has guts, he should reveal those names.” He said if any Congress member is found to have stashed money abroad illegally, the party would “punish” the person.

Another Congress leader and a former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said the party has no problem if all names are put out in public domain.
Jaitley had earlier said the government would not be pushed into an act of adventurism and jeopardise the chances of getting cooperation of other countries in future.
The NDA government’s approach on black money, he had asserted, “is doggedly persistent, not adventurist.”
He had also blamed the agreement entered into by the Congress government with Germany in 1995 as a constraining factor in disclosing details of black money stashed abroad.
In the run-up to Parliamentary polls, BJP had promised to bring back black money kept by Indians in overseas banks while targeting the UPA government for not taking effective action on the issue.

Imposition of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centres involvement in theissuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Hiranandani says no out-of-court settlement with Hirco PlcNiranajan Hiranandani, MD, Hiranandani Group has ruled out an out-of-court settlement with Hirco Plc.
Talking to CNBC-TV18, Hiranandani said they had a strong case against Hirco's USD 350 million claim.
In February last year, Hirco had sued Hiranandani and his daughter in a lower court in the Isle of Man, alleging they had committed fraud and other misconduct prior to their resignation as chairman and CEO of Hirco in 2010.
The lower court had ruled in Hirco's favour on the issue of jurisdiction in the case, and the verdict was upheld by the Isle of Man Appellate Court as well.
Hiranandani said: “We were looking for an adjudication that this jurisdiction should be India because the properties were in India of course the Isle of Man has rejected that, so the case will go in Isle of Man. It makes no difference whatsoever, we have an excellent case and they don't have a good case at all. We are absolutely right, we should be able to justify ourselves in the Isle of Man ultimately but we were looking that the jurisdiction would be India and only that is what we have lost - only the question of jurisdiction not the case.”

Maoists apologise for killing of unarmed  unwellcopPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:41 pm
The CPI (Maoist) has apologized for the killing of an unarmed Chhattisgarh constable in Sukma district earlier this month. Shiv Kumar Sidar was  unwell and travelling in a passenger bus from his camp in Chintalnar to a health centre when the Maoists forcibly halted the bus and killed Sidar.
“Our guerrillas killed a policeman but this happened without the permission of our party. We seek an apology (for the act). Shiv Kumar Sidar was going for the treatment of his illness. He was not carrying arms for people’s exploitation. In such circumstances, we consider it wrong that he was nabbed and killed,” said a statement released on Monday by the South Regional Divisional Committee of CPI (Maoist).
The statement added that “our stand towards the police remain the same what we had earlier said. Hum bina target wale police ko nahi marenge.(We will not kill police without target).”  The apology also urged the security forces to stop harassing and torturing innocent villagers.
This statement marks yet another apology from the rebels for their actions in the last 18 months. They apologized for the killings of two Bastar journalists last year. This April, they issued a “public apology” within 48 hours after blasting an ambulance and a minibus in Bastar that killed 14 persons, including five teachers and two men on medical duty, and expressed “extreme empathy” for the families of the deceased and the injured.
Last October, Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee Secretary Ramanna had also noted that the killings of PCC Chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel in Darbha was a mistake.

BJP to launch mobile  online membership drive on Nov 1Print
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:10 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the first BJP leader to have his party membership renewed through a mobile text message, a first of its kind of measure introduced by the organisation, as it launches its membership drive from November 1.
Party General Secretary J P Nadda said BJP aims to “break all records” in enrolling new members in the six-month long drive as the party seeks to strengthen its base following its unprecedented victories in Lok Sabha elections as well as recent Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana.
For the first time, BJP has introduced the use of mobile and internet for people to become a party member. Anybody interested will have to call a mobile number, which would be disclosed on November 1, to start membership process, he said while addressing a press conference here.
“The emphasis would be on mobile and internet…Party President Amit Shah will make Prime Minister Modi the first member through SMS and Modi will make Shah the second member by similar method at the party headquarters on November 1,” Nadda said.
The party generally seeks to increase its members by 20 per cent during the drive, which is launched every sixth year, but this time it will work to break all previous records, Nadda said.
The party presently has 3.25 crore members, though not all of them are active workers.
The drive, however, will not be launched in poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, where it will begin only after the Assembly elections.
Enthused by the “connect” of its catchy slogans with masses during Lok Sabha elections, BJP has come out with new ones for the membership drive which include ‘sashakt Bhajpa, sashakt Bharat (strong BJP, strong India)’ and ‘saath aayein, desh banayein (come together, build the country)’.
BJP will hold three workshops in Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata on October 29, 30 and 31 and similar exercises would be held at the state-level as well, Nadda said.
While Bangalore would cater to south and west Indian states besides the UTs, Delhi would host central India states and Kolkata the eastern states. States will start membership drive from November 2.

Wolff: Whatever happened to advertising?

Advertising Age.

My friend and long-time colleague at New York magazine, Simon Dumenco, has just been appointed the top editor of Advertising Age, the ad industry's leading trade magazine. This is meaningful to me because I remember with rapt fascination the "ad trades" my Mad Man dad used to bring home in the 1960s, all about the secrets of how clever men got rich thinking up clever things. And, too, because not long ago I did a stint running Ad Age's longtime competitor, Adweek. But most of all, I'm interested in Simon's new job because the advertising business still supports this newspaper and most other media, and yet nobody seems to know what it is anymore.
Is the business about advertising, or is it about technology? Is it a creative business or a number-cruncher business? Is it a partner with the media business or is it its competitor? And if it's not a cool business anymore — and whoever hears anybody say they want to go into advertising? — who actually works in it? And why?
The ad trades themselves have fallen on hard times, in part because they cover a business without a common theme or core to write about (in addition to there being far fewer people in advertising to buy high-price subscriptions after several decades of consolidation in the industry). Making ads, for instance, is no longer the prime function of advertising. In fact, relatively few people in advertising make ads or dream up campaigns anymore.
Much of the business is now oriented toward the digital side. This is a vast area of the business that in itself would be hard to define. One executive at a well-known digital agency — itself part of a larger full-service agency, itself part of the handful of holding companies that dominate the business — told me in a private conversation that the job was no longer about storytelling, or myth-making, or brand building, but about moving the cash register closer to the consumer.
I have been puzzling over that job description ever since. As far as I can tell, what it means is that cleverness and even salesmanship are out, and that what ad agencies do, or what they want to do, is much the same thing that Google and Facebook want to do: get paid for ever more seamlessly, and stealthily, linking buyer and seller.
The emphasis on digital contributes to the identity crisis of the industry because, once, the effectiveness of the advertising business was measured by the fact that the cost, and seemingly the value, of advertising on television and in magazines and newspapers kept going up. But in digital, the cost of advertising space keeps going down, suggesting that digital advertising doesn't work very well. Or it suggests that technology can now so clearly and efficiently identify a likely buyer that the waste and much of the profit is removed from the system.
Wolff: The end of advertising
Advertising used to be about a partnership between a writer and an art director — my father was a copywriter and some of his dearest friends art directors. Their job, which transformed the nation in the many decades after World War II, was to create desire and hence the demand for much of what became modern life. A growing belief fueled by financial types that the magic could be measured, and that it could be achieved in more efficient ways than relying on creativity, made writers and art directors much less important. Instead, the measurers rose to prominence. Measurability rather than creativity became the sine qua non of advertising.
This was a particular attraction of digital — that its results and nature could be finely calculated, curiously creating a world in which everybody has numbers seemingly supporting any point of view and outcome they want, making this theoretically most-measurable type of media the most indecipherable.

One measure for ad agencies was that digital, with all its programmers, product managers, consultants, Web staffers and social media experts, was a lot more profitable than making ads that only required a copywriter and art director. A result was that the particular partnership of ad agencies and magazines, which gave each business much of its flair and its Mad Men culture, faded. There are few ad men or women who actually write ads anymore, although some try to be "content creators," writing "native content" — a perplexing genre. Most have just become part of an amorphous digital blob without precise function or character. Certainly, this is a much less compelling subject for Ad Age than the clever men and women who used to create memorable words and pictures.
Then, too, television, where advertising achieved its ultimate power, turns more and more into a medium without ads. Television's new golden age is paid for by the viewer — ads, when you do see them, seem discordant and peculiar.
After so many years, perhaps we have outgrown advertising. In fact, advertising is still a thriving business in many of the world's newer, fast-growing economies with less jaded consumers.
But here it is not so hard to imagine — just as we look forward to the last episodes of Mad Men — a post post-modern America without advertising, at least not as we have known it. Now the story my friend Simon at Advertising Age must try to make sense of has to do with big data and programmatic buying and the purchase funnel and the ways in which we micromanage the key strokes to complete a transaction, and how we matter-of-factly trade our privacy in some mysterious new deal we have not ever actually agreed to.
Of course, we have all long wanted advertising with its overt demands and cheap seductions to go away and to stop bothering us. Quite possibly another example of why we should be careful what we wish for.

Detroit Electric  giving a look at the rear end of what it considers the final version of its SP:01 battery-fueled electric sports car.
The car will be somewhat similar to the Tesla Roadster no longer in production. Both are pure battery-power two-seaters based on Lotus designs. Detroit Electric's founder is former Lotus executive Albert Lam, former Group CEO of the Lotus Engineering Group and Executive Director of Lotus Cars of England.
Detroit Electric says its car will not be a roadster -- open car -- but rather a hatchback for better aerodynamics, longer range, higher speed.
Production is to begin late this year, and sales are to begin early next year in Asia, Europe and North America. No price has been announced.
The company was founded in 2008 and named after an electric car company that was successful in the early 1900s. It said in March 2013 that it would build as many as 2,500 sports cars a year in Michigan, but it didn't say exactly where.
Now the plan is to build all the cars in a new, dedicated Detroit Electric production facility in Leamington Spa, England, beginning late this year.
It also plans a European headquarters in Houten, Netherlands, where the company has recruited a new team to manage the brand's sales and marketing, as well as customer service in the region.
The company's h.q. remains on the 18th floor of the Fisher Building in downtown Detroit, and that site also becomes the financial center and will oversee North American activities.
The company claims that its lightweight, limited-edition SP:01 will be the world's fastest production electric sports car: top speed,  155 mph; 0-60 mph, 3.7 seconds. It hasn't given a driving range between battery recharges.
The changes since the 2013 Shanghai showing include a fastback design with smoother rooofline, a rear spoiler and heating-cooling system improvements.
The vehicle's battery packs have been clad in a protective composite casing which forms an integral part of the vehicle's structure and makes the car stiffer. It also helps protect the batteries in a crash.
Jerry Chung, design chief at Detroit Electric, said: "The final design of SP:01 incorporates signature Detroit Electric design DNA, carried over from the prototype model we revealed last year. Coupled with many motorsport visual cues, the new fastback design, bold face and sharp contours evoke the company's vision of pure electric performance."

McDonald s Happy Meals problem6
It's not an insurmountable problem in that the company had $35.8 billion in systemwide U.S. sales in 2013, according to QSRMagazine.com. Sales could slide an awfully long way over an awfully long time before anyone overtakes it. The next closest chain was Subway, with $12.7 billion in 2013.
In fact, you can combine the 2013 U.S. sales of Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Chick-Fil-A, KFC and Five Guys, and McDonald's still comes out almost $200 million ahead.
Which bring us to lunchtime with the girl, 8. We had an hour between gymnastics classes. We were a block from McDonald's.
"I only want to go there if they have a prize I want," she said.
They didn't.
Later, over quesadillas at Chipotle, she suggested McDonald's could win her affection with a full-size American Girl doll in its Happy Meals. "But," she said, thinking about it for a moment, "that Happy Meal would probably cost $100."
If an 8-year-old feels that way about Happy Meals and Mighty Meals, what about the grown-ups taking them out to eat? And what happens when those 8-year-olds become 18?
"More choices, sophistication and better quality are driving kids' attitudes away from McDonald's and toward these other restaurants," Tristano said. "When kids get into that 8-to-12 range, before they become tweens even, they not only want something different, they want something better. What's changed is the fast-casual industry — like Chipotle and Panera — all these offering other choices and higher quality."
McDonald's has said it understands that millennials, like all of its customers, "share a desire for fresh, quality ingredients," and it's looking to expand its offerings to meet that demand. It's also trying to tap into digital marketing and mobile ordering platforms.
But the lesson about the Happy Meal is it has to be about the food, not the geegaws and gimmicks. As the Beatles, absent parents and spurned self-financed politicians all will tell you, real loyalty is earned not bought.
"Trying to change who you are, which we all know as individuals, is very difficult," Tristano said. "This is a big train that needs to slow down and stop before it changes direction. … The next generation may be the one that they're going to get to return to McDonald's, and that could start with the kids' meals."
Keeping eyes on the prize for McDonald's means keeping the focus on the food.

All The Wealth The Middle Class Accumulated After 1940 Is Gonereddit
Here's more proof the middle class is dying.
The middle-class share of American wealth has been shrinking for the better part of three decades and recently fell to its lowest level since 1940, according to a new study by economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics.
In other words, remember the surge of the great American middle class after World War II? That's all gone, at least by one measure.
In this case, "middle class" is defined rather expansively as the bottom 90 percent of all Americans. "Wealth" is the total of home equity, stock and bond holdings, pension plans and other assets, minus debt. As such assets are mostly owned by mid- to higher-income households -- and considering most Americans define themselves as "middle-class" -- it seems reasonable to use the bottom 90 percent as a proxy for the "middle class."
Saez and Zucman discussed their paper in a blog post for the Washington Center For Equitable Growth on Monday that included this stark chart:
Debt has been the big force driving net wealth lower for the middle class, according to Saez and Zucman. Brief bubbles in stock and home prices in the 1990s and 2000s only temporarily offset the steady, depressing rise in mortgage, student-loan, credit-card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent.
"Many middle class families own homes and have pensions, but too many of these families also have much higher mortgages to repay and much higher consumer credit and student loans to service than before," Saez and Zucman wrote.
Another important factor has been that incomes have stagnated for most Americans over the past few decades, once adjusted for inflation. Along with rising debt levels, stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money.
And who has been the beneficiary of this middle-class misery? The top 0.1 percent of Americans, whose incomes have just kept rising, and whose share of wealth has soared to levels not seen since Jay Gatsby was still staring at the blinking green light at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock:
In fact, the middle class is not alone in suffering from shrinking wealth. The rest of the top 10 percent of Americans below the 0.1 percent -- the "merely rich," Saez and Zucman call them -- have also suffered from falling household wealth over the past four decades.
This rising inequality of wealth can only lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future, Saez and Zucman warned, echoing French economist Thomas Piketty. The very rich will just keep getting richer by living on the returns from their wealth, while the rest of us will keep falling behind.

Uber for Kids: Shuddle Wants to Shuttle Your ChildrenEmail
Little Suzy has soccer practice. Timmy needs to get to his recital. You have an important meeting. Don't worry, a new startup says it has you covered.
It's called  Shuddle . It was founded by Nick Allen, one of the guys behind Sidecar, a ride-sharing service like Uber and Lyft that connects drivers with passengers through a smartphone app. This service, however, is meant for (although not necessarily limited to) children. 
Shuddle
"The foundation of this whole thing is trust," he told TODAY. "When you create an account, you actually get a phone call from us welcoming you. We are there to answer any questions you might have, and parents have a lot of them."
Obviously, the idea of entrusting a child to an unknown driver will give some parents pause. That is why Shuddle only hires drivers with two references confirming that they have experience working with children. They also have to pass national and local background checks, a vehicle inspection, and a face-to-face interview and training process. 
After that, ordering a car from Shuddle works like this:
Parents download the app and sign up for a Shuddle Pass membership, which costs $9 a month, plus fares for each ride. 
Rides can be scheduled anywhere from a day to a week in advance through the app. 
The driver arrives and answers a secret word chosen by the family to confirm their identity as a Shuddle driver.
Parents can watch the progress of their kids in real time on their phones. 
Once the ride is over, parents get a message from Shuddle telling them their kids have reached their destination. 
Right now, the service is only available in San Francisco, but Allen plans to expand in the future. He originally got the idea watching parents order Uber cars for their kids. Companies like Uber and Lyft, he said, don't have the insurance to cover passengers under the age of 18.  Shuddle does. 
He is also using the family-focused service to attract female drivers who might not be comfortable driving drunken guys home from a bar at 2 a.m.
"Most of our drivers are nannies, teachers and child-care providers," he said. "Our value proposition to them is, 'Hey, our customers are all families, these rides are happening during the day and you can schedule them ahead of time,' and that really resonates with women."
In fact, right now all of Shuddle's drivers are women. The company is accepting new members slowly to make sure it can recruit enough drivers to offer families rides whenever they need one.
It certainly sounds convenient. But would you put your kid in a Shuddle car? Tell us what you think!

There s Now a Host of Ambitious Terminology for Women in the Workplace -- Are Men Feeling Left Outreddit
Every study indicates Millennial males are an evolved model of masculinity: kinder, more accepting, not intimidated by dirty diapers, comfortable sharing power with a new generation of high-achieving females.
But how well do we really know them -- particularly in the workplace? The new generation of women at work has been peeled, prodded and parsed from every angle -- their education, their numbers, their issues, their needs, their frustrations. But you would be hard-pressed to find one illuminating equivalent study on the male side of the gender divide.
The lexicon of women and work is crowded with terms like "queen bee," "glass ceiling," "burnout," "have it all," "mommy track," "on ramps," and "lean in." Name one for young men.
There are some indications that the adjustment isn't as smooth as the assumptions of an evolved male might indicate. Pew research finds that young women are, for the first time, surpassing young men in career ambition: 67 percent of women put career success high on their list of life's goals, versus 60 percent for males. It's a statistically significant difference, and an even more significant shift from decades past -- when the majority of women were just happy to be in the game.
All such surveys run into the same question: is the rebalancing -- in this case, of career expectations -- a matter of males trending down, or females catching up? Are the genders working their way toward equilibrium, or are we seeing the start of long-term trends?
Either way, for men born after 1980, theirs is a generation of adjustment. They have seen a rebuilding of architectures of support in everything from girl's sports to female-only scholarships to the broad encouragement for females to break down barriers. All of that, of course, reflects the maturation of a better, fairer society -- where ability has blown large holes in the former battlements of privilege.
In a Shriver Report article "Has a Man's World become a Woman's Nation?" sociologist Michael Kimmel, a leading researcher and author on men and masculinity, sees distinct male reactions to the new power-sharing.
Some see the rise in female power as an "invasion." They are in a fighting mood, determined to recapture lost territory. Others, he argues, are largely indifferent to economic and other measures of female progress. For these "masculinists," it's about retrieving an "inner sense of their own masculinity." Many, he says, find it in men's empowerment groups or in the reaches of cyberspace.
It's likely that most male Millennials in the workforce fall into Kimmel's third category. They fall somewhere between "eager embrace and resigned acceptance." They think it's right. They think it's fair. But they are largely along for a "rather apolitical ride." Their support is rooted in the reality of change.
Adapting to what's right and inevitable means getting past what many see as a continuation of the unequal support this generation has experienced since childhood. Roughly 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have organized and funded women's-affinity groups. The number of men's-affinity groups are a handful and largely informal. Companies talk openly about their commitment to hire more women and put them on special development tracks. Men in many organizations see flextime, job sharing, and extended maternity leave largely as gains for females.
It's a fair point that, by numbers and culture, entire organizations can be called a male-affinity group. But for male Millennials, that is a situation not of their making. It would be understandable that they look at these special support programs and see an unfair advantage to those competing for the same promotions.
Since there is so little about male Millennial opinion, I asked a number of young male managers their thoughts on the fairness of the new corporate rule book. These conversations -- though well short of a representative sampling -- found both support and questions.
Said one: "When you think about it, we all grew up at a time when women were getting extra support. It's just been part of our lives. But I think most men will tell you that it makes no sense that 90 percent of a school's athletic budget goes to boy's sports. Or that a woman qualified for a job gets moved aside because she's a woman.
"On the other hand," he quickly added, "let me tell you what I just experienced. A number of us applied for an open position. It went to a woman who was in the Women's Leadership Group. The supervisor for that position is the sponsor of the group. "You look at that, and you wonder. Is she the best candidate? Quite possibly. Did being a woman and a member of the leadership group give her just enough of an edge to get the job? How can you rule that out?"
Another had a different view. "It's not like they suddenly imported a whole new category of people to compete for a finite number of jobs. The talented competition has always been there. It's just that, now, a lot of that competition is female. I see some extra support. But I don't see outright bias. I don't believe things like women's groups and mentoring are discrimination--certainly not the kind that used to block the way for women."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that just over half of "management, professional and related occupation" positions are now held by women. Smart employers who want to find and develop the best talent regardless of gender should make sure they equally tuned in to the hopes and needs of the other half. Listen carefully. They tend to be quiet.

3 Lessons on Financial Inclusion and the Sharing Economyreddit
Why is it that despite new technologies and widespread innovation, today's financial sector provides such ill-fitting products and services to so many people and leaves so many more entirely unserved? We are missing a huge opportunity for business, policy and society alike - a missed opportunity with lasting negative effects.
For an economy to thrive, we must have appropriate, affordable financial services available to a majority of people and organizations operating in it. In other words, we need financial inclusion. Historically, however, many financial services have been available only to wealthy and better-off individuals, leaving many disadvantaged and low-income people "unbanked."
Setting the economic stage: from microfinance to macro effects
Since the late 1990s, microfinance has become a major tool for financial inclusion. Microfinance is the provision of small (micro) loans and savings products for people living at the base of the economic pyramid (BOP). It has historical links to rotating savings and credit associations (or ROSCAs) that operate like community lending circles. Microfinance clients are often called microentrepreneurs; classic microfinance is focused on the provision of working capital loans - funding to build and grow small enterprises.
Modern microfinance is typically traced back to the 1970s when Mohammed Yunus began experimenting with making small loans to groups of poor women in Bangladesh. Today microfinance is credited with lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty around the world. Collectively, microentrepreneurs represent a formidable force in the global economy.
Yunus' original work was primarily grant-driven: it did not involve commercial capital. However, as the concept caught on - and especially, as repayment rates remained close to 100% over time - investors began to take notice, with mostly great and sometimes negative effects.
The advent of "commercial" microfinance dates to the early 2000s (for context, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006). I was fortunate to be at the proverbial fifty-yard line of microfinance at this time, advising investors, foundations and microfinance institutions (MFIs) around the world. One of my clients was Kiva , which at the time was tiny and less than one year old - ahead of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms like Lending Club, or crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. Kiva today is on track to facilitate (cumulatively) more than $1 billion in loans to microentrepreneurs around the world. In places like Congo, Kiva is the largest private lender in the country.
Microfinance works because it is built on a premise of trust and reputational capital, and it meets the needs of people left out of the current system. It enables poor microentrepreneurs to disintermediate loan sharks and, usually, save money for the very first time. This money can help put children in school, provide a buffer for emergencies, and increase resilience overall. The social returns of microfinance are enormous. In addition, at the societal level microfinance proves that being poor does not mean greater risk; it forces us to rethink what, why and in whom we invest.

At the same time, microfinance is not a panacea. We saw that, especially with the entry of venture capital and private equity investors, many MFIs were forced to compromise their core social mission, some markets got saturated, with borrowers taking loans that no socially responsible lender would have ever offered. Often, investors' demands were prioritized over microentrepreneurs' needs. In a few cases, the results were disastrous: MFI client suicides, massive non-repayment, and MFIs going out of business.
In hindsight, during this era we learned the power of commercial capital to help an innovative tool grow and scale. There is no question that without commercial investment, microfinance would not have reached as many people successfully - with overall repayment rates still near 100% - as it did. However, we also learned that funding without a social mission as its unequivocal top priority can be toxic, and that MFIs who do not look at clients' overall needs (including financial literacy) are much more likely to fail.
Microentrepreneurs: from Bangladesh to Brooklyn, Berlin and beyond
Fast forward to today's blossoming sharing economy, with new business models based on "access over ownership" and underutilized assets. We're building community marketplaces in unparalleled ways: from carsharing and ridesharing, to sharing all kinds of skills and spaces. Many of these models rely essentially on new technologies: in effect, we're building online platforms to enable sharing in the offline world.
In the process, an entirely new class of microentrepreneurs is emerging. It includes Airbnb hosts, Lyft drivers, TaskRabbit taskers, Skillshare teachers, Park My Pooch dogsitters, Shyp pick-up people, AnyRoad tour guides, RelayRides car owners and many others. They are earning income, saving money, building livelihoods, engaging in their communities, and sometimes just squeaking by thanks to these platforms. Sharing economy marketplace dynamics are also driven by trust and social capital, reaffirming the conclusion that one's reputation matters more than bank account balance.
The degree to which the term microentrepreneurs is being used today is unexpected, but perhaps not surprising: according to the Freelancers Union, Intuit and other sources, it is estimated that by 2020, more than 40% of the U.S. workforce will be "freelance" - not connected to any one company or organization. So this is not just a sharing economy issue, this is a major economic trend underway.
Some companies, such as the ridesharing platform Lyft , are actively seeking to engage with a broader community. Lyft not only enables its drivers (many of whom were previously underemployed) to earn income, but also it seeks to expand its offerings to lower-income areas through its Community Solutions initiative. However, neither Lyft nor other sharing economy platforms are able to provide financial services. We have yet to effectively fill this gap.
Today's microentrepreneurs (courtesy Lyft)
Etsy , a P2P platform for creative goods, shows how these issues and trends play out. Although Etsy is distinct from sharing economy companies (because it does not focus on sharing of underutilized assets), its more than one million sellers around the world are a prime case of microentrepreneurship - and the issues around financial inclusion.
The majority of Etsy sellers lack access to financial services to grow their businesses. Interestingly, Etsy sellers rarely need investment capital. They don't want to grow "big"; they appreciate the P2P nature of the business because it allows them flexibility and to do what they love. In the aggregate, this is as if a leading global corporation (or an entire country) lacks the financial tools to thrive. And ironically, typical responses such as providing access to Small Business Association (SBA) capital aren't appropriate. We need to think differently.
Companies like Etsy, and the broader sharing economy, represent an economic bridge: they have the capacity to help smooth the transition from old to new ways of economic thinking, working, caring for our families and connecting with community. The sharing economy will not solve today's global economic woes, no more than microfinance can (not) single-handedly solve global poverty alleviation. But it is a powerful and helpful option to have that did not exist before, and should be promoted as such.
Three lessons (and three services) for today
Today's microentrepreneurs - and society at large - can learn a lot from past experience with financial inclusion. There are three key lessons:
Microentrepreneurs in the sharing economy are ill served by financial services.
Meanwhile, many people who could benefit by participating in the sharing economy are left out of it, because they lack access to appropriate financial tools.
Points 1 and 2 represent huge opportunities for financial institutions and entrepreneurs alike, on both macro and micro levels. (And I often feel like I am watching a movie on repeat, with a deep sense of déjà vu.)
Kiva was in many ways the pioneer of today's crowdfunding and P2P lending phenomena. It bridged the proof of concept that Yunus had established (building trust, reputation and social capital) with new technologies that enabled access to finance in new ways (e.g. online lending platforms and mobile banking).
Unfortunately, thus far the "innovation" we have seen by traditional players has been limited to traditional clients (such as the Barclaycard, which allows well-off customers to donate profits but doesn't actually serve low-income clients directly).
In particular, the following are services that are ripe for development - their market is already primed:
Income tracking, saving and investment services for microentrepreneurs
Financial literacy tools: a fundamental building block, which also increases the return for all other transactions and services provided
Simple credit card access: many sharing economy platforms require a credit card to participate, leaving out many people who could benefit - and thwarting inclusion
The economy, jobs, livelihoods and the role of finance are all undergoing significant shifts. The rise of microentrepreneurship, at scale, represents a new economic force. In order to unlock its full potential, we must develop services to address new needs. In doing so, we may also find a key to success amidst these shifts - and a world of new opportunity.

Is Wall Street finally turning on Amazon as Bezos magic fadesIs Wall Street finally turning on Amazon as Bezos magic fades?

Amazon.com Inc. Jeff Bezos Consumer Goods Industries House of Cards (tv program)
SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's once fairy-tale ride on Wall Street has hit its most jarring bump yet.
The company that for years enthralled investors with improbable growth and earned one of the technology sector's highest valuations drew widespread ire after a spectacular results letdown on Thursday.
Amazon missed expectations across the board - on margins, on its net loss and on revenue. An unaccountably poor 7 to 18 percent revenue growth forecast for the typically strongest holiday quarter was the final straw for some.
Coming just three months after a big letdown in July, the warning may represent a tipping point for investors who are already wary of a triple-digit price-earnings ratio and a persistent unwillingness to throttle back spending.
Investors are losing patience with Jeff Bezos’ game. Amazon stock swooned Thursday and it’s diving deeper today after the company reported weak earnings and predicted a dismal holiday season. ( Russ Mitchell )
"They're becoming much too distracted in all these other efforts" outside core businesses like online retailing and web services, said Matthew Benkendorf, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. Benkendorf unloaded his Amazon holdings a year ago and said he would be skeptical of future involvement even if the stock falls further.
"They are their own worst enemy to success," he said. "They really need to do some soul searching and get focused."
After some rough patches following the dotcom boom, CEO Jeff Bezos for years weaved a spell over Wall Street, riding a track record for upending the retail industry with Amazon's low-cost, speedy-delivery model. But Bezos has increasingly sought leading positions in Internet computing, digital media, and on-demand services.
8
Investors have given Bezos a lot of leeway based on past success, including the introduction of Amazon Web Services. The cloud-hosting and computing service started out as a low-cost option for cash-strapped startups but now vies successfully with IBM on government and corporate IT contracts.
But the company is entering a phase when many investors are expecting to see profit improvements, said Andrew Cupps, president of Cupps Capital Management in Chicago. Cupps now owns about 20,000 Amazon shares, down from around 30,000 earlier this year.
Amazon shares fell 8.3 percent on Friday to a year's low of $287.06, wiping out more than $12 billion in value.
Including Friday's plunge, Amazon's stock is down by nearly a third since January. Investors had begun questioning Bezos' growing spending on perceived side-projects since his company missed second-quarter profit targets.
Such long-term endeavors included Hollywood-style content and mobile devices to compete with Apple Inc and Google Inc . But while Amazon's original drama series "Transparent" has won rave reviews, the jury is still out on whether the company can consistently deliver Netflix-style hits like "House of Cards." Meanwhile, its "Fire" smartphone project appears in trouble. The company took a $170 million writedown in the third quarter, largely because of unsold phones. And last month, it slashed the phone's price (with a two-year AT&T contract) to 99 cents from $199.
That's why brokerage analysts previously enamored of Amazon's prospects struck a pessimistic note. At least 20 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock on Friday.
cComments
Amazon has built it's business on the backs of it's suppliers, who bear the cost of the absurdly generous return policy without any benefit. People think that you can order 10 pairs of shoes, have them sent to you and send back 9 that you don't want. Somehow they think this is...

"Even if Bezos is unconcerned about institutional investors' near term, he needs to care how the stock impacts his ability to attract and retain talent, particularly given the broadening tech expertise he needs," said Macquarie's Ben Schacter. "If the stock continues to get hit, we could even end up in a situation with activists calling for significant changes."
SICK OF IT
To be sure, short interest in Amazon remains low compared with most companies, suggesting that few investors deem the company to be in trouble. But it has increased over the past six months. About a year ago, 0.3 percent of the shares available for short bets were being used for such activity.
That's increased to about 1.6 percent as of Thursday, according to Markit, which tracks share lending.
And despite Friday's steep target-price cuts, no brokerage yet has a sell rating on the stock. Of the 44 analysts covering Amazon, 28 have a 'buy' or higher rating on the stock, though that's down from 32 three months ago.
Some still give Bezos the benefit of the doubt.
"I get it that people are frustrated that they've done a lot of different things that haven't helped them that much," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which will hold onto Amazon for now. "We'll hang in there a little longer to see if this thing will come to fruition for them."
Others have begun to waver. During Thursday's earnings call, analysts pressed Amazon on when it would see a payoff from heavy investments in China, devices and other areas. Wolfe Research analyst Aram Rubinson asked what metrics Amazon tracks "because it's a little hard to see any of it making positive progress."
"We are at the point where they're getting sick of it," said John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, who has been shorting Amazon for about two years. He took issue in particular with executives' assertions that they rely on cash flows as one of their prime performance metrics.
"They're using a cash conversion cycle – meaning, they take your money in today when you buy something, but they don't pay their supplier for 75 days. That is what creates cash flow and that's what everyone on the Street looks at," he said. "That's an entirely fallacious way of valuing a company."
"If Amazon were to exit China and use the savings to buy back stock, we could easily get far more optimistic," Rubinson said in a separate note. "But we are not holding our breath."

Black money case: Centre reveals names of three account holdersBlack money case: Centre discloses 8 more names to Supreme Court
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Centre today disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and Goa-based mining company, against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Pvt Ltd and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the Government.
The affidavit, filed days after the government came under attack from political rivals that it was chary of revealing names, said that these names have been received from French authorities and other countries.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under its scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal“.
The additional affidavit on the black money issue was filed today in furtherance of its affidavit recently when it had said that the names of account holders in foreign banks cannot be disclosed till there is evidence of tax evasion against them and prosecution is launched in India.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries''.
The list names Timblo Pvt Ltd and its directors Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. It was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its directors.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family Burmans said that the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income-Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added.
Lodhiya denied having a Swiss bank account. “We have already declared in the income-tax and there is nothing...we don’t have any Swiss account that is the only thing which I can say,” he said.
Radha Timbo declined to comment on her name being mentioned in the affidavit, saying she has to first study it before commenting.

HUL Shares Fall Most in Nearly 4 Years on Weak Outlook
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 16:44 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai:
Hindustan Unilever, controlled by consumer goods giant Unilever Plc, warned India's consumer spending will remain weak as the economy sags after its own profit rose 8 per cent on robust sales of soaps and detergents.
Net profit rose to Rs 988 crore for the three months to September 30 from Rs 914 crore a year earlier, Hindustan Unilever said in a statement on Monday. The company is two-thirds owned by its Anglo-Dutch parent, and plays a key role in Unilever's Asia operations.
Hindustan Unilever said fiscal second-quarter sales growth outstripped the broader market, but the profit number was exactly in line with an average of estimates from analysts polled by Reuters. The weak demand forecast helped send the company's shares sharply lower and pointed to future headaches for Unilever, already hit by slowdown in emerging markets which generates more than half its sales.
"We see the market continuing to remain soft. While we are conscious of this near-term concerns, we remain positive on a medium- to long-term outlook of our country's fast-moving consumer goods market," finance chief P.B. Balaji told reporters on a conference call.
Hindustan Unilever shares closed 5.1 per cent lower after the results, its biggest single-day fall since January 2011, with some dealers saying its unit sales volume growth of 5 per cent was below their expectations. The company has been hurt in recent quarters by weaker consumer demand in an economy that grew less than 5 per cent in the past two fiscal years.
Parent Unilever last week reported its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly five years, hit by persistent woes in Europe and the slower performance in emerging markets. It promised new, cheaper products and more cost cuts would help in raise profits.
Hindustan Unilever sales rose about 11 per cent, helped by soaps and detergent sales that grew at a double-digit percentage pace, the company said, along with skincare products.
As of last week, shares in Hindustan Unilever, valued at nearly Rs 27 crore, had risen nearly a third this year, outperforming the Nifty and the consumer goods index.

Black money: Centre s affidavit discloses three names to SC  no politician in first listCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
Dabur said that Pradip Burman’s account was opened when he was a non-resident Indian, Lodhya denied having a foreign bank account, and Radha Timblo said she needed to study the affidavit before reacting.
“The intention of the present government is clear and unambiguous. The government is keen to unearth black money held abroad and for that purpose it will use all diplomatic and legal means and also all investigative agencies to obtain information that can assist in such unearthing,” the Centre said in the affidavit.
Read: BJP calls black money affidavit historic, Cong claims blackmail
 
The Congress asked the Modi administration to refrain from “political titillation and playing games”, calling for disclosure of names of all those who had illicit money abroad.
“They are the government. They control ministries and departments. They should act....Do not play games,” said party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
Monday’s affidavit was filed by the income tax (I-T) department in response to a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking that the government take action to bring back India’s black money, estimated by some at nearly $500 billion.
Read:  Govt trying to protect politicians, businessmen, says Ram Jethmalani
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu will hear the black money case on Tuesday. The government is seeking that the court modify an earlier order insisting that all names be revealed; its view is that names should be disclosed only after prosecution is launched against the tax evaders.
The affidavit said that the prosecution against Burman began after the government received information against him from French authorities. It was silent on the sources of information on the others.
The government also informed the court that Switzerland had assured its cooperation, including reaching a treaty on automatic exchange of information with India. It said Swiss authorities had agreed to assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank documents.
HT had on last Wednesday reported the Centre was likely to tell the apex court names of people against whom strong evidence exists of stashing away black money in Swiss banks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is moving fast to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in slush funds or black money stashed abroad, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The government is building pressure particularly on Switzerland, seeking details of Indians who have parked unaccounted for money in the Alpine country's highly secretive banks. It has quickly implemented a Supreme Court directive to set up a high-powered special investigation team , headed by retired judge MB Shah, to look into the issue.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
According to PTI, the Union government told the apex court that Switzerland had indicated willingness to provide information on black money in cases probed by the income tax department.
Information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established, the government said.
Even though the government pointed out that it had no intention to withhold names of people who have stashed black money, it also said such names could not be disclosed unless there was prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.
The Centre also noted that every foreign account held by an Indian may not be illegal.
Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had told the Supreme Court that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
There were murmurs of protest within the ruling BJP that not disclosing names would hurt the party's image after it had made bringing back black money, a key issue in a general election that it won by a landslide. The Centre's stand also drew a strong response from the Congress, which accused it of hypocrisy.
Turning the tables on the Congress, finance minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the disclosing of names of people holding black money accounts will embarrass the opposition party.
The previous UPA government had submitted the names of 18 persons who had illegally stashed away money in Liechtenstein to the Supreme Court.
It had come under flak after it opposed the Supreme Court’s direction to set-up a special investigation team (SIT) and its review petition against the court’s verdict was dismissed. The SIT was finally set up by the Modi government within days of its taking over at the Centre.

Restrain from making provocative comments: Panel to KCRRestrain from making provocative comments: Panel to KCR
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
A three-member panel constituted by Press Council of India has recommended that Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao be directed to restrain himself from making provocative statements against journalists.
The committee comprising journalists Rajeev Ranjan Nag, K Amarnath and Krishna Prasad was constituted by PCI Chairperson Justice (retd) Markandey Katju to probe threats to the media in Telangana after certain remarks reportedly made by Rao were brought to the Council’s notice.
While listing its findings, the panel noted that “the Chief Minister of Telangana did make the statements attributed to him from a public platform that he would break the necks and bury media persons and that they should salute the Telangana people if they wish to live in Telangana.”
The Committee said that by making these statements from a public platform, the Telangana Chief Minister had violated the letter and spirit of Article 19 (1)(a)(e)and(g) which pertain to freedom of speech and expression, freedom to reside and settle in any part of India and practise any profession.
The Committee recommended that PCI and Central Government should impress upon Rao that “blatant threats to the media and media personnel violates the oath of office he took to protect and defend the Constitution of India and follow the rule of law.”
“The Chief Minister of Telangana should be directed to restrain himself from making provocative statements against journalists or in saluting and supporting organizations which seek to limit the flow of information to the people, on the basis of nativity or domicile status,” the panel recommended in its report.
The report of the three-member committee was placed before the Press Council today and adopted, sources said.
The committee report also stated that Telangana Government should be directed to take immediate action to create conditions and atmosphere where free and fair journalism can be practiced by print and electronic media without fear of retribution by the state or the “sword of business terrorism” by non-state actors.
It sought that all cases registered against journalists for participating in protest actions should be withdrawn or fast tracked.
Prompt action should be taken against the police official responsible for attacking journalists and roughing up women journalists at Hyderabad and Warangal, the committee recommended.
The photographers and videographers whose equipment was damaged during the police action should be compensated, it said. The State should not discriminate against the journalists on the grounds of their nativity, it added.
The committee has recommended that the state government should immediately take steps to enable MSOs to withdraw their blackout of channels TV 9 and ABN Andhra Jyothy in the interest of freedom of media and people’s right to know, as enshrined in the Constitution.
It also recommended that print and electronic media organisations must put in place sterner mechanisms for greater editorial scrutiny of public interest journalism.
The Committee, in its report stated that it sought appointments with Telangana Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police to elicit their views on the points of reference made to the committee.
They (Committee) waited on both days for the confirmation of appointments but to no avail, the report said.

Govt May Consider Raw Sugar Export Incentive After October 29Indian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
New Delhi: The government will consider extending the incentives for raw sugar exports after October 29 when leading cane growing states forecast their sugar output for the new season beginning October, two sources said on Monday.
"The cane commissioners of leading cane growing states will present their estimates on Oct. 29 and that will set the ball rolling for a decision on raw sugar export subsidy in 2014-15," a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
In February, government gave Rs 3,300 ($53.82) a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
However, a delay in extending the incentives for the new 2014-15 season had led to misgivings in some quarters that New Delhi was against giving subsidy for overseas shipments of raw sugar.

Stocks Open Lower After Poor News From EuropeMars Patrol, Please Phone Home
Nov. 13, 2006
By NED POTTER
Ten years ago -- 10 years last week, in fact -- a little ship named Mars Global Surveyor was launched from Florida, designed to spend two years in Martian orbit.
It hasn't been heard from in a week now, and the engineers at the Jet Propulsion Lab in California are finally getting worried.
Something on the ship apparently went awry when it sent a signal that it was having trouble orienting one of its solar panels to face the sun. A corrective command was radioed back.
The response was two days of silence, and then a carrier signal suggesting the ship had gone into "safe" mode -- essentially shutting down non-essential systems until its earthling masters could figure out what was wrong and send further orders. It's roughly analogous to your computer crashing, then giving one of those messages that says, "This system has recovered from a serious error. …"
That was Sunday a week ago, though, and for a ship that has endured the rigors of deep space for so long, time may finally be running out.
NASA's Deep Space Network has been sending signals to the orbiter every two hours. So far, silence.
"The spacecraft has many redundant systems that should help us get it back into a stable operation, but first we need to re-establish communications," said project manager Tom Thorpe in a NASA statement.
MGS was overshadowed in 1997 by the Mars Pathfinder lander -- you probably remember it, with its toaster-sized Sojourner rover -- that landed on the Martian surface, wandered among the rocks, took beautiful color panoramas, and captured the American imagination.
Global Surveyor quietly did more substantial things. It sent back detailed mapping images of almost all the Martian surface, shooting pictures of what, to many scientists, looked like gullies in the sides of craters. NASA theorized that relatively recently, geologically speaking, there may have been liquid water spurting from underground reservoirs into the Martian sand.
Three other orbiters and two other rovers have arrived safely from Earth since Mars Global Surveyor. They have more advanced cameras and more powerful onboard computers. NASA fully expected to end the MGS mission around 1999; instead, it's had to keep allocating extra money to staff this project that nobody expected would last this long.

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Gold prices dropped sharply at the domestic bullion market on the back of heavy unwinding by stockists and investors amid sluggish demand outlook.
Silver also plummeted owing to massive speculative sell—off, coupled with subdued industrial offtake.
The overall trading sentiment turned highly volatile as traders are very cautious and avoiding any long positions at this juncture due to ongoing uncertainty in global markets over the interest rates hike sooner than previously expected, a bullion dealer commented.
It is widely expected that the US Federal Reserve is going to announce the end of quantitative easing — a massive stimulus program introduced aftermath of the financial crisis when the Federal Open Market Committee concludes a two—day meeting on Wednesday.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) slumped by Rs 260 to conclude at Rs 27,055 per 10 grams from last Wednesday’s closing level of Rs 27,315.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) shed by Rs 255 to end at Rs 27,205 per 10 grams against Rs 27,460.
Silver (.999 fineness) tanked by Rs 460 to finish at Rs 39,015 per kg compared to Rs 39,475 previously.
On the global front, the shiny metal continued its downtrend and trading was almost flat at $1,230.86 an ounce in early European trade.

BJP to launch mobile  online membership drive on Nov1Print
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:10 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the first BJP leader to have his party membership renewed through a mobile text message, a first of its kind of measure introduced by the organisation, as it launches its membership drive from November 1.
Party General Secretary J P Nadda said BJP aims to “break all records” in enrolling new members in the six-month long drive as the party seeks to strengthen its base following its unprecedented victories in Lok Sabha elections as well as recent Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana.
For the first time, BJP has introduced the use of mobile and internet for people to become a party member. Anybody interested will have to call a mobile number, which would be disclosed on November 1, to start membership process, he said while addressing a press conference here.
“The emphasis would be on mobile and internet…Party President Amit Shah will make Prime Minister Modi the first member through SMS and Modi will make Shah the second member by similar method at the party headquarters on November 1,” Nadda said.
The party generally seeks to increase its members by 20 per cent during the drive, which is launched every sixth year, but this time it will work to break all previous records, Nadda said.
The party presently has 3.25 crore members, though not all of them are active workers.
The drive, however, will not be launched in poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, where it will begin only after the Assembly elections.
Enthused by the “connect” of its catchy slogans with masses during Lok Sabha elections, BJP has come out with new ones for the membership drive which include ‘sashakt Bhajpa, sashakt Bharat (strong BJP, strong India)’ and ‘saath aayein, desh banayein (come together, build the country)’.
BJP will hold three workshops in Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata on October 29, 30 and 31 and similar exercises would be held at the state-level as well, Nadda said.
While Bangalore would cater to south and west Indian states besides the UTs, Delhi would host central India states and Kolkata the eastern states. States will start membership drive from November 2.

New Zicom CCTV kit allows surveillance fromsmartphonesUsers can access the CCTV footage from almost any computer connected to the Internet and even from smartphones.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:41 pm
Zicom has launched its new CCTV Surveillance Kit that allow users to monitor their home or business premises from their smartphones. Priced at Rs 14,300, this surveillance kit comes with two IR dome cameras (720 TVL), one digital video recorder (4 Channel DVR), three power adapters, one remote control to use with the DVR and four BNC connectors.
All cameras are equipped with infrared Array LED (IR) sensors which gets activate automatically in low-light or no-light situations to allow you to see up to 30 meters (95 feet) away and deactivate once lighting conditions are brighter to allow.
The digital video recorder uses H.264 compression to record video simultaneously from all cameras. Two more cameras can be added to this kit at a later stage, should the need arise.
Users can access the CCTV footage from almost any computer connected to the Internet and even from smartphones. Zicom claims that the kit can be easily installed without any expert help.

Indian startup aims to sell portable washing machines at Rs1 500Venus mini portable washing machine can be mounted on any plastic bucket to wash all types of laundry.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:35 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 8:39 pm
A Mumbai-based startup is looking forward to manufacture a washing machine for people who cannot afford to buy a regular washing machine or do not have enough space in their house. This pocket-friendly machine is obviously not like any other regular machine washing. It appears like a big electronic hand blender which can be mounted on any plastic bucket to wash all types of laundry.
“The simplicity of design will enable us to make this machine at a very low price – if mass manufactured. Making this device available in the market for an affordable price for the poor families in the third world will help millions of women who presently are forced to wash clothes by hand,” said Piyush Agarwalla, founder of Vimbas Navrachna, the group which is manufacturing Venus mini portable washing machine.
The project went live on crowd funding website Indiegogo on October 13. The Vimbas Navrachna team has to generate US$ 50,000 by December 12 to start the mass production of Venus. “Our aim is sell the Venus machine for Rs 1,500 or less if possible. Every contribution will help bring us closer to realizing our dream of mass manufacturing this device and selling at an affordable price,” said Agarwalla.
With a plastic bucket of 25 litres capacity (minimum 20 litres bucket), users can wash up to 2.5 kilograms of load per five minutes wash cycle. The Venus can be useful for people living alone like students, bachelors, working men & women, according to the project’s Indiegogo page .
The team even has plans to manufacture a direct current (DC) version of the Venus if they exceed the funding goal. The DC version can be operated with the help of batteries making it ideal for campers.

Four nurses who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first U.S. patient diagnosed with Ebola talked to '60 Minutes' in an exclusive interview. They gave new details of his care, and how the hospital handled the case.

Automatically Generated Transcript (may not be 100% accurate)
00:02  New guidelines are expected to be announced in the coming
00:05  days for health care workers returning from Ebola stricken areas. The
00:09  decision comes as governors and several states announced over the weekend
00:13  they were instituting quarantines for aid workers returning from West Africa.
00:17  Critics say that might prevent health care workers from traveling to
00:20  help fight Ebola outbreak at its source. Meanwhile Texas health Presbyterian
00:25  Hospital in Dallas. In the staff who work here have endured
00:29  harsh criticism for weeks for their handling of the first case
00:33  of people in the US. But nurses who treated so called
00:36  patient zero Thomas Eric Duncan paint a different picture. Four of
00:40  them sat down with sixty minutes to share their side of
00:43  the story their fight to save his life. Steady or rose
00:47  said before Duncan was even diagnosed she feared she was witnessing
00:51  Ebola but didn't allow that feared apparel letter. As a nurse.
00:55  I understand the risk that I take every day come to
00:58  work pays no different than any other patient provided careful. So.
01:04  I wasn't going to say no I'm not going to care
01:07  for him. But rose went on to describe that whether intentionally
01:10  or not Duncan misled them on as possible exposure to Ebola.
01:14  They asked him have you been in contact with anyone who's
01:17  been. Sick. He said just now despite that the nurses that
01:23  everyone who care for Duncan volunteered to be there. And there
01:26  when volunteers every one was a volunteer and we also began
01:29  her respiratory pain he. Physicians arsonists. The nurses say they were
01:34  by Duncan's side not only giving him the best medical care
01:38  possible but holding his hand and comforting him. He died ten
01:42  days after being admitted to the hospital that was divorced him.
01:50  This weekend. That we care for. That far just as hard
01:55  with us. It's just kind. This is Stanley couldn't be there.
02:04  And we were the last three people to see him alive.
02:06  The nurses also said while it's true the hospital was unprepared
02:10  to deal with Ebola it's partly because the US as a
02:13  whole wasn't ready. They cited unclear instructions on protective gear in
02:17  the early stages. Ten nurses who contracted the buyers from Duncan
02:21  amber Benson and Nina Fam have both since recovered. We believe
02:25  in the power of prayer. He doesn't have so many people

Tech pioneer Ken Coleman talks diversity

Ken Coleman Special Advisor to Andreessen Horowitz The Venture Capital Firm talks on diversity in the technology field.

PALO ALTO, Calif. – As a pioneering African-American in the land of tech, Ken Coleman has earned the respect of venture capitalists and the friendship of presidents.
And yet as a black man in America, Coleman shudders when police lights flash.
"When I'm stopped I want to say, 'I'm not what you think, I've got an MBA, I live in Los Altos Hills, I own a home in Maui.' I want to say that," says Coleman, 69. "Because I know through experience that person might have an image of what I might be and view me as dangerous. And to not feel that way would be foolish."
The duality of such an existence would enrage many. But Coleman has guided his personal and professional life with a simple philosophy: "You will experience lots of racism and prejudice. But you can't look under the bed for it, because then it becomes an obstacle to your success."
That mantra saw the son of a Centralia, Ill., maid and a heater-factory laborer graduate from Ohio State University and become one of the first African-Americans in Silicon Valley when he joined Hewlett-Packard in the '70s as a human resources exec.
Leadership roles at Silicon Graphics followed, where Coleman hired a summer intern by the name of Ben Horowitz, co-founder of VC powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. The firm recently named Coleman as a special adviser with a mission to both counsel young tech company founders and spearhead a networking effort aimed at increasing the ranks of minorities in tech.
Challenge to tech companies: Join 10,000 Innovators Fund
In a blog post noting Coleman's appointment, Horowitz called Coleman his "personal guardian angel." But Coleman's wingspan will need to expand as Silicon Valley grapples with the pressing issue of employee diversity. In recent months, furor over the topic has grown as firms such as Yahoo, Google and Apple divulge staffing numbers with glaring minority under-representation.
USA TODAY's ongoing coverage of this topic has reported marked pay gaps in tech, where Hispanic, Asian and black programmers often earn $16,000, $8,000 and $4,000 less, respectively, than white counterparts, according to the American Institute for Economic Research.
High-tech pay gap: Minorities earn less in skilled jobs
A recent guest columnist, Charles Hudson, an 18-year Silicon Valley veteran and a partner at SoftTechVC, noted that he is such a rare bird that "I've often been confused for everyone from Google's (chief legal officer) David Drummond to MC Hammer."
But as one of around 500 leading African-Americans in tech today, Hudson is positively surrounded by peers when compared to Coleman's debut decades ago. Joining HP after a stint in Korea with the Air Force, where he worked on early computers, Coleman was determined early on to increase the ranks of blacks in tech.
"We had a very aggressive recruiting program (at HP) at the collegiate level, and we did a good job of eliminating the risk concerns many people had," he says, noting that the advice he still dispenses to any founder who asks is make sure your HR department is staffed by the very minorities you're trying to recruit.
“I don't think diversity should be a deficit model. It's an opportunity model. If I know something you don't know about the marketplace because of my staff, I will beat you. And that's something every company out there should be concerned about.”
Ken Coleman
"Diversity doesn't happen naturally," he says. "Social systems, which a company is, want to reproduce themselves. If a founder went to Harvard, they'll want to replicate that." He adds that the argument for breaking that habit is dollars and cents.
"I don't think diversity should be a deficit model," he says. "It's an opportunity model. If I know something you don't know about the marketplace because of my staff, I will beat you. And that's something every company out there should be concerned about."
'DONE WELL BY ANY MEASURE'
Coleman is the first to say he's "done well by any measure" thanks to his career in tech, which saw him serve as COO of early Web giant Silicon Graphics and today finds him chairman of data analytics firm Saama Technologies. And yet in his mind a notable asterisk accompanies those laurels.
"The real question is, what might I have done or been if I had been white?" he says, not bitterly but rather with his ever-present smile and deep laugh. He recounts how white HP peers were asked to join company boards far earlier than he was.
Coleman's solution? He accepted the numerous requests that came his way to join non-profit boards eager for diversity, "and then just worked it hard to show people how I could be helpful as an adviser to a company. There was no other option."
"Ken has been a pioneering figure in Silicon Valley, but what most don't realize is how many careers he has helped, pulling people up even if they never knew it," says Price Cobbs, a longtime Coleman friend and corporate consultant who wrote Black Rage, a seminal '60s text that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
"What Ferguson (the August fury over the death of black teen Michael Brown) reawakened particularly in Ken and my generation is a desire to reconnect with communities we're no longer in," says Cobbs.
For Coleman, that means putting a greater emphasis on reading and STEM subjects that are gateways to jobs in the tech industry. Coleman also is quick to stress that "more than 50% of jobs in technology don't require technology skills," adding that his current advisor, Pinterest CEO Ben Silberman, has a graphics background.
"Look, he says, "I don't believe white hiring managers lie in bed thinking of ways not to hire black people. The issue is, most hiring managers are trying to reduce risk. And sometimes your instinct is, 'You're different than me, so that's risky.' But that's not the right way to think about things."
Today, America is a nation of 320 million that is roughly 70% white, 15% Hispanic, 11% African American and 4% Asian. Someday soon, Coleman believes, this country's technology workforce can and should break down along similar lines, compared to the current 2% of blacks and Hispanics in tech.
"Do I believe this is critical to the country? Yes," says Coleman. "I know that if the tech companies in this valley put their mind to it, they can put a dent in it. We have some of the smartest minds around. And my avocation is simply to have whatever impact on this issue that I can."

Rupee Ends Flat at 61.30; Focus on US Fed Meet
Reuters | Updated On: October 27, 2014 18:04 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The rupee closed little changed on Monday as improved sentiment from upbeat US data and smaller-than-feared capital shortfalls at European banks were offset by weaker local shares and caution about recent gains in the domestic currency.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.30/31 per dollar, little changed from its Wednesday's close of 61.31/32. Markets were closed on Thursday and Friday for holidays.
All eyes are now the Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday. The US central bank is expected to end its government bond purchases, while giving accompanying assurances that it will respond if a global downturn threatens the US economy.
Analysts add any indication of earlier-than-expected U.S. rate hikes could hit emerging market currencies. The rupee is up around 0.77 percent so far this year, thanks to $35 billion in foreign investments into debt and stocks.
"If the Fed gives out clear signals that a rate hike may not be very far away, then we can expect some pressure on the rupee," said Chintan Karnani, chief analyst at Insignia Consultants, a currency risk advisory firm in New Delhi.
Sentiment improved as Asian currencies were lifted after upbeat U.S. home sales data and after the European Central Bank said fewer than one in five of the euro zone's top lenders failed stress tests at the end of last year.
But gains in the rupee were kept in check as domestic shares faltered, ending a five-session gain.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.59, while the three-month contract was at 62.18.

Dozens of Nigerian girls abducted by BokoHaramhis Monday May. 12, 2014 file image taken from video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network, shows the alleged missing girls abducted from the northeastern town of Chibok. (Source: AP)
By: AP | Maiduguri | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:43 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 9:00 pm
Dozens of girls and young women are being abducted by Islamic extremists in northeast Nigeria, raising doubts about an announced cease-fire and the hoped-for release of 219 schoolgirls held captive since April.
Thirty teenage girls and boys have been kidnapped since Wednesday from villages around Mafa town, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, the local government chairman Shettima Maina told reporters.
Escaping residents said Boko Haram insurgents abducted 80 girls and women from neighboring Adamawa state on Oct. 18.
Older women in the group were released the following day and said the extremists kept about 40 younger women and girls, according to the residents. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the insurgents.
On Oct. 17, Nigeria’s military announced a cease-fire had been agreed with Boko Haram. He ordered his troops to immediately comply.
But the insurgents have launched several attacks since then and on Friday a multinational force including troops from Nigeria and Niger wrested back control of a town held by Boko Haram on the western shores of Lake Chad.
Witnesses and a security official said more than 20 insurgents were killed in fierce fighting at Abadam in which the Nigerian Air Force bombed occupied posts and ground troops opened fire after which the insurgents fled.
Boko Haram had hoisted their black and white flag in Abadam a week before, when they killed at least 40 civilians and forced hundreds in the farming community to flee across the border into Niger, according to some residents who escaped to Maiduguri, 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the east.
Also last week, a car bomb exploded in a bus station in Azare, a town in north-central Bauchi state. Five people were killed and 12 hospitalized with injuries, according to police spokesman Deputy Superintendent Haruna Muhammad. No one claimed responsibility but suspicion immediately fell on Boko Haram, which in December 2011 bombed Azare’s police station and several banks.
The continued fighting and abductions raise questions about the cease-fire. Ten days after the announcement, Boko Haram has yet to indicate that it has agreed to a truce.
Officials had said the cease-fire would lead to the speedy release of the 219 girls kidnapped from a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok on April 15.
Abducted girls are subjected to horrific treatment, Human Rights Watch said in a new report Monday, quoting escapees who described forced marriages and rapes, forced conversions to Islam, forced labor and forced participation in attacks.
The insurgents mainly target Christians and girls who go to school, said Human Rights Watch.
More than 500 girls and women have been kidnapped by Boko Haram since 2009, according to an estimate by the New York-based rights group. Unknown scores of young men also have been kidnapped and forced to join the extremists as continued…

V-shaped stock rebound catches bears offsidesV-shaped stock rebound catches bears off guard

The stock market’s sharp decline earlier this month was followed by a classic V-shaped rebound rally, catching many investors off guard. But can the rally last?
Last week, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rallied more than 4%, posting its best weekly gain of the year — and ending a four-week losing streak. In late-morning trading Monday the S&P 500 was down 7 points or 0.35%, to 1958.
But many investors did not expect the large-company stock index to bounce back that fast or that far, after tumbling more than 9% from its intraday high to its intraday low earlier this month amid fears of a global growth slowdown, Ebola and other market headwinds.
“If you blinked, you missed it,” is the way Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group described last week’s flash rally, which was powered by strong corporate earnings reports. Hickey’s firm supplied an intraday stock chart from Oct. 1 to Oct. 21 to show just how violent the S&P 500’s V-shaped upside reversal has been:
The S&P 500 has delivered a V-shaped recovery since its Oct. 15 intraday low. (Chart: Bespoke Investment Group)
The question now is: Can the rally last?
Citing historical data of how stocks have reacted after similar drops and sharp rebounds, the answer is there’s a good chance the rally could have legs, notes Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Lee’s research notes that the S&P 500’s current pullback from Sept. 19 to Oct. 15 was 9.8% from it intraday high to its intraday low. Following the past 49 times the S&P 500 has dipped at least 7% (but did not fall into a bear market, or a 20%-plus drop), more than half of the corrections ended after a decline of 10%. But he stresses that “markets either fall 10% or less or they continue to fall much deeper, or 20%-ish.” The fact this current pullback ended at less than 10% is a good sign, history suggests.
Historical performance data also supports the argument that stocks can rebound more than skeptics believe.
“The faster the decline, the faster the recovery,” Lee told clients in a report.
In terms of timing, Lee’s work shows that the market recovery normally takes 1.4 days for every day of a decline. So after a 10-day decline, markets normally get back to even 14 days later.
His work also shows that more than 50% of the time the S&P 500 tends to be 11% to 17% higher eight weeks after the correction bottoms.
“90% of bull market bottoms are V shaped,” Lee said.
In the chart below supplied by Fundstrat, you will notice that the median return eight weeks after a market bottom is 11%, but more often than not the gains are much larger.

Chiquita bananas
179 CONNECT 39 TWEET 48 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE
The battle for Chiquita  brands is finally finished.
The banana kingpin Monday agreed to be sold to two Brazilian companies for about $681 million.  The action comes just days after Chiquita Brands International's shareholders soundly rejected plans to merge with Fyffes, an Irish importer of fresh fruit.   For weeks, a corporate battle has been waged over who would walk off with Chiquita, a brand name that has huge market value.
In an era when fresh is increasingly critical to consumers, Chiquita sells fresh produce under the Chiquita and Fresh Express brand names, which are both widely recognized globally.  Its annual revenues exceed $3 billion, and it employs about 20,000 people in nearly 70 countries.
Shares of Chiquita jumped 1.45% or 21 cents to $14.37 in early-morning trading Monday.
Investment firm Safra Group and juice company Cutrale Group will purchase Chiquita for $14.50 per share, a 2% premium to its Friday closing price of $14.16, Chiquita said.
"This transaction demonstrates our board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value and underscores the significant progress Chiquita has achieved over the past couple of years in our financial and operational performance," said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita's CEO, in a statement.
The companies put the transaction's value at about $1.3 billion, including the assumption of Chiquita's debt.
One analyst likes the deal and says that it's a continuation of the recent trend of branded food deals. "As consumers continue to eat more healthy foods and expand the amount of fruits and vegetables they eat, the opportunity to expand the offerings under these brand names is significant," says Greg Wank, chairman of Food & Beverage Services Group at Anchin, Block & Anchin.
This deal bodes well for the produce industry, which is typically seen as more generic and less branded, says Wank.
Chiquita's board unanimously approved the deal, which is targeted to close by the end of the year or in early 2015. Chiquita will become a subsidiary of the Cutrale-Safra group once the transaction is complete.
On Friday Chiquita and Fyffes PLC gave notice to terminate their proposed merger agreement after Chiquita's stockholders didn't approve a revised transaction agreement between the two companies during a special shareholders meeting. The proposed agreement with Fyffes was an all-stock deal, with the companies planning to incorporate in Dublin to take advantage of lower tax rates. Chiquita is based in Charlotte.
Once Chiquita's shareholders rejected the proposed deal with Fyffes, Chiquita said that it planned to enter talks with Safra and Cutrale on their competing offer of $681 million. Chiquita had received the $681 million bid from the pair last week after previously rejecting offers from the duo. The prior offer from Safra and Cutrale was $14 per share. They had bid $13 per share in August.
The Fyffes transaction, which was rejected, was structured as a corporate tax inversion — a procedure in which a domestic firm reincorporates in a lower-tax nation overseas in a bid to cut its future U.S. tax bills.
Washington has been split along party lines on corporate inversion. President Obama in July said U.S. firms that pursue the legal transactions were unfairly "gaming the system." Congressional Democrats largely agreed. Republicans, however, argued the issue should be considered as part of a broader revision of the federal tax code, including a reduction on the 35% top tax rate the U.S. imposes on companies total earnings at home and internationally.
Chiquita was founded by Capt. Lorenzo Dow Baker in 1870 and almost a decade ago purchased the Fresh Express brand.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is snuffing out smoking in its offices and buildings.
The nation's second-biggest tobacco company informed employees Wednesday that beginning next year, the use of traditional cigarettes, cigars or pipes will no longer be permitted at employee desks or offices, conference rooms, hallways and elevators. Lighting up already is prohibited on factory floors and in cafeterias and fitness centers.
The no-smoking policy will go into effect once Reynolds builds indoor smoking areas for those still wanting to light up indoors, spokesman David Howard said.
"We believe it's the right thing to do and the right time to do it because updating our tobacco use policies will better accommodate both non-smokers and smokers who work in and visit our facilities," Howard said. "We're just better aligning our tobacco use policies with the realities of what you're seeing in society today."
While Reynolds will no longer allow smoking, it will allow the use of smokeless tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, moist snuff and pouches of finely milled tobacco called snus (pronounced "snoose").
The company also will allow the use of Eclipse, a cigarette made by Reynolds that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit by a lighter. First released in the mid-1990s, Eclipse is in limited distribution and one of the top-selling brands in the cafeteria at the company's Winston-Salem, North Carolina, headquarters.
The percentage of Reynolds' 5,200 employees that smoke is in line with the smoking rate in the U.S. That is about 18 percent of adults, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
Through its subsidiaries, Reynolds American also makes Pall Mall cigarettes, Grizzly smokeless tobacco and Vuse-branded electronic cigarettes.
Altria Group Inc., the Richmond, Virginia-based owner of the nation's biggest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, doesn't allow smoking on factory floors and in places like elevators or hallways, said spokesman David Sylvia. Employees with separate offices can smoke in them, but otherwise the company has designated smoking areas in office buildings, conference areas and cafeterias, he said.

New Microscope Allows Scientists To View The World Like Never Beforereddit
You've never seen cells up-close quite like this.
Developed at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a powerful new microscope can record the activity of living cells, molecules, and embryos in 3D and in real-time. Just check out the video above that shows a HeLa cell dividing , and prepare for your mind to be blown.
The microscope uses a technique called lattice light-sheet microscopy , which involves scanning a cell with ultra-thin sheets of light . This process allows scientists to collect high-resolution images while minimizing light damage to the cells. The research was described in a paper published online in the journal Science on Oct. 24.
"There are many cells you could look at forever in 3D ," Dr. Eric Betzig, a physicist, inventor, and engineer at the institute who developed the microscope, said in a written statement. "We know what the microscope can offer in terms of the imaging, but I think there are a lot of applications we haven't even thought of yet."
For instance, observing the intricacies in the way cells behave may allow scientists to better understand the causes and development of cancer and how different congenital problems develop, Betzig told The Washington Post.
Betzig won the Nobel Prize in chemistry this year for the development of another powerful microscope technology called super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 25:  
Google Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Page has put Sundar Pichai, one of his key lieutenants, in charge of the Internet company's products.
The India-born executive will have oversight over products such as search, maps, Google+, commerce, advertising and infrastructure, according to a Google spokesman. Six executives who previously reported to Page, including the heads of research, social media and search, will now report to Pichai, according to Re/code, which first reported the change on Friday, citing an internal memo.
The change will free Page from having as many direct reports and product units to oversee so that he can better focus on "the bigger picture," according to the Re/code report, which also cited anonymous sources.
YouTube, Google's popular video website, will be unaffected by the new structure and will continue to report directly to Page.
The move puts Pichai, 42, in charge of many of Google's main services, including its core search and advertising units, which generate the bulk of the company's revenue.
Google, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has experienced several high-level management changes this year. Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora departed unexpectedly in July to become Vice-Chairman of Japan's SoftBank Corp and was replaced by longtime Google executive Omid Kordestani. Vic Gundotra, the head of Google's social networking services, left in April.
Pichai, who has risen rapidly through the ranks since joining Google in 2004, is viewed by many industry insiders as potential CEO material. In addition to his duties overseeing the various products, Pichai will continue to lead Google's Android and Chrome software operating systems as well as Google's Apps business.

How Sophia Broke the Rules for Advice Based Businessesreddit
I have wanted to interview Sophia Bera for quite a while because I love her story, and I want to share it with all of you.
You see Sophia completely smashes the myth that advice based business has to be done face to face -- and in particular that financial advice has to be face to face -- and cannot be done online.
You see I have been arguing that for quite some time -- and many people I know, and respect, have told me that it was impossible.
But, then along comes Sophia Bera, and she is living proof that it is possible. Sophia is the Founder of Gen Y Planning.
Not only that, Sophia goes another step forward and demonstrates how she has built a recurring revenue business -- and with clients that do NOT have assets under management. How clever is that!
You see, Sophia works virtually with her clients, the majority of whom are in their 20s and 30s -- a target market frequently ignored because, generally, they don't have assets under management.
Sophia has built her business on that target market.
In the interview I did with Sophia, which you can listen to here , you can hear how Sophia manages her business fully online, how she breaks the other myth of not being able to build strong relationships virtually, and how her clients find her online!
If you want to listen to someone who has taken the traditional approach to advice based business and turned it on its head, then listen to this interview with Sophia .
Sophia is someone I admire and respect, and I am thrilled to share her story with you today.
Check it out here .

Navigating Your Career Through Breast Cancerreddit
I was recently having a conversation with a friend about how much the world has changed since the global financial crisis of 2008.  The ways in which we spend have changed.  We have different attitudes about debt, and even though the job market has improved, millions continue to struggle as wages have not caught up.
Somehow, we began to talk about the dissolution of the financial giant Lehman Brothers.  Some argue that was the moment that signaled life as we know it had changed.  My friend, like many people, lamented how 'corporate greed' has destroyed the world.
I didn't take on that discussion, but I did share with her a story about a woman I know who worked at Lehman Brothers.  I felt the story was a good illustration of why we should not cast anything as 'all good' or 'all bad.'
The story comes to mind as we turn an important spotlight on breast cancer this month.
Meet Hannah
In June of 2005, Hannah Burns was Managing Director of Corporate Communications at Lehman Brothers, and fulfilling one of her major responsibilities: Getting the company's quarterly earnings results out to the public.  As the numbers were being released, Hannah set-up a meeting with her boss -- he believed she was going to update him on the media's coverage of the data.  Instead, she had to deliver a far more difficult story.
"I've got good news, and bad news," she told him.  "The good news is that it's early and very treatable, the bad news is that I have breast cancer."
Burns describes herself as a private person, but she went straight to her bosses' office when her doctor delivered the news over the phone.  "Being in my function I can't just disappear and not tell anybody.  I just wanted to get it off of my chest and move on.  It was an easy conversation.  He was incredibly sympathetic, and shocked."
The fact that this Mother of two daughters had her disease detected early had her believing that she would be able to 'get it off of her chest and move on.'  The next few months, however, would prove to be a physical and emotional challenge that she could not have imagined.
Three weeks later, there was the surgery, which was followed by a rigorous four month period of chemotherapy, and bone marrow shots, and then seven weeks of radiation.
In a feat that can be described as nothing short of heroic, aside from a one week recovery period after surgery, Hannah only missed one day of work throughout her entire four months of treatments.
"In addition to wanting to teach my daughters a lesson on how to work through adversity, the firm was so supportive that I wanted to do my absolute best to show my gratitude," says Burns.  "The firm said do whatever you need to do to get well.  Knowing you've got that support is half the battle."
Not only did Lehman provide Burns with inspiration, but the firm also gave her the flexibility to work through her challenge.  She had her treatments on Wednesdays, did not have to return to work, and she was able to come in late on Thursday's. Burns says her worst side effects set in on Friday afternoons, and Lehman allowed her to leave in the afternoon. The company also provided her with car service to and from the office throughout the entire ordeal.
If This Happens to You
One of the many things Hannah taught me was that not everyone -- not even corporate giants like Lehman Brothers -- has all the answers. Hannah simply had to tap into her courage and give the company a blueprint to help her best navigate this challenge. Otherwise, her boss may not have known what to do and there may have been a different result.
If you find yourself trying to work through this situation, here are some tips that may help:
Talk to your doctor before your employer: You need to know what you can expect physically and psychologically, so that you can be clear about your needs to your employer.  That way you can come to your boss with a clear plan of action. Hannah, for example, purposely scheduled her treatments on Wednesday's. That way she would have the weekend to recover when the worst of the side effects hit about 48 hours later.  She knew she would need Friday afternoons off.
"Work is a very important part of a women's life, and if she can continue to work, she's going to do better, " says Dr. Ruth Oratz, reknowned oncologist and associate professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine. "But they need to be flexible, and realize that they may have to make some changes."  Oratz adds that work is not going to be an option for all women.
Be true to yourself when it comes to talking to your boss: "How much you tell your boss depends on your own personal style," according to Kate Sweeney at Cancer and Careers.  "If you have an open relationship, be open.  If not, just present the situation, and tell them what you will need."  Also, if you have an open relationship with your co-workers, you will likely want to share details of your recovery.  If you're more private you may just want to say "I'm doing fine," and don't be afraid to leave it at that."
Find out what your company has done with employees in this situation in the past: This is particularly true when it comes to leave and benefits.  You are trying to determine if former policies will work for you. Supposed, for example, you want to work from home, yet you find out this has not been allowed. You want to be able to bring that up to your boss, as something you will need. Maybe your company has never been in this situation before.  You need to find out if it is going to be up to you to guide them, when it comes to helping you remain as productive as possible.
Know your legal rights: In the U.S., for example, people with cancer are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act which gives you rights in the workplace.  In addition, protection is provided under the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year.  The weeks do not have to be taken consecutively. Human resource departments can be a great resource when it comes to knowing your legal rights.  They can also be of great help with your insurer. A company calling on your behalf will likely have a lot more leverage with an insurance firm than you calling as an individual.
Pay attention to how you feel: If you take time off for treatments, you can expect to have a lot of mixed emotions as you transition from patient back to employee.  If you don't feel psychologically up to speed, you may want to seek out some counseling, or attend workshops and seminars to refresh your work skills. Physically, take a look at your workspace.  Tell your employer if it needs to be redesigned with something like back support.

India worlds 4th largest steel maker at 62.41 MT in Jan-SeptREUTERS A worker welds steel bars during construction of the roof. File photo.
TOPICS
iron and steel
With 62.41 million tonnes output, India remains the world’s fourth largest steel producer in the first nine months of the current year, preceded by China, Japan and the US.
World Steel Association (WSA) data showed India’s steel production grew by 1.8 per cent, the second highest among the top four steel producing nations, during the January-September period from 61.27 MT in the same period last year.
India has been the world’s fourth largest steel maker for the last four years. The order is likely to remain unchanged in current year too, an industry expert said.
During the first nine months, China produced 618 MT steel which is a little more than half of world’s total production at 1,231 MT.
China logged 2.3 per cent growth during the period. But its steel production remained static in September, as per data revealed by WSA, at 67.5 MT when compared with the same month last year.
Japan remained the remote second with 83.1 MT production during the nine-month period clocking just 0.8 per cent growth over 82.4 MT production in the same period last year.
The US stood at the third spot with 66.33 MT production compared to 65.3 MT output during the January—September period of the last year.
Though the growth in world’s third largest producing nation grew by 1.6 per cent during the period, in September steel production in the US fell by 0.1 per cent over the same month last year.
Russia and South Korea vie for the fifth slot with 53.4 MT and 53.2 MT output in the first nine months of the current year.
The balance is, however, tilted towards the Asian nation as it logged 9.4 per cent growth, highest among major steel producing nations, in steel production during the period compared to Russia’s 3.1 per cent.

Urgent and transformative changes to the civil services are a must to enable successful economic reforms
October 26, 2014:  
All secretaries to the Government of India should have received ‘outstanding’ grading over their last five annual appraisals, by and large, otherwise they won’t be eligible to claim the coveted title. As one babu quipped, if all of them are ‘outstanding’, why is their performance so average as evident from the poor results in many cases? Granted, truly excellent officers have to work with average colleagues and an archaic system, and cannot really work as lone rangers.
This babu friend had unfortunately got ‘Very Good’ once and that meant his death knell in terms of his dream of becoming a hallowed secretary or even an additional secretary to the GoI. Usually, in civil services, promotions happen automatically. Some selection criterion does exist in the Central Government, but merit is not considered in its proper dimensions.
There are counter arguments to this — many say favouritism can allow sycophantic officers to go higher than the deserving ones. In the armed forces, it is said, promotions take place mainly on merit and officers get weeded out even before they retire. Efforts to bring in the same system in the civil services have not been successful and that is needed if economic and governance reforms have to succeed.
Perhaps the establishment is inured to the Peter Principle, that a person reaches his level of incompetence sooner or later.
Lacking a system
Consequently, we get an average administration which is good at pushing files. Many babus earn plaudits for not taking any decisions rather than for taking decisions because of the fear of vilification and/or punishment.
In my 30 years of public advocacy, I have come across a variety of babus to whom the Peter Principle applies without doubt, but the system protects them from being weeded out. And many of them, aided by a strong fraternity, end up in some sinecure post for five more years after retirement. This makes a mockery of the system and the nation has to bear the burden.
On the other hand, if one looks at the armed forces, a person can rise to the level of colonel or captain in the navy or group captain in the air force after 23 years of service. But that may be at the end of his career, unless he has successfully undergone training and promotion tests for going up. Unlike the forces to which people enter via specialised training centres, civil servants can be from any discipline but have to qualify through the UPSC exams. Thus we also find doctors, scientists, engineers, management graduates and social scientists who end up in the service that requires general skills and a good IQ.
Misplaced skills
The investment in specialised skills is lost to the society. Also, other aspirants to such an education also lose the opportunity since the seats are limited in good professional institutions.
Besides, the civil services have always opposed the lateral entry of good professionals in overnment. For example, in 1959, an industrial management pool was created to engage successful private sector executives in public enterprises. Many joined, sacrificing their compensation packages, and have risen up in the Government. But recruitment took place only for one year and the system was pulled back, ostensibly to protect the civil services.
Nearly 200 civil servants have been occupying posts in public enterprises since then. This is not to say that exceptional econocrats or even scientists have not held senior positions in the Government but they were exceptions. How does all this apply in Narendra Modi’s push for Make in India? Hugely. Unless civil service reforms are carried out, doing business in India will remain difficult in spite of tomes of studies and reports, and platitudes.
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Veerappa Moily had gone in depth into civil service reforms to make it more efficient, but the recommendations are yet to be implemented fully. Some simple steps have been taken but they have not been able to address the structural issues.
Need urgent reform
Recommendations have been made to mandate mid-career training as a promotion criterion. By and large, civil servants having worked for nearly 25 years are being sent, rather than phased out into 10, 15 and 20 years service.
Having interacted with many, one does not find any significant change in them or their attitudes after they have come back. Sometimes, one sees an officer working in a particular discipline being sent abroad for specialised training but coming back and spending the rest of his career in jobs where that training will never help.
The Second ARC had recommended many armed forces-like changes in the civil services. This included the establishment of a National Institute for Public Administration to run specialised degree courses for aspirants, but conceded that aspirants from other disciplines may also be admissible after doing a bridge course. Capacity building was also defined in depth and it was suggested that for every promotion a mandatory training was needed.
Most importantly, the Second ARC also recommended that officers be put into specific domains, based on their academic qualifications, experience and aptitude, so that “the most suitable for the post is selected”.
A similar practice was also followed under the ICS. The Second ARC had also suggested that there should be competition for senior positions, but that has translated into jockeying rather than being done through a logical process.
Among many sterling suggestions, the Second ARC had also recommended lateral entry for positions of additional secretary and above, which does not exist in the armed forces. Another critical suggestion was borrowing from the armed forces’ practice of weeding out officers after 20 years of service and suggesting that appointments should only be made for 20 years and their continuation would depend on their performance.

Blending poetry and processorsThe Innovators, Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster
This book on the digital revolution logs you into an enchanting world of craziness and camaraderie
October 26, 2014:  
In 1801, Frenchman Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented the automated loom, which changed the fortunes of the silk weaving industry. The loom was a scientific wonder. It showed that the whole weaving exercise could be ‘programmable’. Until then, looms had followed a manual process: they created a pattern by using hooks to lift selected warp threads, and then a rod pushed a woof thread underneath.
The Jacquard loom, however, used a series of cards with punched holes to control this process. The holes determined which hooks and rods would be activated for each pass of the weave, thus automating the creation of intricate patterns. Each time the shuttle was thrown to create a new pass of the thread, a new punch card would come into play. This was a seemingly simple and utilitarian result that was supported by an enchantingly complex idea. In fact, Jacquard developed the idea of the loom based on the thoughts and ideas of inventors Basile Bouchon, Jean Baptiste Falcon and Jacques Vaucanson.
The Jacquard loom would influence inventors of myriad hues in the years to come. Among them was an Englishman, Charles Babbage, who was so enamoured by the idea of using punched cards to control intricate patterns that he decided to borrow the idea to develop a complex device he was fancying to build — the Analytical Engine, an idea he conceived in 1834.
Like all great inventors, Babbage too possessed an uncanny ability to combine “innovations that had cropped up in other fields”, writes Walter Isaacson in The Innovators. Babbage realised he could use the punched cards in place of the steel drums in his Analytical Engine, to input an unlimited number of instructions to the machine. This was conceived as a general purpose computer that would carry out a variety of different operations based on programming instructions given to it — exactly what a computer does today.
Ahead of their times
Babbage’s machine was an idea that was a hundred years ahead of his time, Isaacson notes. But he didn’t find too many takers for his seemingly utopian idea — except one. And that was Ada, the Countess of Lovelace. Isaacson paints a strikingly vivid portrait of the relationship the ‘father of modern computer’ shared with the countess, a mathematical genius who was the first one to envision the modern computer.
Born on December 10, 1815, Ada was the only legitimate child of legendary English poet Lord Byron. Ada’s margin notes to her translation of a study in Italian of Babbage’s Engine, written by a (then) young engineer called Luigi Menabrea, became more famous and coveted than the thesis itself. Menabrea later became the prime minister of Italy. It was in these notes that Ada discussed the idea of a general purpose machine, which later evolved into the modern computer.
Many rightly believe her works in the area of computing and mathematics didn’t get the deserved attention, even though over the years she was celebrated as a feminist icon and computer pioneer, especially in the initial decades of the digital revolution. Hers could be one of the first and perhaps the most important case of criminal neglect the computing industry later became notorious for.
To his credit, Isaacson devotes a significant amount of real estate to sketch Ada’s interestingly eccentric life, even though one gets a sense that even he is not thoroughly convinced of her genius. “Whether due to her opiates or her breeding or both”, Isaacson writes, Ada developed an outsize opinion of her own talents and started describing herself as a “genius”. Interestingly, in his biography of Steve Jobs (2011), Isaacson appeared to be all awe describing Jobs’ eccentric and self-obsessed ways.
The collaborators
In his journey tracing the evolution of the digital revolution, Isaacson introduces an ensemble cast — many known and some unknown. There are the usual suspects such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and a refreshing multitude of interesting faces that makes The Innovators the most interesting account of the history of the digital era. The depth of Isaacson’s research is spectacular to say the least. And his narration is dexterously non-linear, making it an intelligent reader’s delight.
A former managing editor of Time magazine, he obviously has the probing eyes of a curious journalist, while maintaining a philosopher’s detachment to the events and ideas he discusses. He is bewitchingly lucid even when describing the most complex concepts in computing. His profiles of hackers and geeks beam truthfulness and striking nonchalance.
Unlike the industrial revolution, which was made possible to a large extent through individual brilliance and resilience (like James Watt or George Stephenson), the digital revolution — despite the cult faces that pop up in most manuals — was a collaborative effort.
A continuing journey
There were leaders such as Jobs or Gates, but there were no “solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell and Morse”. Most of the key inventions of the digital era came from the collaboration of hackers, inventors and entrepreneurs.
Even though Isaacson declares at the outset that it’s the story of collaboration that he is trying to capture, he ends up highlighting many cults. But that’s pardonable, given that each character, representing an epochal event in the history of computing, stands testimony to the camaraderie and unity that propelled digital inventions. While narrating the stories, Isaacson captures how each invention in the digital universe has helped humanity leapfrog on many fronts and how these devices, services and events helped make complex tasks simpler and more enjoyable.
Technology, especially computing technology, has made human lives a highly entertaining affair. In the second half of the past century, especially at the tail end of it, computers and the internet started influencing human life like no other forces of nature have.
In the past decade or so, we saw the world wide web — invented by the ideas of Tim Berners-Lee who was, like Gates and Jobs, also born in 1955 — and the internet (which was an offshoot of a military mechanism for communication) redefining the contours of nations, triggering revolutions, challenging militaries. Computing technology even gave us a new, global currency (bitcoin) and the world’s first free, open repository of information (Wikipedia) and many more services and devices.
This is a continuing journey, an unstoppable revolution. And as Isaacson notes, what is making this revolution even more enchanting and likeable is the interplay of art and science in it.
And as Ada, Countess of Lovelace had believed, — and as Isaacson sums up — innovators are people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. This chemistry will spring more surprises in the years to come.

The too-long arm of the law  contdThe heat is slowly turning up on the government’s use of civil asset forfeiture procedures to extort money out of innocent individuals without the messy need to actually show that they did anything wrong or wrongful.   I blogged about this a couple of weeks ago, and today’s New York Times has a front page article detailing another wrinkle in the civil forfeiture scam :  seizures of funds deposited in violation of the “anti-structuring” provisions of the federal code.
As you probably know, banks have an obligation to report all cash transactions of more than $10,000 to the federal government.  What you may not know is that it is a federal crime to “structure a transaction,” including by “breaking down a single sum of currency exceeding $ 10,000 into smaller sums, . . . “for the purpose of evading the [reporting] requirement.”  The reporting requirement itself is designed to alert the government to possibly suspicious transactions involving proceeds from money laundering, or drugs or gambling or other cash-intensive activities.  But the statute makes the evasion itself a crime — even if the money was derived from perfectly lawful activities, and even if the “purpose of evading the reporting requirement” is a perfectly benign one.  And to make matters much worse, the IRS doesn’t even have to charge you with the crime of “structuring” in order to seize the proceeds of the transaction under civil asset forfeiture laws, and the Times article details growing use of this procedure to take and keep money belonging to innocent individuals who are never even charged with the crime at all.
As it happens, I have a particular interest in and connection to the “structuring” issue.  Back in 1993, when I clerked for Justice Ginsburg, the Court decided the case of Ratzlaf v. US (510 US 135 (1994)).  Ratzlaf admitted that he structured a cash transaction with knowledge of, and a purpose to avoid, the banks’ reporting requirement.  [He owed $1000,000 to a Las Vegas casino, and the casino helpfully provided a limousine to take him around to a number of local banks where he could get cashiers' checks for $9,900 without triggering the recording requirement)  The anti-structuring statute at the time, however, called for proof that the actor had not merely violated the anti-structuring provision but "willfully violate[d]” it - and the Court (with Justice Ginsburg writing for the majority of five) held that the government had not proved that Ratzlaf acted “willfully.”  (Law students take note – it’s a very interesting decision about how to construe the word “willful” when it appears, as it does not infrequently, in statutory criminal provisions.  And an odd lineup, which usually means something interesting was going on in the case:  Ginsburg joined by Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Kennedy in the majority; Blackmun, Rehnquist, O’Connor, and Thomas in dissent).  The Court noted that “willfully,” when used in federal statutes, usually means that the actor had “specific intent to commit a crime,” i. e., “a purpose to disobey the law” – that the defendant knew that he was acting unlawfully but went ahead nonetheless.  Adding the modifier “willfully” is the legislature’s way of overriding the usual rule that “ignorance of the law is no excuse”; ignorance of the law is an excuse, if the statute requires the government to show that you acted “willfully.”
Ratzlaff, the Court held, didn’t act “willfully,” because even though he knew of the bank’s reporting requirement (and was acting to evade it), he didn’t know that such evasion was itself a crime, so he could not be said to have acted with a specific purpose to disobey the law.  The government argued that that the intent to evade the reporting requirement was alone enought to satisfy any “bad purpose” requirement signalled by use of the word “willfully”; because “structuring is not the kind of activity that an ordinary person would engage in innocently,” it was therefore “reasonable to hold a structurer responsible for evading the reporting requirements without the need to prove specific knowledge that such evasion is unlawful.”
The Court (wisely, in my view) rejected that argument:
“Undoubtedly there are bad men who attempt to elude official reporting requirements in order to hide from Government inspectors such criminal activity as laundering drug money or tax evasion.  But currency structuring is not inevitably nefarious. Consider, for example, the small business operator who knows that reports filed under 31 U.S.C. § 5313(a) are available to the Internal Revenue Service. To reduce the risk of an IRS audit, she brings $ 9,500 in cash to the bank twice each week, in lieu of transporting over $ 10,000 once each week. That person, if the United States is right, has committed a criminal offense, because she structured cash transactions “for the specific purpose of depriving the Government of the information that Section 5313(a) is designed to obtain.”  Nor is a person who structures a currency transaction invariably motivated by a desire to keep the Government in the dark. But under the Government’s construction an individual would commit a felony against the United States by making cash deposits in small doses, fearful that the bank’s reports would increase the likelihood of burglary, or in an endeavor to keep a former spouse unaware of his wealth.”
[I've often wondered whether Justice Ginsburg's familiarity with perfectly lawful tax-structured transactions - her husband Marty having been one of America's top tax lawyers - helped make her more receptive to the notion that the "evasion of the reporting requirement" alone is not enough to trigger criminal liability; just because a statute says "If you do X, the consequence is Y," avoiding X in order to avoid Y is not, standing alone, a criminal act - if it were, a lot of tax lawyers and their clients would be in jail.]
Unfortunately, Congress, responding to alarms that this holding would make it harder to find and to prosecute money launderers and drug dealers, rather quickly responded by deleting the word “willfully” from the statute, leaving us with the mess we now have.

The White Paper Is Not Deadreddit
White papers seem to be falling out of favor. Perhaps our preferred screens have become too small and our attention spans too short. Or maybe it's the perception that white papers are only for large, corporations selling complex technologies.
I am here to tell you that rumors of the death of the white paper are greatly exaggerated. And they're not just for the Fortune 500. White papers may have the longest shelf life of all content, and they can be sliced and diced to meet a variety of marketing purposes and repurposes.
I sat down recently with Gordon Graham, aka "That White Paper Guy" and author of White Papers for Dummies, which is part of the "Dummies" series from Wiley. My interview with him will debunk some of the misconceptions about white papers, and may get you thinking of ways to include them in your own content mix - even if you are a small business or a B2C marketer.
Fox: Gordon, I want to key in on your small business background and how a white paper can help a small company find and connect with customers. I understand as VP of Marketing you helped take a company in wireless barcode scanning from $250,000 to $14 million. How did you do it?
Graham: I think it was the willingness of the business owners to try different things. I would suggest something, and more often than not they would say, "Yes, let's try that." Two things that really connected for us and really got us traction were white papers and case studies.
Fox: Give an example of a successful white paper you created for the business.
Graham: It ended up being more of a booklet that featured a fictitious company we called Acme Tricycle Works. It involved two people - Victor the Vice-President, who was the decision maker, and Martin the IT Manager, who made technical recommendations. We had them walking through Acme, going into every department and making observations about how things were before our technology and after. It was something of an extended customer story based on a fictitious composite of a lot of our customers.
Fox: It was a published as a physical document?
Graham: Yes, as a book. It was the late '90s, so I might look at it differently now. But we deliberately decided to make it like a physical trophy. It was the most lavish thing we ever did, but that little booklet earned us millions of dollars' worth of sales.
Our west coast sales rep summed it up nicely when he said, "I go to a meeting and I put a copy of our little book at everyone's place, and you can see in their eyes that we have just risen to the top of their vendor short list because we look like a big, professional company."
Fox: What's interesting is that here you turned a lowly white paper into a story that people could identify with.
Graham: It was powerful, especially since we were a small company competing with big companies who had been in business much longer and had millions of dollars to spend. Yet, we would regularly beat them out on projects. Finally, one of our big competitors got so tired of dealing with us, they just bought us out.
Fox: That is powerful, yet when I talk about white papers to clients these days, their eyes roll up in the top of their heads. They're like, "Oh, no. Here we go again!"
Graham: Well, I guess there is something of a fatigue factor. I've seen so many articles lately with people posing the question, "Are white papers dead?" or outright declaring, "The white paper is dead!"
I think anything that's poorly done is going to fatigue people and I would say the majority of white papers out there are not very effective. They make the same mistake over and over - too much selling. A white paper's not supposed to be a sales document. It's supposed to help people understand some kind of issue or solve a problem or make a decision.
Fox: It seems to me that another attribute of a good white paper is that it contains content you can re-purpose and reuse.
Graham: Yes, a problem-solution white paper can generate probably three or four blog posts. You just take every section, boil it down a bit and post it. Then at the bottom say, "For more discussion, see the full white paper here." Another obvious way to re-purpose a white paper is to boil it down to a slide deck, and then you can post that on sites like SlideShare .
Fox: We have been talking mostly about B2B - how can white papers help companies that sell consumer goods and services?
Graham: Here is a B2C example from a small business in Pennsylvania, a guy who runs an interesting niche. He mails invitations and special offers to new people who have moved into a neighborhood, information he gets from residential sales, movers and the US postal service. People who move into a new house in a new town need all new services and information on local businesses. Imagine you get this mail with offers like, "Come to Joe's Garage and we'll give you a free oil change." You go to Joe's Garage and chances are they will become your new garage.
We developed a white paper to help attract local retailers like Joe's Garage. It talks about why people move, how they move, where they're moving and other information, including graphics to show the opportunity.  This white paper has been on his website for seven years now, and it's still being downloaded hundreds of times a year! As long as prospects are still suffering the same pain and struggling with the same problems, it remains relevant and useful.
Fox: How does a business go about developing a white paper?
Graham: The general process of doing an effective white paper is to start with a problem that your prospects are facing [most likely, your customer service team has a long list and FAQs]. And then do some research to flush out the problem in detail. Also, get a good handle on your purpose, which is most often related to the sales funnel. Are you trying to generate more leads? That's the top of the funnel. Nurture existing prospects or keep them engaged through a complex sale? That's the middle. Supporting an evaluation or business case is the bottom of the funnel.
Fox: In your book, you discuss three kinds of white papers that you label as the popular ice cream flavors of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. I think that's brilliant because everyone loves ice cream, or at least can relate to it!
Graham: Exactly!  The idea came to me while I was going through the list of white papers I had written, and realized that most of them fell into one of three buckets. I figured, why not turn them into buckets of ice cream!
Fox: Vanilla is the prototypical backgrounder, the usual technical or financial business benefits of something. My apologies in advance for a bad pun, but how about a few licks of strawberry and chocolate...
Graham: Chocolate is the problem-solution white paper. I call it chocolate because it's the richest and most complex flavor. It's the one you can post on a website for years, refreshing it if needed with more recent statistics. It will keep generating leads, literally for years.
Strawberry is light and lively. The really fun, fresh flavor of strawberry white papers is the Numbered List. I would say these days at least half of the white papers I do wind up being numbered lists because everybody likes them. Another light version of a white paper is something I call the " Cheat Sheet " which is a geared to help B2B marketers when their sales reps ask for something short they can leave behind at a meeting or e-mail to prospects. The fact is, we all have too much to read and too much information coming at us from all different angles. That's what makes strawberry so popular.
Fox: Do you include graphics or anything else to liven up the story or highlight particular points? And how are most white papers published these days?
Graham: White papers have become more visual and better designed over the years. I would say definitely put a visual cover on it. Use charts and graphs and good typography. If you have a budget, spend some extra money on a professional designer.
As for publishing, usually they are published as PDFs and distributed online. There are sites like Knowledge Storm and Find White Papers for publishing white papers. Also check out your industry trade magazines or associations to see if you can get your white paper posted on their site or run and ad with a link to the white paper back on your site. It's a great way to attract new prospects.
Too much information remains locked up in the minds of subject matter experts. A white paper can capture that know-how to help promote any B2B concern, and many B2B companies as well. It's a foundational piece of content that sales teams want and prospective customers need.
Gordon's book, " White Papers for Dummies ", is an excellent resource for developing and writing white papers. Lean more on his website, thatwhitepaperguy.com , which also offers helpful tips and advice.
Additional resource::  Here's a list of common synonyms for "white papers." Depending upon your audience, these terms may help you strike the right tone for your resource...even better than "white paper."

Why Many Good Mortgage Loans Are Not Being Madereddit
The housing sector today is not providing the economic stimulus we had come to expect during periods of economic recovery. A major reason is that the underwriting rules and practices that determine whether or not an applicant qualifies for a home mortgage are much stricter today than they were before the financial crisis.
In part, the tightening reflects changes in the market environment that make mortgage loans generally more risky than they were before the crisis. The major factor was the nationwide decline in house prices between 2006 and 2009, the first such decline since the 1930s. The very liberal terms that prevailed prior to the crisis were based on a widespread belief that such declines were a thing of the past. When price changes are always positive, it is very difficult to make a bad mortgage loan. Now that the market understands that house prices can decline, mortgages are considered riskier.
A second factor has been the post-crisis practice of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to require lenders originating loans for sale to the agencies to buy them back if they default too quickly. This has caused many lenders to impose underwriting rules (referred to as "overlays") that are more restrictive than required by law and regulation,
A third factor has been the post-crisis tightening of underwriting standards imposed by law and regulation. The riskier mortgage types that experienced the highest default rates are no longer permitted. This includes loans that allow negative amortization where the payment does not cover the interest, and loans that allow interest-only where the payment convers only the interest.  Monthly payments today must be fully-amortizing, meaning that if continued through the life of the loan, the balance will be paid off at term.
In addition, riskier loan features that are still allowed carry a larger penalty than they did before the crisis. For example, a borrower refinancing with "cash-out" is subject to a larger price penalty relative to a no-cash refinance than before the crisis, and may also be subject to a higher credit score requirement, a higher equity requirement or both. The same is true of loans on 2-4 family properties and condos, relative to loans on single-family homes.
But the tightening of underwriting rules following the crisis has gone beyond these rational adjustments to a riskier environment. It also included knee-jerk responses to pre-crisis abuses, particularly to the many cases of loans granted to people who obviously couldn't repay them. A system of hastily enacted rules and procedures designed to prevent this from happening again are now blocking many good loans from being made. The following are major features of this system:
A belief that all mortgage loans should be affordable. In fact, there are numerous circumstances in which an unaffordable loan is in the interest of a borrower, and where the evidence is compelling that the loan will be fully repaid. One example is a cash-out refinance by an owner who wants to remain in the house a few more years before selling, and uses the cash to make the payment. Underwriter judgments are needed in such cases, however, and these are not a part of the new system.
Underwriter discretion is substantially narrowed. Rules have largely eliminated discretion, and the major role of underwriters today is to check for conformity with the rules.
Ratios of debt-to-income above 43% indicate over-commitment by the applicant. Given the wide range of circumstances that can affect a borrower's capacity to meet obligations, fixation on any ratio as a maximum makes no sense. But again, the sense should be provided by an underwriter with the discretion to make a call, and that no longer exists.
The affordability requirement is absolute and not affected by the applicant's credit score or equity in the property. Applicants making a down payment of 40% with a credit score of 800 are turned down if their income is not adequate. This makes no sense.
Income must be fully documented. Prior to the crisis, documentation requirements ranged from full-doc to no-doc, with three or four partial- docs in-between. The less complete the documentation, the higher the price and the larger the required equity and credit score. That sensible system is now gone and all loans must be fully documented. This is why I keep getting letters from self-employed applicants who cannot qualify despite having large equity and a high credit score.
Much of the system of rules and beliefs described above stem from Dodd-Frank, and were formulated in an atmosphere hostile to lenders. But borrowers are the ones paying the price.
The issues need to be reconsidered in an atmosphere free of vindictiveness toward lenders. It could begin with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and their supervisor the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which could re-examine their rules, identify those that should be liberalized, and determine which they could fix on their own and which would require new legislation,

The ECB Assessment of Eurozone Banks  Health Will Not Dissipate Fundamental Questionsreddit
After months of waiting, we just received the results of the assessment of the health of Eurozone banks by their new supervisory authority: the European Central Bank. They were predictable, but the exercise has limitations which result in delivering only a partial health bulletin.
What the numbers say
Of the 130 banks 25 have insufficient capital. Their aggregate needs amount to 25 billion euros, or 1% of the equity of banks in the Eurozone. Over-valuation of assets amount to 48 billion euros, or 0.15% of the assets of European banks. Those numbers are reassuring.
Of the 25 billion, Greek (8.7) and Italy (9.7) account for almost 75% of the missing equity. France (0.1), Germany (0.1) and Spain (0.0), the main Eurozone countries (with Italy), are in almost perfect health.
None of the 20 largest Eurozone  global banks is included in the list of banks with insufficient capital.
This reading is reassuring, and given the methodology used, the results are indisputable.
What the evaluation does not say
While there are three Basel III ratios that banks will be required to comply (liquidity, leverage and capital adequacy), the analysis of the ECB is only focusing on lack of capital. The Asset Quality Review is in the context of capital adequacy.
The Asset Quality Review generally excludes any form of reduction in the nominal value of bonds issued by sovereign states of the Eurozone. They are  considered worth their face value when they are detained in the core portfolio of Eurozone banks. This ignores that the Eurozone has violated its own dogma in the case of Greece and Cyprus. Unfortunately, the size of sovereign bonds create one of the systemic worries. Country risk is absent from this assessment and all state bonds are considered as strong as Germany.  It would, of course, be extremely politically sensitive.
The absence of the 20 largest global banks in the Eurozone from the list poses a question: the choice of banks. Slovenia, Portugal, Slovakia and Estonia do not represent a systemic risk by themselves. Their presence in the sample was purely political and a matter of national pride. Monte dei Paschi alone, which would have fallen into bankruptcy without the intervention of the Italian government last year, can be considered systemic. Everything has been built so that only the less significant banks are caught in claws of the ECB.
Systemic risk is not taken into account. The vulnerability of banks in countries where they operate are not taken into account, especially those who are over-indebted, such as France, Greece and Italy. That is a shortfall since sovereign risks represent 115% of the equity of banks in the Eurozone.
The analysis of asset quality is also limited by a methodology that ignores "exotic" assets in the balance sheets of major global banks, and in particular the risk on derivatives. It's the same structured products. Such risks are generally absent from smaller bank balance sheets.
Risks associated with the universal banking model and the size of major European banks are not part of the debate. European banks continue to threaten the Eurozone with assets of 31 billion euro, representing 250% of GDP (against 75% in the US).
A reassuring health bulletin in the absence of crisis.
The assessment of the European Central Bank has merits: it pushed a number of major banks to take restructuring measures, sometimes at the last minute such as the capital injection of AXA into AXA Bank last Friday. Deutsche Bank took drastic measures and increase its capital in the first half. Until the last minute, it was unclear whether it would be affected by the AQR.
What the analysis does not touch, even if public statements are sure to pretend an absence of systemic risk, is that with 31,000 billion for 13,000 billion capital Gross Domestic Product, and the Eurozone is over-banked. As such, the taxpayer will have to bail out in the case of a collapse of a major bank, despite the new bank resolution mechanism set up by the European Union.

24 European Banks Fail EBA Stress Test: Is a Major Banking Crisis Loomingreddit
The European Banking Authority, in conjunction with the European Central Bank, conducted a stress test of 123 leading banks within the European Union. A total of 24 banks failed the stress tests, which gauges the ability of a bank located within the EU to withstand macroeconomic pressures, which are rapidly accumulating not only in Europe but throughout the global economy. This represents a full 20 percent of all the major banks subjected to the stress test by the EBA and ECB.
Nine of the banks with failing grades are Italian; three are Greek and another three are Cypriote. Though only one of the banks on the list of vulnerable banks is Irish (Ireland had previously been afflicted with a major banking crisis, requiring a massive bailout), that institution, Permanent TSB, is one of Ireland's largest financial institutions. Permanent TSB was found to have a massive €854.8 million hole in its reserves. Overall, the EBA found that the banks surveyed in the stress test were short of 24.6 billion euros in capital reserves--the amount required in their modeling to withstand a three-year recession. This is the equivalent  of 31.17 billion U.S. dollars at current exchange levels.
Since the global economy imploded into systemic crisis in 2008, central banks and regulating authorities in major economies throughout North America and Europe have held periodic stress tests, apparently in an effort to reassure the public in those countries that their banks are in generally good financial condition. There is a suspicion among many that those stress tests are often rigged in a manner designed to present the most favorable indication possible regarding those banking institutions. The fact that this most recent stress tests undertaken by the EBA reveals that 20 percent of the European Union's major banks are in trouble, and this at a time of economic stagnation throughout Europe, with increasing indications of looming recession, should serve as a warning klaxon on how fragile Europe's financial health remains a full six years after the onset of the global economic and financial crisis.

Euro edges up on better-than-expected ECB stress testsDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.
8
Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.
0
Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

A journey into humilityUpdated: November 22, 2014 14:34 IST
A journey into humility
fiction
“In Australia, the Man Booker Prize is seen as something of a chicken raffle. I just didn’t expect to end up being the chicken.” This year’s winner, Richard Flanagan, gets candid about his prize-winning book, and why he thinks the novel is not dead.
Richard Flanagan is nothing if not a man of his word. When his incredibly personal novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction, he said, “Writing is a journey to humility.”
Then just a few days before the prize was to be announced, Flanagan — easily among the finest Australian writers of his generation — was quoted as saying, “In Australia, the Man Booker is seen as something of a chicken raffle.” A couple of days later, he won the raffle, thereby becoming the third Aussie to get the Booker after Thomas Kenneally and Peter Carey. 
His words stayed in the memory of his numerous readers across the world. And in his mind too. Soon after he received the Man Booker prize — where he pipped to the post, among others, Neel Mukherjee and Howard Jacobson, who won the prize in 2010 — Flanagan did not forget his words, merely adding, “In Australia, the Man Booker Prize is seen as something of a chicken raffle. I just didn’t expect to end up being the chicken.” Then he happily talked of humility, taking care to bring in a reference to his grandparents. “I do not come out of a literary tradition. My grandparents were illiterate.”
What he did not say then, but said to The Hindu, was that his father was a prisoner of war for three and a half years in Burma where his award-winning novel is set. For years, Richard heard tales of people surviving on stale rice, living with open wounds, constant humiliation and, ultimately, a life of denial; a life by the deadly railway track linking Burma and Thailand. He heard it all from his father and siblings. Then, one day, he “decided to tell the story”, though his father never asked him about its contents. Flanagan and his five siblings grew up “as children of the Death Railway”. They “carried many incommunicable things” and he “decided to tell the story” through the book.
Thus was written The Narrow Road to the Deep North. It is a journey that took him 12 years; long enough for the Tasmanian to consider picking up a job in the mines of Northern Territory in Australia to meet his daily expenses. For such a long time, he lived each of the characters. “The central character — Dorrigo Evans — is me. And so too the Japanese commandant, Nakamura, and the murderous Korean guard, the Goanna. All are me, because within each of us lives the universe and the universe is never one thing. Its harmony lives in its oppositions.” Incidentally, the place claimed some 90,000 labourers’ lives.
Unfortunately, the day Flanagan mailed the publishers the manuscript of the war-time novel — dedicated to his father — Flanagan Senior, then 98, passed away. And the author, who had in the run-up to the D-Day, admitted, “I would miss my father if I did (win the prize)”, did indeed miss him when he got the award.
“Out of a literary ghetto to the biggest literary prize” is how he summed it up in a chat hours after the award ceremony. The ceremony in the U.K. was kind of a home-coming for Flanagan who had, early in his life, studied at the University of Oxford. As a teenager who left school at age 16 in Australia, Flanagan had won a scholarship to Oxford where he completed a Masters degree. All along, he worked as a river guide before taking to academic writing full-time. History, though, could not interest him for long. Soon, he switched to fiction.   
He wrote The Narrow Road... in his shack on Bruny Island, an island off Tasmania. “It looks out on some trees, the sea and an array of animals there, including quolls.” From that far end of the world, he has written six novels, including Gould’s Book of Fish, which was a bookie’s favourite for the Booker about 12 years ago. Incidentally, this time too his book was a bookies’ favourite; his work seemed to tick all the boxes: it related a very human story of love and war, a deeply enriching novel that seemed to cry out for the medium otherwise said to be fading away. It was set in Burma, in news for many reasons of late. And it came from the pen of an Australian, somebody who had never won the award earlier. If, in the run-up to the award, Flanagan was the bookies’ favourite, the award has aroused new interest in his work. The book sold some 60,000 copies in Australia before the finals; in next 24 hours, orders for 10,000 copies were placed.
Understandably, he was less than pleased when it was suggested that the novel is a dying art. “Much has been made about the death of the novel. It is said to be assailed by technology, by the web. I don’t share that pessimism because I think it is one of the great inventions of the human spirit. It is one of the greatest spiritual and intellectual inventions of our age. As a species, it is story that distinguishes us and one of the supreme expressions of the story is the novel. Novels are not a mirror to life or a guide to life. They are life.”
Hardly a surprise considering he is happiest when writing and is a rare writer who is fond of human company, of places where people gather and talk. Post-Booker, he won’t be short of either the company or the place.
Hey, didn’t we talk about Flanagan’s humility at the beginning? Yes, we did. And Flanagan showed that characteristic in ample measure after winning the award. “The fractious tribe of writers is not readily given to fraternity. But I was honoured to be a writer among the writers on this short list. I said to Howard (Jacobson) that there was a good argument to be made for any of the short listed books being the winner. And there is. I hope readers remember 2014’s Man Booker Prize not for my book alone, but for the formidable strength of its shortlist of which I am proud to be part.”
This, after he nudged ahead of them all. How is that for humility for a writer? “To be a writer is to journey into humility. It is to be defeated by ever greater things.”
Indeed. Out of the literary ghetto and all the way to the Booker night. How is that for accomplishment?

Average gasoline price tumbles to lowest level in almost four years7
The average is the lowest since Dec. 17, 2010, as oil, which makes up 64 percent of the pump price, has fallen 24 percent from this year's peak in June. And prices could continue to fall.
"The crude oil price crash has been passed through by refiners," said Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey. "Retailers will probably be pressed to pass through at the pump a few more pennies of price-cutting sometime soon."
The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 states among the markets surveyed was in San Francisco, at $3.45 a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Memphis, Tenn., where customers paid an average $2.73 a gallon. Regular gasoline averaged $3.33 a gallon on Long Island in New York, and $3.39 in Los Angeles.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark priced in Cushing, Okla., declined $4.81, or 5.6 percent, to $81.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the two weeks ended Friday. It dipped below $80 on Oct. 16 for the first time since June 2012.
After rising as analysts speculated prices had reached a floor, West Texas Intermediate crude sank again after stockpiles climbed nationally. It fell to $80.52 on Wednesday, and ended the week down 24 percent from the year's high. The U.S. benchmark, which slipped into a bear market Oct. 9, may dip to $75 by the end of year, Bank of America Corp. said in a recent research note.
The "swiftness of the sell-off" attracted bargain hunters, who saw prices continue to decline, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund that focuses on energy.
"People came in and tried to pick the bottom, and they picked wrong," Kilduff said.
U.S. oil output was 8.95 million barrels a day the week of Oct. 10, the most since 1985. U.S. production has increased about 66 percent in the past five years as companies have used horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to tap into hydrocarbon-rich layers of underground shale rock.
Gasoline stockpiles fell 1.3 million barrels, or 0.6 percent, in the seven days ended Oct. 17 to 204.4 million, Energy Information Administration data show. Gasoline futures on the Nymex fell 7.58 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.18 a gallon in the two weeks ended Friday.

Constitutional challenge to quarantine unlikely to succeedBy Eugene Kontorovich October 27
Kaci Hickox, the nurse forcibly quarantined by New Jersey upon her return from West Africa, is threatening a legal challenge to her confinement. Her lawyers claim she is being deprived of her liberty in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Due process cases are fact specific, and I am not privy to information NJ authorities had before them or their decision-making process. However, it is highly unlikely that she will prevail.
While the Supreme Court has long held quarantines to be constitutional, it has not ruled directly on the scope of permissible quarantines. However, in the famous case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts , the Court did uphold a blanket mandatory vaccination law, under which resisters were put in jail. The principle here is the same as with quarantine – that one’s normal rights to bodily integrity are suspended by a general and serious public need, especially of an epidemiological variety.
Still, in part because quarantines have rarely been imposed since World War II, there is relatively little direct precedent on their permissible scope and circumstances. But a brief review of the cases suggests it extremely difficult to challenge such an action without a clear showing of medical unreasonableness, or discriminatory application. Indeed, I found no cases in which a quarantine has been lifted due process grounds (though there have been some successful challenges to conditions of quarantine).
One case upholding a quarantine has facts that look strikingly like Hickox’s. In U.S. ex rel Siegel v. Shinnick, 219 F.Supp. 789 (E.D. NY 1963), the plaintiff was confined for 14 days on her return from a “smallpox infected area” abroad, despite a lack of any evidence of direct exposure or symptoms. The court upheld the action, noting:
[The] judgment required is that of a public health officer and not of a lawyer used to insist on positive evidence to support action; their task is to measure risk to the public and to seek for what can reassure and, not finding it, to proceed reasonably to make the public health secure. They deal in a terrible context and the consequences of mistaken indulgence can be irretrievably tragic. To supercede their judgment there must be a reliable showing of error.
Perhaps the ACLU, which is also questioning the current quarantine, thinks that due process has expanded so much that it might even prohibit this most traditional use of the police power. I doubt it. There are extremely few contexts where the state can deprive someone of liberty without any showing of wrongdoing, or any personal conduct whatsoever: conscription, quarantine, and in a milder fashion, jury service. The case law basis for conscription goes back only to 1918 (also the time of the first widespread quarantines n the U.S.), but it has proven impervious to a liberalized due process clause. Quarantine is safe too.
Moreover, 20th century quarantine cases have typically death with tuberculosis and small pox, both of which are far less lethal than Ebola, and about which much more was known. (The most common form of smallpox had a 30% fatality rate, less than half that of Ebola.) All this shifts the presumption of validity even more towards the state.
Under the basic Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test for these kind of deprivations of liberty, the gravity of the of government’s interest and adequacy of pre-deprivation process are key factors. The long incubation period and deadly effects all counsel for allowing a deprivation of liberty without any showing of illness. Locking a patient up after they develop a fever simply does not substitute for doing so in advance.
UPDATE: I just saw news reports that the nurse is being released.
Eugene Kontorovich is a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, and an expert on constitutional and international law. He also writes and lectures frequently about the Arab-Israel conflict.

Imposition  of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centre s involvement in the issuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Telangana may reduce power cuts on industrial consumersTelangana may reduce power cuts on industrial consumers
Our Bureau
Tweet
Hyderabad, Oct. 27:  
The Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has today called upon TS Transmission Corporation to reduce the two-day power holiday per week on the industrial consumers to one day a week.
The suggestion comes in the backdrop of drop in demand from the agriculture sector following fall in temperatures due to widespread rains and also the kharif season nearing completion.
In the midst of a demand-supply mismatch leading to huge power cuts in the new state of Telangana, this comes in as good news for the industrial power consumers who are faced with hard times due to inadequate power supply to run their units leading to production loss. The small and medium enterprises are amongst the worst hit.
The directive of the Chief Minister to the D Prabhakar Rao, Chairman and Managing Director of TS Genco and TS Transco, comes in at a time when the two States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are in a major spat over power generation at the major hydel reservoirs of Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar, with the latter accusing of violating the existing government orders.
The Government move to reduce power cuts is the first sign of demand from the farm sector coming down over the past two days due to wide spread rains caused due to cyclone resulting in drop in temperatures and also demand from the farm sector pump operations.
The demand from the farm sector operation, which is provided up to seven hours of power supply to energise the pump sets, is likely to taper off with the khariff season coming to an end, providing the flexibility to reduce power cuts.

How To Make Your Office More Productive For Introvertsreddit
If you encounter an individual who considers the prospect of working on a team to be a form of long-acting torture -- you just might find they would describe themselves as an "introvert." To an introvert, teaming can become a bit of a workplace nightmare -- in direct opposition to how they would normally approach their work . The essence of teaming experiences, including vying for airtime to present ideas, can put off an otherwise satisfied employee. Ultimately, the often "on-demand" nature of team participation, doesn't always align with all personalities or work styles.
But, introverts, those who tend to "focus inward," can still excel in the realm of teams. For a significant percentage of the US that describe themselves as an "introvert", team membership shouldn't boil down to becoming louder to be heard. As expressed by Laura Richardson, VP at of The Innovation Games Company , "Introverts shouldn't be relegated to catching the team leader in the hallway, after the meeting to share their opinions comfortably".
Sophia Dembling, author of The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World , explains that teaming can be a positive experience for introverts, as long as they have the opportunity to process information in a manner in line with their work-style strengths. "Introverts don't mind meeting with a team," she says. "We know that's necessary for strategizing. But we prefer if our contribution to the larger project is something we can do by ourselves, then bring back to the team. We're most productive when we can focus quietly and independently on a task."
There is good reason to ensure that introverts participate fully in the team process. In fact, research has shown that the hesitancy to monopolize the conversation can actually make them powerful team members. Why? Introverts tend to listen to suggestions more openly, in comparison to their extroverted colleagues -- a tremendous advantage when developing solutions.
Here are some ideas to help team membership become more productive for introverts:
Build mutual respect. It can appear that introverts and extroverts are from different workplace planets. As a result, it is imperative that we understand, and respect, the differences in the way we each process information.
Utilize solitary ideation. Introverts are more sensitive to the stimulation that occurs while interacting with a team. Offer opportunities for introverts to start the idea generation process before a team meeting is held. Distribute information concerning the focus of the challenge, the anticipated obstacles and goals, before the first team meeting.
Build confidence in the process. One strategy to increase confidence in the team process can be borrowed from the theater. GameChangers , which utilizes improvisation to enhance communication skills, uses learning-based exercises to help all team members. "Improvisational game structure gives even the most introverted players on a team a point of focus that allows them to confront concerns regarding the social dynamics of collaborating," says Mike Bonifer, co-founder and CEO.
Take control. Encouraging broad participation in a group can require careful direction. First on the list -- controlling the mine fields that deter full participation. "Loud talkers" and "Interrupters" who squelch the input of other team members, must be addressed. Set guidelines for participation. If negative behavior persists, deal with the problem privately.
Use the 8 second rule. During team meetings, try not change topics or shift gears too abruptly. Pause and wait 8 seconds before moving on to the next topic. You may find that this brief pause, allows an introvert time to chime in and share an opinion.
Game it. Gaming applications offer an interesting alternative to effectively gather information from all types of team members. From the early phases of the ideation process -- to weighing options -- gaming can help collect potential solutions and visualize the entire decision process. An added plus: "loud talker" no longer dominates the conversation. ( See The Innovation Games website here. )
How do you help your introverted team members shine? Are you a "card carrying" introvert?

Coalscam: CBI allowed to retain documents seized from JSPL
After lodging the FIR, CBI had carried out searches at four locations in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. CBI has said that the case pertained to allocation of Gare Palma IV/1 coal block to the firm.
Post your opinion here
 
A special court today allowed CBI to retain documents seized during searches conducted at the premises of  Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) against which the agency has lodged a fresh FIR in connection with the coal blocks allocation scam.
The order came after the agency said the seized documents would be required for the day-to-day probe in the matter which is in progress. CBI prosecutor A P Singh and the investigating officer (IO) in the case informed Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar about the searches conducted by the agency at the office premises of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd and other associated offices.
The court, after hearing the submissions and perusing the application, allowed the IO to retain documents but directed CBI to file all the relevant documents which have been recovered, along with the final report on completion of the investigation. "An application has been moved by IO ASP S N Khan intimating about searches conducted under Section 165 CrPC at the office premises of M/s Jindal Steel and Power Ltd and other associated offices.
"It has further been stated that as the documents seized during the course of search operation are required for the day-to-day investigation of the matter which is in progress, so permission may be granted to retain such documents in the malkhana of CBI," the court noted in its order.
"Heard. Perused. Request is allowed. However, it is directed that upon completion of investigation all the relevant documents so recovered shall be placed on record along with the final report," the judge added.
CBI had recently lodged a case of alleged cheating and corruption against Jindal Steel and Power Ltd relating to the probe into coal blocks allocated during 1993-2005 period. According to CBI, it was the 36th FIR in connection with its probe in the coal allocation scam.
The case was registered against Jindal Strips Limited (now known as Jindal Steel and Power Limited) and unnamed public officials for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating under the Indian Penal Code and various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
After lodging the FIR, CBI had carried out searches at four locations in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. CBI has said that the case pertained to allocation of Gare Palma IV/1 coal block to the firm.
CBI said the case was the outcome of a preliminary enquiry registered on September 26, 2012, for looking into allocation of coal blocks during the period 1993-2005. "It was alleged that 'Gare Palma IV/1' coal block was allocated to said private company for their sponge iron plant.
"It is, inter-alia, alleged that the company proposed and entered into irregular mining lease covering area much beyond the coordinates stipulated by Ministry of Coal, resorted to excess coal mining and irregular regularisation of area beyond coordinates," CBI had said.
The company has also been accused of indulging in "excess coal mining, sale of raw coal, sale of coal fines and middling to other than specified end-users, irregular permission for consumption of coal in expansion of kilns and other related allegations," it had said. The company had earlier said that all its actions were in keeping with the legal framework and that it complied with the law in letter and spirit.
The company is already facing CBI probe for alleged cheating and misrepresentation of facts in bagging the Amarkonda Murgadangal block in Jharkhand in 2008. Company Chairman and former Congress MP Naveen Jindal has been questioned by CBI over Amarkonda Murgadangal block allocation.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."

Give preference to existing coal block allottees in auction: AssochamGive preference to existing coal block allottees in auction: Assocham

New Delhi, October 27:  
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) has suggested that the Government should give preference to companies that have an operational or soon to be operational end-use project but have had their coal blocks cancelled.
Assocham has written to the Prime Minister’s Office saying that coal blocks already allotted for end-use steel projects should be auctioned only for steel projects while those for power projects should be auctioned only for power projects.
“The reserve price and upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable resource and not on the basis of geological reserves,” said the industry chamber in a statement.
“Clearances accorded to the existing coal blocks should automatically get transferred to the new allottees. Obtaining these clearances again will lead to considerable delays in commencement of production from mines and adversely affect the end-use project,” the statement added.

IDBI Federal Life to step up focus on group insurance  online productsIDBI Federal Life to step up focus on group insurance, online products
G Naga Sridhar
Want to be a multi-channel company, says CEO
Hyderabad, October 27:  
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Company is entering the group insurance space and also planning to file for an online product soon, according to its Chief Executive Officer and whole-time director, Vighnesh Shahane.
“We want to be a multi-channel company and these are areas which are growing in the industry,” Shahane told BusinessLine.
The company, which is a joint venture between the IDBI Bank, Federal Bank and European insurance major Ageas, is also building up a team for promoting its group insurance products. IDBI Federal Life now has an over 11,000-strong agency, besides a direct sales force of 250.
On the positive sentiment in the industry , the CEO said: “This is driven by a positive regulatory regime at the moment, the buzz about increase in the Foreign Direct Investment limit to 49 per cent and a stable political situation.”
The life insurance industry might register single-digit growth in the current financial year, he added. However, Shahane also sees challenges for the industry in the form trust deficit and sustaining cost-rationalisation ratios.
Interest in ULIPs returning
The unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs), which witnessed a steep fall after the regulator had brought in new norms, including cap on commission for agents in 2010, are also staging a comeback. “We can’t exactly quantify this at the moment but there is greater awareness on ULIPs now than earlier among the customers,” he added.
Recently, the bank-allied company launched a unit-linked endowment product christened Wealthsurance Suvidha Growth Insurance Plan aimed at the first-time ULIP customer and two other plans that offer guaranteed returns.
On capitalisation plans, he said there was no immediate need for the capital as the solvency margin was 472 per cent for the company as against the regulatory requirement of 150 per cent.
Claims
IDBI Federal’s claims settlement ratio was 90 per cent last financial year. The repudiation ratio came to down to 5.47 per cent during the period as against 16 per cent in the previous year.
“We have also recently launched eight-day claim settlement guarantee. If a claim is not settled within this period, we will pay 8 per cent interest on death benefit,” Shahane said.
The guarantee is applicable if the policy has completed two years from the date of the policy inception to date of death of the life insurance and if the claim did not warrant any further investigation.

Indian Army celebrates 65th InfantryDayPrint
By: Express News Service | Udhampur | Posted: October 27, 2014 9:02 pm
To remember and honour all those members of the Infantry who made the supreme sacrifice fighting Pakistani Raiders in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947, the Indian Army celebrated 65th Infantry Day with traditional solemnity and gaiety all across the Northern Command on Monday.
Lt General HJS Sachdev, Chief of Staff of the Northern Command, laid wreath on the “Dhruva Shahid Smarak’’ in Udhampur, the defence ministry spokesman based at Udhampur based Northern Command Headquarters, Colonel S D Goswami said. Similar memorial services were held all over the state, he said, adding that the celebrations were marked by laying of wreath at war memoraisl, sainik sammelans and sainik bhojs.
October 27 is celebrated as Infantry Day by the Indian Army as it was on this day that an Infantry  Company of the First Battalion of the SIKH Regiment was airlifted from Delhi to Srinagar to liberate Kashmir from the invading tribals who were supported by Pakistan Army. This action was ordered by then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehry after Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession acceding Jammu Kashmir to India.
Another significance of October 27 is that it was on this day in 1947 that India as an independent nation was first time engaged in operations against an aggressor, the spokesman pointed out.
Giving details, the spokesman said that Pakistan Army had launched “Operation Gulmarg” in early October 1947 using tribals to annex Jammu Kashmir. Hostalities began when a tribal rebellion was instigated in Poonch in South-West Kashmir. By October 20, the Pakistan Army entered the conflict in support of tribal forces.
As nearly 5,000 tribals supported by Pakistan Army invaded Kashmir Valley from Abbottabad on October 22, Maharaja Hari Singh on October 26 signed the Instrument of Accession thus making the state an integral part of India making Nehru to order Indian Army evict the invaders. The entire campaign was predominantly Infantry centric and its commencement on October 27, 1947 is commemorated as Infantry day, the spokesman said.
In his message to the Infantry, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Northern Command and senior most Infantry officer in the region, Lt General D S Hooda, complimented all the infantrymen for the devotion to duty and indomitable spirit while working under trying and difficult conditions. He acknowledged their tremendous contribution in maintaining the sanctity of the nation’s borders and fighting terrorism in Jammu Kashmir.

In some cases in urban areas, family members were away on work when the bank representatives visited their houses. Another round of visit would be made to such houses, he said.
On October 25, banks conducted mega camps in 15 locations in the district to open accounts, he said.
Banks in the district, along with the Dakshina Kannada district administration, are planning to open accounts to all the households in the district by the first week of November. With that, the district would achieve the milestone of covering 100 per cent households under the scheme, he added.

Supreme Court panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas nearSariskaWhile barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. (Source: PTI photo)
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 9:34 pm
The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. continued…

Ever since Ebola first “arrived” in the U.S. from West Africa a few months ago via doctor Kent Brantly, an increasingly charged debate has engulfed its domestic containment policy, and now, one week ahead of the mid-term elections, a spat between federal and state governments over quarantine protocols threatens to politicise the issue further.
The latest turn of events came after Kaci Hickox, a Sierra Leone-returned nurse placed under mandatory 21-day quarantine in New Jersey despite testing negative twice for the deadly virus and not showing any symptoms, criticised the “knee-jerk reaction by politicians” to Ebola, saying, “to quarantine someone without a better plan in place, without more forethought, is just preposterous.”
Over the weekend Ms. Hickox’s lawyer said to media that she planned to file a federal lawsuit challenging her confinement as a violation of her civil rights, especially as it raised “serious constitutional and civil liberties issues… [and] the [quarantine] policy is overly broad when applied to her.”
On Monday morning, however, the New Jersey Department of Health issued a statement this morning that Ms. Hickox has been “symptom-free for the last 24 hours,” and that it decided to discharge her after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Her release appeared to be a reversal by the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who had earlier defended the quarantine order but said this week that “when she has time to reflect, she will understand” the quarantine.
Meanwhile in neighbouring New York State, Governor Andrew Cuomo revised the quarantine policy for returning health-care workers from West African nations after facing heightened pressure from the Obama administration to loosen the rules.
Explaining the protocols Mr. Cuomo said that healthcare workers who had been in contact with Ebola patients but did not show symptoms of the virus could return home but will be required to remain there while being monitored by state health officials for symptoms. They would, however, be allowed to interact with family and friends while being monitored, he added.
Meanwhile both parties appeared to be inserting the Ebola issue into their statements leading to the November 4 mid-term elections.
Republicans, who are fighting to gain control of the Senate and thus capture both houses of Congress, have focused on criticising the President Barack Obama’s response and blaming the White House for the confirmed Ebola cases on domestic soil.
Some Democrats have responded by claiming that Republican spending cuts have made the problem worse, and others accused conservatives of fear-mongering.
An poll by the Associated Press and GfK noted that Ebola was uppermost voters’ minds as Election Day approached, with 74 per cent considering it “very or extremely important, and 56 per cent expressing disapproval of the administration’s response.

The stock market’s sharp decline earlier this month was followed by a classic V-shaped rebound rally, catching many investors off guard. But can the rally last?
Last week, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rallied more than 4%, posting its best weekly gain of the year — and ending a four-week losing streak. In late-morning trading Monday the S&P 500 was down 7 points or 0.35%, to 1958.
But many investors did not expect the large-company stock index to bounce back that fast or that far, after tumbling more than 9% from its intraday high to its intraday low earlier this month amid fears of a global growth slowdown, Ebola and other market headwinds.
“If you blinked, you missed it,” is the way Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group described last week’s flash rally, which was powered by strong corporate earnings reports. Hickey’s firm supplied an intraday stock chart from Oct. 1 to Oct. 21 to show just how violent the S&P 500’s V-shaped upside reversal has been:
The S&P 500 has delivered a V-shaped recovery since its Oct. 15 intraday low. (Chart: Bespoke Investment Group)
The question now is: Can the rally last?
Citing historical data of how stocks have reacted after similar drops and sharp rebounds, the answer is there’s a good chance the rally could have legs, notes Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Lee’s research notes that the S&P 500’s current pullback from Sept. 19 to Oct. 15 was 9.8% from it intraday high to its intraday low. Following the past 49 times the S&P 500 has dipped at least 7% (but did not fall into a bear market, or a 20%-plus drop), more than half of the corrections ended after a decline of 10%. But he stresses that “markets either fall 10% or less or they continue to fall much deeper, or 20%-ish.” The fact this current pullback ended at less than 10% is a good sign, history suggests.
Historical performance data also supports the argument that stocks can rebound more than skeptics believe.
“The faster the decline, the faster the recovery,” Lee told clients in a report.
In terms of timing, Lee’s work shows that the market recovery normally takes 1.4 days for every day of a decline. So after a 10-day decline, markets normally get back to even 14 days later.
His work also shows that more than 50% of the time the S&P 500 tends to be 11% to 17% higher eight weeks after the correction bottoms.
“90% of bull market bottoms are V shaped,” Lee said.
In the chart below supplied by Fundstrat, you will notice that the median return eight weeks after a market bottom is 11%, but more often than not the gains are much larger.

Govt scraps selection process for PSU Bank Chiefs
The current selection process for the FY14 -15 stands cancelled. So the posts of eight CMDs and fourteen EDs remain vacant with immediate effect.
Post your opinion here
The government has scrapped the selection process to select the heads for PSU banks.
This has come in the wake of many bribes-for-loan scandals at state-run banks.
The current selection process for the FY14 -15 stands cancelled. So the posts of eight chairman and managing directors (CMDs)  and fourteen executive directors (EDs) remain vacant with immediate effect.
In the new selection process the RBI governor or his nominees (at least of a rank of deputy governor of RBI) will be part of the selection process.
The government is committed to filling up the all these vacancies expeditiously but the exact details of the selection process are not yet known and will be notified shortly.
This decision was as per the committee recommendation which had been constituted to relook at the entire matter and the RBI governor was also part of it.

Mumbai, October 27:  
The Shiv Sena has decided to bury the hatchet and team up with the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra. The change in mindset was reflected in a “soft” editorial published in Monday’s edition of Saamana, the Sena’s newspaper that is often considered its mouthpiece.
The daily is usually used as a platform to take positions on important social and political issues by the party’s bigwigs. Its tone reflects the thinking of the party leadership. It may be recalled that during the election and the results announcement, the Saamana, in its editorials, had repeatedly attacked the BJP leadership.
In Monday’s editorial, however, the Sena said that rather than the Congress and the NCP, it is better to have a BJP government.
Obliquely referring to the issue of a separate Vidarbha State, which has been supported by a few BJP leaders, the editorial stuck to its stand of not splitting Maharashtra. It said the new Chief Minister should put aside his political views and work for the unity of the State.
In the past, the Shiv Sena has vehemently opposed the formation of Vidarbha on the lines of Telangana. It had warned that such a move could lead to dissatisfaction among the people.
The editorial said that on Laxmi Pooja day (October 23), Maharashtra BJP president Devendra Fadnavis met Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and took his blessings. Later, Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings. All these blessings are important, the editorial said, adding that the support of the people is the most important.
It further said Gadkari has the requisite experience to become the CM, but the final decision would be taken by the high command in Delhi.
Although Fadnavis has no experience in governance, the editorial said, he has a good grip on legislative matters.
The editorial summarised that the Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who would take Maharashtra ahead.

Trilokpuri violence is part of a pre-poll pattern  says Delhi CongressTrilokpuri violence is part of a pre-poll pattern, says Delhi Congress

Charges levelled Delhi Congress leaders coming out of the police headquarters after meeting the Police Commissioner on the Trilokpuri riot issue, in New Delhi on Monday. SHANKER CHAKRAVARTY
Accuses Centre of inaction, connivance
New Delhi, October 27:  
The Congress has demanded the resignation of Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Lieutenant General of Delhi Najeeb Jung over the recent violence in the Trilokpuri area of Delhi.
Trilokpuri witnessed riots and communal tension last week following a petty altercation between some Dalits and Muslims on Diwali evening.
The Congress alleged that Rajnath and Jung were inactive and soft towards the perpetuators of violence despite intelligence agencies giving prior information about possible violence in the area.
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said there was a pattern in the violence. “We are very sad but very forthright in asking why is this pattern, this repetition, this systemic pattern occurring before elections in so many parts of the country with monotonous regularity, especially in the last five months or so. We condemn this, we want to tell the nation that what is happening is a combination of subtle imagery of hidden symbolism, of innuendo, of insinuation, of provocation all this is made into a cocktail to create a surcharged atmosphere,” he said.
Singhvi further said the “violence” pattern used across the country is unmistakable. “It is deplorable, it is condemnable and it is especially condemnable because it is under the nose of the Central Government, the Home Minister and the Prime Minster. And Delhi, as you know, remains in suspended animation,” he said.
He questioned the role of former BJP MLA Sunil Kumar Vaidya in the incident. “At the minimum an impartial, independent enquiry by an unconnected third entity is necessary. What is the role of Sunil Kumar Vaidya needs to be answered.
“Why this blame game and back-forth transfer of allegations about advance information supposedly given by the Central Government to Delhi Police, and either not acted upon or not received, according to the letter?” he asked.
He added that the AAP MLAs from the area were silent about the happenings in Trilokpuri.

BJP drive to expand party strengthBJP drive to expand party strength

Modi will renew membership as part of initiative
New Delhi, October 27:  
Determined to convert its electoral success into expanding the party’s mass base, the BJP is set to launch a new membership drive to add “recording-breaking” numbers to its current strength of 3.5 crore members.
To launch the drive, titled “Sashakt BJP, Sashakt Bharat”, on November 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s membership will be renewed by party president Amit Shah, who too will renew his primary membership.
Besides manually filling membership forms, the party will facilitate the drive by encouraging online/mobile registration. To inaugurate this service, Modi will send a text message to Shah and renew his membership.
“We have found a new strength and, in Narendra Modi, a true mass leader. People want to follow him and the BJP will make all efforts to convert this enthusiasm into a mass movement for a transformation in the national character.
“The party will find a new strength. We expect people to join en masse,” said BJP general secretary JP Nadda at a press conference here.
According to Nadda, the new members will be automatically located and linked to their respective polling booths to aid in the party’s efforts to strengthen its base from the primary electoral unit.
To hold workshops
The BJP is holding three separate workshops — the first to cover its southern and western units on November 29 in Bangalore, the second for northern and central units in Delhi on November 30, and the third in Kolkata to cover the eastern and north-eastern units.
However, the party does not seem to have a screening process for its new members.
“For the moment, the priority is to increase our strength. The process of filtering and screening new members gets automatically done when primary members become active members,” said Nadda.

Party retains tough stance against likely ally Shiv Sena
New Delhi/Mumbai, October 27:  
In the ongoing political brinkmanship in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena seemed more willing on Monday to cede ground to the BJP.
Giving nothing away, BJP leaders in Delhi maintained that the party is ready to run a minority government if the Sena is not willing to join the alliance unconditionally.
At present, the BJP holds all the cards for two main reasons — the outside support offered by Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and the fact that without the BJP’s support, the Sena cannot continue to rule the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) besides many other local bodies.
However, the tough posturing does not rule out the possibility of the Sena joining the State Government. After all, the BJP has not yet withdrawn support to the Sena in the BMC. Nor has it sacked Sena minister Anant Geete from the Union Cabinet.
These, and the fact that Sena MPs were invited to a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, indicate that the BJP is still open to the Sena joining the government in Maharashtra.
For the moment, the party is tight-lipped on how far negotiations with the Sena have progressed. “There is no negotiation. The Sena basically has no option. They will come around before the swearing-in,” said a BJP source.
The BJP’s central observers, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and party general secretary JP Nadda, will visit Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon.
The Maharashtra BJP legislature party is scheduled to meet at 4 pm on Tuesday, when it will elect its leader. In all likelihood, Devendra Fadnavis will be elected and his perceived rival Nitin Gadakari may propose his name, apparently to snuff factionalism in the party.
Following the meeting of the legislature party, the party will stake its claim to form the government. It may happen on Tuesday night or the next day, October 29. The Maharashtra government is expected to be sworn in by Friday.
Meanwhile, the Sena was clearly showing signs of recognising the BJP’s dominant role in the alliance. It admitted that the Chief Minister’s post belongs to the BJP.
“On the day of Laxmi Pooja, (Devendra) Fadnavis met (Nitin) Gadkari and took his blessings. Later Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings.
“All these blessings are undoubtedly important, but the blessings of the people are the most important. Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who will take Maharashtra ahead with the blessings of the people,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.
BJP MLA is dead
Even as the BJP was preparing for government formation, it received a setback in the sudden death of the party’s newly-elected MLA, Govind Rathod. He passed away late on Sunday evening following a massive heart attack, bringing down the strength of the BJP in the Maharashtra Assembly to 121.
Rathod was elected to Assembly from Mukhed, near Nanded city. He suffered a stroke while travelling on Devgiri Express to Mumbai. After the attack, he was admitted to a hospital in Jalna, central Maharashtra, but did not survive.
Fadnavis, along with other leaders, hurriedly cancelled all previous engagements and rushed to Mukhed on Monday.
Rathod’s sudden death led the party to reschedule the swearing in ceremony to Friday, party sources said.
It was earlier planned for Wednesday morning.

Centre to link mobile SIM with Aadhaar numberCentre to link mobile SIM with Aadhaar number
IANS   New Delhi, October 27, 2014

The central government is working hard to link mobile SIM with the Unique Identification (UID) number or Aadhaar, a senior official said in New Delhi on Monday.
"The prime minister (Narendra Modi) has directed us to link the SIM of the mobiles with the Unique Id. We are working on that issue and I am sure we will be able to resolve issues," said RS Sharma, secretary of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology.
"The idea is the mobile should become a very very strong factor in authentication and also a factor for getting information and transaction. If that happens, then it will an enable and empowering tool for the people of India," he said.
Sharma was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Communications and Information Technology Ministry.
He said the secretary of the department of telecom is having deliberations with various departments to facilitate the work of linking mobile SIM with Aadhaar cards. This project is a part of the Digital India programme.
"The programme that has been envisaged by Digital India will boost more ecommerce in India. We are standing in the cusp of digital revolution," Sharma said.
Speaking about his recent visit to South Korea, Sharma said: "We went to South Korea to promote domestic manufacturing of electronics in the country."
"As you know, the government has come up with a policy that gives a lot of financial incentives - both in terms of taxes and also in terms of investment incentives to establish industry - both for individuals as also for clusters."
"So, we had gone to South Korea to meet with the industry leaders there," Sharma said.
"Specifically, we met LG and Samsung and number of other industrial leaders and we emphasised to them that it will make sense to produce in India not only for domestic market, which is so huge, but also to export from India to other neighbouring countries," he said.
Sharma added that the companies have all formulated groups "which will come here and they will interact with us".

Bangalore: 2 questioned for  fake  love jihad flyerComments
Bangalore police have questioned two men in connection with a pamphlet which urges Muslim men to marry women of other religions for "generous rewards" and has been circulating in the city through WhatsApp and emails.
The police have not registered a case yet but believe the pamphlet is fake and intended to create communal discord by urging Muslims to wage love jihad, a term coined by Hindu right wing groups for an alleged conspiracy by Muslims to abduct, seduce and elope with Hindu girls for the sole purpose of conversion.
The affidavit lists a rate card: the highest reward of Rs. 5 lakh is for marrying a Brahmin girl and the lowest, of Rs. 1.5 lakh, is for a Buddhist girl. "We the students of Muslim Youth Forum give a call to you to indulge yourself in love jihad mission for universe and global Islam,” says the pamphlet and provides a list of postal addresses, email IDs and phone numbers for further information.
While most of the phone numbers start with the country code, +92 (Pakistan), the postal addresses belong to the Muslim political organization Popular Front of India. The Bangalore, Kozhikode and Chennai offices of the organization have been listed on the pamphlet.
“We would have to be either extremely foolish or some sort of extremist underground organization to circulate a pamphlet like this and provide our own office address. This is the handiwork of the same Hindutva organisations that are spreading the fiction of Love Jihad,” said Abdul Wahid Sait, the PFI’s Karnataka President.
Sait said that the pamphlet had come to the PFI’s notice a few weeks ago. “We promptly reported it to the police but there has been no action,” said Naseeruddin a PFI activist. Additional Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar confirmed that two men had been questioned but said, “A case has not been registered as we have not yet received a formal complaint. We don’t want to take it up suo motu.”
“The same pamphlet had appeared on the official website of the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti in 2011. It was taken off after we lodged a police complaint in Kozhikode,” said A Mohammed Yusuff, a member of the PFI’s national executive.
Abdul Shakoor, the Kozhikode-based PFI activist, who lodged the police complaint, said, “The (Kerala) police have said that they could not trace the origin of pamphlet. But we have clear evidence to link some Hindu extremist organisations and activists. We will be filing a private complaint before the court with all the evidence in November.”
While the pamphlet has been received as evidence of Love Jihad by those inclined to such a view, it has also amused those who have been following the politics of the PFI over the years.
“Just like the Sangh Parivar, the PFI is also vehemently opposed to inter-religious marriages. In Coastal Karnataka, PFI followers have often attacked Hindu-Muslim couples. So we find hilarious that they are being accused of promoting such alliances. If anything, they should be prosecuted for their moral policing,” said Muneer Katipalla, the State President of the leftwing Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI).

Couple from northeast assaulted in Bangalore  asked to leave IndiaNow, a Nagaland couple assaulted in Bangalore

Days after the Manipuri student Michael Haokip was assaulted for not knowing Kannada, another couple from Nagaland was assaulted on the outskirts of the city by four men who called them "foreigners" and "NRI".
The victims, who requested the media for anonymity, have said in their complaint to the police that the man was punched and the woman slapped by them.
Although the attack happened on Saturday, the issue came to light on Monday after the arrest of the four men. They have been identified as Rathan, Mahesh, Harish and Ananth. Mahesh, Harish and Ananth are software engineers and Rathan owns a gym.
Getting these men booked, however, was hardly an easy task for the couple. They were turned back from two police stations they visited by policemen who refused to register a complaint.
They finally approached the nodal police officer appointed to address grievances of people from the northeast states living in Karnataka. The FIR was registered only on Sunday afternoon, more than 24 hours after the incident.
Narrating the horror, the Nagamese man told reporters that he had gone for a drive with his wife and their friend to a picturesque part of the city when their car had a flat tyre.
As they tried to repair the car, they were approached by four men who came in a SUV.
The victims claimed that the men called them NRIs and foreigners and demanded to know what they were doing at such a lonely spot. Soon, they started pushing the man around and when the woman intervened, she too was slapped.
"They kept repeating that we should leave India," said the man, who is a software engineer and has lived in the city for 13 years.
Although home minister KJ George avoided the media, sources in his office said that an enquiry will be conducted to ascertain why the police delayed the FIR.

'Over the last three decades, people have become so aware of the connection between health and food.'
Back in 1995, CEO  Gary Hirshberg  told Inc. about a “friendly note” on every yogurt container Stonyfield Farm sold that encouraged customers to contact his company. Today, the channels of communication may have changed — along with nearly everything else in the U.S.  food and beverage  industry — but the importance of tapping into consumers' experiences and expectations hasn't. Inc. discussed these makeovers with the industry's veterans and newcomers.
In a conversation with  Bo Burlingham.
One study shows 90 percent of consumers are choosing local, at least occasionally. - Gary Hirshberg
WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT “THE FOOD REVOLUTION.” HAS THERE REALLY BEEN ONE AND, IF SO, HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT? 
Gary Hirshberg: No question there's been one. When we started selling organic yogurt in 1983, nobody knew what we were talking about. I often say, we had a wonderful business back then; we just had no supply and no demand. But the world has changed. People want a high-quality product, whether it's in a restaurant or by a processor or from a farm. They want it produced by somebody they trust. And they are demanding transparency. One study shows 90 percent of consumers are choosing local, at least occasionally. It's no longer just in the top foodie markets like New York and San Francisco. Now, it's everywhere.
Danny Meyer: I think one sign of the food revolution is that people like us chose to get into this business. None of our parents would have said, “My son, the future lawyer, should really open a restaurant, or a brewery, or a tea company.”

Myra Goodman: I look at it a little bit more from the consumer perspective. When my husband and I started Earthbound Farm in 1984, our choice to go organic really came from learning about the chemicals used in farming. We were just personally afraid to use these chemicals and eat food grown with them, and we didn't want to sell this food from our roadside stands to our consumers. People thought we were pretty crazy. But over the last three decades, people have become so aware of the connection between health and food. They realize you can really improve your health with your diet.
Ari Weinzweig: Yes, but remember, there are whole parts of the country that wouldn't know what we're talking about. Many of us live in a bubble. In our world, without question, people are much more interested in traditionally made foods and food that tastes better, and they don't mind spending money for it. The cheeses that were really high-end when we opened in 1982 are now supermarket offerings. The stuff we had back then that was pretty good, we wouldn't even carry anymore, because our market has evolved so much.
Steve Hindy: When I started selling Brooklyn Lager in New York City in 1988, a lot of people almost spit it out. They said, “My God! It's so dark and bitter. Why don't you make a beer like Heineken?” Today, Brooklyn Lager is considered a mainstream, entry-level craft beer.

Seth Goldman: I see people connecting the dots. They want to understand who's involved, all the way down to picking the tea leaves, and then all the way to the other side: What happens to the package? As Gary likes to say, “There's no such thing as ‘away.’” So where does it go once it's done? We're now owned by Coca-Cola, and they have really embraced this change. They have to, because it's going to happen with them or without them. I don't think Coca-Cola is intrinsically a company trying to create more demand for organic beverages, but they're supporting Honest Tea's distribution and growth. As a result of what we're doing, when we become larger, we are helping to create more demand for organic beverages.
Weinzweig: Yes, and you have companies like Chipotle coming into the middle of the market. For fast food, it is very high-end. That raises the bar as well, which is great. I think people will continue to eat better food because it tastes better, and you feel better. The challenge is that most people haven't really experienced it.
Meyer: And remember that McDonald's owned around 90 percent of Chipotle at one time. I'm not sure Chipotle would otherwise have had the fuel it needed to become the independent company that has, more than any other company, changed what America expects from fast food.
People will give you one shot. If it’s not yummy, they’re not coming back. - Danny Meyer
Matt Salzberg: Food is just more fun now. You look at the Food Network and the rise of celebrity chefs, and food is a lot more aspirational, from a consumer perspective, than it used to be. Our customers at Blue Apron are actually a part of our product. We deliver recipes and ingredients, and then they cook at home. A lot of what we sell is that experience of cooking and being closer to your food and having fun while doing it, trying new things, trying new recipes, trying new ingredients. People find that variety to be fun, and I think that's also what's driving a lot of the innovation in food products. There's just greater interest in food than ever before.
HOW HAS THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CHANGED?
Meyer: People are interested in customizing their experiences in life, whether it's on a mobile phone with their apps or what they ask for in a restaurant. It's almost like, “Yeah, I see your menu, but here's how I'm going to eat.” The whole experience has changed. It used to be that when someone reserved a table for four at 8 o'clock, you could expect four people. Today a table for four is really a table for eight: four people plus their cell phones, for taking photographs. It's almost unusual if people are not photographing their food and then sharing it in real time with someone else who is not physically present.
Hirshberg: I'm not sure how many people are photographing my yogurt, but there's no question that the consumer has shifted on us as well. People switch to eating more organic for two reasons: having children and having a health event, usually cancer, which is not a good thing but does work in the favor of organics. These shifts create opportunities. Look at Greek yogurt. It wasn't even here five or six years ago, and now it's 50 percent of the category. On the yogurt shelf and the tea shelf, we're seeing far more diversity, far more choice, and I think social media has had a lot to do with it. We producers are now able, without expensive market research, to get a sense of what our consumer wants, in real time.
Hindy: I agree that social media has had a huge impact. You can start a little brewery in the middle of nowhere today, and everyone you want to reach will know about it before it even opens.
8
Salzberg: Our business probably wouldn't have existed without social media. Blue Apron is an Internet business. We have a direct relationship with our customers every week. A huge percentage of our new customers come from referrals from friends, from photos on Facebook, from the constant communication that we have back and forth with our customers on our website. In the process, we're building up trust, which has been really important from a marketing perspective, because there's so much competition and so many choices. A lot of consumers now are looking for a curated experience, and that's one of the things that we built into our model. Every week we offer some choice and some preferences, taking into account people's dietary restrictions and the like. But for a lot of people, it's actually a liberating experience to say, “Hey, we trust your brand. We believe you will do a good job managing our refrigerator and helping plan our meals.” The constant communication is one of the things that really drives the emotional connection and the affinity that people have for our business.
0
Meyer: Let's not forget that discovery has always been a huge part of the joy of eating. In the old days, if I discovered a dish I had never heard about before, I had to work really hard — without the benefit of a GPS or a language translator — to find the recipe somewhere, bring it back, and figure out how to get the ingredients to cook it the right way. Today, it's harder and harder to discover something that the rest of the world has not already discovered and broadcast via social media. That's a challenge to the people who are bushwhackers in the field. They take all the initial wind in their face and establish a brand, and the thanks they get is 25 upstart competitors who actually benefit from being new.
IS IT HARDER OR EASIER TO START A FOOD BUSINESS TODAY?
Hirshberg: Much easier. Most of us were thought of as crazy people when we started. Now, people demand the kind of craftsmanship we're all bringing to the table. And with social media, you can get the word out much more easily.
Goodman: The opportunities are there with social media, with people looking for the discovery Danny's talking about. Also, small companies are so much more agile, and they can create custom products. There are the people who have allergies or are sensitive to gluten and don't want to eat certain grains. There are so many custom diets that food companies can respond to and develop a little niche in. You also have big companies looking for entrepreneurs to do their innovation.
Goldman: I guess it's easier, but in my industry it's all about distribution, which is really challenging to break into. It's not hard to start a company. Today there's money, a lot of ideas and opportunities, but it's hard to scale, because distribution is so consolidated and shelf space so limited. We see a lot of companies get up and running, but then can't figure out how to cross over into profitability and scale their supply chain.
Hindy: The beer industry is different, though. Today, big beer distributors from coast to coast are very aggressively pursuing craft brewers, and that's a sea change. We had to distribute our own beer and a lot of other craft beers here in New York City for 15 years, because the big distributors wouldn't give us the time of day.
Salzberg: Before starting Blue Apron, I was in the venture capital business, and I spent a lot of time looking at people starting companies. It's without a doubt easier today than it's been in the past. Capital is available, and you need less of it to get started. Food is actually a little more capital-intensive than the typical business, but capital costs are coming down. And there's more risk taking in the work force. In the past, it was difficult to attract people to an unknown young company. Today, it's often an advantage for early companies, because people are excited to join you if they care about your cause.
Meyer: When I first got into business, there was a statistic that two out of every three restaurants would fail in the first six months. Why? Because it took at least a year for people to figure out that you were there. Today, you could get photographed looking at a vacant store and read that night on some food blog that you're opening a restaurant. That leads to the opposite problem for us. When we launch a restaurant, we are not nearly as good as we will become. So it's easier to launch, but there is so much early attention that you're at risk of exposing yourself more quickly than you like. Because people will give you one shot. If it's not yummy, they're not coming back.
Hindy: Beer drinkers were very forgiving to the first wave of craft brewers, who didn't yet have it right. Today, people know what craft beer is, what it's supposed to taste like. If it doesn't, they're not going to buy it a second time. So the bar's a lot higher for quality, but people keep pouring into this business. What's interesting is the success rate. If you take all the production breweries from Day One, 70 percent of them are still in business, and 50 percent of the brewery-restaurants are still in business. There will definitely be a reckoning one of these days, but I think it's going to take a while.

Where the wildflowers areYumthang overrun by tube lousewort. Thingnam Girija
Lofty ideals: A stark corner of the Lachung Valley. Mahima Jain
In the sleepy valleys and villages of north Sikkim, the landscape may be cold, stark and imposing, but the people are quite the opposite
We are on the eastern range of the Himalayas in north Sikkim. Winding, potholed roads crisscross steep slopes, with our destination nowhere in sight. Waterfalls and brooks appear more frequently than roadside eateries and villages; one is even nicknamed the Amitabh Bachchan waterfall.
The tributaries of Teesta, and often the Teesta herself, are our silent companions, flowing at times along the road, and at others, gushing in the deep ravines below.
Nepali songs play in the background as villages, snow-capped peaks and Buddhist flags pass us by. We make a quick stop for momos and chai. And then it begins all over again. Lachung is a long way off.
Lachung, primarily an agricultural village, opened for tourists in the early ’90s. And what it offers is rather simple: a chance to go off the grid and explore nature’s contradictions.
There is no network coverage — save for some sporadic BSNL connectivity — making it a perfect hideaway for those who seek quiet.
Lachung, or small pass, is almost 110km from Gangtok, and the eight-hour journey requires a permit because of the village-town’s proximity to the China border. Locals, called Lachungpas, mostly Bhutias and Lepchas, say there are less than 2,500 people and around 400 houses in Lachung. At 8,200ft, resources are scarce and the military presence heavy.
It is evening by the time we make it to Lachung. The ‘hotel’ is small. After handing over the keys, the sole manager-cum-housekeeper warns, “Madam, if you look for luxury and comfort, this is hell, but if you look for nature and peace, this is jannat (heaven).” His former claim turns out to be too self-deprecatory. The place has a decent television set, running water and clean beds and towels, though there is no room heater, hot water or room service.
Next morning, we head to the Yumthang Valley (13,800ft), the Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary and Yumesamdong (Zero Point at 15,300ft). These destinations are only a couple of hours away and the drive is a visual treat, the scenery alternating between monochrome and technicolour.
The sanctuary and the Yumthang Valley are a riot of colours. Rhododendrons and Himalayan wildflowers, Buddhist prayer flags, and tiny huts made of wood and tin dot the grassy river banks and slopes. Local stalls offering Tibetan and Buddhist memorabilia, Maggi noodles, Old Monk, and winterwear for hire, slowly give way to sombre military outposts.
Yumesamdong is grave, black and white. A perpetual cover of clouds casts a shadow over the freezing upper course of the river that makes its way across a rocky plain with bare snow-capped mountains framing and feeding it. A gloomy path to nowhere lies ahead. The temperature in Lachung and its surrounding areas can be sub-zero in winter. But Yumesamdong is colder still. Often, snow and thick ice abruptly block the road leading to it.
No one lives near or beyond this region — often referred to as ‘no man’s land’ — so no one really bothers to clear the road either. The landscape is cold, stark and imposing, but the people are quite the opposite. It is perhaps, the warmth of the Lachungpas alone that keeps the place humane.
We leave Yumesamdong and descend to the more welcoming Yumthang Valley and the Shingba Sanctuary. There are various flower-trails here and a day is too short to explore everything. Over the years, these valleys and the Lachungpas have hosted many botany enthusiasts, who have visited the region to record and collect samples of plants.
The first such explorer to travel through Sikkim was Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, a Victorian botanist and former director of Britain’s Kew Gardens, who was also known for his collaborations with Charles Darwin and Sir James Clark Ross, who explored the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
The Joseph Hooker Correspondence Project, currently underway and supported by Kew, is now working towards digitising his letters and other works. A post by Virgina Mills, the project coordinator, explains that Hooker was in Sikkim between 1848 and 1849, looking for ‘plant treasure’ to send back to his father William Hooker, Kew’s first director. He discovered 25 new species of rhododendron that were added to the collection at Kew.
Joseph Hooker, an amateur artist who sketched the flowers and landscapes he saw and made Sikkim’s first map, is also believed to have started and fuelled the craze for rhododendrons in British gardens.
The fascination for rhododendrons and Himalayan flowers hasn’t diminished in the 21st century. Back home, I search for and find a modern-day Joseph Hooker. Tabish Qureshi, professor of physics at Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi and self-professed anthomaniac, visited Yumthang Valley and the Sanctuary in June 2011 to observe and document the flowers.
Rhododendrons bloom in April-May, Himalayan flowers in June. Qureshi, who is the founder of the website flowersofindia.net, says his companions and he spotted the rare Himalayan Yellow Poppy in full bloom. In one visit, lasting only a couple of hours, he noticed flowers such as white and blue avens, Griffith’s cobra lily, yellow buttercups and cinqefoils, pink geraniums and pedicularis (or louseworts), forget-me-nots, red Himalayan strawberries, Himalayan roses and Webb’s rose, to name a few.
Even if one needs a handbook to identify the flowers in the vast valley, the simple pleasure of walking down to the river, sitting on a boulder surrounded by blooms and watching the clouds playing hide-and-seek with the Himalayas is unparalleled.
Having spent more time admiring the Himalayan peaks, we are left with little time for the flower trails in Yumthang. Since these are largely deserted areas, it is mandatory to return by late noon. We are just beginning to appreciate the valley and the walk to the river, when we are ushered back to our car.
The next day, during the arduous journey back to Gangtok, I am reminded of how Hooker must have travelled more than a century ago, and the thought makes the bad roads appear less hostile. A few hours out of Lachung, the mobiles start buzzing, and the silence offered by the monochrome and technicolour landscapes is now far behind. It is time to switch on and stay connected.

These Are the Best Countries For ExpatsIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: India is among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of expat quality of life, as lower living costs and good perks for families make the country an attractive expat destination, says an HSBC report.
India was ranked ninth on the Expat Explorer overall league table, which was topped by Switzerland, followed by Singapore and China in second and third place, respectively.
Many expatriates (expats) in India said they were able to benefit from cheaper living costs and they find the country a great destination for bringing up a family.
The report noted that many expats in economies like Brazil, Turkey, or India were sent by their company, highlighting a trend for corporations to take advantage of these growth hotspots by relocating their employees abroad.
Interestingly, 60 per cent of expat respondents living in India and China agreed that their host country is getting better as a place to live and work.
Others in the top 10 expat destinations include, Germany (fourth), Bahrain (fifth), New Zealand (sixth), Thailand (seventh), Taiwan (eighth) and Hong Kong (10th).
India was ranked sixth in the 'Raising Children Abroad' league tables. Around 44 per cent of expats said that the cost of raising children in India is lower than in their home country.
Besides raising a family, many expats in India also reported greater savings on everyday expenses and a better work/life balance when compared to their home countries.
However, four in ten expats in India said local work culture was "difficult to get used to".
"India is fun, exciting and varied - and that can sometimes mean challenging too," an expat in India told the survey.
In terms of expat-salaries, Asia dominated the list, with an average annual expat wage of $120,000, way higher than the global average of $92,000.
In terms of top economic concerns for expats, more than a third (35 per cent) said job security posed the greatest risk to their financial wellbeing, followed by the state of the local economy (33 per cent) and the health of the global economy (27 per cent).
When looking at why expats are taking the plunge to move abroad, this year the most frequently cited reason was to improve career prospects.
For those looking for better job prospects, the Middle East remains the place to be. Around two in three expats said they moved to Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for better job prospects, the report said.
The study was commissioned by HSBC Expat and conducted by third party research company YouGov, who surveyed 9,288 expats through an online questionnaire.

PSU refiners ‘must strategise’ better to improve margins
Richa Mishra
Minister Of State (Independent Charge) Petroleum, Dharmendra Pradhan
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan says companies must diversify crude basket, upgrade plants for superior price realisation
With the contentious issue of gas pricing and diesel deregulation behind him, Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of State (Indepenédent Charge) Ministry for Petroleum & Natural Gas, is now focussed on coming out with a mechanism that will help PSU refiners source crude oil at better rates and enhance their gross refinery margin (GRM).
Clear that oil and gas sector will be dominated by public sector entities, Pradhan, in conversation with BusinessLine just before leaving for Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, said the Government is only a facilitator. Commercial decisions have to be taken by companies. As with other fuel prices, every six months gas rates will also be decided by the companies based on the formula set out by the Government, he said. Edited Excerpts:
With two critical issues sorted out, are you now turning to the PSU refiners’ crude oil sourcing mechanism?
The spot crude oil sourcing mechanism should be dynamic. When market dynamics are in play, they will have to strategise how to source crude oil cheap and improve their refinery margins. Any business entity has to look into the cost of production and raw materials. These are the two aspects where things can be reworked according to the market dynamics.
Earlier, there was a limitation on processing of crude varieties due to their refinery configurations. But there are new technologies that allow refineries to process different kinds of crude. The PSU refineries should be in a position to process crude from Latin America to Africa. They need to not only diversify their crude basket but also upgrade their refineries to make it possible for them to get a better price realisation.
But experts say some of the PSU refineries have outlived their life…
It is true that the refineries are old, but technology is available. Each refinery will have its own benefits no matter how old it is. When market dynamics are in play, the refiners have to see how they can deliver the product at competitive rates. The GRM of PSUs is low and they need to improve it. The efficiency needs to go up and the way to do that is to bring technology and a smart economically viable procurement model for crude.
Is the Government open to public-private tie-ups for fuel retailing?
The private sector is satisfied with diesel de-regulation and has renewed its interest in retailing. The Government will not interfere if PSU oil marketing companies enter into joint ventures for retailing. They are into joint ventures for refineries, aren’t they?
Are you reworking the subsidy mechanism? (The subsidy burden will be restricted to LPG and kerosene now. ONGC disinvestment will be impacted by the subsidy issue.)
How the delivery mechanism for LPG subsidy will come, we are in discussions with the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG is a technology to deliver the subsidy. Right now, the subsidy is going to the companies. We plan to give it to the consumer directly.  Both diesel decontrol and Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG will help reduce the subsidy burden. If the subsidy burden overall comes down, then ONGC will also benefit. Once the burden comes down, then the sharing arrangement can also be reworked.
When is the tenth edition of oil and gas exploration licensing rounds to be announced?
Going by the experience of the previous nine rounds, we want to come out with a better system now. We have realised that availability of strong seismic data, a clarity on fiscal regime — whether revenue share or production sharing besides some administrative issues need to be resolved before we launch NELP-X. This is no breaking news so I can’t give a timeline.

Nows the time to buy cheaper growth storiesAnand Shah, CIO, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund
The CIO of BNP Paribas Mutual Fund is upbeat on private sector banks, cement and telecom
Markets will take a price correction over the next one year, before the actual execution of the Government's plans sparks the next jump, according to Anand Shah, CIO, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund. He believes that now is the right time to buy cheaper growth stories than pay too much premium for a safer bet.
What do you make of market valuations and earnings now?
Today, even after such a sharp run-up, the one-year forward price-earnings multiple is much lower. The market is just coming back to its mean multiple; it has not run up beyond its normal zone.
Still, this surge has come much before the actual earnings growth. Either there may be a price correction for the next one year or consolidation around these levels.
We believe economic recovery will be slow and gradual. Over the next two years, we’ll move to a 5.6 to 6 per cent growth in GDP. Along with that, inflation will slow down a little and we will see the start of the interest rate cycle cut. Then, in the next 12 to 18 months, there will be some visibility of earnings growth going back to where it historically used to be.
There can be sectors where, along with the volume growth that can give margin expansion, utilisation will improve and there will be a lot of operating leverage. For these sectors, over the next few years, even if the topline growth is 14-15 per cent, earnings growth can actually be around 18 per cent.
Isn’t the market already factoring all this in?
The big driver of the market a year-and-a-half later would be the actual execution of the new Government. That will lead to visibility of GDP growth, investment cycle revival, in turn leading to quicker earnings growth. I agree that for the market to rerate further, we need earnings growth visibility. And that hinges on the execution — that is, if expectation of government policies is pushing the market now, the actual execution will be the trigger, going ahead.
And this is coming out of the stagnation we’ve seen in the past five years. Assuming, of course, that execution happens.
What is the future of beleaguered sectors such as mining?
Frankly, it’s a tough call. You have to be very select in these sectors. Not all companies will be able to come out of the trouble they are in. Only a select few which have worthwhile operational assets and capex stuck only because of regulations will see some recovery. In fact, it’s not a sector call at all, but very stock-specific.
So which are the sector calls?
The simplest story is private sector banks. In the last 15 years or so, they have grown faster than the banking industry. And banking itself grows faster than the nominal GDP.
Another sector where the worst is really behind is telecom. Over the last six quarters, there has been a lot of sanity in pricing, lower discounts, improvement in realisations, expansion in margins and a reduction in competitive intensity.
The third sector which we believe will look good, but with a lag of maybe a quarter or two, is cement. Here, with demand picking up, there will be utilisation increase and operating leverage to play on, especially after so many years when the supply growth was higher than demand.
A large part of cement demand comes from rural housing, as there is a shift to pucca houses. For FMCG, IT and pharma sectors, earnings growth will be along their long-term averages. So they are good long-term bets.
However, if growth is higher in other components of the market and available cheaper, then there may be a phase for a year or two when they underperform.
Right now, people are paying a premium for stability and surety of earnings growth. But we believe that now, it is the right time to buy cheaper growth stories than pay too much premium for a safer bet.
What is the strategy of your mid-cap and large-cap funds? They have been consistent, even with the extreme volatility in markets.
In both BNP Paribas Mid-cap and Equity, the key objective is to identify companies which will grow earnings at a rate superior to the index earnings growth rate and which is sustainable at the same time. Both have equal weight.
In our Mid-cap fund, we look at three factors.
One, the leaders in an emerging sector, where the sector is so nascent that the leader can grow much faster. The second is the challengers in a developed industry — companies which can challenge the leader and so grow much faster than the sector.
The third are consolidators. This is where an industry is very fragmented and because of that, there is no large player.
So, as and when the industry consolidates and the number of players reduces, the bigger ones benefit.
However, there are not many opportunities like this. Cement is one example. In BNP Paribas Equity, we have 75-80 per cent in large-caps.

DLF Falls 8%, a Day after New Haryana Minister Says Vadra Land Deals Will be Probed
NDTV | Updated On: October 27, 2014 16:49 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
DLF shares faced sharp selloff on Monday after a newly-inducted Haryana minister said the BJP government will investigate land deals of the previous Congress government.
Anil Vij, a Cabinet Minister in the new Haryana government, told PTI on Sunday, "Nearly 70,000 acres of land was acquired from farmers and sold at high profits. We will order probe and anyone found guilty, be it any official, Robert Vadra or (former Chief Minister) Bhupinder Singh Hooda or anyone else, will not be spared." ( Read the full story here )
In the run up to the assembly elections, BJP and other parties had attacked the previous Hooda government over the Robert Vadra land deal. The 2008 deal involved the sale of a 3.5 acre land by Mr Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, to DLF.
In 2012, senior Haryana bureaucrat Ashok Khemka cancelled the mutation of the land deal alleging that the rules were bent for Mr Vadra on account of his hefty connections. Mr Khemka was transferred three days later.
The Haryana government said an inquiry had found Mr Khemka's allegations to be baseless. In July this year, the mutation was sanctioned by the state government.
DLF was among the top losers in the 50-share Nifty. It ended 7.88 per cent lower at Rs 110.50 on the NSE and underperformed the broader realty-sub index on the NSE, which declined 3.9 per cent. ( Track stock )
Monday's selloff comes at a time when India's largest property developer is already under huge pressure following a ban by market regulator Sebi, which has barred DLF from tapping capital markets for three years. ( Read )
The ban is a blow to the heavily-indebted real estate firm because it will now not be able to raise money using equity or debt instruments regulated by Sebi.
DLF has sought interim relief from Securities Appellate Tribunal against Sebi's ban and the next hearing on the matter is slated for October 30. ( Read the full story )

Pradip Burman among 3 named in black money caseThe Hindu The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that it has no intention to withhold names of persons who have stashed black money abroad.

Every account held in a foreign country may not be illegal: Centre
The Centre on Monday disclosed in the Supreme Court that Pradip Burman of Dabur, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya and Goa-based mining baron Radha Satish Timblo of Timblo Private Ltd. were among those who had stashed black money abroad.
Other Directors of Timblo — Chetan S. Timblo, Rohan S. Timblo and Mrs. Mallika R. Timblo were also named in the affidavit, ahead of the hearing on Tuesday.
While disclosing these names, the Centre sought modification of the May 1 apex court order to disclose all names of foreign account holders and pleaded that only those names against whom investigations had been completed and prosecution launched, should be disclosed. The court must consider whether in directing the disclosure of all names, international standards had been violated, the Centre said.
Stating that the disclosed names were received from French tax authorities and prosecution had been launched against them under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Centre’s affidavit said, “The government is committed to disclose names of persons holding illegal money abroad. However, every account held by an Indian in a foreign country may not be illegal and the fundamental right of citizens to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be ignored.”
The Centre argued that under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, confidentiality had to be maintained.
What they said:
“I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media.... I am shocked. ”
Pankaj Lodhya
 
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” ”
Spokesperson, Dabur
 
“I have not seen the affidavit. I need to study it before commenting anything on it. ”
Radha Timblo
 
“The list of those with accounts in banks abroad has several Congress members. I must make it clear there are no names of BJP members in the list”
G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson
 
“The present administration has resiled from this position and now after over three years is praying for modification/ clarification of the judgement and order of July 4, 2011 in connection with the disclosure regarding Liechtenstein Bank accounts of Indians ”
Ram Jethmalani, expelled BJP leader
 
“All foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as illegal... We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence”

““The government can disclose all the names on the list to the court as per law.”
Salman Khurshid., Senior Congress leader
 
“Only three persons in the country have blackmoney?”
Nitish Kumar, Former Bihar Chief Minister
 
“Government has to answer a lot of questions as there is a reluctance on its part to give out all the names. This shows that the government lacks the political will and determination to fulfil its election promises”
D Raja, CPI National Secretary
 
“If there is a (Congress) name, the individual concerned will answer it and it is not proper to take names from the podium of party office.”
Abhishek Singhvi, Congress spokesperson
 
“Who is the government trying to protect in the black money scandal? Is it playing politics to blackmail the culprits? BJP ministers are not being transparent. ”

Nurse detained under New Jerseys Ebola quarantine to be releasedBy Abby Ohlheiser and Cecilia Kang October 27 Follow @abbyohlheiser Follow @ceciliakang
This undated image provided by University of Texas at Arlington shows Kaci Hickox, who was placed in isolation in New Jersey last week. (University of Texas at Arlington via Associated Press)
After a weekend of exchanging sharp barbs with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a nurse who was detained and placed in isolation in the state after returning from West Africa was released .
“Since testing negative for Ebola early Saturday morning, the patient being monitored in isolation has thankfully been symptom free for the last 24 hrs,” the New Jersey Department of Public Health said in a statement. “After being evaluated by CDC & her clinicians the patient is being discharged.”
Kaci Hickox was the first health-care worker to be quarantined under a new policy in New York and New Jersey, shortly after it was announced that another health care worker who recently returned from the region tested positive for Ebola in New York City. During her isolation, Hickox  criticized her treatment by New Jersey officials as “inhumane” and lashed out at Christie.
On Monday, at a campaign event in Florida  for Gov. Rick Scott, Christie said he “didn’t reverse my decision” in releasing the nurse, adding, “She hadn’t had any symptoms for 24 hours. And she tested negative for Ebola. So there was no reason to keep her. The reason she was put into the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic.”
Earlier on Monday, Christie said  Hickox will understand his quarantine decision “when she has time to reflect.”
Hickox returned last week from Sierra Leone after working with Doctors Without Borders on the front lines of the Ebola epidemic. She was held in isolation in a tent at a New Jersey hospital over the weekend, despite having no symptoms of Ebola.
Writing about her isolation for the Dallas Morning News , Hickox said that her treatment after arriving at Newark was disorganized and troubling. “No one seemed to be in charge,” she wrote. “No one would tell me what was going on or what would happen to me.”
She was specifically critical of Christie, who had told reporters Saturday that Hickox was “obviously ill.”
“First of all, I don’t think he’s a doctor,” Hickox told CNN on Sunday , in an interview from her isolation tent. “For the first 12 hours, I was in shock. Now I’m angry.”
That same day, she hired civil rights attorney  Norman Siegel, who told NBC News  that Hickox planned to sue for her release.
New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Monday that citizens need to rely on facts and not fears in regards to the Ebola virus. (AP)
Hickox will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine order while she is in the state, the health department statement said. “After consulting with her, she has requested transport to Maine,” the health agency said, noting that New Jersey officials have arranged for Hickox to leave the state in “a private carrier not via mass transit or commercial aircraft. Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives.”
Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said in a statement : “Upon the healthcare workers’ return home, we will follow the guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for medical workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients. Additionally, we will work with the healthcare worker to establish an in-home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other Mainers until the period for potential infection has passed.” 
After a doctor in New York tested positive for Ebola , Christie and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) issued strict quarantine procedures for all health-care workers returning from Ebola-stricken regions of West Africa. The doctor, Craig Spencer, had also recently returned from the region after working with Doctors Without Borders.
On Sunday evening, Cuomo revised his state’s initial quarantine procedures to allow asymptomatic health-care workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients to return to their homes, as long as they remain in isolation there.
Christie defended his state’s quarantine on “Fox News Sunday.”
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) explains his decision to quarantine nurse Kaci Hickox in a New Jersey hospital after she had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. Christie made his comments before Hickox was discharged after testing negative for Ebola on Saturday and being symptom-free for 24 hours. (Youtube/ GovChristie)
“I don’t believe when you’re dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system,” Christie said. “The government’s job is to protect [the] safety and health of our citizens. And so we’ve taken this action, and I absolutely have no second thoughts about it.”
In Florida on Monday, after health officials announced that Hickox would be discharged, Christie,  according  to CNN , told reporters: “I know she didn’t want to be there. No one ever wants to be in the hospital, I suspect, and so I understand that. But the fact is I have a much greater, bigger responsibility to the people and the public.”
The news of Hickox’s release came shortly after health officials in New York announced that a 5-year-old boy who recently traveled from Guinea is at Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital awaiting test results for Ebola. According to an e-mailed statement from the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the child developed a fever Monday morning while already under observation at Bellevue. The department expects preliminary results within the next 12 hours.

The controversy surrounding the venue of the 81st Akhil Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelan ended on Monday, with the central committee of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) withdrawing permission given to Haveri district to hold the annual convention.
Pundalik Halambi, president of KSP, told The Hindu that the venue for the next convention would be decided at a meeting to be held at Belur in Hassan shortly. The committee took the decision to change the venue in view of the differences between Haveri and Ranebennur taluks.
Following an appeal made by the Haveri district president of KSP to review the decision, a meeting was convened at Motebennur on Sunday, which also ended on a sour note. “In the meeting held here on Monday, it was decided to withdraw permission given to Haveri and finalise the venue in the next executive committee meeting,” Mr. Halambi said.

It’s time for social media stocks to do less talking and more showing. This is a big week for social media earnings reports — starting today with Twitter (TWTR) .
The online service that allows investors to share short messages is expected to report a quarterly profit of a penny a share, reversing a year-ago loss of 13 cents a share. Revenue is expected to more than double, rising 109% to $252 million, says S&P Capital IQ.
UPDATE: Twitter’s results now in. The company met expectations, stock down.
Those are the numbers Twitter investors say they’re looking for — but they’re actually looking for more. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the past three earnings quarters, S&P Capital IQ says. During the quarter ended in June, for instance, Twitter made 2 cents a share, well ahead of the expected 3-cents-a-share loss.
Good numbers are needed to get this stock going:
Talk is centering around Twitter to actually earn a profit of 3 cents a share. Anything less would be seen as the company laying an egg.

Pankaj Lodhiya: The man who went missingAfter Centre’s affidavit on black money, Rajkot bullion trader turns elusive
Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya
Ahmedabad, October 27:  
After the Centre came out with its first instalment of disclosure on black money accounts in foreign banks, Rajkot, a sleepy town in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, suddenly came under the spotlight.
Of the three names that were mentioned by the Centre in its affidavit in the Supreme Court on Monday, one was of a non-descript bullion trader-cum-realtor—Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya.
Lodhiya, hailing from the Soni (goldsmith) community in Saurashtra, suddenly became the most sought-after person by the national media. An interview he gave in the morning to a private news channel was enough to make him ‘popular’.
Within hours of the broadcast of the interview, Lodhiya turned untraceable.
Lodhiya’s company, Shreeji Trading Co, has been mentioned in the Centre’s affidavit. The company, operating in bullion trading, has branches spread across six cities, including New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, with its head office located in the crowded commercial area of Diwanpara in Rajkot.
Lodhiya, in his early 50s, also runs two other companies under the Shreeji Group— Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd, a manufacturer and trader of diamond jewellery, gold ornaments and silver articles; and Shreeji Realty, the construction arm of the Group.
Since morning on Monday, the offices remained closed as no phone calls on the landlines were responded. Lodhiya did not respond to mobile calls or text messages and even the emailed queries remained unanswered.
Apparently, in the TV interview, Lodhiya had mentioned: “I do not have any Swiss account. I have declared all assets and I have not been served any notice.”
He had also clarified to the reporters that he had submitted the details of his financial transaction before the Income-Tax department during recent scrutiny. He said he will react to the department once he is officially communicated about the issue.
Being one of the leading bullion traders in the region, Lodhiya’s alleged Swiss-bank connections have sent cold shivers across the bullion trading community in the region.
A jeweller from Rajkot told Business Line on condition of anonymity: “Their (Lodhiya’s) business interests in real estate and bullions indicate a direct link to route black money from one source to the other. But there are many such jewellers in Rajkot who have similar business combination. So, it first has to be verified and established, only then we can comment on his black money income.”
According to Shreeji Company’s website, “Shreeji Group initially started its business operations in the realty sector and then began its adventurous journey into the bullion business.”
The Website described Pankaj Lodhiya as the chief promoter of the Group, while it also mentioned the support “from father Chimanlal Laljibhai Lodhiya and his brother Kaushik Chimanlal Lodhiya,” in running the different business verticals. The bullion business was started about 15 years ago, but the journey had been a roller-coaster ride for Lodhiya. Trade sources claimed that the group had faced an Income-Tax raid about one-two years ago at its showrooms and offices.
‘Good reputation’
Yet, traders and jewellers maintained that Lodhiya enjoyed good reputation as he was one of the biggest gold/silver suppliers to small and medium jewellers and goldsmiths.
“Lodhiyas have a good reputation in the market. They are one of the leading bullion suppliers in the Saurashtra region,” said a bullion trade expert in Ahmedabad, also on condition of anonymity.
According to his website, the group dealt with the “important good delivery members of London Bullion Merchants Association and other international and national suppliers of bullion.
A leading bullion importer in Ahmedabad maintained that Lodhiyas had earned good name with diversified business interests ranging from jewellery making and exports, bullion trading and real estate.

10 rules on the art of innovation  and the  genius of Steve Jobs0
Jump to the next curve. “Most institutions define themselves in terms of what they already do,” Kawasaki said. If companies were more forward-looking, their demise would become less likely. This doesn’t mean switching industries; it means delivering the same benefit through different mechanisms. Kawasaki said telegraph companies might still be around if they’d recognized their value in delivering messages and embraced the telephone.
DICEE. Kawasaki said the best products and services are deep, intelligent, complete, empowering and elegant. As an example, he mentioned the Ford MyKey device, which parents can program to prohibit teen drivers from passing a determined speed limit.
Get shipping. “If you wait for the perfect time, if you wait for the perfect product, you will never ship,” Kawasaki said. Riffing on a certain popular song, he said innovators often “don’t worry, be crappy.” That’s not to say he encouraged creators to sell junk, but to ship products that are innovative despite imperfections.
Let flowers blossom. Despite best efforts at branding, marketing or advertising, a company sometimes attracts the “wrong” customer. Instead of freaking out, Kawasaki recommends that companies ask those people why they’re buying the product, or why they’re using it in a way other than the company intended. That can lead to a new direction or a new life for the company.
Ignore the haters. Products such as TiVo, Macintosh and Android inspire adoration and ire. “I’m not telling you that you should intentionally piss people off, but I’m telling you revolutionary products tend to polarize people,” Kawasaki said. “It’s OK.”
Churn, baby, churn. The process of churning a product from 1.0 to 1.1 all the way to 2.0 and beyond is the hardest part of innovation, Kawasaki said. “You need to ignore what the customers are telling you because they can only tell you to revise the current curve,” he said. Only the people working on the product can know how to take it to the next level.
Marketing is simple. Companies should measure their products or services on their uniqueness and value. It’s OK to be low in uniqueness if you’re high in value, because then you can compete on price, Kawasaki said. But it’s best to be high in value and in uniqueness, because then you can charge a premium.
Perfect your pitch. Kawasaki said the perfect pitch features 10 slides, lasts 20 minutes and uses size 30 font. He gave even more importance to personalization. For example, when he pitched to a company in Turkey, he opened with a picture of him wearing a fez in Istanbul’s grand bazaar, which helped forge an immediate connection.

Union Minister for Transport and Shipping Nitin Gadkari leaves after meeting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at RSS headquarters in Nagpur on Saturday.
TOPICS
parties and movements
Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh strongly reacted to Mr. Gadkari’s action, saying it reflected the "attitude of the leader and the party".
Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari rode into a controversy on Saturday when he was caught on camera entering the RSS headquarters here on a scooter without wearing a helmet in violation of traffic rules.
TV channels showed him riding his white-coloured scooter to the Sangh headquarters in the Mahal area of the city to meet RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat amid efforts by the party to form a government in Maharashtra.
When presspersons pointed out the violation of rules, Mr. Gadkari refused to comment, and entered the premises with a man riding pillion and another scooter in tow.
Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said it reflected the “attitude of the leader and the party, whether they believe in following the rules or not.” “It is a very small thing, and for anyone else, it wouldn’t have mattered ... for the Transport Minister of the government of India, who is violating the law which he had to be enforcing, then it does make a difference,” he said. It was not immediately known if the Nagpur Police were contemplating booking the Union Minister for violating traffic rules.

Heli-skiing: into the wildFirst tracks: round-up of the season’s developments
“In addition to the somewhat frivolous thrill of dancing down the hill, [the ski tourer] also seeks the aesthetic values inherent in the mountain country to which the ordinary skier is completely oblivious,” he enthused. “Ski touring takes us on to those mountains and slopes which we always look at from the top of our lifts and wish we were over there instead of here. It gives us the means to manifest our, however hidden and subconscious, desires to explore the distant, the new, the unknown, to be adventurers, to be able to throw back the shackles of our physical limitations and to go wherever our fancy urges us to go . . . ”
It was stirring stuff but there was more to come. For Gmoser was developing a new type of ski touring, in which the hard slog uphill would be removed by technology. “For uphill transportation for ski touring we need something with far more versatility and mobility than the most convenient types of ski lifts,” he told the instructors. “The machine to fit the bill is a helicopter.”
Finally, after six hours on the road, we emerge from the forests to see light streaming from the windows of a large building that’s strangely reminiscent of both an alpine chalet and an airport terminal. Inside, people are sitting at a long bar, playing cards by the fireplace and table-tennis in an adjacent games room. Having not even passed another car in the previous two hours, the sudden warmth, light and human contact are disorientating.
Hans Gmoser and his adventure-hungry acolytes were driven by the desire to escape into the wilderness
This is Monashee Lodge, the world’s largest heliski lodge and the newest in the portfolio of Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH), the company Gmoser founded. The lodge offers every comfort: there is a hot tub on the roof, a team of masseuses, a large wine cellar, a climbing wall, ski shop, business centre, library and 69 bedrooms. Guests are looked after by seven guides and 26 staff. It is a huge, five-star example of how far heli-skiing has come.
Today the sport Gmoser pioneered in 1965 has spread around the world: heli-ski operations have sprung up in far-flung mountain ranges from Alaska to India, in Chile, Turkey, Georgia, Sweden, Iceland and many other countries. CMH, though, remains by far the biggest operator, employing at least 120 mountain guides at its 11 bases in British Columbia.
Gmoser had begun experimenting with helicopters to access the mountains in the early 1960s but the first commercial “helicopter ski touring” trips (the word “heli-ski” had yet to catch on) took place over two weeks in April 1965. If our journey felt long, it was nothing to that of those first heliskiers, who reached the last section of road to their camp at 5pm but took nine more hours to cover the final 28 miles (“numerous times we were stuck in the mud, got rained upon and pushed the vehicles,” Gmoser later wrote). Accommodation was basic: the guests (six the first week, 12 the next, each paying $275) stayed in the plywood cabins of a disused sawmill camp, sleeping on iron beds in their sleeping bags. The guides, cook, pilot and mechanic slept on the floor of the kitchen building.
Heli-ski creator Hans Gmoser
In the morning, the helicopter would begin to ferry the skiers up the mountain, a lengthy task given that this was a slow, piston-engined Bell 47, which could only carry the pilot and two passengers. Women were taken last, to minimise their time waiting in the wind on the freezing mountainside. Each day they would make just one or two runs, often having to bushwhack back through the forest to camp, where they would gather in the kitchen to sing, play the instruments they had brought, drink and stay warm until going to bed at 10pm.
Halfway through the second week, the helicopter crashed. It was coming in to land when the landing gear sank into deep snow, causing a rotor to strike the ground. The three people on board managed to jump out before it burst into flames; all were shaken but unharmed, and the pilot was quickly dispatched to find a replacement machine to finish the week. But the risks and hardships of that first fortnight were matched by the thrill of discovery – of unskied slopes and a new way of reaching them. The first heliskiers went home, told their friends about their adventure, and Gmoser’s company never looked back.
. . .
Half a century later, we crouch down beside the lake in front of the lodge and wait for our lift. It is -20C, cold enough to make steam rise from the water; a family of bald eagles swoops in and out of trees by the shore. Then, a low rhythmic thud carried on the wind, oddly familiar from countless Vietnam war movies; it grows louder as the helicopter approaches.
The flimsy three-seaters used in the early days have long gone; this is a twin jet engine Bell 212, which will easily swallow our group of 10, as well as the guide and pilot. There’s a surge of adrenalin as it eases down from the sky, rotors furiously beating the air, skids just feet from our huddled group, its belly close enough that I can see every rivet. The guide slides back the door and we clamber in, rushing and struggling to strap safety belts over our bulky clothes. Then the helicopter gently lifts and turns, crossing the misty lake and climbing the steep, forested slope on the far side.
Coming in as an outsider, CMH feels like a tight-knit club, if not quite a cult. The other skiers in my group – indeed 90 per cent of those in the lodge – are indistinguishable thanks to their brightly coloured Gore-Tex skiwear, all of it branded with the CMH logo. Most of them have been coming for years, if not decades, often moving between different CMH lodges before settling on a favourite.
Skiers waiting for a Bell 212 to pick them up
In part their loyalty is due to a gimmick introduced in the early 1970s. Each night, the vertical distance each client has skied that day is posted on a board in the lodge, along with their cumulated lifetime total. Perhaps it’s something to do with the alpha-personality types who go in for this kind of holiday, and who can afford it, but in the CMH club, people really seem to take pride in this (utterly meaningless) figure, a badge of how much virgin snow they have defiled. Those who hit a million vertical feet are awarded a special CMH ski suit, presented after dinner in the lodge. My total after four days was just over 80,000ft; the frontrunner in the lodge that week had notched up a lifetime total over 26 million (he is so in thrall to the experience that he keeps a room at the lodge for the entire season).
It would be easy to mock – to bemoan how the original motivation of exploration and escape has been replaced by one of consumption and competition – were the whole thing not done in such warm North American spirit. The special suits are awarded in a sort of gang show (think shaving foam and dressing-up) designed to humiliate as much as honour the recipient. Dinner is eaten around large communal tables – a concept that ordinarily strikes terror into my English heart but which is a delight here thanks to the friendliness of the mostly US guests and the club-like atmosphere that prevails. After dinner and at the bar, people stand up to tell jokes and shaggy-dog stories that have been passed down between generations of guides and guests. Some of the punchlines might have been lost along the way but it’s hard not to be charmed. By the second night, everyone seemed to know my name.
. . .
This winter there will be numerous events to mark the 50th anniversary of the sport Gmoser created, including several “nostalgia weeks”, but the connection with the past seems to run strong through the whole operation. Despite the delights of the new lodge, many of those I talk to like to remember the early days before its construction, when they stayed in a basic hostel used by workers building a nearby hydroelectric dam. They recall leaking roofs and lumberjacks swinging punches – even the day the hostel caught fire is a topic for nostalgia, as is another helicopter crash. “The machine was on its side and filling up with fuel – I thought I was a dead . . . ” one man tells me with a grin. Didn’t that put him off? “Well it was the final week of the season anyway but I was back the next year.”
Monashee Lodge
Perhaps this is the key: despite the luxury and the special suits, this remains a genuine adventure. In all, 42 people have died skiing with CMH, the most recent being last winter. Given the size of the operation, it’s not a surprising figure – it represents approximately one death per 31,000 skier days – but the presence of risk, no matter how small the chance of being involved, changes the atmosphere, making everything more vivid. Safety briefings are taken seriously, guides are respected, guests build stronger bonds, après-ski is more celebratory.
And whether it’s a club or a cult, it’s one with a total commitment to a single central tenet, one that remains the same now as it was in 1965. Our helicopter lands at the top of a run called Nagel East, touching down in a clearing surrounded by blackened tree trunks, the survivors of a past forest fire. We jump out, huddle together once more as our guide unloads the skis, then watch as the helicopter peels away off the mountainside to get the next group, its frantic noise replaced by a crescendo of silence.
I plunge downwards . . . The feeling is somewhere between falling and flying, a delicious mania found at the outer limit of control
The guide leads and we follow in line, traversing at first, poling hard to get moving in the deep snow, passing through a glade of skeletal trees, before regrouping where the mountainside starts to fall away. The guide gives a list of safety instructions, then one by one we push off.
The skis accelerate rapidly and then, like a speedboat starting to plane, rise up and come alive, floating through the thigh-deep snow. Powder like this can be more than 90 per cent air – less dense than the froth of a cappuccino – and it is the only thing supporting me against gravity’s pull. I plunge downwards, weaving between the black trunks that are the only solid, vertical reference points in a mad world tipped on its side and awash with rushing snow and plummeting skiers. Some turns send up white waves that cover my face. The feeling is somewhere between falling and flying, a delicious mania found at the outer limit of control.
This is skiing’s “rapture of the deep” – potentially dangerous because it is so all-consuming, calling skiers to go faster, to abandon restraint, do anything to prolong the sensation. But it is wonderful too, the club’s motivation and lifeblood, the ephemeral commodity that has sustained CMH for 50 years and built an industry, the siren call that draws people across the world and up long logging roads in the darkness.
Tom Robbins was a guest of Pure Powder ( purepowder.com ) and Air Canada ( aircanada.com ). Pure Powder, a specialist heli-ski tour operator and CMH’s UK agent, offers a week’s trip with CMH from CAD$11,500 (£6,329). Air Canada has daily flights from London to Kelowna, via Calgary, from £825

Death by a Thousand Cutsreddit
It is likely that you don't realize what your state and our nation have lost in economic terms and research productivity as a result of recent cuts in the federal budget and budget instability brought on by a failure of Congress to pass a budget in a timely manner. Although some members of Congress strongly support increased funding for U.S. research, others argue that the time has come for the cost of basic biomedical research to be borne by industry and philanthropy. Those who make that argument either ignore, or are unaware, that this experiment has already been tried -- unsuccessfully.
Nearly 80 years ago, Louisiana Senator Joseph E. Ransdell failed at his efforts to get support for research through private and industrial resources. He instead determined that a federal agency, the National Institute of Health (NIH), was essential for supporting American biomedical research. It was clear in his day, as it is now, that basic research, which is an imperative precursor to cures for disease, was considered too risky for industry, whose primary goal is to turn research findings into potential therapies. At the NIH many things have changed over the last eight decades, including the addition of 26 more institutes and centers so that the research it supports addresses the full range of human disease; but the principle behind industry's role in research and discovery remains the same.
Like many taxpayers, you may think that taxes on your hard-earned money go to Washington, D.C. and stay there. In fact, 80 percent of the $29.2 billion that Congress appropriated to NIH last year was distributed through grants to scientists and public research institutions in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
Despite the proven value of, and critical need for, this research, NIH-funded scientists have experienced a 22 percent reduction in what they could buy with federal research dollars over the past 10 years. Adding insult to injury, the NIH budget was reduced by 6 percent in real (not inflation adjusted) dollars between 2012 and 2013. With the fall in federal grant support through NIH, fewer and fewer scientists are getting the funding they need to continue research. As a result, too many are closing their laboratory doors forever. If you think that a laboratory's closing does not affect you, think again. The loss of a single laboratory not only denies the U. S. the advantages of new research, but it also means a loss of three to four employees who were contributors to their state's tax rolls and three to four people who buy their groceries at your store, their gas at your station, or their services from your company. They have less (or no) money to put into the collection plate at their house of worship, and those houses then have less they can provide in humanitarian efforts in the community.
That sounds bad, but those results are not the worst of it. Hopefully you are healthy now, but imagine if tomorrow you begin to have symptoms of disease. For instance, your doctor may find that your cholesterol is very high or that you have signs of a stroke. Had it not been for NIH-funded research, your physician would not have effective drugs to treat you. Drugs called "statins," which lower cholesterol, would have never been developed; we'd have had no clue that drugs that make your blood less "sticky" (so-called antiplatelet agents) could help prevent strokes (and heart attacks); and we'd be stuck with ineffective treatments for high blood pressure, which can lead to stroke and heart attack.
Now let's conjecture that your own symptoms come from a disease that has no treatment. How do you think treatments are going to be found without research? When you need that treatment, you'll really want it, but your disease could take your life before the research engine can be restarted to find a cure. As Thomas Friedman emphasized in his New York Times column of September 24, 2013, countries that don't plan well for the future tend to do poorly when the future comes. Conversely, countries that do plan for the future tend to come out on top.
In his book, Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract with America (2005 Reginery Publishing, Washington, D.C.), former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich makes similar points when he states, "Investing in science (including math and science education) is the most important strategic investment we make in continued American leadership economically and militarily. Investing in science has also been the most consistent, powerful, single mechanism for extending life and for improving the quality of life. When developing the federal budget, the investment in science should be considered immediately after operational military requirements and before any of the traditional domestic spending programs." He went on to say, "Congress should be aware, however, of the crippling impact of a flat budget when research opportunities and needs are growing."
It is troubling to see how those warnings have been disregarded. Results of that disregard can be seen already. For example, data show that in recent years, the percentage of science and engineering journal articles based on research performed in the U.S. has fallen, while the percentage of articles from Chinese researchers has gone up dramatically.
So what can you do about it? Get the message to your elected representatives that federal funding for research is very important to you. Those in the seat of power actually listen to their constituents because they know that if they don't listen, we can vote them out of office. Information that will help you get in contact with your representatives can be found by visiting the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's (FASEB) Resource Guide to Advocating for Science on Capitol Hill and at Home. To learn more about how much NIH grant money comes to your state or district, take a look at FASEB's recently updated NIH funding map . Share your dismay that funding close to home is falling and both your health and the leadership of our country are threatened. Finally, don't forget there's an election in two weeks. You have the power to elect those who will honor your priorities.

Haryana govt contradicts Hoodas claim  says he was invited to Khattarswearing-inPrint
Outgoing Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda talking media in Chandigarh on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | Chandigarh | Posted: October 26, 2014 8:59 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 9:02 pm
The new Haryana government on Sunday said that outgoing chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was invited to the swearing-in of M L Khattar and a seat was reserved for him, contradicting the claim of the Congress leader that he did not receive an invitation.
The state government also said that Hooda’s name was among the dignitaries who were to receive Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Chandigarh Airport.
A Haryana government release this evening claimed that office of Deputy Commissioner, Rohtak had delivered an invitation card of the swearing-in ceremony at Hooda’s and Member of Parliament Deepender Singh Hooda’s residence at Rohtak on Saturday.
“The invitation was delivered by an official of office of DC, Rohtak at about 1 PM on October 25,” the release said. Apart from this, one chair was exclusively reserved for outgoing Chief Minister on dais, the release said, adding that Hooda’s name also figured among the dignitaries who were to receive the Prime Minister at Chandigarh Airport.
However, Hooda told reporters this afternoon, “I did not get the invite. Had I got one, I would have thought over it (whether to attend).”
A galaxy of leaders including the Prime Minister, L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, several Union Ministers, Chief Ministers of four BJP-ruled states, besides others attended the ceremony of Khattar and his Council of Ministers. Khattar was sworn-in as the 10th Chief Minister of Haryana on Sunday.

State Dept. seeks Walter Reed land swap  angering D.C. mayorBy Jonathan O'Connell October 24 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Walter Reed closed in 2011 and has become the subject of interest by the State Department, Childen’s National Medical Center and the D.C. government (Photo by ASTRID RIECKEN For The Washington Post)
D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is fighting an effort by the State Department to acquire as much as 20 percent of the land at the former Walter Reed Army Hospital where the D.C. government has been planning a town center-style development featuring housing, a charter high school, a grocery store and other amenities.
The Defense Department, which owns the entire campus, has been planning to provide about 45 acres on the western side of the campus to the State Department and 67 acres on the eastern side to the D.C. government. The campus has been vacant since 2011.
But a new request for land has prompted a possible reshuffling.
Children’s National Medical Center is seeking 13 acres of the State Department property, including a former Armed Forces Institute of Pathology building. Children’s won some support for the project on Capitol Hill, including from D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D).
State Department officials in turn — according to the mayor’s office — saw that they could lose the property and instead began jockeying to acquire 13 of acres pegged for the D.C. government.
On Oct. 23 Gray wrote to Army Secretary John M. McHugh, saying that if the Army carved out that land for the State Department it would have a “devastating impact” on the District’s ability to deliver the economic development it has promised to Congress, the Army and residents.
“Needless to say, such actions would negate years of effort, violate the trust of all stakeholders, indefinitely delay the creation of jobs, retail amenities, and housing, and waste millions of taxpayers dollars spent on the Army’s efforts to dispose of the property,” Gray wrote in the letter, obtained by The Washington Post.

A senior District official confirmed the letter and said the State Department was seeking 13 acres in the southern end of the District’s site, including properties currently pegged to house the homeless and veterans.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing relationships with federal officials, the source said State Department officials had gone to Capitol Hill with their request and that if it was approved it would force the District to re-do 18 months or more of planning. D.C. is working with a development team led by Hines Interests.
“The impact is pretty severe because we’ve been working with the development team constructing an offer that will satisfy all parties,” the source said. “Removing buildings and bifurcating the site just totally changes the economic analysis.”
The State Department is planning to use its portion of the Walter Reed property to create a “diplomatic enclave” akin to embassy row on Massachusetts Avenue. It didn’t hear about Children’s interest until this summer, according to department spokeswoman Christy Maier .
Maier said the agency plans to trade parcels of the land to foreign governments in exchange for properties abroad where the United States needs to open embassies. Not having the full acreage would cut into that mission, she said.
“We think this has a strong national security interest for us to be able to do this,” she said.
Still, Maier said the department wanted to be mindful of the District’s plans. It is now asking for just seven acres to compensate. That way the District and State would split the acreage that would go to Children’s.
“What we’ve done is take a real hard look at what would happen if Children’s did get the 13 acres,” Maier said. “We understand that they have a concern, and we realize this is sort of a new wrinkle for everybody. In a way it sort of splits the 13 acres that Children’s would get between the State Department and the District” portions.
 
Dr. Marshall Summar, chief of the genetics and metabolism division at Children’s, said the building that Children’s is seeking in particular has lab space that could accommodate medical research and would be difficult for the State Department to demolish because of its extremely thick, blast-proof concrete.
“Tearing that building down was not going to be a trivial thing or cheap, but most of those labs were renovated in 2010, so its lab space is beautiful,” he said.

Summar said that the last thing he wanted to see was for the hospital’s request to negatively affect the District’s plans. “Children’s really would not want to cause any harm to the city’s side of this or cause them to receive any less land,” he said.
In the end, Summar said he didn’t think the State Department would be able to acquire any of the District’s land.
“I really just think it was something where they were trying to see if anyone on the Hill was interested in it and I don’t think anyone really was,” he said.
This story has been updated with the State Department’s response.

Google executive Alan Eustace broke the sound barrier and set several skydiving records over the southern New Mexico desert early Friday after taking a big leap from the edge of space.
Eustace’s supersonic jump was part of a project by Paragon Space Development Corp. and its Stratospheric Explorer team
The technology that has gone into developing the balloon, the spacesuit and the other systems that were used in Friday’s launch will be used to advance commercial space flight, namely efforts by Arizona-based World View Enterprises to take paying tourists up in a high-altitude balloon and luxury capsule starting in late 2016.
As more people head into the stratosphere, the spacesuits could be adapted for emergency rescues or other scientific endeavours, officials said.
After nearly three years of intense planning, development and training, Eustace began his ascent via a high-altitude, helium-filled balloon just as the sun was rising. It took him more than two hours to hit an altitude of 1,35,890 feet, when he separated himself from the balloon and started plummeting back to earth. Wearing his specially designed spacesuit, Eustace hit a top velocity of 1,322 km/hr during a free fall that lasted four-and-a-half minutes.
The supersonic skydive happened with little fanfare, out of the media spotlight, unlike the 2012 attempt by daredevil Felix Baumgartner and the Red Bull Stratos team.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hosted a high tea for all NDA MPs — the first such event after the BJP-led alliance came to power in May — and utilised the occasion to ask them to be a symbol of positive political entity.
At the event held at his Race Course residence, Modi also made a fervent appeal to all the NDA MPs to ensure the success of his ambitious projects like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan Dhan scheme, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and labour reforms. The meeting lasted for about two hours during which the MPs were given presentations on these schemes.
“There was an elaborate discussion on many issues which the government has brought to the nation. We had an address by the Prime Minister who talked about cleanliness, various issues before the government, how a common MP can turn things in this country, how a common MP can be a symbol of positive political entity and how the respectability of politicians can be enhanced in the country,” said BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy after the meeting.
He said the Prime Minister talked on a wide range of issues. “The Prime Minister happily endorsed the achievements of the BJP and greeted Amit Shah on his victory in Haryana and Maharashtra,” Rudy said.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu coordinated the meeting where various departments made presentations.

Digboi refinery executive director goes missing inAssamPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 26, 2014 9:13 pm
Kaushik Bora, an executive director of Assam Oil Division (AOD) of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd has gone missing on Sunday from near the Digboi Refinery in upper Assam, about 530 kms from. His personal car was found abandoned about 10 kms from Digboi.
Bora, currently Number 2 in the 114-year old Digboi Refinery, had gone out from his official residence in the refinery township at around 10:30 AM and was later reported missing by his family at around 4 PM, Tinsukia district SP Akhilesh Kumar Singh said over the telephone.
“The officer’s personal car was found abandoned near Pengeri on the Digboi-Pengeri-Bordumsa Road, about 10 kms from Digboi. While his mobile phone has remained switched off, no group of organization has claimed responsibility for any abduction,” SP Singh said.
Bora (57), who is provided with an official vehicle and a driver by the public sector oil company, had no business whatsoever to go towards Pengeri and that too on a Sunday, the SP said. The Digboi-Pengeri-Bordumsa Road however is infested by both dacoits as well as ULFA militants.

Meet 2 Boomers Making A Real Impact Through Their Encore Careersreddit
Encore.org is preparing to honor social entrepreneurs and activists over 60 at next week's Encore 2014 Conference: Building an Encore Nation in Tempe, AZ. Through recognizing these Boomer pioneers, I believe we will begin to define a better sense of what our generation is capable of in the coming decades, and, most importantly, to better persuade the rest of society just how important our continued leadership and participation is going to be for everyone's collective future.
I had the good fortune to speak with two of this year's honorees -- two individuals who could not be more different on so many levels, but who share a common passion for the well-being of others, and a tireless confidence to do something about it.
You can read their complete profiles and backgrounds on the Encore.org website , but I thought I would share some of the personal insights that stood out in my conversations with each of them.
Cecelia Nadal, a Purpose Prize Fellow, has a striking and confident presence about her that belies her abundant warmth and openness. I immediately got the sense that participating in our chat was certainly an opportunity to talk about and to promote her work, but it was just as much driven by her curiosity to meet with, and engage with, another concerned human being, and to share a moment of heartfelt connection. For the past 18 years, Cecelia has been working across the St. Louis community through her organization, Gitana Productions ,  to bring together youth from different local, ethnic communities through art and performance projects.  Her goal is to use arts education as a vehicle for personal and professional discovery, and she has touched thousands of lives in the process.
David Campbell, a Purpose Prize winner whose prize is sponsored by Symetra, could not come from a more different background. An engineer by training, he worked steadily in the technology sector for his entire career -- at IBM for many years, and then getting involved in the advent of the internet sector as President of BBN Technologies. But for the past ten years, David has done a complete pivot as the Founder and Chairman of All Hands Volunteers , a non-profit disaster relief organization that has been able to deftly jump into crises as they are happening, and in many cases, handle key infrastructure and reconstruction projects quickly and effectively, while larger NGOs and governmental organizations are struggling to align and deploy their resources.
A key lesson for me in speaking with each of them was that these kinds of pursuits have to stem from a core personal inspiration. It can be a particular "ah-ha" moment where everything comes into focus, or it can be a particular philosophy or sense of identity and purpose that emerges and solidifies over time. For David, retired and living in the Boston area in 2004, it was a friend luckily escaping the Thai island of Phuket just days before the disastrous Tsunami hit, whose story triggered him into action. In speaking with David, it felt as if he himself wasn't completely clear about what drove him to jump on a plane and travel to Phuket by himself with no real plan and no real connections -- just some conviction that with his engineering and managerial background, he could find some way to make a difference. But once on the ground in Thailand, it sounds like his purpose was there waiting for him - but he had to be open enough to discern what it was that he was actually meant to do. Although he had brought a wireless router with him, and walkie talkies (and duct tape, for some obscure reason...), what he wound up doing was helping to build fishing boats, and organizing the financing and production process so that Thai fisherman could get back out and resume working to feed their families.
Cecelia carries our collective ethnicity in her genes: she's Black, Puerto Rican, African, Cherokee, French, and Irish. Her father was in the military and she grew up in military bases around the country and overseas -- a true "army brat." So it is no wonder that early on, starting in high school, she became fascinated by Gypsies -- the Roma people whose diaspora has taken them all over the world. That ethnic and sociological fascination continued through college at St. Louis University, and on into her first career working in human resources. But finally, it was her life-long dedication to the arts that spurred her to devote herself full time to marrying all of her interests into one very personal and authentic pursuit, and, as she says, "eventually getting ornery enough to do what i wanted to do! Once I embraced what Gypsy culture meant, and allowed it to influence what I was doing, then things started to come together."
For Encore careers to really work, they need to bypass the logical or the conventional, and emerge from our hearts. We have to ignore our minds, which may be listing all the reasons why-not, or trying to reconcile the new avocation with the old/outdated rules or established routines from our about-to-be previous life. For David, the calling was a thunderclap that revolutionized his life pretty much overnight. For Cecelia, it was a slow, progressive emergence that took years. But in the end, each of them was willing to let go, to surrender to what was apparent to them, and present for them in these revelatory moments. Each of them seized an opportunity, and each of them today embodies a palpable enthusiasm for what they are doing, and for sharing it with everyone around them. As we wrapped up our conversation, David spontaneously invited me to join him on a trip next week to visit a project that All Hands is doing in Colorado. I replied "David, so you are always recruiting!" [for your projects]. He just laughed...
Perhaps the most exciting (or scariest depending on your POV) aspect of Encore Careers is a certain sense of the unknown that we are facing for our generation. We are just beginning to explore this extended  period of opportunity that has somehow been grafted unexpectedly onto our lives. Sure, as we've been growing to this point, we had some general ideas about what our later life would be like. However, now that we're actually facing these next 20, 30, maybe 40 years, we recognize that it is not going to be all golf and cruises and grand kids. Instead, it is going to be an entirely new phase, or life stage, or... whatever. Imagine combining the wisdom and equanimity of our best grandparents with the best mentorship and resourcefulness of our parents, and with our own rock 'n roll sensibilities and activism.
It sounds like a party I want to attend.

In furtherance of good governance
R. K. Raghavan
public officials
Civil servant independence in the country is at best nominal. Nonconformity even to spurn whimsical and arbitrary directives received from above is widely recognised as a very risky proposition
The right to judicial remedies … is a constitutional right of the subjects … Employees of the State cannot become members of a different class to whom such right is not available. — Justice J. Chelameswar and Justice A.K. Sikri of the Supreme Court of India (September 22, 2014) in Vijay Shankar Pandey vs Union of India and Another.
Amid the din raised over the case involving the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader J. Jayalalithaa, an important and recent ruling by the Supreme Court of India in an entirely different domain has gone virtually unnoticed. This judgment was in the cause of good public administration, a sector vital to economic development. The message that the top court possibly wanted to send through its order was that an honest civil servant can bank on the Court if blatant injustice has been done to him or her by an unfair executive.
Black money case
The judgment possibly took cognisance of the fact that over the years, the Indian bureaucracy has become a spineless structure that cannot stand up to unethical pressures by the Executive or the moneyed in society, thereby belying the worthy dream of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, free India’s first Home Minister. It was the doughty Sardar’s vision and resoluteness that ensured that efforts in some quarters in post-Independence India to abolish the centrally recruited and overseen All India Services did not succeed. The nation has greatly benefited from the continuance of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS) in particular. Certain events since 1975, viz., the period post-Emergency, have however been the cause for dismay among those who have been looking for a professional, honest and independent civil service that would bolster an equally dedicated political class. It is against this backdrop that one should analyse the recent Supreme Court decision.
It all began in 2010 when V.S. Pandey, a senior IAS officer, Uttar Pradesh cadre, joined hands with Julio Ribeiro, the former police chief, and a few others, under the auspices of a non-governmental organisation-styled India Rejuvenation Initiative (IRI), to file a writ petition on the need to ferret out black money owned by Indians and stashed abroad. The petition culminated in the Supreme Court decision (2011) known as Ram Jethmalani and Others vs the Union of India. Reacting to this, Pandey was served a charge sheet by the U.P. government on five counts for alleged violation of four clauses of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.
Charges, exoneration
The gravamen of the charge against Pandey was that, in being a co-signatory to the said writ petition by Ribeiro and others, he had endorsed an affidavit by one Jasbeer Singh that was critical of some senior officers of the Government of India (mainly from the Enforcement Directorate). The charge sheet added that in not having obtained the government’s permission before joining the said NGO and deposing in an inquiry where the Central and State governments were likely to be criticised, he had violated the conduct rules.
An enquiry officer appointed to look into the charges against Pandey exonerated him of all the charges on August 30, 2012. Strangely, a copy of this report of exoneration was not served on Pandey. On September 9, 2012, a selection committee that was considering cases of IAS officers in U.P. for promotion to the super timescale ignored Pandey’s case, although he had been exonerated and was eligible for promotion. The committee’s decision was in a sealed cover, a usual practice in respect of officers against whom disciplinary action was pending.
Worse was to follow. The enquiry officer’s finding was rejected by the U.P. government on September 26, 2012, on the ground that his report was cursory and that he had failed to properly investigate all relevant facts. The State government went on to invoke the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 and appoint a two-member committee to look once more into the charges against Pandey. Significantly, the State government’s action came on the same day as the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) dismissing Pandey’s appeal seeking his promotion. Following this, Pandey went to the Supreme Court on a writ that was recently disposed of by a bench comprising Justices Chelameswar and Sikri in favour of Pandey. In doing so, the judges made some comments on what was palpably an act of rancour and vindictiveness by the government. What was striking about this remarkable judicial order was the thoroughness with which the bench demolished each averment against Pandey.
Upholding an individual’s right
First, the Court held that since Pandey never disputed the charges made against him, there were no facts to be investigated by the enquiry officer. Second, relying on the decision (1971) of the Supreme Court in K.R. Deb vs Collector of Central Excise, Shillong, the bench held that a second inquiry against Pandey was untenable. There could at best be a further inquiry, but not a second one on the same facts. And, in the Pandey case, the facts were such that a further inquiry was hardly warranted. As regards violation of a stipulation of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules that an officer could not depose before an individual, or committee or any other authority without the sanction of the government, the bench held that joining in averments made in a writ petition before a court was equivalent to taking part in a judicial process for which no citizen needed to get the government’s nod. An individual’s fundamental right did not get diminished just because he was a member of the civil service.
The two judges were categorical that this was a clear case of harassment of a hapless civil servant. (“The purpose behind the proceedings appears calculated to harass the appellant since he dared to point out certain aspects of mal administration ... The whole attempt appears to be to suppress any probe into the question of black money. A part of the strategy to intimidate not only the appellant but also to send a signal to others who might dare in future to expose any mal administration.”) They did not also fail to notice that while the government chose to proceed against Pandey, it ignored the action of another official, Jasbeer Singh, who had filed an additional affidavit that was critical of the government. The bench allowed Pandey’s petition and went beyond, to award him the costs involved. In doing so it said, “The requirement of (a) democratic republic is that every action of the State is to be informed with reason. State is not a hierarchy of regressively genuflecting coterie of bureaucracy.”
The need for support
This landmark judicial order comes at a time when, in my view, an intimidated civil service needs support. In many States, public servant morale is at its nadir and it requires the oxygen of an unequivocal imprimatur from the highest court of the land that would help to halt the hands of a meddling political class. Nothing else would bring about at least a marginal improvement to what is an undeniably appalling situation. Wide publicity to its salient features would go a long way in reinstilling courage into large sections of the bureaucracy which is baulking in fear of reprisal for its legitimate actions and has been coerced into condemnable passivity.
Civil servant independence in the country is at best nominal. Nonconformity even to spurn whimsical and arbitrary directives received from above is widely recognised as a very risky proposition. Signs of defiance are fraught with such serious consequences that even the most courageous civil servant thinks many times over before turning down even a palpably unethical and illegal direction. The few mavericks who display a semblance of remonstrance are heavily penalised so as to deter potential dissenters. It is this sordid state of affairs that convinces me that Justices Chelameshwar and Sikri will have to be hailed for coming squarely to the rescue of a hapless senior official of the U.P. government for his alleged intransigence.
I view the judgment as bold and imaginative. It sends out a strong signal that the honest and upright civil servant can depend on the higher judiciary for unequivocal support. Wide publicity to the facts of the case and details of the judgment is a must.
I am not pleading here for a total licence to honest civil servants to do whatever they want or indulge in intemperate criticism of a constitutionally installed government. What is required is a freedom to speak their minds in furtherance of good governance. I am happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first meeting with the Secretaries to the Union Government exhorted exactly this and made himself available to hear them, especially when they were at loggerheads with their Ministers. There cannot be a better way to get the best out of each government official whatever be his status in the hierarchy. The Prime Minister’s Office has again to be complimented for issuing a directive to the bureaucracy that it should not act on oral instructions. I am confident that this stand would greatly promote transparency and honesty in governance.

‘The government has taken steps to destroy MGNREGA, an act that gives purchasing power to the rural poor, following prejudicial contentions of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders’
It’s no secret that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. MGNREGA is perhaps the only law in the world which guarantees 100 days of wage employment a year to one member of a rural household at the minimum wage rate. With the sole exception of the late Gopinath Munde, who on becoming the Rural Development Minister had expressed his support to expand and strengthen the programme, other BJP leaders have expressed their contempt for it.
The latest in the list is Maneka Gandhi who termed it the “most expensive failure” of the United Progressive Alliance government and went on to make the rather bizarre statement that it was because of MGNREGA that the handloom, silk and carpet weaving industry in Varanasi has been destroyed. “Labour is impossible to get,” she said, because of MGNREGA work.
Have any of the BJP leaders opposing the scheme on equally specious grounds ever been to an MGNREGA worksite? If they had, they would have seen frail men and women digging and lifting approximately 1,500 to 2,000 kilos of mud in a single day to earn a minimum wage, the national average of which was just Rs.132 last year. If anyone opts for this work, it is not out of choice but distress.
Arbitrary funding priorities
In the eight blocks in Varanasi, the implementation of MGNREGA has been quite poor. Last year, on an average in each of the blocks, 2,500 households got only two and a half days of work in a month (using the State average of 31 days last year). Clearly, MGNREGA is not the cause for weavers’ distress although the relief it could have provided is absent.
The real problem today is that such prejudicial contentions of BJP leaders are increasingly followed by government steps to destroy MGNREGA.
This started with the reduction in budgetary allocations from already low levels. UPA-II had also cut down funds for MGNREGA from Rs.40,000 crore in the budgets of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 to just Rs.33,000 crore in the subsequent two budgets.
However the difference is that whereas the previous government kept it open-ended with a proviso to meet the additional demands of the States where required, the Narendra Modi regime has virtually capped the expenditure refusing legitimate demands of the States for more allocations on the basis of demand for work by the rural poor. Given that the basis of the legal guarantee of 100 days of work is demand-driven, imposing such a cap is clearly a violation of the law.
Ninety per cent of the cost of MGNREGA is borne by the Centre. This February, the mutually agreed labour budget was 227 crore person-days, slightly higher than the 2011-12 number of 219 crore person-days. In financial terms this translates into an expenditure of Rs.61,000 crore. In addition, the Centre still owes States Rs.3,000 crore from last year’s backlog.
But instead of revising its priorities in expenditures and ensuring funds for MGNREGA, the Modi government slashed the labour budget by more than 50 per cent, allocating just Rs.33,500 crore. In an unprecedented move, it then divided the amount among States on a “pro rata basis.” All States have suffered cuts in allocations, some more than others.
Take the case of Tripura, the best performing State in the country in the implementation of the scheme. Its record in provision of work has been double than that of the national average. The agreed labour budget for Tripura amounted to a central allocation of Rs.1,406.96 crore for this year. However, the projected amount was arbitrarily slashed to Rs.660 crore by the Centre. Moreover, till October 20, the Tripura government had received only Rs.180 crore of the indicated allocation. This is the lowest in the entire country. Gujarat received 76 per cent of its indicated allocation, Chhattisgarh received 82 per cent and Kerala received 46.58 per cent.
There were no criteria for releases, just the arbitrary use of power by the Ministry. It is only after strong objections and protests by the Tripura government that another Rs.193 crore was released. But the damage has already been done. The Tripura government had projected a creation of 2 crore person-days between April and September, but has managed to achieve the creation of only 1.08 crore person-days till now. This is a direct fallout of the cut in funds.
As a result, the benefits of work and income to thousands of households, the majority of them tribal communities, are being destroyed by the Central government. Moreover, the inadequate devolution of funds and the consequent reduction in workdays created in the first six months will set into motion a vicious cycle, since the low average workdays will in turn affect all subsequent allocations which are based on past performance.
Another negative change in the making is the decision to alter the material-labour ratio from the current 60:40 to 51:49, thus increasing the proportion of expenditure on materials. This has serious implications on the very character of the programme.
First, with the overall cut in funds, any change in material labour ratio, given the increased costs of creation of workdays, will drastically cut down days of work which are already low. Second, the current expenditure on materials is just 23 per cent, well below the permissible 40 per cent, so there is enough scope to increase the material component with an expanded list of permissible projects without changing the ratio. Third and critically, the increase in the ratio of materials will automatically mean the entry of contractors and machines in much larger numbers into the MGNREGA projects. This in turn will signify the conversion of MGNREGA from a work guarantee Act into a contractor’s commission guarantee Act.
The idea of development
The attack on MGNREGA should also be seen as a reflection of the BJP’s idea of “development,” which is a deep commitment to the trickle-down theory of growth. The UPA also subscribed to this theory which is why it took steps in its second term that weakened and diluted its own legislation.
The ideological underpinning of the present assault on MGNREGA is linked to the approach regarding the use of national resources. MGNREGA, however inadequate, makes a step in the right direction by: providing a share of national resources to create work opportunities in rural India thereby directly increasing the purchasing power of the rural poor; planning projects to meet requirements at the village or area level unlike planning to build infrastructure which primarily helps corporates; having the potential to support farming by small and marginal farmers and those belonging to adivasi and Dalit households; and preventing wages from coming down below the legal level, thus stopping, at least in theory, gross exploitation of rural labour through payment of dismal wages by various sections of the rural elite.
That is why the dilution of the Act has the backing of representatives of the rural elite — the landlords and big contractors — across political parties.
The implementation of MGNREGA requires serious improvement to increase the number of workdays to its full potential. Works permissible should be more closely linked with livelihoods and work such as fodder and fuel collection, the working of Self-Help Groups and animal husbandry. Non-payment of minimum wages and delayed wage payments have to be urgently addressed, and compensation arrears should be paid along with unemployment allowances. Of what use is the ‘Make in India’ slogan when the Indian mazdoor, whose hands labour to produce, lives in destitution and distress?

41 of Narendra Modis 44 ministers are crorepatisJaitley is richest NDA minister, Sadananda Gowda's wealth is growing fastest
Mail Today –  Sat 25 Oct, 2014

If wealth is health, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers is pretty much in the pink. Of the 44 members in Modi’s ministerial team, no less than 41 - or 91 per cent - are crorepatis.
This compares rather favourably with the United Progressive Alliance II’s Council of Ministers, where 47 of 79 ministers - just about 60 per cent - were similarly wealthy.
Union Finance and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley is the richest minister of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, with assets totalling Rs 114.03 crore.
It is Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda, however, whose assets have shown the greatest increase, rising by Rs 10.46 crore since he took over as minister. His wealth has shot from Rs 9.88 crore as declared in the Lok Sabha elections to Rs 20.35 crore now.
The wealth of Modi’s ministers has been analysed by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and National Election Watch (NEW) by comparing the declarations filed for the Lok Sabha elections in May this year and those sent about five months later to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
Declarations of 45 ministers, including Modi himself, have been analysed. Of the 45 ministers, 37 had contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and eight are members of the Rajya Sabha. Unlike the railway minister, Jaitley’s assets have shown an increase of Rs 1.01 crore in the same period.
Jaitley’s assets rose in value from Rs 113.02 crore during the Lok Sabha polls to Rs 114.03 crore in the 2014 disclosure to the PMO. He is fond of luxury cars and has declared ownership of high-end cars like a Porsche worth Rs 1.02 crore, and vehicles from Mercedes Benz and BMW among others.
Gowda’s growth is on the fast-track primarily because he has acquired a commercial building worth Rs 13.49 lakh as well as a residential building worth Rs 11.65 crore.
Matter of assets
The average value of assets of Modi’s Council of Ministers, according to the declarations on the PMO website, is Rs 14.32 crore. Following Jaitley on the rich list are Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Rs 108.31 crore) and Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power, Coal and New and New and Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal of the Bharatiya Janata Party (Rs 94.66 crore).
According to the ADR, many Union ministers including Gowda, Dr Harsh Vardhan, Ananth Kumar, Jitendra Kumar, Manoj Sinha, and Santosh Kumar Gangwar have not declared the value of their agricultural land in their declarations.
On the not-so-rich side, the least wealth has been declared by Sudarshan Bhagat of BJP (Rs 59.13 lakh) followed by Mansukhbhai Dhanjibhai Vasava of the BJP (Rs 65.71 lakh) and Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janashakti Party (Rs 95.71 lakh).
Among the ministers who contested the Lok Sabha 2014 elections, the highest increase in assets in five months has been shown by D.V. Sadananda Gowda of the BJP (Cabinet Minister for Railways). Gowda is followed by Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Radhakrishnan P. of the BJP, who has shown an increase of Rs 2.98 crore from the Rs 4.09 crore he declared in the Lok Sabha polls.
The reason for the increase in the property of many ministers, including Radhakrishnan P., has been difficult to evaluate as some ministers have not declared the values of their assets in a comprehensive format.
The great dip
There are 16 ministers whose wealth has shrunk in the jour- ney from the General Elections to the Council of Ministers. The greatest decrease is for Exter- nal Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj whose wealth has fallen by Rs 3.89 crore (from Rs 17.55 crore to Rs 13.65 crore).
She is followed by Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North-eastern Region Gen. (Retd) V.K. Singh of BJP, who has declared a decrease of Rs 3.13 crore (from Rs 4.11 crore declared in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to Rs 98.27 lakh declared in the disclosure to the PMO).
The former Army chief is followed by Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan of BJP who has declared a decrease of Rs 1.28 crore (from Rs 2.82 crore declared in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to Rs 1.54 crore in the disclosure to the PMO).
The declaration of assets by the ministers has been made according to the Code of Conduct issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs which makes it mandatory for every minister to disclose details of their assets and liabilities.
The 2009 Cabinet of the UPA had 47 crorepati ministers, of which 38 were from the Congress, five from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, two from the Nationalist Congress Party, and one each from the National Conference and Trinamool Congress.
NCP leader Praful Patel was the richest of the lot, with assets worth Rs 89.9 crore.

Navy gets a lion’s share of the projects
The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting chaired by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley cleared deals worth Rs.47,000 crore on Saturday for the three services with a lion’s share going to the Navy. The Army’s long-pending proposal for the Anti-Tank Guided Missile system has been cleared.
Addressing the Council, Mr. Jaitley said the nation’s security was of paramount concern for the government. He added that “necessary hurdles and bottlenecks in the procurement process should be addressed expeditiously so that the pace of acquisition is not stymied.”
In a major boost to the Navy , six new conventional diesel-electric submarines under Project-75I have been approved at Rs.50,000 crore.

Cyclone Nilofar: Gujarats coastal districts to recieve heavyrainfallPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi/ahmedabad | Posted: October 26, 2014 10:11 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 10:15 pm
Coastal districts of Gujarat would receive isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall from October 30 as Cyclone Nilofar would intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours, India Meteorological Department(IMD) on Sunday said.
The cyclonic storm Nilofar over westcentral and adjoining southwest Arabian Sea moved slightly northwards and lay centred at 1730 hours today about 1240 kms southwest of Naliya (Gujarat), 1300 kms south-southwest of Karachi in Pakistan and 900 kms east-southeast of Salalah (Oman), an IMD statement said.
It would intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and it would move initially north-northwestwards during the next 48 hrs and then recurve northeastwards reaching north Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coast by October 31 morning.
“Under the influence of this system, rainfall at many places with isolated heavy to very heavy falls would commence along coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch from October 30 morning,” the statement said.
Squally winds speed reaching 45-55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph would commence along and off Gujarat coast from October 30 morning. Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be rough to very rough from the same period, it added.
The statement said that fishermen out at sea along and off Gujarat coast should return to the coast.

Eight LeT militants arrested in KashmirValleyBy: Press Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: October 26, 2014 10:03 pm
Eight Lashker-e-Toiba militants were on Sunday arrested by the security forces in North Kashmir, weeks before the first phase of Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir.
With the arrest, the security forces claimed to have busted a module of the terror outfit and “averted a major terror plan of the militants”. A huge cache of arms and ammunition was also seized.
“Police in Sopore (in Baramulla district), with the help of 30 Rashtriya Rifles(RR), have busted a recruitment module of militant outfit Laskhar-e-Toiba, thus averting a major terror and subversion plan of the militants.
“Eight members of the module were arrested from different parts of Sopore town and adjoining areas,” a police spokesman said here.
He said the militants, all local, were recruited into the outfit which was trying to execute militant activities.
“The local boys were recruited into the outfit, which is building a network of LeT operatives.
“They were bent upon executing various militant actions in and around the township in conspiracy with one foreign terrorist of LeT, Umer Khitab, a Pakistani national, who is operating in Sopore. Khitab has been taking directions from another LeT man Hanzulla, also a Pakistani national,” he said.
Three of them Rayees Ahmad Bhat, Sajad Ahmad Bhat and Shabir Ahmad Kumar are residents of Harwan, Sopore. While remaining five, Lateef Ahmad Gujar, Zubair Ahmad Gujar,
Mohammad Qasim Gujar, Mohammad Iqbal Gujar and Hakim Din Gujar are residents of Gujarpatti Zaloora village, the spokesman said.
He said eight UBGL, five Chinese grenades and 100 AK-47 rounds have been seized from them, adding involvement of these militants in “other actions of terrorism and subversive actions is being probed”.

Centre according toModiSeveral economists have been disappointed by Modi’s first few days in office.
Written by Christophe Jaffrelot | Posted: October 27, 2014 12:04 am
Narendra Modi became prime minister on May 26, a little more than 150 days ago, after an election campaign that raised many expectations. According to some of Modi’s staunchest supporters, the modernisation of the Indian economy was set to happen because he would free the caged Indian tiger for good. Political commentator Swapan Dasgupta wrote in May that he was “an Indian revolutionary” a la Margaret Thatcher, who, according to economist Surjit S. Bhalla, “achieved the near-impossible by changing forever the mindset of a socialist, outdated England”.
But several economists have been disappointed by Modi’s first few days in office. They lamented that the Union budget was too much like previous ones, with few liberalisation measures except the relaxation of FDI caps in insurance and defence (from 26 to 49 per cent). But the “worst” was the Centre’s decision not to cut subsidies and to rollback the rail fare hike, a move, according to Swaminathan Anklesaria Aiyar, “so populist, dithering and spineless as to make Manmohan Singh look a lion by comparison”. Some of Modi’s supporters in the West were also surprised by the way his government stalled the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in the name of Indian peasants’ interests (and at the expense of the standardisation of customs procedures, which was supposed to add $1 trillion to world trade). But this decision was in keeping with the speech Modi had made as early as on May 20, before the BJP parliamentary party, in which he said: “A government is one which thinks about the poor, listens to the poor and which exists for the poor”. Subsidies for the poor may be criticised as inefficient from the opposition benches, but to cut them once in office and deprive millions is another matter.
In fact, the Modi government has opted for a gradualist transformation, which can be explained by the need to protect his supporters from the corporate sector, who may not like to be exposed to competition, constraints such as mass poverty (a “detail” the election campaign conveniently overlooked), and the weak position of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha. But if it is too slow for the neoliberals, it is too radical for the trade unions. The controversy regarding the Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2014, is a case in point. If the bill is passed, the minimum number of workers to be employed for a unit to be defined as a factory could be doubled, freeing several enterprises from having to comply with the Factories Act, which relates to safety, working conditions and welfare of employees. Such a reform is intended to please Indian entrepreneurs and also, probably, attract foreign investors to “Make in India”. While this is a contentious issue, given the relatively small number of workers in the formal sector, it is not revolutionary. And neither continued…

Letters to the editor: Missing EidgreetingPrint
Posted: October 26, 2014 11:55 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrating Diwali with defence force personnel in Siachen and with Kashmiris has immensely boosted their morale. It has also gladdened an overwhelming majority of the population. Modi is known to be a master communicator. But the fact that this year, his personal Twitter handle notwithstanding, no official Eid greeting was issued on behalf of the prime minister and no iftaar party was hosted, calls for corrective measures. In the absence of a course correction, unintended consequences could follow. This is especially true given the concerted efforts of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda to divide the Indian people. Unity must be guarded at all costs.
— Nirmal Singh
New Delhi
Reading the result
The BJP’s resounding victory in Maharashtra and Haryana rings alarm bells for regional parties. There is a need for a change in strategy. Or else, they should be ready to be swept away by the Modi wave — yes, it exists, and it is gaining momentum. The Congress needs to change its overall organisational structure. The demands to rope in Priyanka Gandhi say a lot about party workers’ faith in Rahul Gandhi. It also shows a touching confidence in the leadership capabilities of the Gandhi family. To blame regional leaders for the defeat is to hide from the real problems. As far as the NCP is concerned, it needs to rethink its policies on urban development, since its base is mostly currently rural. The MIM’s debut in Maharashtra is nothing short of impressive. By winning the Muslim vote from under the Congress’s nose, it has made a great start.

Malegaon
Raring to research
At the convocation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the need to boost medical research in India. Our country has to catch up with the rest of the world in many areas of scientific research. “Brain drain” is both a cause and an effect of poor research and infrastructure. Apart from in some top institutes like the Indian Institute of Science and the various Indian Institutes of Technology, scientific research is in its adolescence in India. There is a palpable lack of exposure to quality research materials and an absence of a conducive environment. Researchers are handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles and improperly rewarded for their efforts.
— Ganapathi Bhat
Akola
The downfall
After taking potshots at the prime minister, the Shiv Sena has had to take stock of reality. It can only join government on the BJP’s terms. This is a great humiliation for the stroppy Uddhav Thackeray, who was expecting to be in a commanding position after the Maharashtra elections.
— Satwant Kaur

Why you shouldnt get used to mobile appsDon't Get Used To Mobile Apps — Their Days Are Very Obviously Numbered
By Alyson Shontell | Business Insider –  Fri 24 Oct, 2014 3:45 AM IST
View Photo
A few years ago, everyone was creating desktop-first startups. Now you're behind if you're not building a mobile application first, and a website second. Apple blogger and Google Ventures partner MG Siegler believes the first app you open in the morning is the equivalent to the new homepage on a web browser.
But apps are very clearly not going to be around forever. Certainly not in their current, bulky square form. There isn't enough mobile homepage real estate for each of the web's 500-million-plus active websites to have its own app and for everyone to download all of them.
Mobile apps are popular right now because mobile search is terrible and they lay out content in a small-screen-friendly way. If apps do stick around, they may transform more into bookmarks, where people have only a few favorites on their home screens, and all other mobile content can be accessed some other way.
"There is no doubt what we have today — screens of apps — is going to dramatically change," former Googler and Facebooker Paul Adams writes on Intercom , where he's now vice president of product. " The idea of having a screen full of icons, representing independent apps, that need to be opened to experience them, is making less and less sense."
Intercom thinks that apps might still exist in the future but will serve as notification systems that push content as necessary — not big bulky apps that take up prime homepage real estate on our phones. Notifications are getting more interactive, too, letting you text message someone back or take an action without fully firing up the app.
Twitter Here's an example of a content card on Twitter. It has all of the information and actions stuffed in a tiny, manageable box within a stream. Cards in notifications probably aren't too far away.
How could simple notifications fulfill all the needs of current apps? Adams thinks they'll morph into content cards, which will allow users to see more information and take more actions straight from a pop-up. Adams believes you'll be able to book a table, send an email, or post to Facebook all without unlocking your phone.
The cards could eventually become personalized and ordered by favorite sources, most important contacts, etc.
This will become increasingly important as screen sizes decrease to the size of a watch face or glasses, or even jewelry.
" In a world where notifications are full experiences in and of themselves, the screen of app icons makes less and less sense," Intercom concludes. "Apps as destinations makes less and less sense. Why open the Facebook app when you can get the content as a notification and take action — like something, comment on something — right there at the notification or OS level."

Tie-up with Sena only without conditions: BJPstate politics
Announcement comes amid growing frustration within Shiv Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP
Even as a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit continues to lobby for a minority government in Maharashtra with the help of Independents, the party announced on Sunday that it wanted a tie-up with its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena. However, this announcement came with the rider that the Sena should come on board without any conditions.
“We are keen to take the Shiv Sena with us in forming the new government, but they should come forward without any conditions. Discussions on portfolios can come later; it is important to have a meeting of minds,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
The party’s statement came after an outburst by Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar earlier in the day: “The BJP does not want us. Their State leaders do not want the alliance.” Mr. Kirtikar was in Delhi to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high tea for NDA constituents.
There is growing frustration within the Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP ever since the election results. Many in the party feel the BJP is set to humiliate them and is not serious about striking an alliance.
However, the party welcomed the BJP’s statement. Meanwhile, the BJP has announced that its Chief Ministerial candidate will be chosen on Tuesday after a meeting of legislators and MPs. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and senior BJP leaders will be present.
The swearing-in ceremony is expected on October 30 at Wankhede stadium. Mr. Modi may attend the event.

India off Fragile Five list: IMFNew Delhi, October 26, 2014

India off Fragile Five list, says IMF

‘If government undertakes structural reforms it can achieve 7-8 per cent growth’
The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) India Mission Chief has said that among emerging markets and BRICS countries, India stands out for accomplishing the sharpest turnaround in its macro economy since the U.S. Federal Reserve started reversing its zero-interest rates monetary policy. As a result, of all these economies, India is best prepared to deal with the Fed’s monetary policy actions.
Earlier this month, the IMF raised its 2014 India growth forecast to 5.6 per cent as against its 5.4 per cent April projection while cutting its world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection to 3.3 per cent. If the new government follows through with structural reforms India can see a growth of 7 per cent to 8 per cent, IMF India Mission Chief Paul A. Cashin told The Hindu.
“India is the odd man out from the emerging markets and BRICS economies that were being called the Fragile Five last year… But the story for India changed quickly… India is better prepared for shocks today than when the U.S. Fed’s tapering started and more prepared than other emerging markets,” Mr. Cashin said.
The Fed’s initiation of the tapering of its monetary policy triggered sharp volatility in the rupee and a spike in the current account deficit. The CAD is down from the level of 4.7 per cent of the GDP to 1.7 per cent of GDP. “Three percentage points down is a lot... in the IMF’s history there are very few cases of that,” Mr. Cashin said. Substantial dollar inflows have led to India’s foreign exchange reserves rising from $270 billion in August to $315 billion.
The only red flags that Mr. Cashin raised were on retail food inflation and structural reforms in the infrastructure, labour and energy sectors. “Retail food inflation in India has been growing at a 10 per cent plus rate … Few countries have had such problems for such long periods of time,” he said.

The NDA government has appealed to the people to participate “enthusiastically” in the events organised on “National Unity Day”, which will be observed on October 31 to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
“The birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will provide all of us with an opportunity to reaffirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity and security of our country,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in a statement here.
He appealed to the people to participate enthusiastically in the programmes to pay rich tributes to the “real national hero” who was the first home minister of the country. On Friday, the government had announced that every year, it will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day).
A function to pay floral tributes to Patel will be held on Parliament Street, while a ‘Run for Unity’ will be held in major cities, district towns and rural areas for all sections of society, particularly youths and members of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) among others.
In Delhi, the run is being organised from Vijay Chowk to India Gate on Rajpath.

Raut: Gujaratis forgot favours bestowed by Bal Thackeray onthemGujaratis forgot favours bestowed by Bal Thackeray on them, voted for Modi instead: Sanjay Raut
By: Express News Service | Mumbai |       October 27, 2014 12:08 pm
Comments
Sanjay Raut
The Shiv Sena has criticised the Gujarati community living in Mumbai, claiming that they forgot the “favours” bestowed on them by the late Sena chief Bal Thackeray and voted for the BJP because both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah were Gujaratis.
“In Mumbai, there is a substantial Gujarati population whose votes play a decisive role. Because the prime minister and the BJP chief are Gujaratis, a majority of these votes went to the BJP. They forgot the favours granted to them by Balasaheb Thackeray on the issue of Hindutva. Inspite of staying in the state, they came together for their caste and region and voted against the Shiv Sena,” MP and editor of the party’s mouthpiece Saamana Sanjay Raut said in a signed article that appeared on Sunday.
This is not the first time that Raut has written against the Gujaratis. An editorial published on May 1 had questioned why Gujarati traders supporting Modi had never stepped out of their highrises to celebrate Maharashtra Day. Party president Uddhav Thackeray had distanced himself from the statement and there were indications that Raut was reprimanded for writing the piece.
Raut has, however, specified this time that he was not taking an anti-Gujarati stand. “We are not taking an anti-Gujarati stand. Inspite of doing major work, Vinod Ghosalkar and Subhas Desai lost from Dahisar and Goregaon. In Colaba, Pandurang Sakpal, who has done good work, lost. What do these things indicate?” Raut wrote. All these constituencies, incidentally, have a sizeable Gujarati population.
Raut also launched a diatribe against the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen. “In Mumbai and Sambhaji Nagar (the term used by the Sena for Aurangabad), the green colour was tossed with aplomb and two MLAs of a religious and fanatical organisation made an entry into the Assembly. The two… got elected due to the division of votes between the Sena and the BJP,” the article said.
He referred to the MIM as a “green snake” and said it needed to be eliminated from Maharashtra. “Maharashra’s politics has seen the ebbing of the MNS and the emergence of the MIM. However this venom needs to be finished from Maharastra’s polity without thinking about political loss or benefit,” Raut wrote.
The article also refers to the ‘threat’ of Maharashtra’s division. “Inspite of elections being over, the sword still hangs over the head of undivided Maharashtra. The clouds also seem to be darkening over Mumbai’s status,” he wrote.
The article also said that the Sena and the BJP needed to govern Maharashtra together. “If the Sena-BJP fought together, they would have got over 200 seats. But that did not happen. The electorate has placed the two at crossroads as to suggest that both should come together and form a government,” he wrote.
Raut further said that even though the BJP managed to win over 100 seats, the Sena put up an impressive performance having fought a lone battle on the issue of an undivided Maharashtra. “Seventeen of Sena’s continued…

More than a dozen European banks flunk test  need to raisecapitalPrint
By: Associated Press | Frankfurt | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:18 am
The European Central Bank says 13 of Europe’s 130 biggest banks have flunked an in-depth review of their finances and must increase their capital buffers against losses by 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion).
The ECB said 25 banks in all were found to need stronger buffers but that 12 have already made up their shortfall during the months in which the ECB was carrying out its review. The remaining 13 now have two weeks to tell the ECB how they plan to increase their capital buffers.
The ECB checked the worth of banks’ holdings and subjected the banks to a stress test that simulates how their finances would fare in an economic downturn.
The exercise is aimed at strengthening the banking system so lenders can provide more credit to companies, boosting the weak European economy. The economy has been plagued both by banks’ unwillingness to lend at affordable rates and by weak demand from companies that see no reason to risk borrowing. ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said the stress test and asset check were “quite strict’’ and that “the results guarantee that going forward the economic recovery will not be hampered by credit supply restrictions.’’
ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said the stress test and asset check were “quite strict’’ and that “the results guarantee that going forward the economic recovery will not be hampered by credit supply restrictions.’’The bank with the biggest shortfall was Italy’s Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which was found to have a capital shortfall of 2.11 billion euros. Most of the other banks that failed were short amounts less than 1 billion euros and in several cases less than 200 million euros. Eurobank and National Bank of Greece had no or practically no shortfall due to later measurements, while Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka had no need to raise more capital due to restructuring this year. Dexia is already being restructured with a state guarantee and does not need to raise more capital despite failing.

Eurobank and National Bank of Greece had no or practically no shortfall due to later measurements, while Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka had no need to raise more capital due to restructuring this year. Dexia is already being restructured with a state guarantee and does not need to raise more capital despite failing.The asset review and stress tests pave the way for the ECB to take over on November 4 as the Europe’s central banking supervisor. The test is supposed to make sure hidden troubles in the system are fixed before landing in the ECB’s lap.

As gold smuggling rises  DRI calls for lower importdutyPrint
The 330% rise in smuggled gold comes even as imports have jumped by around 450 per cent year-on-year in September touching $3.75 billion.
Written by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:16 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 1:21 am
Seizures of smuggled gold by the directorate of revenue intelligence has risen by an unprecedented 330 per cent during the April-September period as compared to last year, prompting the directorate to call on the finance ministry to bring down the import duty on the yellow metal and make smuggling less lucrative.
This development comes even as gold imports have jumped by around 450 per cent year-on-year in September touching $3.75 billion, which calls into question the effectiveness of the high import duty of 10 per cent.
Experts say that import duty has failed to as a deterrent and demand for gold has only gone up.
“There were 2,150 seizures of gold made by the DRI across the country worth over Rs 600 crore in the last six months. This is huge when compared to 500 seizures worth Rs 150 crore made last year during the same period,” a government official told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.
According to a report by the DRI, gold seizures made up for 24.58 per cent of the total seizures last year compared to 8 per cent of the total seizures in 2012-13. It seized 1,267.26 kg gold in 2013, 200.75 kg in 2012 and 153.26 kg in 2011, according to available figures.
“DRI director general Najib Shah has written to revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das pointing out that the imports have gone up drastically despite high duty. Gold smuggling has emerged as a huge menace for the country. In view of the current situation, the finance ministry should take some decision on high duty rate. Also, it is resulting in huge foreign exchange outgo,” the official added.
In the Budget 2014-15, the government did not reduce the import duty on gold despite the current account deficit (CAD) coming down to 1.7 per cent in 2013-14 from a high of 4.8 per cent in 2012-13.
Last year, the government had taken a slew of measures, including raising the import duty to 10 per cent in phases and restrictions on import, to cut down gold imports. However, the measures led to a rise in smuggling.
Ajay Sahai, director general, Federation of Indian Exports Organisations (Fieo), said that smuggling is on a rise duty due to high duty and not due to supply shortages.“Availability and price are the two factors which contribute to gold smuggling. Clearly, there is no supply shortage as evident by high imports in the last few months. High duty is now becoming counterproductive.

Delhi Confidential: RahulscounselPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:16 am
Rahul Gandhi has been receiving hundreds of suggestions, both directly and indirectly, from scores of leaders and party well-wishers on how to revive the Congress and lift the morale of the workers. But one gets to hear former Union minister Srikant Jena has an interesting advice which stands out. He wants the young Congress V-P to move out of Delhi for some time and camp in a rural location. Rahul should work from that location and meet leaders and workers there, Jena says. He believes party workers would flock to that location, creating a buzz and energising the cadre. It would apparently help Rahul in connecting with the grassroots workers and get a sense of their feelings and aspirations. One doesn’t know what Rahul thinks about this suggestion.
SPACE CRUNCH
The existing office infrastructure for the Home Minister at North Block was proving to be insufficient for the large number of visitors that come to meet Rajnath Singh every day. Therefore, a new guest room has been constructed adjacent to his corner office. The minister’s security has also blocked an open space in the gallery leading to the elevator that the minister uses. And to further control access to the minister’s room, a door frame metal detector (DFMD), which was earlier placed beyond the elevator’s door, has now been right ahead of it.
LEARNING TRACK
Given the responsibility to restructure the Railway Board and overhaul the functioning of the Railway Ministry, the high-level committee headed by Bibek Debroy has set out to learn a thing or two about how the Railways operate. During its first interaction with members of the Railway Board, the committee was ‘advised’ to go out in the field and witness the complexities in the functioning of the Railways. The committee, only one member of which has a Railway background, is therefore said to have decided to take an outstation trip and go to Chhattisgarh to familiarise itself with the coal loading operations in a bid to understand the freight business of Railways.
POWER EQUATION
There was no attempt to hide the new power equation in the BJP when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to the party headquarters for his first media interaction over the weekend. The ‘Diwali Milan’ had been hosted by party president Amit Shah and he seemed to have made sure that the reigning power structure was made as obvious as possible. Special chairs, bigger in size with shimmering upholstery, were kept for Modi and Shah on the dais. The chairs for other BJP leaders, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Prakash Javadekar, J P Nadda and Shrikant Sharma, were smaller and of a different colour.

Car safety  design to get priority under newbodyA file picture of the crash test done by the UK-based Global NCAP in January.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:12 am
Carmakers in India would be forced to recalibrate their focus on safety, with the Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India — an independent agency proposed in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill — expected to wield the stick on issues such as standards for the design and construction of passenger cars.
Also, from next year, the Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program is expected to be rolled out, under which the safety of passengers would be assessed by testing cars in front-on and side-on crashes.
India currently does not have a new car assessment programme to provide buyers with independent reports of vehicles’ crash safety and vehicle makers are not required to meet the United Nation’s basic crash-test standards, something that is mandatory in markets across the world.
The two measures assume significance in light of a random crash test conducted by an independent agency in January this year, where three cars out of the five cars failed the front impact crash tests on account of basic structural deficiencies in the body.This is even as a variant of one of these car models that is sold in the European market was found to be carrying the highest rating safety certification offered by the same agency in similar crash tests conducted on cars sold in the European Union.

Belief: An Underutilized Toolreddit
There are many life lessons taught every day, such as ways to deal with others, subject matter expertise, and learning basic survival skills.  However, there isn't enough time allocated to teach individuals about the power of belief.  This is surprising because belief is often a cornerstone of success.  Moreover, if individuals don't believe in themselves, then the reason that others should believe in their activities or causes might not be as great.
Belief is a thought, feeling, or an internal drive that can be used to overcome an obstacle, advance toward a goal, or move beyond past challenges --- sometimes in spite of overwhelming odds.  Belief isn't required to move forward; although, it's an important tool to help summon the energy to persevere during difficult moments or challenging times.  Furthermore, the biggest benefit of possessing belief is that it supports something that is significant to someone --- even if nobody else agrees with it.
Belief is something that is true to an individual, very personal, needs to be developed, and can be a powerful tool for personal development.  It's also a characteristic that can help individuals move forward, solve an issue, or to achieve a goal.  Nevertheless, everyone doesn't have belief in themselves or may choose not to leverage their belief system to maximize their potential.  Some reasons that belief might not be fully utilized are: self-doubt, fear, others' opinions, etc.  Notwithstanding, a significant reason that belief isn't used more often is that life experiences greatly influence an individual's ability to "believe."
Things that happen during someone's lifetime effect their perspective and outlook. If an individual has had positive experiences associated with their beliefs, then their outlook is usually more positive. Conversely, if an individual has had bad experiences associated with their beliefs, then their outlook might be more negative. Although, a single bad experience won't always impact someone's future outlook, unless an individual learns to SEE; that is, the individual experiences a (S)ignificant (E)motional (E)vent.
Once an individual begins to SEE, there is a realization -- temporary or long-term -- that something that was once believed to be unimportant is actually important or something that was believed to be important might not be as significant.
There are several components of belief:
concept - an individual envisions a way to accomplish a task, activity, or project, which doesn't need to be fully understood for an idea to be developed;
consideration - something is evaluated as a possibility, but hasn't been selected as a viable option;
convenience - something that is used, done, or believed only if there is a potential benefit to an individual's position, situation, or desired outcome.
Oftentimes, belief might not be used sufficiently because of a lack of confidence, questionable arrogance, or a negative roadblock. Therefore, belief must be developed and maintained to achieve an internal balance that will support their goals, which includes an ability to be positive in their actions, to not be confident in a condescending manner, and to prevent any self-defeating activities that might prevent themselves or others from making forward-progress.
Belief can be a challenge because no matter the amount that someone wants something to be true. There aren't any guarantees that a belief is correct, achievable, plausible, possible, reasonable, or viable. As a result, belief requires faith in something that -- many times -- cannot be proven to be achievable or attainable at the time it's pursued.
Other challenges with the development of belief are that individuals:
have doubts;
aren't confident in their own capabilities;
have a need for approval;
haven't solidified their belief;
have a fear that prevents a pursuit of something that might be true.
Belief helps to provide energy to complete something that someone wants to achieve; however, anyone who doesn't believe in something that is thought, done, or pursued can give-up long before the desired outcome is achieved.  For this reason, individuals must understand that belief isn't required to accomplish something; although, belief can be a significant factor between experiencing success or failure.
Activities that can help develop belief:
Work on a dream despite fears, which sometimes requires moving past personal limitations and barriers to develop an idea or to achieve a desired outcome.
Consider an idea to be in-progress and build on it.
Act as if there isn't a possibility of failure.
Continue to be self-motivated --- even if there are setbacks.
Minimize doubts and worries to maximize opportunities for success.
Learn a lot from each effort --- even if the outcome isn't as desired or expected.
Beliefs might not always be realized; however, individuals who don't pursue their positive beliefs can limit opportunities, options, and possibilities for a better future for themselves and others.
Remember ... no matter the length of your journey, always be your best.
Additional information on the development of belief can be obtained from Mr. Young's presentation about " belief " and his solution-oriented book " Management Spotlight: Belief ".

A Letter to Consumers  Travelers and Humans...reddit
Dear fellow guests, shoppers, travelers, and customers in general,
I hope you don't mind me mentioning this to you. I mean, you don't even know me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, and I just felt compelled to speak up. You see, your flight was delayed, but it wasn't that poor man's fault working the check-in counter at the gate. He had nothing to do with the flight being delayed. It's not like he went out and unscrewed some nuts and bolts or removed the airplane's left wing as a joke. So why are you yelling at him? He doesn't deserve to have you all up in his grill over something that is completely beyond his control.
Or how about you, degenerate gambler who brought his paycheck to the casino? Did the cashier who just broke your last $50 FORCE you to spend it all in that slot machine? Why do you feel the need to give her a mean and nasty attitude? Why did you spend all your money? Just because YOU had a bad day, that doesn't mean you have to make everyone around you just as miserable.
I was at the social security office the other day, applying for a replacement card for my oldest. And as they called each person in the queue up to be waited on, I continued to hear complaint after complaint. "Why didn't anyone tell us this??" "We didn't know we had to fill out THAT paperwork." And no amount of sweetness or kindness from the customer service rep would appease these unhappy folks. So I made a point, when it was our turn, to try to be as nice and genuinely kind as I possibly could. I figured, I wasn't going in to solve a problem, I just needed a new card. And the woman who waited on us probably needed a smiling face to deal with, for a change. I also made it a point to explain this to my 17 year old so that she, too, can see that it's always better to try to make someone's day better instead of worse. Why add to their stress?
People working in the customer service industry don't deserve to be treated like doormats. They're doing a job. Sometimes it's a thankless job, sometimes they have to deal with real assbags. And they usually have to smile and take all the crap that's being dished out to them. After all, 'the customer's always right.' Well I call bullshit. Let me fill you in on a little secret. When your grandmother said "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar," she wasn't talking out the ass of her granny panties. She was telling the truth.
I worked in the customer service industry for many, many years in the casino biz. I worked around people who were at all-time highs, winning jackpots, and all-time lows, losing everything. I paid out winning Keno tickets to people who had to scrape together pennies to afford the $2 cost, and I watched millionaires lose thousands of dollars in slot machines, sometimes hundreds of thousands. It sometimes broke my heart to watch people, who I knew could not afford to be at the casino, continue to spend dollar after dollar, chasing a jackpot that would never come. And some of those people were absolutely beautiful on the inside AND on the outside. Always with a smile, win or lose. And I cringed as I watched people who could afford to light their cigars with $100 bills show nothing but disrespect to cocktail waitresses or dealers. Why?? Why can't people be nicer to folks who are just doing a job?
My point is this: The people who are waiting on you are NOT getting paid extra to take shit from you. A simple smile and a kind word go SO much farther than a bad attitude and a scowl. Are there customer service reps out there that aren't very nice? Sure there are, and they usually don't hold those jobs for very long. But for the ones who DO try to make your experience as quick and painless as possible, take a moment to smile. Take a second to say "thank you, I really appreciate that." You'd be absolutely amazed at how good not only you'll make that person feel, but yourself as well. You'll come away feeling a little better, and that's never a bad thing.
Warmly,

Heavy rain disrupts normal life in Andhra; crops submergedBy: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:48 am
Normal life was thrown out of gear at several places in Andhra Pradesh Sunday with incessant rain lashing the state under the influence of north-east monsoon.
The heavy rain led to water logging and submergence of low-lying areas in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Kadapa and Prakasam, among others, according to reports reaching here.
Several rivulets and other water bodies were in spate following the downpour, which flooded agriculture crops and disrupted road traffic at several places.
The north-east monsoon has been vigorous over south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema. Under its impact, rain occurred at most places in the two regions and at a few places over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Macharla in coastal Andhra received 29 cm rainfall.
Moderate to rather heavy rain or thundershowers would occur at many places over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema till Monday, it added.

CM Rawat trumps BJP with Ramdevs Kedarnath visitNext to Ramdev is Ranjit Rawat, aide of CM Rawat. (Source: Express photo by Virender Singh Negi)
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:44 am
A visit by Baba Ramdev to the Kedarnath shrine last week appears to have handed the aces to the Congress government in Uttarakhand against the BJP.
Ramdev praised Harish Rawat as “an able CM” after his return from a visit on which he was accompanied by one of the chief minister’s closets aides, former MLA Ranjit Singh Rawat. Apart from sending out the message that the politically influential yoga guru is no longer out of bounds for the Congress in Uttarakhand, it also allows the Congress to steal a march on the BJP.
The same Congress government, then under CM Vijay Bahuguna, had registered a series of revenue-related cases against Ramdev’s Patanjali Yogapeeth just before the Lok Sabha elections.
What has caused the BJP all the more cause for consternation is Rawat’s latest move to invite Haridwar-based priests to Kedarnath so that they can see for themselves the reconstruction work undertaken by the government after the June 2013 flash floods. Those who have already visited include Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanand Brahamchari, Satpal Brahamchari, Swami Mohandas and Swami Shivanand Bharti.
Morari Bapu, too, recently visited Kedarnath to offer prayers. Although the trip was planned by Morari himself, the CM was with him at Kedar valley’s Agastyamuni town where the bapu distributed cheques to a number of the disaster victims, apart from donating Rs 1 crore to the Badri-Kedarnath temple committee. “We want spiritual leaders to look at the reconstruction work and make suggestions. They have a large number of followers and can spread a positive message about the state,” Chief Minister Rawat told The Indian Express over the phone. Next among Rawat’s planned invitations are Sudhanshu Maharaj and the Art of Living’s Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

Next among Rawat’s planned invitations are Sudhanshu Maharaj and the Art of Living’s Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.
“The CM should focus on welfare schemes. The government has done nothing to generate jobs for people in areas hit by the disaster,” said the BJP’s Uttarakhand president Tirath Singh Rawat. “The trek route to Kedarnath is not yet in proper shape.”
Former CM Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, now BJP MP from Nainital, has demanded that the state hand over Kedarnath’s infrastructure development to the centre.
Such criticism explains the way Rawat is dealing with Kedarnath. “He has given special focus on highlighting the reconstruction work. His decision to hold a cabinet meeting in Kedarnath was part of a strategy to stop the BJP from using against the government their allegations of mishandling of of the situation ,” a Congress source said.Last week, Rawat held an all-party continued…

Between BJP and power bid  Hemant evolved and assuredLooked uncertain when he took over, now even Congress backing him as leader of alliance in polls.
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:41 am
Its confidence high after the Lok Sabha and two assembly election victories, the BJP will inevitably target emerging the single largest party in the Jharkhand assembly too. That will leave the other parties with the objective of thwarting the BJP by cobbling together alliances that will possibly inch them past the majority mark in the 81-member House.
With that objective, the Congress has announced that it would fight the elections under the leadership of the JMM’s Hemant Soren. At the time of one of its worst crises, the Congress has placed its trust in a debutant MLA who had been CM for just 15 months. “He has no ego and is easy to negotiate with. He is transparent and has evolved into a good leader,” said Congress leader Ajay Kumar, who was involved in the talks leading to the announcement.
This October is a far cry from January 2013 when Hemant, 39, who had pulled down the Arjun Munda government, was made to wait six months by the Congress before it lent its support. Back then, even those within the JMM knew very little of someone they respected only because he was Shibu Soren’s son. Hemant, a bespectacled, slight man, could not match the stature of his brother Durga Soren, who was the de facto chief of the party until his death in 2009.
Even as recently as April, a senior BJP leader had noted, “Guruji wants to be CM still. Wait and see, Hemant will fail; Guruji will take over to save the party.” His father’s old aides were up in arms over their reduced role in the decision-making process; Hemant had allied with the RJD, which had opposed the creation of Jharkhand.
Signs of Hemant’s evolution began to show before the Lok Sabha elections. He fired Congress leader Chandrashekhar Dubey from his cabinet for personal attacks, and did nothing to stop senior leader Hemlal Murmu from joining the BJP, for it removed one of the party’s power centres out of his way. And in the elections, Hemant was the only one who stood between the BJP and a clean sweep, with the JMM winning two of the four seats it had contested. Hemant had micro-managed his father’s campaign in Dumka; in Rajmahal, he handpicked Vijay Hansdak and made sure he won against Murmu.After the elections, Hemant fired another cabinet colleague, Simon Marandi, who used to boast that he had mentored Shibu Soren. Last month, he fired the Congress’s Yogendra Sao. “We are the only party that has dared to fire ministers for incompetence. Guruji fired two; Hemant has fired three,” said JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.

7 arrested in Bengal clash  remanded in 5-day custodyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Bhangor (wb) | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:40 am
Four more persons were arrested in connection with Saturday’s clash between two factions of the Trinamool Congress at Bhangor in South 24-Parganas district, taking the number of persons held to seven, police said on Sunday.
All the seven accused were produced in the SDJM’s court at Baruipur and remanded in five days’ police custody.
Two youths were killed in the clash at Deota village in Bhangor on Saturday, which is a Trinamool Congress stronghold and the local gram panchayat is also controlled by the party. Among those arrested since Saturday were Baonta gram panchayat pradhan Panchu Gopal Mondal, police said.
One Bapan Mondal was gunned down by some people, following which the rival group shot dead Rajesh Mondal in retaliation during the clash.
Villagers and opposition CPM claimed that the intra-party clash took place because of rivalry over control of the local panchayat.
The Opposition alleged that panchayat chief Panchu Mondal had been removed by the group claiming allegiance to TMC leader Arabul Islam.

Jarawa film: Lookout notice against French duo soonBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:38 am
A lookout notice would soon be issued against two French filmmakers who allegedly trespassed into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve and secretly filmed a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe in the Andaman islands.
“We are cross-checking the records of their arrival in India with the immigration office. Once we have the exact dates we will send a lookout notice against them through the Ministry of External Affairs,” North and Middle Andaman Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Meena told PTI from Port Blair.
Last week, an FIR was filed against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert under various sections of the Protection of Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012 and Foreigners Amendment Act 2004.
Police have since then arrested two locals of Karen community and is looking for two others who had helped the filmmakers meet Jarawa tribals.
The filmmakers had uploaded details and photographs on a website and a Facebook page which were removed after the filmmakers were sent a notice by the Union Territory’s administration, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
Extremely vulnerable to diseases, the 400-strong Jarawa tribe live as nomadic hunter gatherers and till as recent as 1998 they had hardly any contact with the outside world.
“Making any contact or shooting photos, videos with them is illegal. The filmmakers have violated the law of the land and will have to face trial as per law once we are able to catch hold of them,” the SP said.
Andaman and Nicobar’s tribal welfare secretary Theva Neethi Dhas said the Jarawas have also confirmed that two foreigners and a translator had visited them during March-April period. Members of the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti are authorised by the administration to talk to the Jarawas who can speak in their native language only.
On their website, the filmmakers claimed to have gathered huge material — photos, films and interviews  — about the Jarawas. The film ‘Organic’, which is currently in post-production stage, is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.
“In order to finish it we will launch a crowd-funding campaign at the end of 2014. We hope to release Organic in theatres in 2015,” the filmmakers had said. They said they found a way to meet and interview the Jarawas several times during the last three years.
Officials said it is not easy to man the tribal area and ensure that no unauthorised person meet the Jarawas. “We have a police lookout post outside the tribal reserve, but since the area is too big it is a tough task for us,” the SP said.
Jarawas, among the four major tribes including Great Andamanese, Onge and Sentinelese, are believed to have lived in their Indian Ocean home for nearly 55,000 years.

Home for Diwali  Lakhan back at bus stop  tied topoleLakhan Sawant Kale is tied to a pole in Mumbai on Saturday. His grandmother is also seen. (Source: Express photo by Vasant Prabhu)
Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:20 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 2:21 am
By: VASANT PRABHU & DIPTI NAGPAUL D’SOUZA
On Saturday, while the streets were abuzz with festivities, nine-year-old Lakhan Sawant Kale sat on the pavement near Mantralaya, one hand tied to a pole of the bus stop. The long strip of cloth used to bind him allowed the boy — suffering from cerebral palsy and seizure disorder — to move about, but ensured he doesn’t stray too far from where his grandmother, a pavement dweller, sat.
Ironically, the boy was in the same situation that The Indian Express had found him in May this year. Following this newspaper’s reports dated May 20 and 21) revealing his plight, Lakhan had received help and had been admitted to a school for special children in Satara, Samata Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, in July (The Indian Express edition dated July 2).
Lakhan’s 66-year-old grandmother, Sakkubai Shiva Kale, says that the boy was brought back to Mumbai on October 21, ahead of Diwali. “It’s a festive season and we wanted him back with the family for a few days. He will be returning to school soon,” she said. Partha Polke, who heads the Satara school, confirmed the same, adding Sakkubai had applied for leave for Lakhan until November 7.
Asked why the nine-year-old had been once again tied, Sakkubai cited her inability to run after Lakhan as the reason. “Given his condition, he doesn’t understand the risk of being run over by a vehicle when he plays on streets. I am too old to chase after him all the time. I am left with no option but to tie him up,” she said.
While this can be viewed as a one-off incident until Lakhan returns to school next month, it throws light on the larger problem. In a country where disabilities such as cerebral palsy or even mental disorders are rarely understood and considered a taboo even by the educated and the well-to-do, the poor find themselves dealing with it with their limited means and no support from the government.
After The Indian Express wrote about Lakhan’s situation in May, it was a private NGO, Manav Foundation, that came to his aid, ensuring that he was temporarily admitted to the Dongri shelter and then finding him a place in Polke’s school-and-hostel facility.
Talking about the challenge she had faced, Manav Foundation’s Meena Mutha had said, “It wasn’t easy to find a suitable place for the boy. The city is lacking in facilities for people who suffer from disorders like Lakhan. And the ones that are already there were either full to capacity or were demanding a high admission fee.”
Polke, however, says Lakhan has improved ever since his admission to the school in July. “He can now eat on continued…

Taking terror totaskPrint
Written by Soli J Sorabjee | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:15 am
Hafiz Saeed was the brain behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured during the 26/11 terror strike, acknowledged meeting Hafiz Saeed in a training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, where he and other terrorists were given commando training.
The US state department formerly has designated Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) as a foreign terrorist organisation. However, after the original designation, the LeT repeatedly changed its name in an effort to avoid sanctions. More specifically, the LeT created the Jama’at-ud-Dawa (JuD) as a front organisation for the preaching of Islam, politics, and “social work”. Consequently, the US state department placed the Hafiz Saeed-run JuD in the list of banned foreign terrorist organisations and designated Hafiz Saeed as a global terrorist. In 2012, the US offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Despite these measures, Hafiz Saeed roams freely in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s abject failure to proceed against Hafiz is sought to be justified on two grounds. Firstly, the difficulty of proceeding under preventive detention laws in the absence of evidence which can withstand strict judicial scrutiny. Secondly, according to Pakistan’s criminal jurisprudence, guilt has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and there is a paucity of requisite evidence for Hafiz’s arrest and conviction.
Apart from the legal untenability of these excuses, the critical point is that Section 153-A of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 is conveniently ignored. This section inter alia prohibits any person from making speeches which promote or incite feelings of enmity or hatred or ill-will between different communities and countries on grounds of religion or any other ground. Hafiz Saeed is neither preaching Islam nor is he a person who is engaged in social work as Pakistani authorities would have us believe.
There is ample incontrovertible evidence of Hafiz Saeed regularly spewing venom with great gusto against India and its citizens with impunity. Pakistan authorities are surely aware of the same and perhaps they are not unhappy about it. I do not favour Pakistan-bashing and believe that there is no option but dialogue between the two nuclear-armed countries. However, Pakistan’s alibi for not prosecuting Hafiz Saeed is specious. It raises serious doubts about Pakistan’s sincerity about having friendly relations with India because the people of India find it impossible to accept Pakistan’s favoured hospitable treatment of Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Is Hafiz Saeed more important to Pakistan than friendly relations with India? The ball lies in Pakistan’s court.

Woman Maoist surrenders inChhattisgarhBy: Press Trust of India | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:14 am
A dreaded woman Maoist, carrying a reward of Rs 8 lakh on her head, surrendered in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district Sunday, police said.
Sita alias Jagarbati (23) turned herself in before police citing atrocities and exploitation of female cadres by senior rebels, Dantewada SP Kamlochan Kashyap told PTI.
Associated with the outlawed CPI(Maoist) since 2010, Sita was working as a member of 2nd battalion of Mad Uttar Bastar Division in Naxal-den Abhujmad, he said, adding that she had been involved in several crimes in the region.

Alcohol warning not to apply to all films  says CBFCchiefPrint
Written by Dipti Nagpaul | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:12 am
Following the furore over statutory warnings during drinking scenes in Happy New Year, CBFC chairperson Leela Samson said the warnings were included not as a ‘rule’, but to give the film ‘U’ (universal) certificate.
Samson said the certification guidelines specify that a film ‘glorifying’ consumption of alcohol cannot be given a ‘U’ certificate, but a ‘U/A’ certificate that implies an adult should accompany a minor to the movie.
“Shah Rukh Khan was keen on a ‘U’ certificate for this film. Since there was a drinking scene, he voluntarily accepted to put the ticker warning,” Samson said.
A source from Red Chillies Entertainments, not willing to be named, accepted the CBFC chairperson’s claim, saying: “We have very happily included the warning in the film.”
The statutory warnings had triggered a furore among film personalities, with speculations that the ‘rule’ will now apply to all films.
This, at a time when the industry is protesting the existing mandatory warning that pops up when characters are shown smoking.
Samson, however, said it was not a ‘rule’, but “a warning for children”.
“This does not amount to any new diktat on part of the government or the CBFC. This will not apply to all films,” she explained.
However, CBFC’s new Regional Officer for Mumbai Rahul Vaidya’s suggestion to show the ticker has set off speculation. Two 2014 releases, Yaariyan and Kick, have scenes showing alcohol consumption, but both were cleared with a ‘U’ certificate.
In fact, never before in Hindi films has a message against drinking been included. Guests sipping from glasses was a common sight in films from the ‘60s and ‘70s. And who can forget Keshto Mukerjee, rarely seen playing sober characters, the inebriated Veeru (Dharmendra) in Sholay or the alcoholic protagonist played by Amitabh Bachchan in Sharaabi. Both Sharaabi and Sholay, ironically, have a ‘U’ certificate.
On being pointed out such points, Samson said, “You are talking about different times and different panels. Like everything in this country, variance is the name of reality.”
She added that the media unnecessarily criticised the recent move. “Vaidya thought it would be right to carry the warning, it was supported by the panel as well as Khan. Khan had the option of refusing and writing to me. But time is of the essence, so I can understand his haste,” she added.

China tells Nepal what todoChina has brazenly told Kathmandu that it is not happy about the presence of activists fomenting trouble in Tibet.
Written by Yubaraj Ghimire | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:12 am
China has sent a clear message to Nepal that it is keen to invest in the country but would like a secure environment for that. It has candidly prescribed some bilateral and internal arrangements. Chinese authorities recently told Nepal’s visiting Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam that a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement (BIPPA) would encourage China to invest more, and with confidence, in Nepal.
Nepal had signed a BIPPA with India about two years ago. The least China wants is the same priority treatment from Nepal, where political instability and the prolonged transition have taken a heavy toll on development. In recent years, China has been more assertive with Nepal and has sometimes brazenly told Kathmandu that it is not happy about the presence of international activists fomenting trouble in Tibet. “They want to have an extradition treaty along with the BIPPA,” Gautam said on his return.
China is increasing its presence in Nepal, even as most Nepali citizens see very little chance of their current political leaders delivering a meaningful constitution by the January 22 deadline. Beijing is also worried that a campaign of 22 parties, led by Maoist chief Prachanda, for identity- and ethnicity-based federalism will have a direct bearing on Tibet. China has been repeatedly warning against such a federal state being endorsed during the constitution-writing process.
However, those involved in constitution-making have, till date, not discussed how the identity issue can be addressed without making it the basis of federating the state. The proponents of federalism fear that a fresh review of the issue may also reopen for debate two other crucial agendas — a republican and secular Nepal. But these issues are already being debated and a section of the Nepali Congress is set to launch a campaign for a “Hindu Nepal”.
Many political leaders, including Maoist ideologue and former PM Baburam Bhattarai, called on former king Gyanendra in hospital, where he was admitted after a heart attack. There is reliable information that representatives of other countries too have seen Gyanendra and shared their worries about Nepal’s fate. Gyanendra has displayed statesmanship, wished all parties success for the constitution-writing, while ignoring the humiliation he has been subjected to. Such conduct has made him arguably more popular than most political leaders today.
There are reports that Indian PM Narendra Modi was keen on meeting Gyanendra during his visit in August. But that might have sent a different message, since the Indian establishment treated him as persona non grata through the April 2006 transfer of power. But Modi seems to have grasped that India is being linked with the political chaos in Nepal. During the SAARC summit, Modi plans to visit to Janakpur (Sita’s birthplace), Lumbini (Buddha’s birthplace) and Jomsom, site of the Muktinath continued…

CBI arrests 3 officials of another OrissafirmPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:09 am
Close on the heels of arrests of Bollywood model Preeti Bhatia in Artha Tatwa chit fund scam, the CBI Sunday arrested three officials, including CMD Anjan Kumar Baliarsingh, of another chit fund group Nabadiganta Capital Services.
The public limited company had raised huge sums from people assuring good returns, but cheated them. Apart from Baliarsingh, CBI arrested two directors of the company — Kartikeya Parida and Pradeep Patnaik. The trio were taken to Capital Hospital for a medical check-up after which they were produced in the CBI court.
However, CBI officials were mum over the fate of BJD’s Mayurbhanj MP Ramchandra Hansda and two ex-MLAs Subarna Nayak of BJD and Hitesh Bagarti of BJP who were interrogated Sunday for the second time in a week over their role in the Nabadiganta scam. All the three were directors with the company.
Incidentally, Hansda during the questioning Sunday, said the Rs 28 lakh in cash found from his house during a raid in July belonged to his supporters. In the previous round of interrogation, Hansda had said it was his own money and not the deposits of Nabadignata investors.
The BJD MP said he had been persuaded to join Nabadiganta Capital Services as a director by its CMD Baliarsingh, but resigned once it became a public limited company in 2013. He said he had neither invested money with the company, nor received any remuneration as a director. Nayak, too, said he had did not get any money as a director. Former Nuapada MLA Hitesh Bagarti, on the other hand, said he invested Rs 3-4 lakh in the company, but didn’t get a return.

A way out ofalienationComprising 10.6 per cent of the state’s population, Muslims have never had more than 12 MLAs.
Written by Jyoti Punwani | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:08 am
Many seemingly contradictory conclusions have emerged from the recent assembly polls. Self-styled spokesmen of the Muslim community may have railed against the Congress’s continuous treatment of their community as a captive vote bank. Yet, according to the Lokniti-CSDS poll published in The Indian Express (‘Behind BJP, Upper Castes, OBCs and Rich’, October 21), 53 per cent of Muslims voted for the party. If the figures are to be believed, these “spokesmen” need to get in touch with their own community at the grassroots. Again, notwithstanding the continuing arrests of Muslims on terror charges under the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-controlled state home ministry, Sharad Pawar’s party got the second highest percentage of the Muslim vote: 16 per cent. Five candidates from the Congress and one from the NCP got elected.
What explains this continuing trust among almost 70 per cent of Maharashtra’s Muslims in the two parties that have ruled them for 15 years, but done little for them? Could it be the enduring legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru, seen as the architect of our secularism? Or of Indira Gandhi, still remembered by elderly Muslims as a friend of the poor, thanks to her rural welfare schemes? Could it be the fear of the Sena-BJP, which the “secular” parties, especially the oldest of them, the Congress, have always invoked to keep Muslims under their wing? For the average Muslim in Maharashtra, Narendra Modi invokes the same fear and loathing that former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray did.
This fear was played up to the hilt during the Lok Sabha campaign, again by self-styled Muslim “leaders” (with generous Congress backing), who were alarmed at the way their youth was deserting its “secular protectors” and turning to Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party in droves. But six months later, many of the same “leaders” were rooting for Modi and Uddhav Thackeray, to “teach the Congress-NCP a lesson that they can’t take us for granted”. For the first time, the BJP won 13 per cent of the Muslim vote, even more than the Shiv Sena’s 11 per cent. Even the strident “love jihad” and “Hindutva-is-India’s-identity” campaign by the BJP/ RSS in the four months of Modi’s rule at the Centre didn’t drive Maharashtra’s Muslims away completely.
Why did one-fourth of them vote for the saffron parties?
The Congress is primarily responsible. It has ruled the state since its formation in 1960, except for two brief intervals. Recurring communal riots, benevolence towards both Hindu rioters and the partisan police, and arrests, torture and prolonged imprisonment without trial of young Muslims for alleged acts of terror, have left the community seething. Indifference of and discrimination by the state, especially the bureaucracy, have led to 59 per cent of them living below the poverty line, in ghettos, lagging behind in education and employment — findings of the Mehmood-ur-Rehman Committee, continued…

At least nine persons were killed – five of them women – and 26 others injured when a night bus run by the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) went off the highway and fell into a small river in Nagaon district in central Assam late last night.
Nagaon district SP Arabinda Kalita said the ill-fated bus was on its way from North Lakhimpur in eastern Assam to Guwahati when the accident occurred. Majority of the passengers were on their way to catch a train in Guwahati today morning en route to Lucknow and other places for visiting some places of pilgrimage.

“The bus which had also picked up some other passengers on the way must have lost control following which it hit the railings of a bridge and fell into a small river. While eight persons had died on the spot, one person died on being shifted to a hospital,” SP Kalita said. The accident occurred at village Uluwoni under Kaliabor police station at around 1:30 AM, after having traveled about two kilometers after crossing the Kaliabhomora bridge on the Brahmaputra.
Eight of the dead have been identified as Pranita Dutta, Jogen Barua, Padumi Barua, Nila Bora, Dhanada Saikia, Kusha Gogoi (driver), Ananda Bora and his wife Nilima Bora. While 26 others who were rescued by local villagers and sent to local hospitals at Kaliabor and Nagaon, 10 of them were later shifted to Guwahati Medical College Hospital here.
Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is currently in New Delhi, has ordered an inquiry to be conducted by the secretary of the state transport department. The state government also announced ex-gratia to the next of kin of those killed and announced free treatment to those who sustained injuries.

1 000-hr Assam district bandh: Nagaland seeks CentreshelpPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:29 am
The 1,000-hour bandh in Karbi Anglong district of Assam beginning Monday has caused serious concern in Nagaland with its Chief Minister TR Zeliang seeking Centre’s intervention so that the road communication to the adjoining hill state is not cut off.
Zeliang has written a letter to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh saying the proposed bandh would cut off road communication and affect supply of essential items, including foodgrain, medicine, petroleum products to Nagaland as well as Manipur. A 23-km stretch of NH 29, which is the only lifeline for Nagaland and Manipur, passes through Karbi Anglong district where bandhs and incidents of violence take place frequently.
The 1,000-hour bandh has been called by Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State (JACAS) of Karbi Anglong demanding creation of an autonomous state out of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, the two hill districts of Assam.
Zeliang said frequent bandhs in the Assam district has always caused endless problems to Nagaland and Manipur, and the affected states are not even remotely connected to the issues raised during most of these bandhs.
In a meeting of the Northeast chief ministers held in Guwahati on August 21, Nagaland had specifically raised the issue of frequent bandhs in Assam. Zeliang had also called upon Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju to take up the issue of frequent bandhs seriously.
Meanwhile, Karbi Anglong Deputy Commissioner PK Buragohain said the district authorities would ensure free movement of vehicles, including those bound for Nagaland and Manipur, by providing armed escorts on the national highway. “We will ensure that no disruption occurs on NH 29,” he said.
A spokesman of JACAS said the 1,000-hour bandh has been called in order to press for resumption of talks with Centre on the issue of creating an autonomous state encompassing the two 6th Schedule hill districts of Assam and introduction of a Bill in Parliament for creation of the autonomous state in the Winter Session. “We want the Government of India to finalise the structure of the autonomous state on the basis of the proposal submitted by JACAS on November 6, 2013 to the Ministry of Home Affairs,” JACAS said.

I first met Lucian in 1990 at his home in Holland Park. I had just started working for James Kirkman, Lucian’s dealer at the time. The studio, where he lived, was on the top floor. After that first meeting he would phone me every morning. A couple of weeks later he invited me round again. He always kept the door from his flat to the actual studio closed but he asked me in. Two rooms had been knocked into one and a skylight had been added. There was something both worldly and grand. Because it was still and quiet, there was the feeling that something was going on with a definite sense of purpose – something to be taken very seriously. For me, the studio had relevance and vitality. It was a place that made you reflect.

Air-conditioning that’s cheap. Cool!
When I first spent time there I thought I would never need to travel anywhere else because in this place I could find everything. It offered a perspective on one’s own circumstances.
There were two easels with large paintings on them of a naked man, Leigh Bowery, and an iron single bed with the green-and-white-striped mattress. In the corner was the sink, which I had only seen before in paintings. Two trolleys were stacked high and overflowing with tubes of paints. Cotton rags for cleaning brushes and palettes, made from discarded hotel linen, lay in mountainous piles on the studio floor beside boxes full of new and used brushes. The room smelled of genuine turpentine and linseed oil. The walls were covered in semi-dry, clotted paint scraped from his palette when he cleaned. The paint was left to dry, building up over many years like deposits of guano on rock. He also used any bare wall to scribble reminders about a particular painting, phone numbers or paint colours that were running low. I would come to check the walls as a kind of ongoing diary.
You have to trust what you see and what you feel . . . I never put anything into a painting that I don’t actually see when I’m painting . . . I am always reacting to what is there. You have the person in front of you and you are trying to relay something of who the person is as a physical and emotional presence
- Lucian Freud
Portrait of David Dawson Holland Park, 1996
I had been seeing Lucian every morning for six years before he asked me to sit for a painting. At the first sitting Lucian said he would prefer it if I was lying on the bed and naked. His initial idea was to make the painting a group portrait and he had asked Henrietta, another painter, to sit. He also wanted to include his whippet, Pluto. He chose a tall, thin portrait canvas. When he started drawing he placed me across the canvas and asked Henrietta to stand at the foot of the bed. Within a short time he decided to paint us individually and began a fresh canvas for Henrietta. He then concentrated on my head and shoulders. Pluto was curled up under my arm and the painting became a double portrait. Lucian loved fur and skin. He always tried to catch a scene rather than compose it.

Speaking to [Freud’s friend, the art critic] Bill Feaver, Lucian had said, “If I’m putting someone in a picture I like to feel that they’ve fallen asleep there, or they’ve elbowed their own way in. They are there not to make the picture easy on the eye or more pleasant . . . ” He liked things to look awkward in the way that life looks awkward. The idea of a story didn’t bother him as he thought “everything’s a story”.

To paint the portrait of the Queen we set up an easel in a small restoration studio used for the Royal Collection in St James’s Palace. Lucian thought the light was lovely. He felt it created a sympathetic atmosphere. The Queen was very generous and cleared her calendar for the amount of time that would suit Lucian and give him every chance to complete the painting. Henrietta Edwards, a courtier, stepped in as the model when it came for the diadem to be painted. The following year he painted Henrietta’s portrait, “Woman with Eyes Closed”.

Madrid, 2010
Bill Acquavella, whose gallery represented Lucian, would arrange certain visits and accompany us to see paintings. An exhibition at the Pompidou in Paris in 2010 inspired Lucian to revisit the city and then we went on to Madrid to see one of his favourite works, Velázquez’s “Las Meninas”, at the Prado. [The art dealer] Jay Jopling and [Rijksmuseum director of collections] Taco Dibbits arranged for Lucian to come to Amsterdam to see the Rembrandts at the time when the Rijksmuseum was closed for renovation. We also saw the Van Gogh self-portrait out of its frame, which was an extraordinary moment, but Lucian was back in his studio painting that evening.

He painted with an intense determination to get things right. Cautious in every statement he made, Lucian’s truthfulness was precise, always surprising, stimulating, deeply felt and thoughtful. He would fight firmly for every point he believed in and for what he asked from a work of art, never making any concession to help his painting. As a sitter you held the position of being passive, with Lucian continually encouraging you. He made you feel that you were understood by him. He could not be shocked by any confession or by anything said. He was immensely interested in other people. There was always a sense of balance around Lucian.

Micro grids poised to take offUpdated: October 25, 2014 00:20 IST
Micro grids poised to take off

Micro grid as a concept may be young, but it holds the key to lighting and digitally connecting millions of lives. Picture shows the 66/11-KV Grid sub-station constructed at the Commonwealth Games Village, in New Delhi. File photo: Rajeev Bhatt
TOPICS
electricity production and distribution
The Centre’s plans to supply electricity 24/7 to all parts of India in five years has opened up vast opportunities for power and automation companies such as ABB, GE, Schneider Electric and few others. These companies have expertise in setting up micro grids that have emerged as a practical solution to provide electricity to off-grid and inaccessible areas.
The opportunity is so huge that ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer at a recently held global analysts’ conference mentioned about India, the only country he named in his two-hour presentation, as an attractive market where the company can play a larger role as a micro grid solution provider. He said sill thousands of villages across the country remained without power and micro grid was the answer to this problem.
Globally, ABB has designed and delivered solutions for more than 80 micro grids, for a wide range of applications including one at Kodiak Island in Alaska, the second largest island in the United States, which operates a micro grid that generates 28 MW of electricity from hydropower and wind for a population of 15,000. The same could be implemented in India to provide power in remote areas in a time bound manner, experts said.
The notation of micro grids came from the availability of renewable power and due to demand of electricity from remote areas. These are grid-independent self-sufficient grids in remote areas where one uses diesel together with renewable energy to generate power for a targeted population.
Typically, a micro grid of 2-3 MW capacity could cater to 5,000 households, experts said, adding that a micro grid comprised power generation system, energy storage facility and the load management system.
A micro grid can cater to a cluster of 2-3 households (10 kilowatts) to up 10 MW, which can feed power to 25,000 households.
“When we look at India you can have several benefits. You actually get power in remote areas and secondly you increase the availability of power through micro grids.
“Nano grids, which comprises a water pump and solar panels, are already up and running in India but micro grids will come up soon. We are pretty confident about the Indian government’s vision to provide power to all,” said an expert.
Micro grid as a concept may be young, but it holds the key to lighting and digitally connecting millions of lives.

It s Not IQ Versus Emotional Intelligencereddit
The CEO of one of the world's largest financial companies told me, "I hire the best and brightest -- but I still get a Bell Curve for performance." Why aren't the smartest MBAs from top schools all highly successful on the job?
The answer lies in the interplay between IQ and emotional intelligence -- and explains why you need both for high performance.
More than a century of research shows IQ is the best predictor of the job you can get and hold. It takes a high ability level in handling cognitive complexity to be in a profession like medicine, a C-suite executive, or a professor at a prestigious business school.
Then why the dismay of that CEO?
The more your success on the job depends on relating to people -- whether in sales, as a team member, or as a leader -- the more emotional intelligence matters. A high-enough IQ is necessary, but not enough, to be a star performer.
Just as is true for IQ, there are many models of emotional intelligence . In mine there are two main parts: self-mastery and social intelligence. The purely cognitive jobs require self-mastery -- e.g., cognitive control, the ability to focus on the task at hand and ignore distractions.
But the second half of emotional intelligence, social adeptness, holds the key to that CEO's question. As long as those super-smart MBAs are working by themselves, their IQ and self-mastery makes them high performers. But the minute they have to mesh on a team, meet clients, or lead, that skill set falls short. They also need social intelligence.
Claudio Fernandez-Aroaz , former head of research at Egon Zehnder International, spent decades hiring C-level executives for global companies. When he studied why some of those executives ended up being fired, he found that while they had been hired for their intelligence and business expertise -- they were fired for a lack of emotional intelligence . Though they were smart, they were bullies or otherwise inept at people management.
Along the same lines, my colleague Richard Boyatzis , professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western University, has found that the vast majority of leadership competencies that predict the performance of sales leaders are based on emotional and social intelligence -- not cognitive intelligence (like IQ).
Then there's a brand new meta-analysis of 132 different research studies involving more than 27,000 people, which I heard reported on by a co-author, Ronald Humphreys, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. That yet-to-be published analysis concluded emotionally intelligent leaders have the most satisfied employees -- if you like your boss, you're more likely to like your job ( just contemplate the opposite, morbid reality ).
And reviewing all peer-reviewed research to date, the same study says emotional intelligence has been found to boost:

Raising a glass to the business of wineStudents raise a glass to the business of wine

The wine industry is becoming increasingly complex
A glass of wine is a way to relax after a day’s studying for many MBA students. But at Sonoma State University, which has been building links between its campus, north of San Francisco, and the wineries of Napa Valley, the business of producing the fermented grape is a growing opportunity for executive training.
Sonoma is one of a handful of business schools around the world to offer specialist wine industry MBAs. Other programmes are run in France, Germany and Australia.

Technology brings choice to MBA students
Such has been the demand for these courses at Sonoma that the business school is to run a new executive MBA programme from its main campus and expand its wine industry research operation. The plan is to build upon Sonoma’s existing wine executive MBA programme, run in partnership with Napa Valley Vintners, creating places for an additional 100 students.
Sonoma is creating a wine institute building with classrooms that are designed for more flexible learning and video conferencing with experts around the world. It is looking to appoint a wine business chair and to fund more research into the changing shape of the global wine industry.
Demand for executive training is being driven by growth in wine production, especially in Asian markets, according to John Stayton, executive director of graduate programmes at Sonoma. “Over the last 20 years the wine industry has become increasingly global and increasingly complex,” he says.
China is the fastest growing market for wine consumption and the sixth largest wine producer, according to International Wine and Spirits Research. It estimated that 2.2bn bottles of wine were sold in China in 2013, making it the fifth-largest wine market by sales and the largest market for red wine.
Sonoma’s aim, says Mr Stayton, is “to become the global wine business programme”. Its existing wine MBA programme has attracted students from Chile, China and Argentina, Mr Stayton notes. They work with Kokomo Winery and Timber Crest Farms to learn how to market and sell wine. The hope is that the new programme will attract more students from outside the US.
Among those who have taken up the wine MBA programme at Sonoma is Christian Ahlmann, whose parents own the Six Sigma winery in California. Mr Ahlmann was keen to follow in his parents’ footsteps but his first instinct was not to get an MBA but a bachelors degree in agriculture. “I figured, it’s about learning to grow things. That was obviously a true assumption, but growing plants is only half of the game.”
While he mastered the production of the grape, he found himself woefully short on commercial knowledge. He resorted to ploughing through business books to communicate with his accountant and to understand best practices on human resources and marketing.
“Soon I realised that an MBA would give me a serious competitive advantage in the wine industry,” he says.
Sonoma’s focus on the wine industry is a big deal, Mr Ahlmann notes, because the market has some unique aspects. For example, wine producers only receive stock once a year, so it is no use if the sales team exceeds expectations because doing so will only mean a company runs out of inventory before the next vintage is ready.
“I got a real appreciation for the value of financial statements and how to interpret them,” adds Mr Ahlmann. “It was like being handed the rule book on a game and the MBA programme was able to decode it.”
After completing the financial statement class, Mr Ahlmann replaced his company’s accountancy firm.
“I found that I communicated much better with them,” [the new firm], he says. “We have become considerably more profitable since I learnt the value and application of numbers.”
A big selling point of Sonoma to Mr Ahlmann, apart from its relative proximity to his family’s winery, was the fact that it incorporates several instructors from nearby Silicon Valley. Although Mr Ahlmann’s family has been running Six Sigma’s 4,000-acre estate since 2000, he claims the business is still in “start-up” mode.
He also liked the way that the teaching staff used real-world examples. One professor, a consultant to Napa Valley wineries, presented the students with a handful of his own consulting jobs. The students then solved these case studies and presented their findings to the proprietors, with supervision from the professor.
“Another professor scratched out the names on an $800m acquisition his company was considering, presented the details to the class and led us through a lively debate evaluating the pros and cons of making the deal,” Mr Ahlmann recalls. “It doesn’t get more real than that.

Tharoor lauds PM again for bringing sanitation toforefrontPrint
Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:35 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 2:39 am
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appreciating the clean-up campaign he launched in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram a day ago. He also lauded Modi for catapulting the sanitation programme to the “forefront of the national consciousness.”
Tharoor was recently removed from the post of Congress spokesperson after the Kerala unit of the party sought action against him for his praise of Modi and his support to Swachh Bharat initiative.
Disregarding the opposition he faced, Tharoor launched the cleanliness drive at Vizhinjam coast on Saturday, which was promptly acknowledged by Modi who called Tharoor’s effort a “great effort” and tweeted that Tharoor’s “active participation in the Swachh Bharat mission is very encouraging”.
On Sunday, Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive. “Thank you narendramodi ji. Here’s a video of my clean-up & a request to you,” he tweeted. The request was for central assistance to clean up a polluted water body — Parvathy Puthanar — in Thiruvananthapuram. Tharoor, however, said that his action has no political significance.
“To my mind there is no political significance to this event. I didn’t see it as a political activity. But rather to me it was part of a national mission. After all, it was Mahatma Gandhi who declared before Independence that sanitation was more important than Independence… The first Congress government of India led by Jawaharlal Nehru gave the nation its first rural sanitation programme.
The NDA under (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee turned it into a total sanitation programme. The UPA government under Manmohan Singh expanded and enlarged this progamme. And I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has continued the UPA’s good work by re-baptising it as Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and raising it to the forefront of the national consciousness,” Tharoor said in his video message.
His Twitter bonhomie with Modi has once again raised the hackles of his partymen.
Senior Congress leader from Kerala K Muraleedharan said: “It could be because of his (Tharoor’s) political immaturity. He could have done all this before Modi’s announcement. He ceased to be a minister four five months ago. He could have led the cleanliness drive immediately after that. He could have done it when the Kerala government launched the clean Kerala mission.”

India set to install cameras along border withChinaPrint
Written by Vijaita Singh | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:32 am
India is set to install high resolution surveillance cameras along the “unmanned pockets” on its border with China in a bid to to guard its territory better. This comes in the wake of a recent face-off with the Chinese Army. The cameras will be put up at 50 locations along the border with China in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh.
A senior official said the cameras would provide live-feed in a range of 20-25 km, and plans are afoot to live stream the footage at the Delhi headquarters. “We recently did a trial run of these surveillance cameras at Thakung (in Ladakh). It was successful and it provided us video footage of a wide area,” said Subhash Goswami, DG, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). He also said the ITBP had approached the Ministry of Home Affairs for approval to set up 54 more border outposts in Arunachal Pradesh.
The DG said that incursions by China into Ladakh during President Xi Jinping’s visit were “uncommon” as they had gone on for a fortnight. “It was uncommon as normally such incidents do not last for more than 10-15 minutes. When they come, we show them a banner telling them that the territory is India’s and ask them to go back. They normally do. But this time the incident lasted for long,” Goswami said.
“The incidents in the past occurred due to the difference in the perception regarding the border,” he said. He added that lack of infrastructure and surveillance equipment were “challenges” they faced regularly in the areas.

Rift in Apna DalwidensPrint
Written by Hamza Khan | Lucknow | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:32 am | Updated: October 29, 2014 1:45 pm
The rift in Apna Dal created due to a family feud seems to have widened with Anupriya Patel, one of the two party MPs, deciding to skip the party’s upcoming foundation day celebrations in Varanasi on November 4. Anupriya will, instead, attend a separate programme in Allahabad to mark the occasion.
The simmering rift in the party had surfaced earlier this month when Mirzapur MP Anupriya had called a press conference in Lucknow and had questioned her mother and party’s national president Krishna Patel’s decision to elevate her elder sister Pallavi Patel as party vice-president. She had termed the decision as “illegal and arbitrary”.
Krishna, however, has said Pallavi remains the party vice-president. “Yes she is the party vice-president and will remain so,” said Krishna, who is overseeing preparations in Varanasi. “Pallavi, national general secretary Seth Jagdish, national treasurer Kailash and other senior party functionaries will be present in Varanasi rally where we are aiming to bring at least 50,000 supporters,” Krishna said. On Anupriya’s participation in Varanasi rally, Krishna said “she hasn’t confirmed her presence”.
Anupriya, meanwhile, confirmed to The Indian Express that she will be participating in the programme at Allahabad and will not be attending the one in Varanasi.
“I have been visiting Varanasi but haven’t visited Allahabad for some time, which is a significant place for the party. So I have chosen to attend the programme there,” she said.
“The programme will be organised at Allahabad’s K P Community Centre on November 4 and Anupriya will be present there as the chief guest,” said Jawahar Lal Patel, who is one of the two claimants to the post of party’s Allahabad district president.
Party’s state general secretary Asharam Verma, national general secretaries Neel Ratan Patel, Rajendra Pal, national committee members Chandra Pratap, Awadh Naresh Verma, Dharm Raj Patel and others will also attend the Allahabad programme. Party state president and Vishwanathganj MLA R K Verma too said he has chosen Allahabad over Varanasi.
However, Phoolchand Patel, the other claimant to the post, said that “Krishna Patel has called a rally in Varanasi and has asked the district units to be there, so we are preparing to take several buses of supporters there”.
Founded in 1995 by Anupriya’s father Sone Lal Patel, Apna Dal rose to prominence in recent parliamentary elections by allying with the BJP and winning its first two parliamentary seats Mirzapur and Pratapgarh. After Sone Lal’s death in 2009, Krishna was made national president of the party, while his younger daughter Anupriya was made national general secretary. She had won 2012 assembly election from Rohaniya seat in Varanasi, which she vacated this year after getting elected to Lok Sabha. Her mother unsuccessfully contested the Rohaniya assembly bypolls.

Letters that tell story of Bapu and Miras troubledrelationshipPrint
Written by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:29 am
January 24, 1929, Muzaffarpur: Beloved Bapu — And now today I have your long Monday letter! How spoiled I am!!
October 27, 1928, Sevashram, Benares: But after all, my beloved Bapu knows everything that is in my head — he knows even better then I know myself!
April 7, 1933, Sabarmati Central Prison, Ahmedabad: “I hear you have got a telescope now-a-days! I once looked at the stars and planets through a very small one of my uncle’s & even that was a wonderful sight. Every night as I look at the starts I think how you, too, must be looking at them from Yervada — and I feel, in my mind’s fancy as if I saw you in the reflection of their light.”
These are excerpts from ‘Beloved Bapu: The Gandhi-Mirabehn Correspondence’, a book by Tridip Suhrud and Thomas Weber that claims to bring out for the first time letters between Gandhi and Madeline Slade or Mira, the daughter of a British admiral who became the Mahatma’s disciple.
The book, on this companionship of 23 years, says on the flap, “Mira and Gandhi shared a connection that was as close and loving as it was troubled. She was a woman of tremendous industry and drive, a quality that Gandhi grasped and admired greatly. However, he was also deeply ambivalent about the obsessive nature of her love — indeed, her infatuation — chastising her sharply for her “idolatry” on the one hand, and apologising for his harshness and keeping her close on the other.”
Suhrud is director, Sabarmati Memorial Trust and a Sahitya Akademi winner who is known as a new age “authority” on Gandhian studies. Weber is an Australia-based author who teaches political science and has written several books on Gandhi.
The letters from Gandhi published in the book are already in public domain while those from Mira are being revealed for the first time; they are under the custody of Sabarmati Ashram.
Most of the letters are a mundane detailing of their daily life — from their trips to a number of places and even the problems that this causes to their diet, some inducing constipation — and yet the book reveals some intimate moments, especially the “unfulfilled” wish of Mira who had longed for a “life in the Himalaya with her dearest Bapu”.
In one letter, Gandhi tells Mira that he prefers to write “love letters” on Mondays, which Mira awaits impatiently.
There are even some Hindi lessons for Mira. “The negative participle should always go with the verb, when the verb is to be negative and when the subject has to be qualified by a long phrase, the qualifying phrase should precede the subject,” Gandhi writes from Bangalore on July 17, 1927.
In a chapter in the book titled, “A Catch-22 relationship” the editors note: “Some may argue that there could have been some element of latent or repressed sexuality involved. Certainly some of his letters to Mira do sound like love letters as hers to him undoubtedly were.”
The letters of Mira are more revealing than continued…

One Man s Weakness Is Another Man s Strengthreddit
If we ask the people closest to us to name our unique qualities, we may or may not be surprised by what they say. The reason they adore us may be the very same reason others criticize us. What one person defines strength, another defines weakness.
No one loves to admit weakness. That's because we've been conditioned to view strengths at one end of the spectrum and weaknesses at the other. One positive and one negative. One an area of excellence, and the other, an area of improvement. When did these become polar opposites?
We're taught to isolate our weaknesses and associate them with failure; we believe that unless we change, this failure is inevitable. So we conform and part with our authentic self, only to meet disappointment.
Do these examples sound familiar? The kid that couldn't sit still and disrupted class becomes a successful entrepreneur. The socially awkward loner, who annoyingly sets the exam curve, becomes a world-class scientist.
These people are the lucky ones. Instead of downplay a quality to "fit in," they embrace it. However, many of us choose the path to conformity. It is easier, more accepting, and unfortunately, less rewarding.
It's natural to label people a certain way in a certain situation, but weaknesses and strengths are words we use to disguise arbitrary borders we set. We take these labels too literally. To do so is both ignorant and one-dimensional. Thankfully, our world is multi-dimensional, and so are we.
The moment we shift our view, we realize that our biggest "weakness" has the greatest potential to become our defining strength.
Many of us are asked this popular behavioral question during an interview: what is your greatest weakness? We take said "weakness," flip it upside-down, and highlight it as a vital benefit for the team and the company. If we actually applied this mentality to our everyday life, we'd begin to see our lives play out differently.
Sometimes we need to take a step back and ask ourselves are we unrealistic or imaginative? Lazy or uninspired? Confrontational or vocal? We all share the same collection of traits; we just call them different things.
Weaknesses are both subjective and situational. Under the right circumstances, our abilities are close to limitless. The question becomes not how to change ourselves, but rather where we can thrive.
Once we answer this question, it's like a domino effect. One success after another begins to practically fall in our laps; this is the moment we learn to effectively harness our natural abilities in the right situations.
Whether we apply this concept to our personal or professional lives, it's a powerful one. Do you have a shortcoming or an opportunity? It's up to you.

A news report  a murder  a cops arrest: Keralas gripping crimestoryPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Kollam | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:49 am
It started with a news report that targeted a few police officers, took a nasty turn with an assault on the journalist who wrote it, hit the headlines with the murder of a gangster, and continues to make news with the recent arrest of a DySP who was once a former UN peacekeeper in Kosovo.
In news-hungry Kerala, this is one crime story that simply won’t get over.
The sequence of events triggered by a report published in a leading Malayalam newspaper in 2009 about an alleged party thrown by a liquor contractor and attended by police officers has also exposed the nexus between law enforcement officers and criminal elements in the state.
Today, the case is being probed by the CBI which has arrested two officers. And in a final twist, investigators now believe the original report that triggered it all may have been a false one.
The latest arrest was that of DySP S Santhosh Nair, on charges of conspiring to kill gang leader “Happy” Rajesh, who allegedly led the attack on V B Unnithan, the journalist.
Based on interviews with police and CBI officials involved in investigating the case, here are the primary facts:
October 13, 2009: The Kollam edition of Mathrubhumi publishes a report filed by Unnithan which alleges that a few police officers, including Nair, attended a party hosted by a liquor contractor at a government guesthouse the night before. The report alleges that the party, also attended by a few TV actors, witnessed “immoral activity” by guests. The report led to a probe by state police following which Nair, then a circle inspector, was shunted out of Kollam for a few months.
December 2010: Mathrubhumi publishes another report by Unnithan, alleging that another DySP N Abdul Rasheed, then the president of the Kerala Police Officers Association, had pulled the emergency chain of the Rajdhani Express in which he was travelling back from Goa so that he could alight at Kollam where the train did not have a stop. The report alleges that Rasheed was travelling with his family, his friend DySP Nair and family, and their common businessman friend S Santhosh Kumar alias Container Santhosh.
April 16, 2011: Unnithan is attacked in Kollam while returning from work. The attackers break Unnithan’s legs, hands and a few ribs. They abuse Unnithan for filing a “wrong report” about the assets of a UDF candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections.
April 27, 2011: Rajesh, the leader of a criminal gang, is found murdered inside his autorickshaw.
The thread connecting these incidents is being probed by CBI in the form of three investigations: the attack on Babu Kumar, the assault on Unnithan, and the murder of Rajesh. The CBI was called in to investigate these cases by the Kerala High Court following two separate pleas, by Kumar and Rajesh’s wife Bindu.
The latest headline was created by the arrest of Nair, 46, who is under suspension, having already been arrested by Kerala police in connection with the attack on Unnithan. CBI had earlier arrested Rasheed, who was in fact continued…

Membership drive exposes friction in ChhattisgarhCongressPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:37 am
Power tussles among Chhattisgarh Congress leaders has again come out in the open, thanks to the state unit’s membership drive. The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) is set to hold elections to its various posts, including those of president and general secretary, next year. So, senior leaders are looking to rope in new members under their wing so that they can influence the selection of the new PCC leadership.
Leading the pack is former chief minister Ajit Jogi, who has asked the PCC to provide him as many as 20,000 booklets of membership forms, each booklet containing 25 forms. The present PCC, led by state party chief Bhupesh Baghel has refused to give him the booklets, causing an open confrontation.
During the last Congress membership drive in Chhattisgarh a few years ago, the party had only enlisted 3.95 lakh members. Jogi, who has been sidelined by the party over the years, now seeks to make as many as 5 lakh members on his own and capture the PCC next year. Also, taking a cue from Jogi, other leaders like Mohammad Akbar have also asked for a huge number of booklets.
The PCC has pointed out that Jogi’s demand is untenable as according to the party constitution, a leader can be given a maximum of 100 booklets or 2,500 forms. A leader can be given more forms only when he has submitted details of the booklets he had earlier obtained from the party.
Jogi, PCC claims, obtained just 150 booklets during the previous drive but has not submitted any detail of the members he roped in. “It is a crisis related to the party’s constitution. I will approach the high command and seek their guidelines” Baghel said.
Jogi, on his part, said he had submitted all details of the previous memberships and the refusal to give him booklets violated his rights as a Congress member.

Health Ministry wants oxytocin details after ManekaletterPrint
Written by Abantika Ghosh | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:17 am
Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has taken up the issue of the use of oxytocin on cows to increase milk production. In her communication to Health Secretary Lov Verma, Maneka, who has worked as an animal rights activist for many years now, has written about how the illegal practice has caused loss of livestock in the country and continues unabated despite several government measures to stop it.
Reacting to Maneka’s concerns, the Health Ministry, through the director general (health services), has asked state drug controllers for details of the manufacturers of oxytocin along with detailed information about the seizures conducted for the illegally produced hormone, the number of persons arrested in connection with these seizures, prosecutions filed and reports, if any, of sub standard quality seized. State governments are required to furnish the information within the next 30 days.
In his letter to the state drug controllers last week, Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh wrote: “Not only does this drug make cows barren sooner, but also lowers the life span of the animal, thus causing economic loss to the owner in the long run. It is being widely used in the dairy industry despite there being a ban on its sale.”
The Health Ministry has also formed an inter-ministerial committee to look into the issue of oxytocin misuse.

UP govt scraps one moreschemePrint
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:14 am
The Akhilesh Yadav government in UP has scrapped a highly successful scheme under which financial assistance was provided to those belonging to backward classes during illness and also for marriage of girls.
This is yet another in the line of popular schemes like unemployment allowance, Kanya Vidya Dhan and free laptop that have been scrapped for several reasons, including funds crunch.
Under the scheme that has been scrapped, the state government was giving a financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to the girls belonging to poor backward classes and an assistance of Rs 5,000 to backward class people suffering from illness. The amount was not high but the scheme was successful with applicants numbering at least 10 times the target in every district.
“It is true that budget has been curtailed for the scheme and it has been deferred. The reason may be that there are several similar schemes being implemented by the state government which are covering a larger section of society,” said Ambika Choudhary, Minister for Backward Class Welfare.
He claimed that a large number of people are being covered under Samajwadi Pension Scheme.
Choudhary had, however, no answer for the state government not allotting funds to the scheme, which led to its closure. “Now it is the reality,” he said. The move to scrap the scheme assumes significance as the beneficiaries were poor people from Backward classes who are considered traditional voters of the SP.
Choudhary defended the move. “The amount (Rs 5,000) given for illness is of no consequence when we are providing free treatment for serious ailments. For the marriages, an amount of Rs 10,000 was fixed but we could not reach out to a larger section of the people,” he claimed.

Yechury waves a red flag over partyresolutionCPI(M) leaders at the party office in New Delhi on Sunday. (Express photo by Amit Mehra)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:14 am
The CPI(M)’s bid to change tactics to meet present day political challenges has brought out divisions within the party, with senior leader Sitaram Yechury opposing the stand taken by the Politburo and, by extension, general secretary Prakash Karat. The CPI(M) central committee, during a four-day brainstorming session which started on Sunday, was attempting to revise its political-tactical line, adopted at the party’s Jalandhar Congress in 1978.
During the session, Yechury moved an “alternative document” to the draft review report finalised by the Politburo. He is learnt to have repudiated the conclusions made in the draft report, presented by Karat.
Yechury’s five-page document, circulated among members of the central committee, is learnt to have questioned the Politburo’s opinion that the political-tactical line adopted in 1978 had many shortcomings, which hampered its expansion outside Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, and its consolidation in the three states. This comes in the wake of a drubbing received by the party in the Lok Sabha elections.
One of the key directives of the Jalandhar Congress, held in the aftermath of the Emergency, was to forge the unity of Left and democratic forces to defeat the Congress. The party applied the “united front tactics” with what it called “various bourgeois-landlord parties” in several states and at the national level over the years fairly successfully.
The draft finalised by the Politburo is learnt to have concluded that the effort to mobilise the regional parties into a third front has proved to be unrealistic and erroneous.
Yechury, on the other hand, believes that there is nothing wrong with the 1978 line and argues that it failed because of shortcomings and “subjectivism” in implementation in the last decade. He further argues that this, along with organisational weaknesses, is to blame for the electoral setbacks.
Yechury’s repudiation of the official draft is the latest incident in the tug of war between him and Karat. His stress on shortcomings in implementation in the last decade is significant, given that Karat succeeded Harkishan Singh Surjeet as general secretary in 2005. Karat’s stint at the CPM’s helm comes to an end next year and the latest tiff comes in the backdrop of a succession war.
Sources said that Yechury had conveyed his point of view in the Politburo meeting held on October 13 and 14, but the Karat camp had the upper hand, because of which the draft was accepted for consideration by the central committee. Yechury, however, did not relent and moved his objections in the form of a note.
What complicated the exercise is the decision of another Politburo member, B V Raghavulu, to place his “views” in the form of a separate note. It is rare for Politburo members to present such notes before the central committee after the Politburo reaches a conclusion on an issue.

Govt plans first corporate takeoverpost-SatyamJignesh Shah FTIL promoter
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:10 am
The government is considering a proposal to supersede the management of Jignesh Shah-promoted Financial Technologies (India) Ltd, a company that develops software for stock and commodity exchanges. If undertaken, this would be the second such takeover forced by the government in recent corporate history after Satyam Computer Services Ltd in January 2009.
Jignesh Shah and FTIL are currently being investigated by the Mumbai Police Economic Offences Wing for their role in the Rs 5,600-odd crore default by FTIL’s subsidiary National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).
According to the proposal, post-management takeover, the company may be handed over to financial institutions during a transition phase when the government can consider bringing in new promoters. Jignesh Shah owns/ controls 45.63 per cent in FTIL as on June 30, 2014.
The management takeover has been proposed by commodities market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry too has favoured the proposal and has observed that NSEL was effectively controlled by the key managerial persons of FTIL, and was fully in the know of NSEL affairs.
The NSEL merger with FTIL proposed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs last week, if followed by a management takeover, would dramatically expedite the recovery process, said government sources. In the last year or so, NSEL has been able to honour payments of only Rs 362.43 crore as against dues of Rs 5,689.95 crore involving around 13,000 investors.
According to sources, the proposed management takeover can be seen as Part II of the government’s plan to clear the mess NSEL landed itself in in August 2013. Part I of the plan was given effect through the Corporate Affairs Ministry’s draft order on October 21, 2014 that proposed merging NSEL with FTIL in public interest. “Ideally, FTIL should have been superseded first. NSEL merger with FTIL should have been the second step,” said a government source.
While FTIL’s minority investors argue about limited liability of the company in challenging the government’s merger order — which effectively requires FTIL to take on NSEL’s liabilities — sources in the government said this was a case of lifting the corporate veil. “Last August itself, FTIL paid up about Rs 177 crore towards meeting NSEL’s payment obligation. NSEL is held almost entirely (99.9 per cent) by FTIL. FTIL has all along been in the know of NSEL activities,” the source said.
In September 2013, a committee under then Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram submitted a report to the government recommending a management takeover of all three exchanges floated by FTIL — MCX, MCX-SX and NSEL. No action was, however, taken on this report.
Later, in an order dated December 17, 2013, FMC declared FTIL and Jignesh Shah among others as “not fit and proper” to be shareholder/ director in the management or board of any exchange. It also pointed out that NSEL cannot be said to be independent since 99.9998 per cent of its continued…

Modi message to NDA MPs: Take ownership of our keyschemesPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Written by Liz Mathew | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:59 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 10:54 am
Amid the continuing suspense over the contours of a BJP alliance in Maharashtra, the spotlight was on the Shiv Sena MPs. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi shifted it away, choosing to focus on his government’s welfare schemes, at his Diwali Milan for NDA MPs on Sunday
“Let’s think big. Let’s think far. Let’s think above politics,” Modi told the gathering at the high tea hosted at his official residence at 7 RCR — his first such meeting with the coalition MPs after taking over as PM. Like the Diwali Milan with the media hosted by BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday, it was Modi’s show once again. The event, which was initially planned only for BJP MPs but later included all NDA MPs, was the PM’s idea — a bid to keep MPs in the loop about the government’s initiatives.
The message was clear: each MP belonging to the ruling coalition should be deeply involved in the implementation of around 64 welfare programmes of the government and ensure that the benefits, as well as the political message, filter down to every village
“The schemes should reach the grassroot level in a more planned manner so that they have some impact on the lives of the people. The implementation should be more focussed and organised,” said a source. “The PM is of the view that MPs’ taking direct initiatives and their involvement in every programme will check corruption also,” he added.
The MPs were also asked to give special attention to skill development programmes. Modi also asserted that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan would be the flagship programmes of the BJP-led government.
“There was an elaborate discussion on many issues which the government has brought to the nation. We had an address by the Prime Minister who talked about cleanliness, various issues before the government, how a common MP can change things in this country, how a common MP can be a symbol of positive political entity and how the respectability of politicians can be enhanced in the country,” BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters after the meeting.
While Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed the gathering on the Jan Dhan scheme, coal, gas pricing and diesel deregulation, Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari spoke about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and Labour Minister Narendra Singh Tomar briefed them on various initiatives under the Shramev Jayate Karyakram.
Pointing out that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan had received tremendous response from all sections of society, Modi urged the MPs to use it to “connect” with people in their respective areas. He asked them to visit schools in their areas over a five-day period beginning November 14, the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, to explain the importance of hygiene. “This will send a positive message,” he said.
Echoing the same message, BJP chief Amit Shah also urged the MPs to “go and explain to the people” continued…

Endless vigil: Uncertainty engenders insecurity, and it's getting worse - Reuters
That’s the only way to contain the terrorist games escalating on Pakistan’s borders with Iran, Afghanistan and India
October 24, 2014:  
Just over a year ago, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was swept back to power, prompting expectations that he would tackle Pakistan’s security and economic crises, and improve relations with India. But, one year is an eternity in the politics of Pakistan! The US is refusing to pledge additional aid beyond what was promised earlier under the Kerry-Lugar Legislation. Even all-weather friend China has expressed disappointment that Sharif’s government has not done the requisite preparatory work for utilising the aid that Beijing had promised for the development of Pakistan’s ailing power sector. The only silver lining has been increased remittances from Pakistan’s workers in the Gulf, despite calls by Imran Khan for workers to halt such inward remittances.
Instead of acting circumspectly in such a situation, Pakistan has chosen to escalate tensions on its borders with Iran, Afghanistan and India. The tensions have arisen because of support to cross-border terrorism resulting from state agencies backing extremist Sunni groups, ranging from the Lashkar-e-taiba to the Afghan Taliban and the Jaish-e-Adl.
On the Iran front
Tensions with Iran escalated last year, when the Jaish-e-Adl mounted cross-border ground and missile attacks in Iran, resulting in Iranian casualties. This prompted an Iranian spokesman to warn that Iranian forces would enter Pakistani territory if the latter “failed to act against terrorist groups operating on its soil”.
More or less coinciding with this, the Jaish-e-Adl kidnapped five Iranian border guards and moved them into Pakistan. Iran not only warned Pakistan of cross-border retaliation, but also brought to the notice of the UN Security Council, in writing, the repeated incursions from Pakistani soil. Ever since the pro-Saudi Nawaz Sharif, whose links with radical Sunni extremist groups is well documented, assumed power, Pakistan has moved towards rendering unstinted support to Saudi Arabia, even in the Syrian civil war. It has also unilaterally annulled the Pakistan-Iran oil pipeline project, prompting Iran to seek compensation.
The Afghan story
While Sharif was commencing negotiations for a peace deal with the Tehriq-e-Taliban in the tribal areas of North Waziristan bordering Afghanistan, army chief General Raheel Sharif launched a massive military operation, involving over 50,000 military and paramilitary personnel, backed by artillery, tanks, helicopter gunships and fighter jets. An estimated one million Pashtun tribesmen have fled from their homes. They are now homeless and facing barriers preventing their entry to the neighbouring provinces of Punjab and Sind. Not surprisingly, ISI ‘assets’ like the Mullah Omar-led Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network have been quietly moved out from the battle zone, quite obviously into ISI safe houses.
Unrest is brewing amidst the displaced Pashtun tribals, as the army is unable to coordinate its operations with civilian relief agencies. One can expect that the displaced and homeless Pashtun tribals will, in due course, resort to terrorist violence across Pakistan.
The special treatment meted out to ISI assets like Mullah Omar and the Haqqani Network would have been carefully noted by the new Ashraf Ghani dispensation in Afghanistan, as a prelude to more serious attacks by the Afghan Taliban acting out of ISI and army protected safe havens in Pakistan. Pakistan’s western borders are not going to be areas of peace and stability in coming years. Unfortunately for both Nawaz Sharif and Raheel Sharif, the escalating tensions with Iran, the partisan stance on Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalries and the military action in North Waziristan have invited criticism within Pakistan.
The India bogey
The promotion and escalation of tensions with India across the Line of Control and the international border have to be seen in this context. What better way for the army to divert attention from its misadventures in the west, than to revive the ‘India bogey’ in Pakistan? Such an action would also test the resolve of the Narendra Modi dispensation in India to deal with cross-border terrorism.
Moreover, with Assembly elections due in J&K in December, the Pakistan army would strive to ensure that the credibility of these elections is questioned by ensuring a low turnout. Hurriyat leaders such as Shabir Shah and Yasin Malik had already been commissioned to stir up discontent and discredit the Indian army, during the floods. Three successive and successful Assembly elections in the State would erode the credibility of Pakistan’s propaganda.
What Pakistan had not bargained for, as it attempted to test India’s resolve from August onwards, was the robust response it received not only from the Indian army, but also from the paramilitary Border Security Force. This was accompanied by an ill-advised diplomatic effort to seek UN intervention in J&K. Both Sharif and his otherwise realistic national security advisor, Sartaj Aziz, seem to forget that the world changed dramatically after 9/11.
The western world led by the US has come to realise that Pakistan-backed terrorist groups are as much a threat to their security as to that of India.
Pakistan also seemed to ignore Modi’s unambiguous stance that dialogue and terrorism cannot go hand in hand, signalling that there would be no repetition of the diplomatic ineptness that India manifested in Sharm-el-Sheikh. Pakistan also seems to have misread the significance of the Obama-Modi Joint Declaration averring action for “dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for terrorist and criminal networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis”.
Pakistan’s military adventurism on three fronts across its borders with India, Afghanistan and Iran has created just the right environment to turn the heat on Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Apart from mounting a media offensive across print, electronic and social networks, it is time for India to get world attention focused on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and the plight of Baluchis, Shias and other minorities in that country.
In any case, there should be no question of a sustained dialogue process till Pakistan fulfils its January 2004 assurance that territory under its control will not be used for terrorism against India.

10 best jobs you can get without a college degree10 best jobs you can get without a college degree

Compensation and Benefits High Schools
A bachelor's degree is often thought to be the key to financial success. After all, while the median salary of high school graduates 25 years and older is $29,766 a year, the typical college grad with a BA makes $50,281. Unfortunately, many young people have to dig themselves deep into debt for a shot at those future returns. Among the 70% of 2012 college grads who took out student loans, the average amount borrowed was $29,400.
Here are 10 thriving careers you can pursue without a college education. The occupations we identified promise generous salaries and long-term job security, based on 10-year employment projections. None of the jobs require a college degree, though some call for a post-secondary nondegree award, typically earned from a trade school or vocational training program. As a bonus, many of the jobs boast below-average stress levels.
Take a look at the 10 best jobs you can get without a college degree.
Data on number of workers, employment projections, education requirements and income comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment-growth projections cover the 10-year period between 2012 and 2022. Salary ranges reflect annual pay for workers from the 25th to the 75th percentiles, which weeds out the lowest and highest earners. Job stress is also based on BLS data, analyzed by career information expert Laurence Shatkin. Overall stress scores range from 0 (no stress) to 100 (most stress).
Dental assistant
Total number of U.S. workers: 309,540
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.5% (All occupations: 10.8%)
Annual salary range: $28,820 to $41,980 (All occupations: $22,670 to $56,860)
Stress score: 49.0 (All occupations: 53.1)
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award

Smiles all around for jobs in dentistry. With studies showing the close relationship between oral health and general health, people are taking better care of their pearly whites and providing more business for those working in the industry. Aging boomers are also adding to the high demand for professional dental care. To meet those growing needs, the number of dentists, dental hygienists (among our best jobs for the future ) and dental assistants is expected to increase rapidly--making the field a good bet in terms of job security.
The quickest way into the specialty is to become an assistant, which doesn't require a professional degree (required to be a dentist) or an associate's degree (required for hygienists). Some states require dental assistants, who perform routine tasks such as updating patient records and sterilizing equipment, to pass an exam and get certified, which can take a year through programs offered by community colleges; otherwise, you can get to work straight out of high school. (Check your state's requirements at http://www.danb.org .) Even if it's not necessary, you might consider going for that certification. According to the Dental Assisting National Board, dental assistants who are certified earn about $2 more per hour than those who are not.
Health information technician
Total number of U.S. workers: 180,760
Projected 10-year growth rate: 22.1%
Annual salary range: $27,520 to $45,260
Stress score: 42.9
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award
Thanks in large part to the aging population, health care is America's fastest-growing industry--and all those medical charts aren't going to track themselves. Health information technicians manage medical records, including patients' symptoms, diagnoses and insurance claims, ensuring their accuracy, completeness and security. As the shift from print to electronic recordkeeping increases, the demand for people with these specialized organizational skills grows, too.
Most employers would prefer to hire a technician with a professional certification, which you can obtain through several programs. For example, you can be certified as a Registered Health Information Administrator through the American Health Information Management Association and a Certified Medical Coding Specialist with the Professional Association of Healthcare Coding Specialists . Throughout your career, you'll need to regularly renew your certifications. If you later want to advance in this field and go for a bachelor's degree, you can become a health services manager--a job with an annual salary range of $70,960 to $117,740.
Elevator installer
Total number of U.S. workers: 21,270
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.6%
Annual salary range: $62,060 to $91,240
Stress score: 59.0
Typical education requirement: High school diploma or equivalent
Going up? Job prospects for elevator installers and repairers certainly are. Construction of new office buildings, stores and other nonresidential projects has gradually risen as the economy has improved and lifted demand for elevators and the people who work on them. The aging population may also add to the need for stair lifts and elevators in both homes and nonresidential buildings.
Despite the rapid growth, the total number of workers remains small--the lowest on this list. People may be deterred by the job's level of danger and physical demands, as well as its high-stress nature. But the happy few who brave this work enjoy the highest median pay on this list: $78,640 a year. If you want to join their ranks, you can start learning the trade right after high school through a five-year paid apprenticeship, offered by unions and individual contractors. You may also need to be licensed, depending on your state.
Massage Therapist
Total number of U.S. workers: 79,040
Projected 10-year growth rate: 22.6%
Annual salary range: $24,380 to $51,820
Stress score: 37.8
Typical education requirement: Post-secondary nondegree award
Massage therapists can relax knowing that they are in high demand. Baby boomers coping with more aches and pains as they age will increasingly need their services. Plus, with massage-clinic chains proliferating and making the practice more affordable, even younger folks will be able to indulge themselves for greater relaxation.
An added perk: Massage therapists, of course, know how to keep calm. They boast the lowest stress score of all the jobs on this list, well below the 53.1 average for all workers. Part of their chill existence--besides the constant exposure to incense and soothing sounds--may be due to being boss-free, with a whopping 46% reporting as self-employed. To become a massage therapist, you'll likely need to complete a postsecondary education program requiring at least 500 hours of classroom study and hands-on practice. You may also need a license or certification, depending on your state's regulations.
Carpenter
Total number of U.S. workers: 580,570
Projected 10-year growth rate: 24.2%
Annual salary range: $31,550 to $55,340
Stress score: 52.1
Typical education requirement: High school diploma or equivalent
A whole lot of people have already figured out that they can build a solid career, without a college degree, in carpentry. This field sports the highest number of workers on this list and--due in large part to the country's population growth and the need for new-home construction --expects another 218,000 people to be needed over the next several years. In particular, entrepreneurial types tend to flock to this occupation; 36.1% of carpenters are self-employed, compared with just 6.5% of all U.S. workers.
Most carpenters get their starts in three- or four-year paid apprenticeships, which you can find through unions and contractor associations, such as the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and the Home Builders Institute . The same groups may offer special programs for veterans, as well as additional training opportunities that may help you advance in the field.
Electrician
Total number of U.S. workers: 542,680
Projected 10-year growth rate: 19.7%
Annual salary range: $38,020 to $66,360
Stress score: 55.0
Typical education requirement: High school diploma or equivalent
No shock here; electricians are looking at a bright future. Again, an increasing number of construction projects is driving demand for these professionals. The already large job pool, with the second-highest number of workers on this list, is expected to expand by about 115,000 people in the next few years.

From icy heights of Siachen  Modi wishes happy DiwaliSrinagar: Wrapped in thick woollens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew to the icy heights of Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir Thursday where he lauded the armed forces and promised a national memorial for Indian soldiers.

The Siachen halt marked the start of a visit on Diwali day to the state where he later met victims of the recent floods - the most destructive in 50 years - at the Raj Bhavan, an event boycotted by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
"I am fortunate that as a servant of the nation, I got to see in what circumstances the soldiers have to live here," Modi said, addressing troops in Hindi in freezing temperature at the world's highest battlefield.
Dressed in battle fatigue woollen jackets, a red scarf and goggles to protect the eyes from blizzards, Modi promised to enforce a one-rank-one-pension scheme for the armed forces during his tenure.
"It is my duty to see that you and your family live in pride."
The Siachen conflict between India and Pakistan has reportedly claimed more than 2,000 lives on both sides since 1984, with most soldiers falling victim to inhospitable weather and altitude problems.

"Everyone is aware of the extreme conditions at Siachen. Overcoming every challenge our soldiers stand firm, protecting our motherland," Modi earlier tweeted.
"Be it the altitude or bitter cold, nothing deters our soldiers. They stand there, serving our nation. They make us truly proud."
He said he had "a message from each and every Indian to our soldiers: that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you...
"We realise how and in what difficult conditions you are deployed here."

"Perhaps this is the first time a prime minister has got the wonderful opportunity of spending time with our jawans on this auspicious day... Am sure this would be among the most unique greetings Pranabda received."
Every Indian stands "shoulder to shoulder" with soldiers in Siachen, he said.
As Modi flew to Siachen, Pakistan Rangers fired at Indian paramilitary positions on the international border in Jammu region 365 km away while a strike called by separatists hit life in Srinagar.
A police officer told IANS that Pakistan Rangers fired at the Narain border post of the Border Security Force at Ramgar in Samba district. The firing started at 10.30 a.m.
Indian and Pakistani forces have been routinely firing at and shelling each other in recent times.
"We sleep peacefully because you are awake night and day," Modi said in his speech. He added that all three wings of the armed forces -- army, air force and navy -- were the nation's pride.
"This is my first Diwali after becoming the prime minister... I am very happy to be with these bravehearts."
After underlining that soldiers always helped people during disasters, Modi said he wanted to build a national war memorial for the military.
Meanwhile, buses went off the roads in Srinagar but some private vehicles and autorickshaws plied during a shutdown called by separatist groups that are opposed to Modi's visit.
Most shops and businesses were shut in Srinagar, the urban hub of a dragging separatist campaign that has claimed thousands of lives in Jammu and Kashmir since 1989.
Police and paramilitary personnel were deployed in visibly large numbers all across Srinagar.
Separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani accused Modi of rubbing "salt on our wounds" by visiting Kashmir on Diwali but not extending Eid greetings to Kashmiri Muslims.
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader Yasin Malik said Modi was "politicising a human tragedy" -- a reference to Modi's meetings with the flood victims.

Sikka fans the winds of change in InfosysSikka fans the winds of change in Infosys
SANGEETHA CHENGAPPA
Change agent: Vishal Sikka, CEO and MD, Infosys
The reinvention plan: more devolution, greater engagement and an atmosphere of informality
Bangalore, October 24:  
Glasnost seems to be sweeping through India’s most talked about IT company, Infosys.
With former SAP AG Director Vishal Sikka taking over as CEO, purse strings have been loosened, unnecessary controls have been done away with and even the mandatory tie has been made optional for male employees.
Sikka, through various e-mails since he took over in August, is driving home the point that engaging with employees more intensely is the key to re-inventing Infosys and if it is to return to the high-growth path and become the IT bellwether again.
Apart from the fact that all employees will now have access to social media sites like Facebook (one of the first things Sikka did after assuming office), he has now allocated a separate budget for employee engagement, to sharpen the focus on team-building efforts.
Team building efforts
“Sikka is putting far more emphasis on re-training, re-skilling employees instead of trying to hire a newer set as it would consume more time and effort — something Infosys can ill afford at this point,” an analyst with a brokerage firm said in a note to investors.
Sikka recently hired Michal Reah, a former SAP executive, to head Finacle, a banking product unit, as he believes that the product business will be the key focus area for the company going forward, and indicating that Infosys will not just stick to its core business of being a software services company.
SWAT team
Sikka had, in an e-mail, sought feedback from employees to improve the company’s all-round performance. He has now decided to act upon the feedback by setting up a SWAT team to review processes and systems on an ongoing basis. Infosys has also decided to allocate unit-level discretionary funds.
An employee who did not wish to be named said that while these steps are welcome, Infosys should start increasing salaries through special incentives for better performance as well as bring down bureaucratic controls bogging down productivity.
BS Murthy, CEO of executive search firm Leadership Capital, said thechanges were bound to happen given that Infosys made the biggest hiring decision in its history by bringing in an external candidate as its head.
“Invariably, the new leader will start by re-defining the character of the organisation — including the way they work, interact with customers, price services, etc.”

Serena thrashes Halep to win fifth WTA FinalsWilliams beats Halep to win WTA Finals title
By CHRIS LINES | Associated Press –  Sun 26 Oct, 2014

Serena Williams of the U.S. holds her trophy aloft after defeating Romania's …
SINGAPORE (AP) — The lead-up to Sunday's championship match at the WTA Finals suggested Serena Williams would face a major challenge to beat Simona Halep, but then, the No. 1-ranked player has made a career out of performing at her best when it matters most.
She did it again in Singapore, dispatching Halep 6-3, 6-0 just four days after a group-stage game between the pair in which the Romanian player dropped only two games and handed Williams her heaviest defeat for 16 years.
Coming into the tournament after having to withdraw from the China Open and Wuhan Open with illness and a knee injury, and just a day after a grueling three-set classic against Caroline Wozniacki, there was plenty of reasons to believe the 33-year-old could be vulnerable.
The doubts, though, were quickly swept aside as Williams overpowered her opponent in an imperious performance.
She won 11 of the last 12 games in the match to join Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf as the only players to have won five titles in the season-ending championships.
"I just started training, because I had such a bad knee in Beijing I didn't know if I'd be able to play here, and now I have won the Billie-Jean King trophy — I am so excited," Williams said.
Williams changed her approach from the group-stage contest, attacking Halep's second serve with fierce ground strokes, and regularly rushing the net to cut the points short and prevent her opponent from playing her preferred style.
"I had to play more Serena-style tennis and just do what I do best," Williams said.
"I was expecting a much better player than I was in the earlier round. Being ready for that really was able to help me out."
Halep's run in this tournament capped a remarkable rise, having gone from No. 64 in the rankings to No.4 in the course of 17 months, with a French Open final appearance along the way.
However, her relative lack of experience of big occasions compared to the 18-time Grand Slam champion proved telling.
"I was nervous before the match that I had to play this big final," Halep said. "I couldn't manage very well the situation.
"I knew that she would be more motivated during this match because we played a few days ago and I won."
The irony of Sunday's match was that Halep had it within her power to deny Williams a place in the final. Halep went into her final group-stage game knowing that if she lost in straight sets, Ana Ivanovic would go into the semifinals at Williams' expense. Instead, Halep lost in three and Williams made it in.
"I have no regrets because I did my job on court against Ivanovic," Halep said. "That was the chance but she deserves to win the title. She's much better."
Williams said she would have done the same thing if in Halep's shoes, namely try to win the group game despite the temptation of knocking out her most dangerous rival.
"No one on the tour thinks like that," Williams said. "She definitely gives her all so I don't think that went through her mind at all."
Halep got the first break of the match in the third game and was up 40-0 on serve in the next and looked capable of repeating the surprise 6-0, 6-2 victory over Williams on Wednesday. However, Williams broke back in that fourth game and the course of the match was changed.
Halep won only three points fewer than Williams in the opening set but clinched just seven points in the entire second set — including only two on return. The set was over in just 25 minutes.
Halep's victory in the group stage ended Williams' 16-game winning streak at the WTA Finals, but the American built her career win-loss record in the championships that feature the top eight players to 29 wins and five losses. Williams also retained the season-end top ranking, taking that honor for the fourth time.

Why Isaacson s Rewrite of Tech History Is So TimelyBy Alison van Diggelen, Host of Fresh Dialogues
Last Tuesday was the kind of evening when you just want to snuggle up with a good book and a warm mug of Earl Grey. But I rallied and zipped up my winter boots to go to Silicon Valley's geek mecca, The Computer History Museum. The guest of honor was Walter Isaacson, the author of Steve Jobs' biography and the bible for entrepreneurs around the world.
Isaacson's latest book is The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution . I knew that learning more about Silicon Valley's history would be good for me, but after reading the humdrum Financial Times review , my expectations were low.
But my fears were unfounded. In the parlance of modern movies, Isaacson had me at "Ada Lovelace." She's the woman who outlined the very first computer algorithm, and envisioned computer programs that could make art, even music. All this back in 1843.
Instead of a discussion about the male-dominated heroes of computing, Isaacson rarely strayed from the topic of women in computing. He chronicled the shocking neglect of the female programming team that completed the Eniac project, the first electronic general-purpose computer, only to be excluded from the high-profile public launch. Many times men got the credit and women were invisible.
"We have to put women back into the history of computing," Isaacson said.
Hear, hear!
Isaacson also has his finger on the pulse of Silicon Valley. Like automatons who've been asleep at the wheel, the tech world -- widely considered the ultimate meritocracy -- is waking up to the huge gender bias that's prevalent here.
With some prodding from influential journalists, companies like Google , Facebook, and Yahoo have recently published their stats.  On average, a paltry 15 percent of the tech workforce is female.
Why does this matter?
Gender-balanced teams make better products, companies, and communities -- and make them more economically valuable.
A recent study from Dow Jones VentureSource found that companies with the highest representation of women on their top management teams achieved better financial performance than other companies.
Sadly, despite Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean in" movement and Warren Buffet urging people not to hold women back, least of all themselves, the number of women going into computer science has actually dropped by half in the last 20 years.
The dearth of prominent geeky role models like Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and Kim Polese is part of the problem. Some say there's still a boy's club atmosphere in tech and that it's "hostile to women."
Some women, like those involved in the misogynistic "GamerGate" even fear for their lives.
Isaacson's book and its rewriting of tech history, with innovating women front and center could not be more timely.
Everyone needs role models, says Isaacson. Three cheers to that. Ada Lovelace is now mine.

But now the Marathi manoos has seen that the BJP offers a better alternative.
A London friend of mine was irritated by his bank manager telling him to clear his debts. So he stormed into his office and said ‘If you don’t stop writing me such rude letters, I shall take my overdraft elsewhere’. It seems to me that the Shiv Sena is in this situation. They first tried to play Big Brother to the BJP and wanted Uddhav Thackeray to be the chief minister-designate. Then they broke the alliance. Now having been shown as the weaker partner, they are still expecting the BJP to come and beg. This is not just misreading the situation, but being deluded.
But what the Congress has shown is that Dynasty does not work. It took three generations for the Congress to run out of talent. With the Shiv Sena, the memory of Balasaheb is the only asset. Raj Thackeray has done even worse. There is no point even in the two parties merging now. They will only destroy one another.
With the double victory in Maharashtra and Haryana, Narendra Modi has confirmed that his victory in May was no flash in the pan. Voters like his aspirational message. They admire his energy and they trust him to work hard for them. The Marathi manoos has been patronised by the Shiv Sena, who think that setting up a pav bhaji stall should be the limit of his ambition. It is the relative deprivation of the Marathas which gives the Shiv Sena the edge in its rhetoric against all outsiders. But now the Marathi manoos has seen that the BJP offers a better alternative. He doesn’t have to be backward forever. Just as the Congress wanted to preserve its BPL families with infinite care lest they escape poverty, the Shiv Sena wants its clients to remain bitter failures. This politics lost out last Sunday.
Once again, the contrast in the style of the BJP and Congress was striking. The BJP immediately began organising for the next cycle of elections and deciding who would be in charge. The Congress has not yet managed to analyse its May defeat, much less the October one.
Sonia Gandhi and Rahul gave up on Maharashtra by keeping their presence at a minimum. The inevitability of decline is starkly obvious to Congress leaders. What they lack is an exit plan. Ideally, the family should give up the party completely and bid goodbye. This may yet give the Congress some hope of reconstructing itself as a  modern democratic party. But perhaps that is asking too much. Their sense of destiny and family ownership will prevent a decent exit and we shall see pursuit of mirages such as Priyanka Gandhi as leader.
We have only one national party left — the BJP. You can see this by the way the NCP is behaving. continued…

Flip side: The festival seasoningSome say it’s a Chinese conspiracy to flood the Indian market with cheap firecrackers so Beijing is no longer the most-polluted capital on the planet.
Written by Dilip Bobb | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:26 am
It’s called PDS. Not the Public Distribution System that is meant to feed the have-nots, but the Post Diwali Syndrome that afflicts the haves. In India, we have more festivals than there are days in the year, but Diwali is really when indulgence violates the urban ceiling act. That is, till the bills come and PDS sets in. Here’s how you can recognise the symptoms of PDS.
Newspapers: Things are back to normal, with the regular-sized daily in your hand as opposed to the obscenely bloated versions that land with a loud thud outside your door in the days leading up to Diwali. National newspapers become unrecognisable because of the radical jump in advertisements, making it difficult to decipher where the front page begins, or whether Samsung or Haldiram have somehow made national headlines. The real news could begin on Page 10! That’s not to mention the shower of leaflets that drown you the moment the paper is opened. The medium as the message is a heavy load to bear.
Air quality: Also shows a dramatic increase, pollution levels that is, thanks to the millions of firecrackers which only increase each year, unaffected by minor issues like an economic crisis, inflation or austerity measures. Some say it’s a Chinese conspiracy to flood the Indian market with cheap firecrackers so Beijing is no longer the most-polluted capital on the planet. Pollution experts, always in great demand for sulfurous TV debates post Diwali, will fume and fret and predict our collective descent into the valley of fear, reminding us of the TV debates about Deepika Padukone’s cleavage.
Black money: The black smoke we see receding in the distance is highly symbolic of the colour of the money spent on Diwali all going up in smoke. We can all salivate over the names of Swiss bank account holders, promised to us by successive governments and Baba Ramdev, but there’s no time like Diwali to see whether the Indian government’s white paper on black money has any currency.
Swachh Bharat: The Prime Minister has pledged to remove the dirt in public life, and it’s never needed more than post Diwali when the public makes the roads look like a war zone in Iraq or Syria. The warmongers refer to it as collateral damage, something Shashi Tharoor will testify to, but collecting the collateral is a mammoth task, requiring all hands to the broom, and not just members of AAP, who are busy posting photographs of garbage like a bunch of drain inspectors instead of putting their party symbol to some use.
Spirit of generosity: It has a historical association with continued…

Fifth column: Real change pleaseNot even in a bizarre companies law that gives officials more powers of interference in routine business matters than ever before.
Written by Tavleen Singh | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:54 am
The Prime Minister makes it clear whenever he speaks that he understands well the need for urgent changes in governance and laws. He talks of ending “inspector raj” and repeats that the government has “no business to be in business”. But his ministers either do not understand what he is saying or do not understand the need for urgency.
This week, in which the whole country worshipped the Goddess of Wealth, is an appropriate one to talk of changes that should already have happened if we want the economy to start growing again at more than 8 per cent. It is a good week to remember that Narendra Modi was given a full mandate because Indian voters wanted radical changes in the way things are. And yet, not even baby steps have been taken so far to rid us of bad policies inherited from the Sonia-Manmohan government.
An example. Every time Arun Jaitley gives an interview, he admits that the land acquisition law bequeathed us by Sonia Gandhi makes it impossible for even private buyers to buy land. He admits that land cannot be acquired easily even for purposes of national security, but instead of ridding us of this misguided law, he announces only plans to tweak it. Has he not noticed yet that tweaking bad policies will get us nowhere near the ‘parivartan’ that the Prime Minister wants? Has he not noticed that investors continue to shy away from investing in big infrastructure projects because, on the ground, they notice no real changes? Not even in a bizarre companies law that gives officials more powers of interference in routine business matters than ever before.
The Prime Minister has repeated often that he believes the government has “no business to be in business”, but his ministers are not listening.
From the Finance Minister’s junior colleague, Nirmala Sitharaman, there have been so many angry statements against private companies that she is beginning to sound like a Marxist professor from JNU.
Most ministers show no signs at all of making the big reforms that are needed desperately if we want India to come closer to developing her enormous potential for being a rich country. They show no signs even that they understand that India counts among the poorest countries in the world because of bad economic policies. Labour laws prevent jobs from being created instead of doing the opposite. But again, they are only being tweaked. India imports vast quantities of coal despite having the largest reserves of this vital resource, but instead of a new policy for coal mining, we get just a bit of tweaking.
As someone who believes that India’s biggest failures have been in the social sector, I wait eagerly for continued…

Inside track: Uplifting desireDuring her brief stint as governor of Kerala, she resided in the Raj Bhavan at Thiruvananthapuram.
Written by Coomi Kapoor | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:03 am
It is  after 15 years that Sheila Dikshit is again staying at her two-bedroom first-floor flat in Nizamuddin East, central Delhi. As Delhi chief minister, she stayed at 3, Motilal Nehru Marg, on a 3.5-acre compound with four bedrooms. During her brief stint as governor of Kerala, she resided in the Raj Bhavan at Thiruvananthapuram. It is therefore quite a change for the former chief minister to return to her old modest quarters. The biggest problem Dikshit is facing is climbing the stairs. She wanted to install a lift, but her neighbour downstairs, IAS officer and author Upamanyu Chatterjee, was not agreeable to the idea as it would block his living room view. His landlady in Dubai too had not signed a No Objection Certificate to permit a lift. For now, the 76-year old Dikshit has to necessarily continue to climb the stairs.
Three in a row
Once is happenstance, twice is perhaps coincidence, but when a minister changes her press information officer thrice in the space of five months, there is clearly something wrong with her media relations. But the question is whether the three hapless information officers transferred out — R N Mishra, Nanu Bhasin and Maushumi Chakravarty — are really to blame if HRD Minister Smriti Irani is not getting the kind of coverage she expects in the media. No minister can get good publicity all the time, especially when she heads such a controversy-prone ministry. One reason for Irani’s poor relationship with the media is that she remains largely inaccessible to journalists. This is in contrast to when she was simply an MP and president of the party’s women’s wing. Then she was charming, thoughtful and interacted freely with the media. Before Irani recruits a fourth information officer, maybe she should consider changing her new standoffish approach with the press.
55-year rule
If politicians are upset at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule of no jobs for those over 75, senior bureaucrats are put off over another unofficial diktat: that plum foreign postings at the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank not be reserved for Government of India secretaries nearing retirement at 60. Modi’s new rule is that such foreign postings be assigned to additional secretaries around the age of 55. His logic is that the additional secretaries can gainfully utilise their three-year experience at international agencies to the country’s advantage on their return. While the post-retirement sinecures simply swell the officials’ bank balance, they provide no material benefit to the government.
Old understanding
The NCP’s offer of unconditional support to the BJP in Maharashtra was no last-minute decision. Nor was it aimed, as a senior NCP leader claimed jokingly, to simply “set the cat among the pigeons”. An understanding of sorts between Sharad Pawar and Narendra Modi had been continued…

From the discomfort Zone: Digital skeletonPrint
Written by Shombit Sengupta | Posted: October 26, 2014 12:13 am
It has started raining on digital technology. Arriving for an early morning flight, I started rubbing my eyes at the airport. Am I sleeping or dreaming? No, it’s real! The famous Walkman inventor is cooling his newly-launched mobile phone in water inside a display box to prove its unique rainproof character.
Yester-generation’s Japanese sultan of electro-mechanical Walkman device, who was upstaged by American burger digi-tech Emperor, is trying to avoid showing commoditised digital images. Instead, with rain falling on mobile phones, the sultan is bringing back Gene Kelly’s 1950s tap dance idea, ‘I’m singin’ in the rain’. Apart from shapely Bollywood heroines getting drenched in the rain, I don’t know whether people require phones in water. Although Slvio Berlusconi would love it for his bunga-bunga underwater sex parties. However, throwing cold water on digi-tech reinforces my digital skeleton idea.
Another airport wait —three hours in Heathrow for connection to Paris — was enough to compare oversize digital screen advertisements of perfume cosmetics brands such as Dior, YSL and Estee Lauder, among others. Through a dreamy route, they’re taking women to planet hedonism. What was disturbing me was identifying the excessive digital effects in every advertising image: The same lighting style and the same post-production digital retouching on the computer. From the technical embellishment perspective, all the different ads resembled one another. Lots of global enterprises have still not understood that digi-tech is just a skeleton. Their digital interface is commoditising the inner value of entertainment that the masses experience, making it all look similar.
Advertising that creates make-believe by manipulating or stretching a subject earlier needed some artistic sense and multiple craftsmanship.
The physical shooting stage involving set designers, light-men, sound creators is getting obsolete now. The other day, I met an old Parisian friend who makes background sound effects for films — a profession he inherited from his father. I loved his surprising magical sessions with different illogical instruments on the floor of a huge room. In front of a projection screen he’d watch the soundless movie and integrate sound into it as per the film’s action. The numerous instruments created by him looked really spectacular, much like installation art today. Watching him skilfully chafe ultra-violet coated satin to produce a recordable swish or strangely pull wire-string on some hollow instrument to emit an obtuse howl was itself an entertaining movie. This was his livelihood and passion, which, he sorrowfully narrated, is fading. His two children are not interested, so his collection of sound effects instruments has rusted and become antique. He said with digital technology, everything’s readymade in the digital disk so anybody can make sound effects. Just imagine, films now have no background sound differentiation.
So many artistic domains are getting massacred due to the over-usage of digi-tech, the killer of human passion, craftsmanship, knowhow and creative distinction.
At the same time we cannot ignore the advantage of digital content vs the celluloid film, which was cumbersome, extremely costly and you had to wait a couple of days to develop the film. With continued…

SC panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas near SariskaPrint
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:27 am
The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. However, a decision on the issue was put on hold in March 2013.
In December 2013, the government decided to withdraw the ban imposed by the state forest department in March 2012 and grant “consent to operate” to all mines falling beyond 100 metres of the sanctuary boundary. Other than Rajan, officials who cleared the decision included former chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, former mining secretary Sudhansh Pant and additional chief secretary (forest) O P Meena.

Good news from textile sector: exports to US  No. 1 single market  hit record highThe pick-up in performance, visible in the export of Indian apparel and textiles, is also matched by a revival of sorts visible in domestic sales.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:22 am
The Centre’s ‘Make in India’ pitch seems to have already found resonance in the country’s textile and garment industry, with India’s exports to its largest single market, the US, headed for a record surge this year.
While a renewed buoyancy in textile and apparel exports is helped by a sharp improvement in raw material supplies, the strong performance by India this year is also a reflection of a combination of global factors — a steady improvement in demand as the American economy picks up, a progressive decline in Chinese exports to major markets such as the US, currency appreciation in  Indonesia, labour unrest in Asian competitor Cambodia and safety concerns after a major factory fire in Bangladesh last year.
Indian textile and apparel exports have risen nearly 7 per cent during January-August 2014, according to the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) data, compared with an average 2 per cent annual growth in the last five years. The growth in exports this year is being seen as significant as it happened despite the sharp strengthening of the Indian rupee since September 2013 (a stronger domestic currency results in a loss of competitiveness for exporters and vice versa).
While the steady pick in US demand is a major factor, larger domestic cotton supplies are also helping India push textile and apparel exports, Ajay Sardana, vice-president of Aditya Birla group firm Grasim said on the sidelines of a recent conference. India is projected to be the world’s top cotton grower this year, ahead of China for the first time in over three decades, according to a September 12 US Department of Agriculture forecast that has been corroborated by the Cotton Association of India.
Virender Uppal, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said, “We (Indian exporters) have leveraged our raw material strengths and followed sustained better compliance practices, which attracted the buyers and international brands across globe to source from India.”
Added to this is a series of problems encountered by India competitors. Cambodia, in June this year, saw labour unrest as angry workers rampaged through a textile plant that supplied US sportswear company Nike Inc, clashing with police over their demands for a pay hike. The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last year has had a continuing impact in terms of orders being diverted to India and other markets because of concerns over Bangladeshi workshop safety while textile manufacturers in Vietnam, one of the fastest growing supplier base, have been weighed in by the high cost of credit.
Both Bangladesh and Cambodia have seen a contraction in exports to the US, continued…

Hammer blow for Manchester City at Upton ParkMan City beaten at West Ham, Southampton win again
By By Mike Collett | Reuters –  Sun 26 Oct, 2014

By Mike Collett
LONDON (Reuters) - West Ham United and Southampton maintained their unlikely but impressive starts to the season when the Hammers beat champions Manchester City 2-1 and Saints moved up to second with a 1-0 win over Stoke City on Saturday.
Chelsea, who visit Manchester United on Sunday, lead the Premier League title chase with 22 points from eight matches while Saints are second with 19 from nine games.
Manchester City are third on 17 after losing at West Ham through goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho. The champions could trail Chelsea by eight points on Sunday night if Jose Mourinho's men triumph at Old Trafford.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Arsenal won 2-0 at Sunderland, Liverpool were held to a goalless draw at home by Hull City, Swansea City defeated Leicester City 2-0 and West Bromwich Albion fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home to Crystal Palace.
West Ham did not have it easy against Manchester City who dominated possession but hit the bar twice through Yaya Toure and only scored once through David Silva.
Frenchman Amalfitano put the Hammers ahead with a tap-in after a brilliant low spinning cross from Enner Valencia after 21 minutes.
Senegalese Sakho became the first West Ham player to score in six successive Premier League games when he made it 2-0 with a goal given after goalline technology showed his header had crossed the line in the 75th.
Silva pulled one back for City with a great solo effort as he weaved through the defence two minutes later.
"It wasn't a lucky victory by any stretch of the imagination today because our commitment and desire to play against the big boys and the present league champions was there for all to see," West Ham manager Sam Allardyce told BT Sport.
"After David Silva scored their outstanding goal, for me it was about the squad's determination to make sure of what is a famous victory for us."
City manager Manuel Pellegrini denied he was under any more pressure after his side also let slip a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow to draw 2-2 in the Champions League in midweek.
VERY UNLUCKY
He said: "I always feel the pressure exactly the same from the first day to today.
"West Ham played very well especially in the first half and they did not allow us to move the ball but we were very unlucky because we had a lot of chances."
Southampton's fairytale start to the season is turning into a credible challenge for a top-four finish after they beat Stoke.
Although they were never likely to reproduce last week's 8-0 win over Sunderland, Sadio Mane's 33rd-minute strike separated the teams at St Mary's as Southampton won for the sixth time in nine matches.
"The first half was fantastic," said manager Ronald Koeman.
"We played very well and dominated the game, scored a good goal and had other good opportunities in the first half but we did not kill the game and it was difficult to the last seconds." Last week Southampton scored their biggest league win since 1921 when they thrashed Sunderland but Koeman said: "Maybe this win is more important than last week's because it's not always that easy and you have to fight for it". Arsenal won for only the second time in eight league matches, beating Sunderland with Alexis Sanchez scoring twice.
Liverpool's woes continued when they were held by Hull with Mario Balotelli missing an open goal with almost the last kick.
West Brom rallied against Palace who led at halftime thanks to a volley from Brede Hangeland and a penalty by Mile Jedinak.
Albion hit back in the second half with a header from substitute Victor Anichebe and a stoppage-time penalty by Saido Berahino.
Swansea ended a run of five league games without a win when they beat Leicester at the Liberty Stadium with a goal in each half from Wilfried Bony.
They are now sixth while Leicester, without a win in four matches since a 5-3 defeat of Manchester United a month ago, have slipped to 16th, two points above the relegation zone.

How to avoid pitfalls in retirement planningRepairing the damage
By Teena Jain Kaushal and Renu Yadav | India Today Group –  Thu 2 Oct, 2014 8:10 PM IST

You have been saving diligently for retirement. That's good. But in all likelihood, you have just a vague idea about what you want, not a concrete plan. That's bad, for this means you will make several mistakes as you set out on the road to gifting yourself a comfortable life after retirement.
For example, many of you think that whatever you save during your working life will be sufficient for your sunset years. But have you accounted for the demon that goes by the name of inflation, which nibbles away the value of your money 24X7? Probably not. This means you will not save enough to be able to continue your present lifestyle in old age.
Lack of clarity, say experts, may also lead you to set unrealistic goals. Sudipto Roy, business head, Principal Retirement Advisors, gives an example. He says a man, less than 30 years old, once sought their advice. He wanted to retire at 45 and buy an Audi car. He also wanted to go on a foreign trip every year.
The problem was that his annual salary was Rs 5 lakh. "We made him realise that it was impossible to meet these goals taking into account his salary. He understood."
Due to increased life expectancy, with people living 20-25 years, even more, after retirement, it is imperative to ensure that your finances are in a good shape when you retire. So, we talk about the most common mistakes that people make while saving and investing for life after retirement. For good measure, we also discuss how these mistakes can be corrected through timely action.
STARTING LATE
Retirement usually comes at the end in the list of financial goals of most people. They usually start saving for it when they are near the end of their working life. The focus, instead, is on intermediate goals. They save for the car they want in the next three-four years or the house they plan to buy in the next 10 years. They forget retirement as it is far away. They think they can start saving for it after other big obligations such as home loan and children's education/marriage are over. This is a wrong approach.
Starting early has many advantages. If you do that, your money gets more time to grow. Each gain generates further returns. As time passes, you miss out on this benefit, called compounding, which can grow money exponentially over time.
For example, if you start saving Rs 5,000 per month at 20 and earn 12% returns every year, you will have Rs 5.94 crore when you retire at 60. But if you start at 30, you will be able to accumulate just Rs 1.76 crore. The 10 additional years that you give your money to grow can do wonders for your financial well-being.
The more you delay, the more you will have to save per month. For example, if your age is 20 and you want Rs 5 crore by the time you are 60, you will have to save just Rs 4,207 a month for the next 40 years, assuming that the rate of return is 12%. If you delay till 25, you will have to almost double your savings (Rs 7,698 every month for the next 35 years). "Starting early can help you build a larger fund and give you flexibility for taking up entrepreneurial or other pursuits close to your heart," says Anil Rego CEO & founder, Right Horizons.
Experts also say that people who don't start saving early generally make riskier investments decisions later in life. So, start saving as soon as possible.
What to do: As a first step, we explain how you can calculate the money you will need for your post-retirement years.
After you arrive at the figure, finalise the investment plan. Take help from a financial advisor if you think you cannot do it on your own.
If you are starting saving for retirement when you are in your 40s or 50s, it is advisable to delay retirement by a few years. "Revisit your investment plan and see if you can allocate more to equities instead of bank fixed deposits, as it is the only way to earn a higher rate of return," says Rohit Shah, a Sebi-registered investment adviser and founder & CEO of GettingYouRich.com, a financial planning website. But remember that investment in shares has to be for at least five years.
"If you have bought expensive products such as unitlinked insurance plans, or Ulips, and traditional insurance products like endowment plans, check their surrender cost. If it is not high, surrender these products and invest the money in higher-yielding products like equity mutual funds."
If you have already retired but do not have enough savings, take up a job. "Alternatively, shift to a smaller city and give your house on rent. You can also sell your house if it is in a big city and buy a smaller one in a Tier-II city and use the money saved for life after retirement."
Also, retired people usually keep funds in conservative instruments such as bank fixed deposits. You can allocate a small part of savings to equities depending upon your risk appetite. The aim is to earn higher returns to bridge the gap between required and actual cash flow. Another option is investing in monthly income plans of mutual funds that invest 10-25% money in equities.
IGNORING PRICE RISE
Inflation is a demon that comes down hard on anyone who ignores it. "Since retirement is a long-term goal, it is important to understand the impact of inflation on your financial goals," says Feroze Azeez, director, Investment Products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth.
Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. It reduces purchasing power substantially. Assuming 7% inflation, Rs 1,00,000 today will be worth Rs 13,000 after 30 years.
In simple terms, this means that things will become costlier and years later you will be able to buy much less with the same amount of money.
Ignoring inflation means you will save much less than what you will need years down the line. If you spend Rs 50,000 every month at 30, you will need Rs 3.81 lakh a month at 60 assuming that prices rise at the rate of 7% every year. You have to invest in such a way that you beat inflation, that is, earn returns that are at least a couple of percentage points above the inflation rate.
Taking inflation into account will not only tell you how much you have to save but also help you decide the most appropriate investing strategy. "The assets that you choose should return more than the inflation rate," says Rego of Right Horizons.
What to do: If you ignored inflation while doing the maths, revisit the numbers. Always take the real rate of return (rate of return minus inflation) while doing the calculation. Also, use a realistic rate of inflation. You can take an average of the past few years. Lastly, don't underestimate inflation. It's better to err on the side of caution.
CASHING OUT EPF MONEY
Many people withdraw money from their provident fund account. This, say financial experts, is wrong as instruments such as the Employee Provident Fund, or EPF, have been designed to provide financial security after retirement. These are highly useful for retirement planning, especially due to their tax-free status.
Experts say it is not good to withdraw money from the EPF, even if it is to make a big-ticket purchase such as a house. Instead, it is better to dip into other savings; EPF should be only for post-retirement years.
Tanwir Alam, CEO, Fincart, a New Delhi-based financial advisory company, says, "Many people ask me if it is okay to withdraw money from the EPF for buying a house or it's better to take a loan. My advice is to let the EPF rest."
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that you save Rs 44,300 a year by choosing home loan over EPF (assuming 20-year loan of Rs 40 lakh at 10.25%), he says. Over five years, the saving is Rs 2,21,500. This takes into account the tax that you save on principal (up to Rs 1,50,000) and interest payments (up to Rs 2,00,000) for the home loan. We have not taken into account the rise in price of the house over time.
What to do: Do not withdraw from the EPF account. "If you have already done so, keep paying back through systematic investment plan," says Gaurav Mashruwala, a Mumbai-based financial planner. If you are short of cash, delay the purchase till you are able to save more.
IGNORING PPF
You may get attracted by high interest rates offered by fixed deposits. But keep in mind that while you pay tax on interest earned on fixed deposits, gains from the public provident fund, or PPF, account are tax-free. Also, PPF investment is eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Currently, PPF pays tax-free returns of 8.7%.
"A good retirement plan should have many instruments. The PPF should definitely be there because of its tax advantages. But the composition of the portfolio should depend upon the individual's situation and risk appetite. While the PPF is a good product, diversification is strongly advised," says Jayant Manglik, president, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.
One can invest Rs 1.5 lakh in a year. Till last year, this limit was Rs 1 lakh. By investing Rs 1.5 lakh every year, one can save Rs 46.75 lakh in 15 years. In 30 years, the amount will be Rs 2.10 crore.
The account can be kept open for as long as you want. You can also use the account for regular income as you are free to withdraw money after the end of the 15th year.
However, remember a few points. You can open an account with Rs 5 but have to deposit at least Rs 500 every financial year. There is an option for part-withdrawal from 7th year onwards. Plus, one can take a loan against the account after the end of the third financial year.
What to do: Open an account as soon as possible. The 15-year lock-in ensures that you save just for old age without getting swayed by intermediate goals.
DELAYING HEALTH INSURANCE
Medical expenses rise as a person ages. Experts say many people don't buy individual health plans during their working life as they are covered by employers. This is wrong as most employers give the cover only till you are employed with them.
You also have the option of porting the employer's policy to individual cover at retirement. But experts say do not depend on group policies after retirement as employers keep changing insurers and so you may miss out on benefits accumulated in the earlier policy such as waiver of waiting period for pre-existing diseases.
It is good to buy an individual health policy early in life. It is not only cheaper but also helps you cover preexisting illnesses after completion of the waiting period. Moreover, it covers you even after you leave the job or your company curtails the benefits under the group plan to cut cost. It also earns tax benefits upto Rs 15,000 for individuals and Rs 20,000 for senior citizens.
What to do: A single hospitalisation can wipe out your savings. Buy health insurance early in life. It will help you save a lot of money. Second, ensure that the cover is adequate. Estimate your needs on the basis of cost of treatment and inflation. If you cannot afford a large cover, buy a regular plan with low sum insured and add a top-up cover. Top-up plans are cheaper than regular plans. In a regular plan, the insurer pays up to the sum insured. A top-up plan covers you after a fixed amount, called deductible, is crossed.
NOT PLANNING FOR CONTINGENCIES
Your long-term investments are not for meeting contingencies. "Hence, all people, irrespective of age and employment status, must build a contingency fund," says Fincart's Alam.
"Ideally, your savings should guarantee you a lifestyle after retirement which is the same as you enjoyed in your working years. This involves high-level contingency planning as your income streams dry up as you retire," says Religare's Manglik.
What to do: A contingency fund should be able to meet at least six months' expenses. In later years, it should take into account possible medical emergencies as well.
NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY FOR EARLY RETIREMENT
Stress is nowadays burning out people at a young age, making them think of retiring early. Financial planners say they come across many people who want to advance their retirement age. But most of the time they advise them to delay the plan if they do not have enough funds to last their lifetime. "Early retirement requires rigorous planning for meeting life's goals," says Fincart's Alam.
To help you ascertain how much money you will need at retirement, we have prepared a table, How much do I need to save for retiring rich?
What to do: "Compounding is a powerful tool (the longer the period, the more the money will grow). If you think you will start saving later when your income rises, you may not be able to save enough. Therefore, enlist a financial advisor, start immediately, evaluate the available savings and protection instruments, calculate the funds required and get down to executing the plan," says Manglik of Religare.
PAYING HIGH FEES
Before investing in a financial product, look at costs such as the agent's commission and fund management charges. This is because these fees are paid from the money that you will invest. The higher they are, the lesser will be the amount invested. You can lose lakhs if you are not careful.
Consider this. You will end up losing Rs 5.82 lakhs over a period of 30 years if you invest Rs 1 lakh in a mutual fund scheme with 1% extra fund management charge, at an assumed rate of return of 12%. "Low cost does decide returns. Hence, the best investments on the basis of cost are mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, PPF and tax-free bonds. One must avoid traditional insurance products such as endowment & money back and Ulips," says Manglik.
What to do: Look closely at costs. For instance, for mutual funds, compare fund management charges. One option is to go for direct plans. In these, instead of going through a distributor, you invest directly with the fund house. Since there is no distribution fee, the expense is lower. A comparison of annual returns given by direct and regular plans shows that direct plans of diversified equity funds outperform the regular ones by more than 1%. Similarly, while buying insurance, go for online plans. The National Pension System is also a cost-effective retirement tool.
NOT HAVING ADEQUATE INSURANCE
When a bread earner dies, the whole family suffers a setback. A life insurance policy can take care of the family's well-being in such a case. The question is, how much cover one should have?
The ideal figure, say experts, is at least 10 times the annual salary. This will give the family a cushion of ten years to adjust to the new financial reality. For example, if your salary is Rs 10 lakh a year, the cover should be at least Rs 1 crore.
Another approach is calculating the human life value, that is, the present value of your future income. Don't forget to factor in liabilities such as home loan while doing the calculation.
What to do: Buy a term insurance policy as soon as you can. Buy online to save on premium. And do not forget to increase or decrease the cover as your liabilities change.
WRONG ASSET ALLOCATION, IGNORING EQUITY
It is important to invest in the right assets. "Asset allocation is to investment what oxygen is to human life," says Shah of GettingYouRich.com.
"As per a study, 91% performance of a portfolio is linked to asset allocation. Selection of securities, timing and others account for the rest 9%," he says. Right asset allocation is important as every asset goes through different cycles of boom and bust and has a different risk-return profile. Diversification is needed to optimise returns.
Another mistake is being conservative and ignoring stocks altogether. Keep in mind that to beat inflation one does not have any option but to invest in a growth asset like equity, which can give good returns over the long term. For example, Rs 100 invested in the BSE Sensex in 2000 had become Rs 422 by the end of 2013. Don't forget that this period covers both the dotcom bust and the 2008 financial crisis. The same investment in G-secs or government securities would have become just Rs 242.
Stocks can also help you reach your goals before time. Experts, in fact, say that those who have already retired should also have some exposure to stocks to support their cash flow as it is not possible to earn inflationbeating returns with debt investments.
"Most retired people think that as they do not have a big income stream, they should focus on capital preservation and invest in fixed deposits. However, they must appreciate that they have 25-30 years ahead of them. Some exposure to stocks can shore up returns," says Raghvendra Nath, MD & CEO, Ladderup Wealth Management Pvt Ltd.
What to do: We are not saying that you should invest all the money in stocks. Debt plays a very important role in the portfolio by providing it stability. Gold, too, has delivered good returns in the past decade. The key, according to experts, is to go for the right asset allocation.
The allocation between debt and equity will depend upon one's risk appetite. Generally, the older the person, the lesser risk he must take. One thumb rule to decide the equity allocation is "100 minus age". But this may not work in many cases. For instance, a retired person with no obligations and sufficient funds to meet his day-to-day expenses can consider a higher exposure to equities.
Age must not be the only parameter. Risk appetite, liquidity, inflation, liabilities and goals should also be taken into account. But one thing is clear. Equity investment has be for the long term.
So, the more time you have to retire, the higher exposure you can have to equity.
ASSUMING EXPENSES WILL GO DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY
Many people assume that their expenses will fall drastically after retirement. While they may indeed go down, don't expect the fall to be substantial. "Expenses after retirement are usually 80% of pre-retirement expenses," says Shah of GettingYouRich.com.
While you may not have to spend on children's education, loan equated monthly instalments and daily travel, some expenses such as medical and payment to domestic helps are likely to rise as you grow old. Your travel expenses may also rise substantially as you may visit friends and family members frequently.
What to do: "One should prepare a break-up of one's current expenses and then map the same to a postretirement scenario and then add inflation to get an accurate estimate," says Shah.
NOT HAVING A HOUSE
House is a basic necessity and accounts for a big share of expenses. If you are living on rent, your monthly outgo will generally be 20-30% of monthly income. So, having your own house during sunset years will reduce your expenses substantially. "It will also provide a sense of security," says Rego of Right Horizons.
In the worst scenario, go for reverse mortgage of the house. Reverse mortgage is the opposite of home loan. The lender makes monthly payments to the owner till he is alive. After death, it sells the house, recovers its dues and gives the rest to legal heirs. "Reverse mortgage can be a good strategy after the person enters his 70s. Reverse mortgage annuities are now taxfree. Leveraging the house can be helpful in tackling the problems of inflation and taxation," says Shah.
What to do: Start saving for a house now. If you can't afford it, consider buying in some other city where prices are within your budget and where you can spend your sunset years. The ideal location can be your native place.
UNDERESTIMATING TAX OBLIGATIONS
The pension you receive is taxable. If you fall in the highest tax bracket of 30% while you are working, it is unlikely that your income after retirement will not be taxable. Also, after retirement, people generally opt for conservative investments such as bank fixed deposits whose returns are taxable. If your annual interest on bank fixed deposits is more than Rs 10,000, the bank will deduct 10% tax at source. If you fall in the higher tax bracket, you will have to pay the differential to the tax department. So, it is better to take post-tax returns into account while working on the retirement plan. For instance, if you are investing solely in debt and earning 9% interest, your post-tax returns will be in the range of 6.3-8.1% depending upon your tax slab.
What to do: Invest in options with lighter tax obligations. Feroze Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "You must look at avenues that can provide you income that is exempt from tax on maturity/withdrawal such as provident fund or attract less/no tax if redeemed after a long period."
For instance, monthly income plans, which have equity exposure up to 25-30%, are taxed like debt funds. One can also look at investing 25-30% money in equity diversified funds as returns from equities are not taxed if sold after one year.
UNREALISTIC RETURNS
Those who invest in shares expect very high returns. Experts believe it is better to be conservative in your expectations. This is because how your investments perform is not in your hands, especially in case of assets like equities. Stocks have the potential to deliver amazing returns, but the risk of losses is also high.
For example, a Rs 100 investment in the Sensex would have doubled between 2005 and 2007. But next year, it would have been reduced to Rs 75. So, be realistic.
"Returns from shares depend upon earnings growth of companies. One can assume 15% returns a year for periods of 10 years or more," says Raghvendra Nath of Ladderup Wealth Management.
Exposure to stocks is likely to go down substantially after retirement. So, you should not assume high returns while doing your calculations.
"Equity investments should always be for the long term, ideally more than three years. One can assume returns of 12-15% a year over the long term. But after retirement, expect 12% returns as one will usually prefer conservative or balanced funds at this stage," says Rego of Right Horizons
What to do: Take a different rate of return while doing calculations for pre- and post-retirement periods. Also, people may approach you with risky schemes which offer unrealistic returns. Risk and returns are related. The higher the returns, the higher the risk. So, always double-check before investing in any scheme which is promising unrealistic returns. Start saving for retirement and avoid hitting the above-mentioned roadblocks for a smooth journey.

Advanced Tax Strategy to Avoid State Income Taxesreddit
While corporate tax inversions are getting all the press lately, there is another tax strategy - call it a " personal tax inversion " - that can help individuals avoid taxes. However, similar to corporate tax inversions, the personal version is becoming just as controversial. Earlier this year New York state, which was losing an estimated $150 million a year through tax avoidance, effectively closed this tax loophole for New York residents. Other states may follow, but until then, if you expect a windfall from a one-time gain or an investment account that you anticipate to produce significant income over the coming years, a personal tax inversion might make sense.
The personal tax inversion strategy is not right for every situation, but under the right circumstances, it can be an effective way to pay less state income tax. The technique, which works best if you live in a state with a high income tax - requires the use of an Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust. The Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust allows you to shift assets to another state with a lower or no state income tax such as Nevada or Delaware. These structures are also referred to as NINGs or DINGs to reflect the state (Nevada and Delaware, respectively) in which the trust is located. As Neil Schoenblum, Senior Vice President at First American Trust in Las Vegas, Nevada, explains, "The NING affords certain persons with significant investment income a rare opportunity to reduce their total tax cost by avoiding all state income taxes that might otherwise be imposed."
How a NING/DING Works
There are grantor trusts and non-grantor trusts. A grantor trust is established by an individual called the grantor. With a grantor trust, the grantor (i.e., you) is treated as owning the trust assets for income tax purposes, and as such, is responsible for any income tax due on the assets within the trust. For example, if you live in California and simply have a trust administered in Nevada, you will still be taxed as a California resident.
On the other hand, a non-grantor trust is where you place assets into the trust and give up enough tax strings so that you are no longer considered the "owner" for tax purposes. So now the trust itself and not you is responsible for paying the income tax. If the trust is administered in a tax-free state such as Nevada, the trust pays no state tax, but don't celebrate too soon. If you transfer assets outside of your control, you run the risk of having to pay gift taxes. So while you may avoid state income tax, you would most likely have to pay federal gift tax or at least use up your gift/estate tax exclusion if the drafting attorney isn't careful. A non-grantor trust isn't going to work well if that were to happen.
The solution is to use a NING or DING. The "secret sauce" of this structure is the careful drafting of the documents. The goal is to keep enough control that you don't get accused of gifting the assets and having to pay gift tax, but not retain so much control that you are responsible for state income tax. This is an advanced strategy that requires the guidance of a good estate or tax attorney. Estate planning and asset protection attorney, Steve Oshins, of Oshins & Associates in Las Vegas, Nevada says, "Nevada has become the go-to state for this technique. I have done more NING Trusts this year than ever before given the favorable NING Trust Rulings that the IRS has recently issued. People love to save state income tax."
An added benefit is that NINGs and DINGs not only provide tax minimization but also asset protection. If you are interested in minimizing state income taxes, have your advisers run an analysis to see if a Nevada Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust (NING) or a Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust (DING) will work for you.

Why China s property slowdown isn t so scaryView Photo
Photolibrary | Getty Images
China's property market looks to be on shaky ground with home sales flagging and prices declining, but Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS - News ) isn't fretting about a sharp downturn in the sector.
"Our bottom line is that the Chinese housing market has some clear signs of 'froth'," Andrew Tilton and Hui Shan, economists at the bank, wrote in note. "But with several sources of pent-up demand, policymakers have a broad array of tools to deploy (and have even started to deploy some) to help support the housing market," they said.
The bubble in the housing market has been generated more from the supply side - overbuilding by developers- rather than the demand side whereby households leverage up to purchase beyond their means, Tilton and Shan said.
Read More China home prices fall for fourth straight month
This means there is still scope to stimulate demand should policymakers desire to do so, they said, noting that rapidly-rising incomes and continued urbanization ensure a large pool of potential buyers in the country.
"Chinese policymakers are attentive to the risks and can avail themselves of a particularly broad array of tools to smooth the adjustment path and limit risks," they said.
Plenty of policy tools
In late-September, policymakers took bold steps to prop up the housing market, allowing a broader range of home buyers access to lower down payments and mortgage rates.
Read More China relaxes mortgage rules for second home buyers
There's further scope to ease mortgage lending conditions, the bank said.
"The mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio is still low in China, so easing mortgage credit would be highly likely to increase sales, prices and construction activity, with minimal incremental financial stability risk," it said.
Alternatively, the government could provide liquidity to distressed developers or even purchasing inventory directly in order to prevent them from cutting price aggressively to liquidity inventories.
However, the bank acknowledges that managing the property slowdown won't be an easy task.
"Policy must be restrictive enough to rein in shadow banking activity and limit future excesses in construction. But it must be loose enough to support demand and avoid a sharp credit crunch that could lead to liquidation of housing inventory and large price declines," Tilton and Shan said.
"Compared with the previous two housing slowdowns in 2008-09 and 2011-12, debt is higher and growth is slower, so policymakers face more constraints today in designing and implementing effective policy changes to steer the housing market away from an eventual hard landing," they added.
The housing sector - which is linked to some 40 sectors in the country from cement to furniture - is regarded as the weakest link in the world's second-largest economy.
Read More China GDP beats, but growth rate slowest since crisis
Growth in real estate investment slowed to 12.5 percent in the first nine months of 2014, from 13.2 percent in the first eight months, while property sales and new construction tumbled, helping to drag broader economic growth to a near six-year low in the third quarter.
"We expect the contribution of housing activity to real GDP growth to wane significantly by 2015, although it is still a net positive," Tilton and Shan said.
"Spillovers to the financial system will not have large negative consequences, because of low household leverage, the lack of complex financial products that can amplify systemic risk, and policymakers' demonstrated ability and willingness to limit the degree of credit stress on the system and to support key institutions," they said.
Near-term outlook brightening
Alvin Wong, China property analyst at Barclays (London Stock Exchange: BARC-GB), expects the government's recently announced property measures will begin to boost sales as soon as the fourth quarter.
"With the effect of the more preferential mortgage environment to kick in, including a lower down payment ratio for upgrade demand, the cheaper lending rate for first mortgages as well as more supportive housing provident fund loan policies, we believe this should bode well for the continued improvement in the sales momentum in the fourth quarter," he wrote in a note.
Read More China's property rescue package: Will it work?
Different from the historical pattern of September sales generally being better than October sales - sales for the first three weeks of this October - across 30 major cities tracked by the bank - have exceeded the level recorded in the same period of September, he said.
With a better October likely, this should translate into the first year-on year increase in national property sales in 2014, he noted.

Printing dept. bid to retain redundant postsUpdated: October 27, 2014 02:33 IST
Printing dept. bid to retain redundant posts
N. J. Nair
Tweet
While the State government is embarking on a drive to do away with obsolete posts in various departments as part of its austerity measures, the Printing Department is reported to be making efforts to retain more than 200 posts that have become redundant over the years.
Official sources told The Hindu that contrary to the government directive to identify such posts, a conscious effort is on to amend the service rules and retain posts that have become outdated following fast-paced changes in the printing sector during the past few decades. The posts of forms officer, compositors and supervisors in various sections in government presses and a legion of proofreaders are just some among them.
Outsourcing
With a lion’s share of the government jobs, including printing of textbooks, being outsourced to the private sector, the state-of-the-art printing facilities in all the 11 presses and the workforce are largely left to idle.
Still, no attempt has been made to audit their output. The revenue drain on this score too has not been estimated so far, sources said.
The post of forms officer, which was created decades ago to distribute government application forms, as well as offices and supporting staff, still exists in 11 districts. Proposals to set up the offices in Wayanad and Idukki were turned down.
Filing of online applications has rendered the posts outdated.
A large number of posts such as compositors and proofreaders are still being retained.
In the wake of the financial crisis, the Finance Department had issued a directive to end the system of officials going on deputation as it entailed financial commitment to the government. Officers on deputation from the Secretariat were being posted as the Director of Printing in violation of such directives. As the officers who held the post were unfamiliar with the nature and functions of the department, many anomalies often went unnoticed, sources said.
The government had proposed to scrap insignificant posts and form a pool of employees occupying such posts. But no efforts were being made either to identify the posts or re-train the employees to make them relevant in the current context, the sources said.

"Everyone is aware of the extreme conditions at Siachen. Overcoming every challenge our soldiers stand firm, protecting our motherland," Modi said in a tweet.
"Be it the altitude or bitter cold, nothing deters our soldiers. They stand there, serving our nation. They make us truly proud.
"Am going to Siachen with a message from each and every Indian to our soldiers: that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you," he said in tweets from his personal Twitter account.
Siachen glacier is the world's highest battlefield at a height of 5,400 meters. Its ownership is disputed by Pakistan.
Modi will visit Srinagar from Siachen to meet victims of the recent unprecedented floods that ravaged the Kashmir Valley and the Jammu region.

The paradox of being TabuUpdated: October 25, 2014 17:51 IST
The paradox of being Tabu
Sudhish Kamath
arts, culture and entertainment
Did you know the queen of arthouse prefers mainstream? That’s what the writer discovers to his surprise on meeting the charming Tabu
If you didn’t watch her films, you could easily mistake her for Farah Khan. For she shares Farah’s spirit and love for commercial cinema and is almost dismissive of anything arthouse or indie because her idea of cinema is ironically the opposite of the films she is in. “Maybe that’s why we have been best friends for years,” she laughs out loud.
“There’s a dichotomy, I agree,” she laughs in the middle of our interview when I confront her after sensing that she prefers entertainment to art.
We are talking about the queen of arthouse here. Tabu. Of Haider. Of Life of Pi. Tabu. Of The Namesake. Of Chandni Bar.
“People have created this perception of me in their own heads because they take it for granted that I am only going to do these (art) kinds of films and that I have a great opinion only about these films. Aisa kuch nahin hai,” says Tabu, talking to me at her Lokhandwala flat.
Maybe that’s why she did Jai Ho? A Bhai film to make a statement.
“It was homecoming for me. It’s the fourth film I did with Salman,” she laughs. “I may prefer comedies or Farah Khan kind of films but people who are offering me these roles are not thinking whether I’m endorsing that kind of films. They approach me if they feel I suit the role and the character.”
"Every film is a different offer. It should be worth my time if I have to get out of comfort zone to do a film"
What doesn’t she like about arthouse films then?
“Well, most of the people can’t or don’t want to pay money. Probably, they come with the presumption or notion that I believe in art more. I don’t know. Maybe they think I have no right to ask for money because they have given me a good role.”
How could they think that the actress who did multiple-Oscar-winning Life of Pi andThe Namesake would be affordable, I ask.
“People can think anything, no? I can’t show them my repertoire. Most of the time, it’s that or sometimes, I think it is not worth my time. I have to spend six months or a year away from home. In any case, I don’t think everyone does everything offered to them. How many actors or my contemporaries are doing ten films a year. Why is this question posed to me?”
So she is a reluctant actor because the kind of films she loves watching don’t approach her and the films that want her can’t afford her?
“I don’t know what to answer. With every film, the priority is different. With every film, the reason for me to say ‘No’ is different. It’s not like a blanket thing. It’s not like a desk job. Every film is a different offer. I’m not able to understand. It should be worth my time if I have to get out of comfort zone to do a film.”
What’s her comfort zone? “My home. Lokhandwala. My friends. And my family. And it’s not a once and for all choice. You are making choices as and when the options are coming. Depending on what you are getting offered, irrespective of who the director is. You are picking or rejecting whatever comes along the way. Life of Pi and The Namesake were worth spending time away from home.”
“It’s a huge leap in your own experience with people. You meet new people. You get so much fodder. The friends I made in The Namesake — I still have my New York and LA friends. That way, it opens up my life. So if it translates to work, then great.”
So how does she evaluate artistic merit in projects? What is good cinema to her?
She pauses to think for a moment and explains hesitantly. “Enjoying the experience of watching the film. I can’t get away from being an audience from my childhood association with movies. That’s why it’s difficult for me to become critical, analytical or judgmental about movies and cinema. As an actor, your life has changed, your relationship with the movies has changed. But when you were not an actor, your relationship with movies was totally different. So somewhere you were caught between that and this. So I am not able to get a handle on what is my take on movies and what is my relationship with it.”
She never went to acting school. She picked up acting along the way, on the job, she says. When Vishal called her for Haider, she did have her reservations about the odd pairing. She knew it was a layered, complex role. There was just one reading before they left for Kashmir and that was it.
I ask her about that moment when a grown up Haider kisses her sensuously on her neck and her reaction at that exact point. Did she know she was getting into incestuous territory?
“I didn’t see it like that. It’s definitely not incestuous. If there was, it was not deliberate. That’s what came at that time. There are too many layers, too many things going on in her mind,” she explains how she approached Vishal’s interpretation of Hamlet’s Oedipal relationship with his mother.
Torn, conflicted, complex. Classic Tabu.

Focus on flagship schemes; Anant Geete leads Sena team
Ahead of the crucial winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the NDA’s close to 400-odd MPs on Sunday evening that he expected them to take his government’s “pro-poor” initiatives pro-actively to the people, as these were not the exclusive property of some political parties/governments (a snide reference to the predecessor UPA dispensation). He also said he expected them to conduct themselves in a “righteous” manner, never indulging in any activity that may bring them into disrepute.
Mr Modi’s pointed message to his flock was delivered over high tea — attended, interestingly enough by the entire Shiv Sena contingent — on the lawns of 7 Race Course Road. It was the first such gathering of NDA MPs, but Mr Modi promised that this would become a regular feature.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, playing master of ceremonies, urged MPs to contribute to enhancing the quality of debates in Parliament, explained the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s objectives, and announced that Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 would be celebrated annually as Ekta Diwas, when all government servants will take the unity pledge. BJP veteran L, K. Advani congratulated party president Amit Shah for the election victories in Maharashtra and Haryana, while presenting him with a shawl.
For two hours, from 4 to 6 pm, the focus was on the importance of all ministers and MPs being fully briefed on key programmes so that, as a government source put it, “elected representatives are empowered to become effective political communicators” both inside and outside Parliament.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed MPs on the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana, the recent ordinance on coal and Union Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari on the Adarsh Gram Yojana; among other presentations.

Sena can come on board without conditions: BJPstate politics
Announcement comes amid growing frustration within Shiv Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP
Even as a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit continues to lobby for a minority government in Maharashtra with the help of Independents, the party announced on Sunday that it wanted a tie-up with its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena. However, this announcement came with the rider that the Sena should come on board without any conditions.
“We are keen to take the Shiv Sena with us in forming the new government, but they should come forward without any conditions. Discussions on portfolios can come later; it is important to have a meeting of minds,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
The party’s statement came after an outburst by Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar earlier in the day: “The BJP does not want us. Their State leaders do not want the alliance.” Mr. Kirtikar was in Delhi to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high tea for NDA constituents.
There is growing frustration within the Sena which has been kept on hold by the BJP ever since the election results. Many in the party feel the BJP is set to humiliate them and is not serious about striking an alliance.
However, the party welcomed the BJP’s statement. Meanwhile, the BJP has announced that its Chief Ministerial candidate will be chosen on Tuesday after a meeting of legislators and MPs. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and senior BJP leaders will be present.
The swearing-in ceremony is expected on October 30 at Wankhede stadium. Mr. Modi may attend the event.

Arabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone  target GujaratArabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone, target Gujarat

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 24:  
After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

Real Madrid come from behind to win the ClasicoNo joy for Suarez as Real beat Barca in 'Clasico'
By By Iain Rogers | Reuters –  Sun 26 Oct, 2014
Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (rear) celebrates after scoring with a penalty …
By Iain Rogers
MADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid trimmed Barcelona's lead at the top of La Liga to one point when they recovered from letting in an early goal to secure a stirring 3-1 comeback win in the 'Clasico' on Saturday.
There was no dream return for Luis Suarez, making his Barca debut after a four-month ban for biting an opponent at the World Cup.
The Uruguay forward looked reasonably sharp and had a hand in Neymar's opening goal but did not come close to scoring himself before being replaced by Pedro midway through the second half.
Neymar stunned a packed and hostile Bernabeu with a superb fourth-minute effort before Cristiano Ronaldo levelled with a penalty in the 35th, the first goal the Catalan side had conceded in nine league outings this term.
Pepe made it 2-1 to the European champions five minutes into the second half and a misunderstanding between Andres Iniesta and Javier Mascherano led to Real's third after the hour when Karim Benzema finished off a swift break with a clinical strike.
"The team was incredible across the board," Real defender Sergio Ramos told Spanish television.
"We had very clear ideas, we dominated and we not only controlled possession of the ball but we were very good on the counter attack," added the Spain international.
"Football is about phases of a match and you have to know how to read them. We fought for the ball and they are not used to that and we did them damage."
Barca are top with 22 points and Real, who had an early-season wobble but have been in scintillating form in recent weeks, second on 21. Sevilla, who host Villarreal on Sunday, are third with 19.
Four-times World Player of the Year Lionel Messi had a quiet night for Barca and remains one goal short of the league scoring record of 251 set by former Athletic Bilbao forward Telmo Zarra six decades ago.
"We played a very good first half," said Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.
"We had some good chances to unbalance them but the 3-1 caused us a lot of damage and we struggled," added the former Barca and Spain goalkeeper.
FIRST BLOOD
In a match watched by millions around the globe and showcasing many of the world's best and most expensive players, Barca drew first blood through Neymar, the Brazil captain's ninth league goal of the season.
Suarez picked him out on the left wing with a raking pass and Neymar skipped past challenges from Dani Carvajal and Pepe before firing into the corner past keeper Iker Casillas.
Real immediately upped their game and Benzema came close when he headed against the crossbar before smashing the rebound off the corner of the goal frame.
Casillas pulled off a superb save to deny Messi in the 23rd minute after Suarez had sent over a teasing low cross and Pepe cleared just as Neymar was preparing to nod home before Real were awarded a penalty.
Barca centre back Gerard Pique slipped and handled a Marcelo cross and Ronaldo sent Claudio Bravo the wrong way for his 16th La Liga goal in eight appearances this season.
It was the 11th consecutive game the Portugal forward has scored for Real, his best run since joining from Manchester United in 2009.
Real edged ahead when Pepe was given too much space at a corner and headed powerfully past Bravo before Barca shot themselves in the foot with a bizarre blunder by Iniesta and Mascherano near the edge of the pitch that gifted possession to Isco.
The Spain playmaker raced clear and the ball eventually found its way to Benzema who smashed it past Bravo off a post.
It was no more than Real deserved and although Barca pressed hard to force a way back into the game they barely troubled the home goal again.
It was Real's 71st victory in 169 La Liga 'Clasicos' since the arch rivals first clashed in the top flight in 1929. Barca have won 66 with 32 draws.

The Centre is expected to inform the Supreme Court on October 28 that it is ready to hold elections in Delhi. Sources in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not in favour of forming the government with the current mandate.
Buoyed by the outcome of Assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra where Modi led from the front, the Delhi BJP leadership feels that the same feat can be repeated in Delhi.
The BJP leaders are set to meet Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung after Diwali to inform him about the decision. It will also have the bearing on Lieutenant-governor's rule in Delhi which will complete the stipulated one year in February. Unlike other states where governor's rule gets renewed after six months, the Lieutenant governor's rule in the Capital lasts a year.
A section of BJP leadership has been in favour of government formation in Delhi. But party sources said that even before the results of the Assembly polls were declared, the prime minister had told the party leaders that forming the government by engineering defections or desertions is not good and the party should seek proper mandate in Delhi.
Thereafter, Delhi BJP leaders have also been informed that they should begin preparations for the polls. Senior party leaders also believe that any statement on government formation will benefit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been demanding fresh elections in Delhi.
After the city's top BJP leader Dr Harsh Vardhan joined the Union Cabinet, the party did not find anyone to project as the potential chief minister. But the party's victory in Maharashtra and Haryana has firmed up the belief that the BJP can bank on Modi magic and it won't be difficult to win similarly in Delhi.
Earlier, in the first week of October, some Delhi BJP leaders had met Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders, including Bhaiyaji Joshi. A party leader said that RSS leaders clearly suggested that government formation in the present circumstances will not send a good message to people and the party should prepare for Assembly polls in Delhi.
"RSS leaders also referred to the party's position in Maharashtra and Haryana, where the BJP was expecting victory. They were of the view that the situation is in favour of the party in Delhi as well. Now, there is no doubt about this," a party insider said.
The BJP had emerged as the single largest party after the Delhi Assembly polls in December last year with 32 seats, including ally Akali Dal's one MLA, in the 70-member House.
In the prevailing situation, the BJP cannot form the government on its own in Delhi. The party's strength in Delhi Assembly has been reduced to 28 after three of its MLAs- Harsh Vardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma-were elected to the Lok Sabha.
On August 5, the apex court had given five weeks' time to the Centre to take a decision on dissolution of the Delhi Assembly "one way or another", questioning it for continuing to keep the House in suspended animation, with no party coming forward to form the government.

Survey: Majority of men want flexible workBy Brigid Schulte October 21 Follow @BrigidSchulte
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
For decades, flexible work arrangements have been seen as an accommodation to working mothers … and often, in high-octane work environments, as a sure way to sideline careers on the “Mommy track.” But a growing body of surveys, polls and research is showing that having a measure of control over when, where and how work gets done is something nearly everybody wants these days. Including men.
In a new survey of 1,000 men released Tuesday, Working Mother Media found that nearly 80 percent said they not only worked flexible schedules but that they felt comfortable doing so.
The survey, How Men Flex, found that more than half of the men said their employers supported flexible work. About one-fourth said their employers could but chose not to. Close to 60 percent of working fathers said they would prefer to work part-time, if that meant they could still do meaningful work and rise in their careers. But one-third said part-time work was looked down on at their workplaces, and would cost them.
Jennifer Owen, director of the Working Mother Research Institute, said the report comes on the second annual National Flex Day that they created to highlight flexibility in the workplace. Last year, they looked at working mothers. This year, she said, they wanted to look at the other side of the story.
“I was expecting, because of conventional wisdom, that we’d see a hesitancy, a big gap in men’s comfort level with flexibility and how they’re using it. And the survey showed that’s completely not true,” Owens said. “Men are very confident using flexibility. It’s almost a mirror image of what we found with women. They’re all looking for the same thing.”
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
The report is one more indicator of the sea change underway in gender roles, workplace cultures and caregiving responsibilities. In recent years, reports by the Pew Research Center and Families and Work Institute, among others, have found that working fathers are feeling more stressed than working mothers from the conflicting demands of work and family responsibilities. Surveys have shown that younger fathers particularly see being hands-on caregivers as being as important as succeeding in their careers.
And the Families and Work Institute has found, in nationally representative surveys of employers and employees, that more men than women tend to work flexible schedules, particularly those in more senior positions.
“Men are too often an afterthought in conversations about working parents and workplace flexibility,” Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer for the financial services company Ernst & Young, said in a statement. Ernst & Young sponsored the survey. “Everyone wants to have meaningful work and personal lives and flexibility is a great equalizer, helping men and women to achieve their professional and personal goals.”
With changing social norms and demands in mind, several companies are opening up flexible work arrangements to more employees, offering paid parental leave for mothers and fathers and other programs to ease work-life conflicts, with some high-tech and financial services companies taking the lead.
Deb DeHaas, who heads diversity and inclusion programs at Deloitte, said that work-life issues have become “center stage” issues for the company, as young workers put a premium on work-life balance, dual-income career couples struggle to juggle it all, and as Baby Boomers are delaying retirement but no longer want to work intensive hours. Flexibility and work-life integration are no longer seen as for mothers or parents only, she said, but as critical for recruitment, retention, morale, engagement, productivity and the long-term health of the company.
Leaders now openly talk about their vacations, she said, the hot yoga they do to stay healthy, the marathons they run. Pilots, called “Small Things, Big Differences,” are underway to give employees more predictability over their schedules and e-mail-free weekends.
“We’re trying not only to have the work-life policies, but to make sure our culture supports it,” she said. “That people know it’s every bit as important to allow that parent time to pick up a child from day care as it is for another person to play sports or get an advanced degree.”
The How Men Flex survey also found that most men preferred a mix of working from home and the office. Men who worked remotely five days a week reported more stress than men with no flexibility in their schedules at all. A majority of these telecommuting men reported feeling isolated, that they could never get away from work, and that their commitment to the job was constantly called into question.
How Men Flex (Working Mother Media)
That, social scientists say, may be because our workplace cultures have long expected men to work nonstop for 40 years, and for women to be primary caregivers.
Laurie Rudman, a psychologist at Rutgers University, has researched workplace cultures and found that men are often rewarded for occasionally flexing their schedule to coach children’s sports teams, but that their commitment is often questioned if they take on more regular caregiving duties. Using identical resumes of men, one with overt caregiving duties and one without, Rudman found that both men and women judged the man with caregiving duties more harshly.
In the How Men Flex survey, authors also found that more than half of fathers said they would reject a job with frequent overnight travel.
And, in an interesting twist, nearly 80 percent of the male managers in the survey said they supported flexible work arrangements for all employees, but about half said they wished they didn’t have to manage those flexible schedules.
The men surveyed by Working Mother Media were, on average, 39 years old and earned an average of $67,000. Only 65 percent were married or partnered with at least one child living in the household.
Other findings include:
88 percent said partners should equally share child care
83 percent said partners should share housework equally
74 percent agreed with the statement, “A parent should be home with children after school.”
65 percent said a working mother sets a positive example for children
Eight of 10 men say they would be comfortable with their spouse as the primary breadwinner
39 percent said they would prefer to be a stay-at-home parent

One company gives workers $7 500 for vacationBy Brigid Schulte October 23 Follow @BrigidSchulte

Earlier this year Jaclyn Pickard went to Costa Rica and snorkeled, visited cocoa farms and rafted 18 miles down the Pancuare River. Her colleague, Lauren Wiper, went to Italy with her sister for 10 days, hiking in the Cinque Terre, wine tasting in the Piedmont and visiting friends in Milan.
Karlis Lauva backpacked through southern France, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. David Fitzgerald bought a bike and rode around Colorado for two weeks following the USA Procycling Challenge.
Their boss, Bart Lorang, went to Bora Bora for his honeymoon.
And their company, FullContact, a high-tech firm in Denver, paid for it all.
It’s called the Paid Paid Vacation. All you have to do is promise not to check work e-mails, texts or calls, to totally unplug, and the company will pay you $7,500 every year to go on vacation, in addition to drawing your full salary.
“We are all really passionate about technology, but at the end of the day, I don’t think anyone’s dream is to just have a job,” said communications director Brad McCarty. “You’re not going to remember the 20 extra hours you put in every week when you’re 90. But you will remember the trip to Venice.”
You can go for as long as you’d like. The company, which organizes peoples’ contacts and stores them on the cloud, has an open vacation policy. “The standard rule is, don’t screw over your team,” McCarty said.

(The standard for most American workers: as the only advanced economy with no national paid vacation policy, one-fourth of all U.S. workers have no paid vacation. Those that do tend to get 10 to 14 days, say they feel too guilty or busy to take them all, and, when they do take off, often take work along or check work e-mails and texts regularly, prompting the travel industry to dub the United States the “No Vacation Nation. “)
Perks like the Paid Paid Vacation landed the company at No. 61 on Outside Magazine’s recently released 2014 100 Best Places to Work list . Outdoor clothing company Patagonia, with its famous “Let My People Go Surfing” motto, came in at No. 94. And at No. 1, Seeley Lake Elementary in Montana, which stores bikes, Nordic skis and showshoes for both students and staff and closes early on Thursdays, the better for everyone to get a start on an outdoor weekend.
As worker well-being, work-life balance, mindfulness classes and even happiness ratings are gaining traction in corporate America, FullContact’s Paid Paid Vacation originated about two years ago, McCarty said, when Lorang traveled to Egypt with his then-financee and someone snapped a photo of him, on a camel, at the pyramids, with his head down staring at his smartphone, checking his e-mail.
It was one of those light bulb moments, McCarty said. “Bart said, ‘this is just ludicrous. If I don’t pull myself away and force myself to have a life, then what am I working for?’”
Now, McCarty said, just about every one of the 41 employees at the four-year-old firm has taken a Paid Paid Vacation. FullContact, which now tracks about 1.3 billion contacts, or 20 percent of the world’s population, views the Paid Paid Vacation as a way to attract and retain top talent in the highly competitive tech world.
Jaclyn Pickard in Costa Rica. (FullContact)
“The cost is actually pretty minimal. It’s not at all uncommon to see $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 bonuses paid for people to come to work at tech companies,” McCarty said. “For us, whatever your salary is, add $7,500 to it every year. That’s a great retention tool for us.”
As are the powder days – meaning, when the snow has dumped and you’re itching to ski, go for it and take a paid day off. Or in McCarty’s case, since he works remotely out of Nashville, when spring fever hits, the hiking begins.
“It’s worked incredibly well,” he said. “The really big names in tech all focus on the same idea, that employee happiness has to come before everything else. While it’s really difficult to measure that return on investment from a dollar standpoint, it’s not difficult to measure what happens when someone returns from a Paid Paid Vacation: you see, without fail, people shining brighter, working harder and more excited to get back into the swing of things.”
And if someone doesn’t unplug on the Paid Paid Vacation?
“If you are on the grid and working and get caught, you have to pay it back. That’s the agreement,” McCarty said. “But so far, no one’s had to.”
McCarty said he hadn’t taken vacation for five years himself before coming to FullContact. Since then, he’s taken a Paid Paid Vacation and gone with his wife and two kids to Disney World for two weeks and spent a long weekend in the Smoky Mountains with his wife, he said.

At least nine persons were killed – five of them women – and 26 others injured when a night bus run by the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) went off the highway and fell into a small river in Nagaon district in central Assam late last night.
Nagaon district SP Arabinda Kalita said the ill-fated bus was on its way from North Lakhimpur in eastern Assam to Guwahati when the accident occurred. Majority of the passengers were on their way to catch a train in Guwahati today morning en route to Lucknow and other places for visiting some places of pilgrimage.

“The bus which had also picked up some other passengers on the way must have lost control following which it hit the railings of a bridge and fell into a small river. While eight persons had died on the spot, one person died on being shifted to a hospital,” SP Kalita said. The accident occurred at village Uluwoni under Kaliabor police station at around 1:30 AM, after having traveled about two kilometers after crossing the Kaliabhomora bridge on the Brahmaputra.
Eight of the dead have been identified as Pranita Dutta, Jogen Barua, Padumi Barua, Nila Bora, Dhanada Saikia, Kusha Gogoi (driver), Ananda Bora and his wife Nilima Bora. While 26 others who were rescued by local villagers and sent to local hospitals at Kaliabor and Nagaon, 10 of them were later shifted to Guwahati Medical College Hospital here.
Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is currently in New Delhi, has ordered an inquiry to be conducted by the secretary of the state transport department. The state government also announced ex-gratia to the next of kin of those killed and announced free treatment to those who sustained injuries.
 

How to deal with the 7 worst types of bossesHow To Deal With The 7 Worst Types Of Bosses
By Emmie Martin | Business Insider –  Fri 17 Oct, 2014 2:45 AM IST
> class="p1">
The Internet Movie Database Donald Sutherland, Colin Farrell, and Jason Sudeikis in "Horrible Bosses."
National Boss Day, on Oct. 16, offers a chance for you to thank your boss for all their hard work.
However, there's a chance your boss is a terrible leader — not exactly the type of person you want to celebrate. 
While you can't change how your boss acts, you can control your own reactions. "When your boss is incompetent, you step up," says Nicole Williams , LinkedIn's career expert. "You're not going to play the victim or the martyr, you're going to see this as an opportunity to take a leadership role, and compensate for whatever your boss is doing."
Dealing with a difficult boss comes down to figuring out where they're failing and making up for it through your own work. "It's not going to help you to play the martyr and complain about your boss," Williams says. Instead, figure out ways you can work your behavior into that boss's style so you'll both succeed. 
Williams walked us through the worst types of bosses and how to deal with their shortcomings. Here are the top seven:
1. The ice block
Some bosses like to keep a divide between their personal and professional lives, making it difficult to form a genuine connection. "This boss seems to be very cold, aloof, and hard to get to know," Williams says.
In this case, you need to be the one who takes the first step. Find out where they went to school, who they know, or where they've worked before — any common ground you can connect over. "Chances are, he or she won't try and initiate conversation, but if you ask great questions, especially smart ones, they're more likely to answer," Williams says.
2. The serial innovator
This boss is always jumping from idea to idea, making it difficult to fully focus on one project. "They always have a new idea and expect the same from the rest of the team," Williams explains. "Even while you're in the midst of working on a project, he's already on to the next." 
The best way to deal with a boss who is all over the place is to stay on top of new ideas as well. Constantly check LinkedIn, know what similar companies are doing, and keep your ear to the ground for any new innovations in your industry. "If your boss walks in and asks if you saw that article in The Wall Street Journal, you have to know it," Williams says.
3. The boss who plays favorites 
The people this boss likes seem to get all the benefits, from attending an out of town conference to earning a coveted promotion. If you're not one of the lucky few, shift your focus elsewhere. "Get the attention of other people within your organization, and he or she will see that someone else — someone they respect — like and appreciate you, and that's going to give them pause and give you a second round of consideration," Williams advises.
However, favoritism can be tough from both sides. If you're the boss's pet, your colleagues likely think that you receive opportunities solely because of your relationship, and not your talents, Williams warns. In this case, do your best to stand out separate from your boss and prove yourself as an individual.

Micromanagers have trouble relinquishing control, and constantly bombard you with emails and reminders, no matter how many times you promised to follow-up on a project. "It's such a competitive workplace, and people are afraid to delegate opportunity because they're afraid it's going to go wrong," Williams says. 
The best way to deal with a controlling boss is to over-communicate until you earn their trust. Williams recommends asking questions to prove that you're competent. "This person wants to answer a lot of questions, so do that," she says.
5. The "talker, not a walker"
This type of boss is all talk, no action."The problem is that their ideas are essentially great, but nothing in terms of the development of your experience and talents will happen unless they're executed," Williams says. 
If you're dealing with this boss, you need to be the one who steps up and takes charge. "Be the one who gets the ball rolling, who takes the first step to build the momentum," Williams suggests. Your boss and teammates will appreciate the effort.
6. The thunder thief
This type of boss not only steals everyone's ideas and takes credit, but also tends to put down other people in the process. "It's hard to sneak around and get credit because a lot of time they're having conversations that you're not privy to," Williams says. "You have no way of defending yourself."
If your boss is petty enough to take your ideas and go over your head with them, it's best to keep your distance. Rather, focus on ways you can make yourself known independently. Williams recommends posting pictures and updates on a site like LinkedIn, so others can see your involvement in a project. 
7. The indecisive boss
Similar to the "talker, not a walker," this boss gets nothing done because they're afraid of making decisions. "This is the person who isn't usually experienced at managing, and doesn't know how to delegate," Williams says. 
An indecisive boss leaves you a chance to take on a surrogate leadership role by stepping up and pushing them to make a decision. "Give them options where they feel some source of empowerment and control, but essentially you're presenting the options to them and limiting the scope," Williams suggests. By asking them to choose between two things, they feel like they're making the decisions, but you've already done the work to narrow things down. 

Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister meets Governor on power sharing with TelanganaPrint
The two state governments are involved in a bitter war of words over the power-sharing issue. (Source: File photo)
By: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 26, 2014 4:55 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 5:02 pm
Amid a raging row between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on sharing of electricity, the AP government on Sunday petitioned common Governor ESL Narasimhan on the issue.
“…The water level is going down to 856 ft (at Srisailam project). The ayacuts of SRBC in Rayalaseema needs to be protected. We tell Telangana as well, let’s protect and save water. Up to 70,000 cusecs of water is going into the sea through the Prakasam barrage. We should not be hardening out stance,” AP Irrigation Minister D Umamaheswara Rao told reporters.
“Farmers need to be protected both in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Our goal is to see that water is not lost,” he said.
Rao said he has explained “all the facts” to the Governor who will go through the relevant material concerning the issue.
“Our leader (AP Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu), as TDP president, tells us and also the Krishna river board chairman that farmers should be protected. I have told Governor about the facts, because water needs to be saved carefully,” he said.
There is a scarcity of 73 TMCs of water to existing levels in Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar (reservoirs) and that huge quantity of water is going into the sea, he said.
Observing that water needs to be saved, the minister said power can be purchased from other states, but even a single TMC of water cannot be obtained.
The current dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is about power generation at Srisailam (project).
Andhra Pradesh wants Telangana to stop power generation at the Srisailam project as continued power generation would lead to water scarcity in AP in the future.
However, Telangana has refused to stop power generation in view of the prevailing acute power shortage, especially to agriculture.
The two state governments are involved in a bitter war of words over the issue.
In a no-holds-barred attack, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had alleged that Naidu was denying the rightful share of electricity to Telangana.
Alleging that Naidu was not honouring the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, Rao had said on Friday that Telangana would move the Supreme Court and also sought the Centre’s intervention.
Rao had alleged that the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister sought to defame the TRS government and “he is a cheater”.
Taking exception to Rao’s criticism, AP’s communications advisor Parakala Prabhakar said on Saturday that the former’s remarks against Naidu were “unbecoming” of his stature.
“He has crossed all limits. Being a chief minister, it is highly unbecoming of KCR to use such intemperate language. Moreover, what else he spoke is blatantly false,” he said.
Prabhakar alleged that the Telangana chief minister seemed to have not understood the substance of government orders (GOs) 69 and 107 that regulate the use of water at Srisailam reservoir.

Well-literate MLAs with modest financial backgrounds inducted in Manohar Lal Khattar s CabinetAmong all the ministers sworn-in, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar is the poorest with merely Rs. 8.6 lakh worth assets. (Source: Jaipal Singh)

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s Cabinet comprises of well-literate Ministers. While four out of the nine ministers are post graduates, three are law graduates and two graduates.
The four ministers sworn-in on Sunday who hold post graduation degrees include  Kavita Jain (MLA from Sonipat), who holds a post graduation degree in  Commerce (M.Com) with a Bachelors degree in Education (B.Ed); Krishan Kumar  (MLA from Shahbad) holds a post graduation degree in Sciences (M.Sc); Karan Dev Kamboj (MLA from Indri) holds a degree of post graduation in arts (M.A) and a law degree; and Om Prakash Dhankar (MLA from Badli) holds a post-graduation degree in Arts and Education (M.A and M.Ed).
Capt. Abhimanyu (MLA from Narnaund) is pursuing a business management course from Harvard University and holds a law degree, and Ram Bilas Sharma (MLA from Mahendergarh) also holds a law degree. Ambala Canontment’s MLA Anil Vij is a graduate in sciences (B.Sc), while Bikram Singh Thekedar (MLA from Kosli) is a graduate in arts (B.A.).
Capt. Abhimanyu is the richest among all the ministers with declared assets of more than Rs. 74.8 crores. Interestingly, he owns eight vehicles in his  name and three in his spouse’s name. Among all the ministers sworn-in, Khattar is the poorest with merely Rs. 8.6 lakh worth assets.
The other Ministers including Kavita Jain has declared her assets at Rs. 2.5 crores, Anil Vij Rs. 86 lacs, Rambilas Sharma Rs. 3.15 crores, Bikram Singh Rs. 1.34 crores, Om Prakash Dhankar Rs. 58 lacs, Narbir Singh Rs. 42.8 crores, Krishan Kumar Rs. 22.62 lac and Karan Dev Kamboj Rs. 4.3 crores.
Infact, before Khattar’s name was cleared as Chief Minister in the BJP’s  legislature party meet, four out of the six Cabinet Ministers were being considered as front-runners for the CM’s post. These include Capt Abhimanyu, Rambilas Sharma, Anil Vij and Om Prakash Dhankar. However, the party chose Khattar, an RSS pracharak and Modi’s close confidant, as its Chief Ministerial candidate and the rest were accommodated by giving them cabinet berths.

Kaushik Bora, an executive director of Assam Oil Division (AOD) of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd has gone missing on Sunday from near the Digboi Refinery in upper Assam, about 530 kms from. His personal car was found abandoned about 10 kms from Digboi.
Bora, currently Number 2 in the 114-year old Digboi Refinery, had gone out from his official residence in the refinery township at around 10:30 AM and was later reported missing by his family at around 4 PM, Tinsukia district SP Akhilesh Kumar Singh said over the telephone.

ECB faces test as Europe braces for landmark banking reviewECB faces test as Europe braces for landmark banking review
Reuters
Tweet
FRANKFURT, Oct 26:  
After putting the euro zone's top 130 banks through their paces, the European Central Bank will face a test of its own on Sunday - will its landmark health check succeed in convincing investors the region's lenders are safe?
The ECB will announce the names of 25 banks that held too little capital at the end of last year, along with details of around 10 banks that have not yet made up the shortfall. The announcement is due at 1100 GMT.
As well as the number of failures, Reuters has already reported details of several banks' performance, including that Germany's Deutsche Bank and Greece's Alpha Bank passed the tests while Ireland's Permanent TSB failed.
Other media outlets have also reported how some banks and countries' banking systems have fared.
With much of the news revealed in advance, the major remaining question is whether the exercise will be judged credible enough to banish lingering fears about euro zone banks, freeing them up to lend again and tempt U.S. investors back to European banking shares.
The ECB has staked its reputation on delivering an independent assessment of the euro zone banks before it takes over as their supervisor on Nov. 4.
The European Banking Authority (EBA), which will include the ECB results in an announcement of EU-wide stress test results at the same time on Sunday, is hoping its exercise will prove more convincing than previous rounds in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The euro dipped on Friday amid uncertainty about the results, while euro area banking stocks were volatile as rumours swirled about who had passed and who had not. Initial comments from investors on Sunday and trading in banks on Monday will be the first real indication of how the tests are judged.
"At least we will get a true picture of what the banks have genuinely in their books," said Alan Lemangnen, Europe economist at Natixis in Paris. "We see that the solvency of the European banking sector will improve and has already improved."
ASSET VALUATIONS KEY
Sources familiar with the tests say the ECB's findings on whether banks have overvalued their assets, and what kind of corrective action it demands, will be at least as significant as who passes or fails.
A forensic review of how banks value their assets marks these health checks out from three previous EBA tests. While just 20 percent of banks have failed the ECB tests, most lenders are expected to be found to have overvalued their assets.
If the ECB judges banks' assets to be worth far less than the banks do, it will not force a bank to immediately take additional loan losses.
However, banks will have to hold more capital to reflect the ECB's assessment of their likely future losses as asset values fall to what the ECB believes they are now. This will leave banks with less flexibility to expand, lend or pay dividends.
Any outcome that depresses lending would be at odds with the ECB's objective of getting banks to pump more credit into the euro zone economy to revive much-needed growth.
"Banks shied away from taking on new risks in order to look as safe as possible," Berenberg analysts said. "Their uncertainty slowed the credit cycle over the last year, and prevented job-creating business investments from going ahead. This uncertainty should fade now."
France's central bank governor, Christian Noyer, said on Friday the exercise was "more rigorous than what was done in other big countries" and would restore credibility in the sector.
The results will be closely watched for any sign of political favouritism. Sources told Reuters on Friday that the checks found that banks in Greece, Cyprus, Slovenia and Portugal had fallen short of the capital benchmarks at the end of last year, while lenders in Spain and France had fared, by and large, better than expected.
In Germany, the president of the association of German private-sector banks, Juergen Fitschen, said on Thursday the results would probably give German lenders a clean bill of health, something that may raise eyebrows given widespread concerns about some areas of German banking like shipping lending.
Fitschen is also co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank . Sources told Reuters on Friday that the lender passed the stress test by a wide margin, showing balance sheet strength well above the minimum requirements.
NEXT STEPS
The ECB review is running in parallel with an EU-wide stress test, and the results for both will be announced simultaneously. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio and chief supervisor Daniele Nouy will brief the media at 1130 GMT on Sunday.
The ECB's passmark is for banks to have high-quality capital of at least 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets in the most likely economic scenario for the next three years, and capital of at least 5.5 percent in an adverse scenario.
The assessment is based on banks' positions at the end of 2013. Since the end of last year, however, banks have already strengthened their balance sheets by issuing new shares, retaining earnings or selling assets. This may mean that even if banks fail, they may have already dealt with their problems.
Since mid-2013, efforts by banks to boost their balance sheets have amounted to 203 billion euros, the ECB said.
Banks with a capital shortfall will have to present the ECB within two weeks with a plan that details how they intend to close the gaps. They will then be given six to nine months to do so, depending on where in the review the shortfalls occurred.
"We expect the capital solutions to be found within the private sector and see extremely limited requests for public funds," Lemangnen of Natixis said.

Euro comes safely through ECB stress test0
Its New Zealand peer slid to 92.35 yen , retreating from a seven-year high of 93.97 set just on Friday.
Traders said investors were forced to take profits on bearish yen trades as a four-percent drop in oil prices to five-year lows triggered a selloff in energy stocks. That, in turn, saw the S&P 500 <.SPX> suffer its biggest fall since October.
Currencies of oil-producing countries fared poorly with the Canadian dollar reaching a fresh five-year low of C$1.1486 per USD . The Norwegian crown fell to a 5-1/2 year trough of 7.1872 per USD .
Asian stocks should track Wall Street lower in a move that will probably continue to support the yen in the hours ahead.
Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Raiko Shareef said there also appeared to be growing speculation that the yen's depreciation has come about too quickly.
"Japanese officialdom would be quick to agree, now sensitive to the complaints of Japan's importers. No doubt helped by some post-payrolls profit-taking, this is USD/JPY's biggest single-day fall since mid-October," he said, referring to Monday's performance.
Indeed, the sharp fall in dollar/yen helped drag the greenback down against the euro, which popped back above $1.2300 , from a two-year trough of $1.2247.
Still, investors were likely to remain wary of buying the common currency amid speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) was poised to ease policy further early next year.
Executive Board member Benoit Coeure kept those expectations alive on Monday, saying policymakers last week agreed unanimously to assess how and when to react to downward inflation risks in early 2015, and that they could then change their asset buying plans.
Several Federal Reserve officials spoke on Monday as well, but stuck to a dovish script that offered nothing new in terms of when the central bank will likely lift interest rates.

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

Equity investing tips for those looking to retireStory
Adding muscle
Stocks are not out of bounds for those who are near retirement. Let's see how they can use equities to shore up returns.
Rahul Oberoi      Follow @iamrahuloberoi    Edition: October 2014
(Photo: Reuters)
It is believed that stocks, due to their unpredictable nature, are only for the young and daring. The old, it is said, should do their best to stay away from this risky asset.
This belief, like many others, is not without its set of challengers. Stocks, say several financial planners, are indispensable for every investor, young or old, as they are the only asset that can beat inflation over long periods.
Suze Orman, an American author, financial advisor, motivational speaker and television host, is once reported to have said, "Cash-in savings accounts, short-term CDs or money market deposits-is great for an emergency fund. But to fulfill a long-term investment goal like funding your retirement , consider buying stocks. The more distant your financial target, the longer inflation will gnaw at the purchasing power of your money."
"A retired person, considering that his liquidity needs have to be met from investments , should invest in debt instruments an amount equal to three years of living expenses plus planned expenditures and ongoing and expected medical expenses. The instruments can be bank fixed deposits or short-term funds. The remaining money can be invested in equities," says Feroze Azeez, director, investment products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth.
WHERE TO INVEST?
An individual near retirement , due to less time and low risk appetite, should invest in companies that grow consistently and have quality managements. There are many such companies in fast moving consumer goods, or FMCG, pharmaceutical and information technology sectors whose earnings grow at a fast pace and which are not impacted much by market trends. Also, a good dividend payment (for regular income) and growth history should be considered.
DK Aggarwal, chairman and managing director, SMC Investment and Advisors, says, "A person who is about to retire can consider large-cap stocks as most blue-chip companies pay high dividends and outperform the stock market. Defensive sectors such as pharma and FMCG should have more weight in the ideal portfolio of a person nearing retirement."
FACTORS TO WATCH
Click here to Enlarge
Unlike the young, who can bet on new and emerging businesses as they can wait for years for their investments to grow, the retired should look at mature companies run by quality managements, score high on corporate governance, have delivered consistent returns and have a history of paying high dividends.
Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "Companies that have proven themselves and have gained market share over the years will need less funds for expansion and so will have a sizeable surplus that they can distribute as dividends. These will be beneficial for retired individuals (who want regular income). Such companies can be either in large-cap or mid-cap space."
Dipen Shah, head, private client group research, Kotak Securities, says, "If someone is near retirement or has already retired, he should invest only in large and stable companies with credible managements, strong balance sheets and good dividendpaying record. Small companies should be avoided."
DIRECT OR INDIRECT EXPOSURE?
What is the ideal way to take exposure to stocks in old age? Considering the recent changes in tax laws, which extended the holding period for short-term capital gains from debt funds from 12 to 36 months, the retired can look at balanced funds. These invest more than 65% money in stocks and so are considered equity funds for taxation. This means gains from an investment held for more than one year are not taxed. Plus, they give investors exposure to debt, which provides stability to the portfolio, as well.
At present, short-term gains from debt funds are added to the income and taxed according to the person's tax slab. Long-term gains, if the units are held for more than three years, are taxed at 20% with indexation. Indexation involves adjusting the purchase price with inflation. It lowers gains and, hence, the tax burden.
Azeez of Anand Rathi Private Wealth says, "Indirect exposure through mutual funds is better since these are well-regulated and managed by professionals. This saves investors the hassle of personally tracking companies. There are a number of mutual funds whose mandate is investing in growth companies. They also provide a dividend payout option." Dividends can be a good source of regular income for the retired.
Tushar Pendharkar, equity strategist, Right Horizons, says anyone can take exposure to stocks, either directly or through mutual funds. A thumb rule says that equity exposure should be 100 minus age. So, if the person's age is 55, he should invest 45% funds in equities. Therefore, it is recommended that one should reduce exposure to stocks with age.
For those who would like to take direct exposure to stocks, we talked to market experts and tried to find out stocks they can buy in the present market from their retirement funds. Hiren Dhakan, associate fund manager, Bonanza Portfolio, suggests stocks with consistent history of paying high dividends such as Colgate-Palmolive, Hawkins Cookers, Emami, HDFC and Hindustan Uniliver.
Aggarwal of SMC says, "Emami and Godrej Industries are good options for retirement planning." Emami has a robust portfolio of more than 300 products and good operational track record. Godrej Industries is part of a leading business group that is seeing robust growth in all its verticals.
Emami has given 47% annualised return to investors in the past ten years. Godrej Industries, Hawkins Cooker, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC and Colgate Palmolive have returned 43.25%, 64.56%, 19.82%, 23.70% and 26.64% a year, respectively, during the period. All these companies also have a record of paying dividends regularly.

School staff member detained for nursery student's rape
A three-year-old girl child studying in a private school in Bangalore was allegedly sexually abused in her nursery class on Tuesday, police said.
Yahoo India –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014
BANGALORE: Bangalore Police have detained a suspect and filed a criminal complaint against the private school where a three-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her school teacher on Tuesday.
According to reports, a school attendant has been detained by the police for interrogation.
The principal of the private school where the alleged rape took place had earlier on Wednesday said that the institution would abide by the law and use all of its resources to nab the perpetrators of the crime.
"We went through all the CCTV recordings, we are sure there was no outsider entry into the school. The police have examined each area of the school campus and have been provided all records for investigation. We take the safety of students very very carefully," she said.
The three-year-old girl child was allegedly sexually abused Tuesday in her nursery class, police said on Wednesday.
"We have registered a criminal case late Tuesday on a complaint by the victim's father that his young daughter was sexually abused in the Orchid The International School premises," Police Inspector T.C. Venkatesh told IANS.
The case was registered under sections 4 and 6 of the Pocso Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012) and section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unidentified suspect(s).
According to the complaint, the girl's mother found her daughter crying and behaving unusual and abnormal when she went to pick her up from the school in the evening.
"The victim had signs of fever and complained to her mother that she was physically abused by someone she did not know or recognize," the complaint by her father Harpreet Singh said.
The latest incident of child abuse in a city school has occurred three months after a six-year-old girl student was allegedly raped July 3 in The Vibgyor High school in the eastern suburb by its gymnastic coach and his assistant.
The accused were arrested three weeks after the incident July 29 and remanded to judicial custody pending investigation and filing of the charge-sheet by police. (Agencies)

RCEP negotiations: India averse to delinking goods from servicesNew Delhi not willing to relent after bitter experience with ASEAN pact
New Delhi, October 26:  
India is facing pressure at the on-going Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations from members such as the ASEAN bloc, Japan and South Korea to conclude a free trade pact in goods earlier than one in services.
New Delhi, however, is unwilling to fall in line with the demand following its bitter experience with the 10-member ASEAN countries with which it had agreed to sign a FTA in goods first.
Sub-group meetings
Talks between RCEP members, which also include China, Australia and New Zealand, are happening in various sub-group meetings at the moment, with New Delhi set to host the next round of talks in December. The pact seeks to include goods, services, investments, competition and intellectual property.
“There is immense pressure on us in these sub-group meetings to agree to de-link goods from services, but we are not budging. With ASEAN, we hardly got any concessions in services as we had concluded an FTA in goods first and had no bargaining chip left. In RCEP we are not prepared to do the same and the entire pact has to be signed in one go,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine.
Negotiation on RCEP, which will be the largest trading bloc in the world accounting for 45 per cent of population and combined GDP of over $21 trillion, began in 2013 and is scheduled to be concluded by 2015.
But, talks have hit muddy waters, as there is no concurrence on important issues such as level of ambition for the initial offers, the divergence in offers made to individual members and whether all parts of the comprehensive pact should be concluded together.
“India wants to be conservative in its initial offers because of China, but other RCEP members want a high level of ambition even at the initial stages,” the official said.
There is also no unanimity on the divergences that members would be allowed to have. While India is prepared to be liberal with trade partners such as ASEAN, Japan and South Korea, with which it already has signed FTAs, it cannot be as open with China because of Indian industry’s inability to cope with open competition from the country.
Similarly, countries such as New Zealand and Australia, with which India has no trade pact, cannot be treated on the same footing as FTA partners.
“It is very important for us to be allowed divergences as we cannot treat all members of the RCEP alike. We hope the grouping recognises and provides us the needed leeway,” the official said.
India is keen to be part of the RCEP despite China’s presence in the grouping as it is not part of either the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) — the other two extensive regional trade deals under negotiations. There is a risk that India would have to face higher duties than its rival countries in most markets if it is not part of any major trade pacts.

SC panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas nearSariskaPrint

The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. However, a decision on the issue was put on hold in March 2013.
In December 2013, the government decided to withdraw the ban imposed by the state forest department in March 2012 and grant “consent to operate” to all mines falling beyond 100 metres of the sanctuary boundary. Other than Rajan, officials who cleared the decision included former chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, former mining secretary Sudhansh Pant and additional chief secretary (forest) O P Meena.

Good news from textile sector: exports to US  No. 1 single market  hit recordhighThe pick-up in performance, visible in the export of Indian apparel and textiles, is also matched by a revival of sorts visible in domestic sales.
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:22 am
The Centre’s ‘Make in India’ pitch seems to have already found resonance in the country’s textile and garment industry, with India’s exports to its largest single market, the US, headed for a record surge this year.
While a renewed buoyancy in textile and apparel exports is helped by a sharp improvement in raw material supplies, the strong performance by India this year is also a reflection of a combination of global factors — a steady improvement in demand as the American economy picks up, a progressive decline in Chinese exports to major markets such as the US, currency appreciation in  Indonesia, labour unrest in Asian competitor Cambodia and safety concerns after a major factory fire in Bangladesh last year.
Indian textile and apparel exports have risen nearly 7 per cent during January-August 2014, according to the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) data, compared with an average 2 per cent annual growth in the last five years. The growth in exports this year is being seen as significant as it happened despite the sharp strengthening of the Indian rupee since September 2013 (a stronger domestic currency results in a loss of competitiveness for exporters and vice versa).
While the steady pick in US demand is a major factor, larger domestic cotton supplies are also helping India push textile and apparel exports, Ajay Sardana, vice-president of Aditya Birla group firm Grasim said on the sidelines of a recent conference. India is projected to be the world’s top cotton grower this year, ahead of China for the first time in over three decades, according to a September 12 US Department of Agriculture forecast that has been corroborated by the Cotton Association of India.
Virender Uppal, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said, “We (Indian exporters) have leveraged our raw material strengths and followed sustained better compliance practices, which attracted the buyers and international brands across globe to source from India.”
Added to this is a series of problems encountered by India competitors. Cambodia, in June this year, saw labour unrest as angry workers rampaged through a textile plant that supplied US sportswear company Nike Inc, clashing with police over their demands for a pay hike. The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last year has had a continuing impact in terms of orders being diverted to India and other markets because of concerns over Bangladeshi workshop safety while textile manufacturers in Vietnam, one of the fastest growing supplier base, have been weighed in by the high cost of credit.
Both Bangladesh and Cambodia have seen a contraction in exports to the US, continued…

Dilma Rousseff becomes Brazils new President for second term after narrowwinPrint

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

You do not have to be an account holder for receiving funds from another account holder
Team Money Today        Edition: October 2014
You do not have to be an account holder for receiving funds from another account holder. ICICI Bank has recently launched a facility under which an account holder can transfer funds to another person even if the latter does not have a bank account. But there are a few prerequisites for using the facility. For example, a sender needs to have online banking ID and password, and the beneficiary needs to have a mobile phone for receiving the amount.
You first need to log in to the bank website with user ID and password. Register the beneficiary, the receiver of money, by entering his or her mobile number, name and address and the unique registration number (URN) that you receive on your registered mobile number. Then, you go to the transfer section and select 'cardless cash withdrawal' for entering the transaction amount. After the amount gets deducted, you receive a unique four-digit code on your mobile from the bank. You need to share it with the beneficiary.
The beneficiary or receiver also gets an SMS with a unique six-digit code on their mobile phone from the bank. Finally, the beneficiary has to visit a specified ATM and enter the required details - the mobile number, the four-digit code (received by the sender), the six-digit code (received by the beneficiary) and the amount to be withdrawn.
You can transfer a maximum Rs 10,000 per transaction and Rs 25,000 per account in a day. Also, the amount per recipient cannot exceed Rs 25,000 in a month.

Ram Jethmalani sends FM a black money stinkerRam Jethmalani sends Arun Jaitley a black money stinker
Mail Today Bureau        Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 11:32 IST
Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has come under scathing attack from senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani, who has alleged that the finance minister was not keen for the truth to emerge regarding the government's efforts to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks.
In a stinging letter to Jaitley, the veteran lawyer has questioned the government's inability to disclose the names of Indians holding illegal foreign bank accounts because of bilateral double taxation avoidance treaties (DTAT). Jethmalani said the government's petition citing DTATs coming in the way of disclosing names is "one of the most ill advised steps taken".
"The DTAT or any equivalent document is not to be used and cannot be used. We are not dealing with persons or entities who by the law of India and Germany are liable to pay tax in both countries on the same income," argued Jethmalani, who is a petitioner in the Supreme Court on the black money issue.
"The Germans never spoke of the DTAT. Our people deliberately brought it in as a certain method of rendering the entire investigation futile and making our corrupt rulers escape arrest and prosecution," he said.
He questioned Jaitley's determination to get the culprits apprehended or even identified. The noted lawyer said about 18 names were given to him under orders of the Supreme Court but the list did not include people like Hasan Ali Khan, a businessman who was investigated for alleged money laundering.
"It is most unfortunate that you continue to act only on DTATS," he said.
Jethmalani also accused Jaitley of inaction on the issue even when he was leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha.
"You were the leader of opposition when the Germans announced that they were willing to share the names with any friendly country without cost or condition," he said, adding that it was his (Jaitley's) duty as leader of opposition to establish contact with the Germans to get the names as the government of the day made no move for obvious reasons.
He claimed that the previous UPA government did not make any move as, in all likelihood, bigwigs in the erstwhile ruling Congress party were involved.
In his letter, Jethmalani went on to attack the finance minister by saying: "I strongly suspect that your conduct shows that you too like many others do not want the truth to come out. Your public statements… are product of a troubled conscience and mental confusion, a deadly combination."
The senior lawyer cited replies given by Jaitley in Parliament in July. "You are persistent in the fraud as your answers in the Rajya Sabha to questions on 8th and 15th July clearly show," he said. Jaitley had talked about a positive response from Swizz authorities to some requests for disclosing the names of account holders subject to the confidentiality clause in the double tax avoidance convention.
In another adverse commentary on Jaitley, Jethmalani wrote: "You do not know much of criminal law and hardly anything about complex criminal investigations, particularly the kind involved in the present case. You do not have the humility to learn from your intellectual and moral superiors."
Jethmalani, who was expelled from the BJP earlier this year, referred to Jaitley's recent ill health and said: "You recently had a near brush with death. This should have created in you a change in your moral makeup and devotion to the nation. You are destroying what Modiji has built during the last election campaign."
He signed off by writing: "You are out to help the biggest criminals to escape. "Please do not send names you have got from the Germans to the Swiss. Send them to the SIT so they can tell them what to do. The Supreme Court is monitoring the investigation, it is not an investigating agency," he said.

Ebola Cases Top 10 000Ebola Cases Top 10,000: WHO

* Bulk of cases in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone
* Total includes new cases in Mali, U.S.
* WHO warns that Ebola coming closer to Ivory Coast
GENEVA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The death toll from the Ebola epidemic rose to 4,922 out of 10,141 known cases in eight countries through Oct. 23, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday.
The virus, which reached Mali through a two-year-old girl who died on Friday, now threatens Ivory Coast, having infected people virtually all along its borders with Guinea and Liberia.
Ivory Coast is the world's biggest cocoa producer. The Ebola outbreak has hurt the economic growth that has been raising living standards in the region.
The three worst-hit countries of West Africa -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- account for the bulk of the world's worst Ebola outbreak, recording 4,912 deaths out of 10,114 cases, the WHO said in its update.
The overall figures include outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal, deemed by the WHO to be now over, as well as isolated cases in Spain, the United States and a single case in Mali.
But the true toll may be three times as much: by a factor of 1.5 in Guinea, 2 in Sierra Leone and 2.5 in Liberia, while the death rate is thought to be about 70 percent of all cases.
The WHO has said that many families are keeping infected people at home rather than putting them into isolation in treatment centers, some of which have refused patients due to a lack of beds and basic supplies.
The U.N. agency, sounding an ominous note, said that out of the eight districts of Liberia and Guinea sharing a border with Ivory Coast, only two have yet to report confirmed or probable Ebola cases.
It has also said trials of Ebola vaccines could begin in West Africa in December, a month earlier than expected, and hundreds of thousands of doses should be available for use by the middle of next year.
The WHO says 15 African states including Ivory Coast are at highest risk of the deadly virus being imported.
In the last 10 days it sent teams to both priority Mali and Ivory Coast to help national authorities gear up their capacity to detect and treat potential cases. Four WHO experts are traveling this weekend to Mali to reinforce the team there.
The agency warned on Friday that many people in Mali had potentially been exposed to the virus because the little girl was taken across the country while ill. Some 43 people with whom she was in contact, including 10 health care workers, are being monitored for symptoms that include fever.
In all, 450 health care workers have been infected to date -- including one in Spain and three in the United States -- leading to the death of 244 of them, the WHO said.
"At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs (health care workers) are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk."
A medical worker quarantined in New Jersey on her return from treating Ebola victims in West Africa was being evaluated in a hospital isolation ward on Saturday after new contagion-control safeguards were imposed for America's biggest urban center.
Isolation wards have been used for medical personnel returning from Ebola zones since Craig Spencer, a doctor who treated patients in Guinea for a month, came back to New York City infected.
"The patient is currently in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, one of eight New York State hospitals that have been designated to treat patients with Ebola Virus Disease. Possible contacts are being identified and followed up," WHO said. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Mark Heinrich/Ruth Pitchford)

Kharif paddy  pulses severely hit in TelanganaKharif paddy, pulses severely hit in Telangana
K V Kurmanath
Officials are worried about further losses in the next two weeks
Hyderabad, Oct 26:  
With the kharif season coming to a close, Telangana has registered a significant drop in acreage of paddy and pulses. Official figures show a decline of 20 per cent in paddy and a 30 per cent in pulses acreage.
Rain brings hope With the State struggling hard to meet the power requirements at the fag end of the season, officials are worried about further losses in the next two weeks. But widespread rains in several districts on Saturday rekindled hopes.
As a result of drop in paddy and red gram and green gram acreage, foodgrains production is expected to be hit in the State. The total area under foodgrains has come down to 17 lakh hectares (ha), according to the provisional figures available with the Agriculture Department. This is about 30 per cent less than the season average of 20 lakh ha.
The total pulses’ area has been declined to 3.5 lakh ha against the normal area of 5 lakh ha. The other crops that witnessed lesser acreage this season include castor, jowar, chillies and turmeric.
Cotton proves dependable
Cotton, however, has shown an increase of 9 per cent. Cotton cultivation, though not recommended in the rain-fed State, is generally grown in 15 lakh ha during the season. A relatively resilient crop, cotton is seen as a dependable crop by the farmers.
“The acreage has grown up to 16.76 lakh hectares this year notwithstanding the initial fears. This is higher than last year’s figure of 16.30 lakh hectares. Pickings have begun in most parts,” an official from the Ministry told BusinessLine.
Soyabean, which is grown in a little over one lakh hectares, has shown a significant increase as the acreage cross the 2.7-lakh ha mark. The area of sugarcane too went up to 44,700 ha from the average of 38,400 ha. Maize too made marginal gains from the average figure of 4.66 lakh ha.

Financial regulators to issue warning against IS linksNew Delhi, October 26, 2014

Financial regulators to issue warning against IS links
PTI
financial and business service
Concerned over an estimated $1 million a day funding received by Islamic State, the Financial Action Task Force (FTAF) has asked all countries, including India, to prevent the terror group from tapping their financial systems.
Financial sector regulators in India, including Sebi for capital markets and RBI for banking sector, are likely to soon issue similar warnings to caution institutions operating under their respective jurisdictions to put in place necessary safeguards.
Sanctions are already in place by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) against entities linked to the Islamic State. However, it is for the first time that a public statement has been issued against this terror group by FATF, an inter-governmental grouping that sets global financial sector regulatory standards to tackle money laundering and terror financing activities.
In line with the UNSC sanctions, Sebi has asked market entities to stay cautious about any funds or entities linked to this terror group finding their way to Indian capital markets.
Following the FATF statement, Sebi and RBI among other regulatory agencies would now issue separate warnings to the entities regulated by them against dealing with ISIL—linked firms, individuals or funds.
While no instance of any IS-linked activities in the Indian markets has come to the fore so far, the regulator has informed stock exchanges about the updated al-Qaeda sanctions list of the UNSC.
Islamic State is estimated to be earning as much as $1 million every day from oil sales, as per the U.S. Treasury Department.
The warning from the FATF comes at a time when the terror group is spreading its reach in the Middle East and the UNSC raising red flag about the terror group’s funding activities.
In order to combat the threat posed by IS, the FATF on Friday reiterated “the need for all countries to fully implement the FATF standards to combat terrorist financing and calls on all countries to take steps to prevent ISIL from accessing their financial systems.”
According to FATF, the fight against IS urgently needs more insight into sources and methods of their funding. India, the United States and Japan are among the 34 member jurisdictions of the FATF.

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — A growing sense of desperation is fueling a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from western Myanmar, with the number who have fled by boat since communal violence broke out two years ago now topping 100,000, a leading expert said Saturday.
Chris Lewa, director of the nonprofit advocacy group Arakan Project, said there has been a huge surge since Oct. 15, with an average of 900 people per day piling into cargo ships parked off Rakhine state.
That's nearly 10,000 in less than two weeks, she noted, one of the biggest spikes yet.
Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 50 million that only recently emerged from half a century of military rule, has an estimated 1.3 million Rohingya. Though many of their families arrived from neighboring Bangladesh generations ago, almost all have been denied citizenship. In the last two years, attacks by Buddhist mobs have left hundreds dead and 140,000 trapped in camps, where they live without access to adequate health care, education or jobs.
Lewa, who has teams monitoring embarkation points, is considered the leading authority on the number of fleeing Rohingya. But boats are now shoving off from more and more places, she said, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of how many are leaving.
"The real number may be higher," Lewa said.
She said some Rohingya families have received phone calls notifying them that ships from the latest exodus have started arriving in neighboring Thailand, where passengers often are brought to jungle camps, facing extortion and beatings until relatives come up with enough money to win their release.
From there they usually travel to Malaysia or other countries, but, still stateless, their futures remain bleak.
In Myanmar, the vast majority live in the northern tip of Rakhine state, where an aggressive campaign by authorities in recent months to register family members and officially categorize them as "Bengalis" — implying they are illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh — has aggravated their situation.
According to villagers contacted by The Associated Press, some were confined to their villages for weeks at a time for refusing to take part in the "verification" process, while others were beaten or arrested.
More recently, dozens of men were detained for having alleged ties to the militant Rohingya Solidarity Organization, or RSO, said Khin Maung Win, a resident from Maungdaw township, adding that several reportedly were beaten or tortured during their arrests or while in detention.
Lewa said three of the men died.
"Our team is becoming more and more convinced that this campaign of arbitrary arrests is aimed at triggering departures," she said.
Rakhine state spokesman Win Myaing denied any knowledge of arrests or abuse.
"There's nothing happening up there," he said. "There are no arrests of suspects of RSO. I haven't heard anything like that."
Every year, the festival of Eid al-Adha, which was celebrated by Muslims worldwide early this month, marks the beginning of a large exodus of Rohingya, in part due to calmer seas but also because it is a chance to spend time with family and friends.
But there seems to be a growing sense of desperation this year, with numbers nearly double from the same period in 2013.
Lewa said a number of Rohingya also were moving overland to Bangladesh and on to India and Nepal.
The United Nations, which has labeled the Rohingya one of the most persecuted religious minorities in the world, earlier this year confirmed figures provided by Lewa about a massive exodus that began after communal violence broke out in June 2012, targeting mainly Rohingya.
With the latest departures, Lewa estimates the total number of fleeing Rohingya to be more than 100,000.
It was not immediately clear where the newest arrivals were landing.

Describing the frequent special discount fare offers by domestic carriers as "non-existent", the Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday urged regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to permit such schemes.
"We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger," APAI president D Sidhakara Reddy said in a communication to the DGCA.
In the latest instance over the last few weeks, budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday launched its 'Diwali Dhamaka' sale , with one-way fares starting as low as Rs.899 (including taxes).
According to the company, tickets can be booked October 21-26, 2014 for travel between November 1 to December 15, 2014.
" SpiceJet has fundamentally changed the air travel paradigm in India this year, with offers that are frequent and often lower than train fares," chief operating officer Sanjiv Kapoor said announcing the scheme.
"We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline's portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings," Reddy said.
Pointing out that it has become routine by airlines to announce such schemes almost once every 10-15 days, their aim appears to achieve cheap publicity for the airline, APAI said.
The association asked the regulator whether the carriers inform about the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with the DGCA showing the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered under the bucket pricing method.
"If they are not, then what action do you propose for not following the procedure?" APAI asked in its letter.
Reddy also said the association would explore the Right to Information (RTI) route if the DGCA did not respond in the matter.

Dilma Rousseff becomes Brazils new President for secondtermPrint

By: Associated Press | Rio De Janeiro | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:30 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 12:37 pm
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and center-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read  “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps _ those who thought only continued…

Someone Drove Through The Disputed Oklahoma Ten Commandments Monument And Smashed It To Piecesreddit
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Someone drove up a ramp near the Oklahoma Capitol steps overnight and into a disputed granite monument of the Ten Commandments, smashing it to pieces in an apparent act of vandalism, authorities said.
Oklahoma Highway Patrol Capt. George Brown said the person abandoned the car and fled the scene after destroying the monument Thursday night, and that investigators are searching the sedan for clues. He said he didn't know if there were any witnesses, but that investigators are reviewing security video.
The 6-foot-tall monument was erected in 2012 with the blessing of Oklahoma's conservative Legislature. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma has been suing to have it removed, arguing that it violates the state constitution and could be seen as a state endorsement of a religion.
"We consider this an act of violence against the state of Oklahoma," said Republican state Rep. Mike Ritze, of Broken Arrow, whose family spent nearly $10,000 having the monument erected. "We are obviously shocked and dismayed, but we're not discouraged," he said, vowing to have it rebuilt.
Gov. Mary Fallin called it an "appalling" act of vandalism and volunteered to help raise private funds to restore it.
The ACLU sued on behalf of a Norman minister and others who allege the monument's location violates the state constitution's ban on using public property to support "any sect, church, denomination or system of religion."
A judge ruled last month that the monument does not violate the state constitution, and ACLU attorneys filed an appeal with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Ryan Kiesel, the ACLU of Oklahoma's executive director, said he and his clients are "outraged" that the monument was vandalized.
"To see the Ten Commandments desecrated by vandals is highly offensive to them as people of faith," Kiesel said.
The monument's placement has led others to seek their own on the Capitol grounds, including a satanic group that earlier this year unveiled designs for a 7-foot-tall statue of Satan. Other requests have been made from a Hindu leader in Nevada and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
It is appalling that this monument was attacked. Those who committed this crime will be caught & held responsible pic.twitter.com/SkYiyUwO8W

UK ends 13-year war in AfghanistanBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 26, 2014 6:17 pm
The UK on Sunday handed over its last base in Afghanistan to the Afghan forces, marking an official end to the 13-year-long combat operations that claimed over 450 British lives in the war-torn country.
“It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future,” UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said.
The Union Jack was lowered at a ceremony in Camp Bastion in Helmand province, bringing an end to the 13-year war in Afghanistan that has claimed 453 British servicemen and women’s lives.
All British troops will leave Camp Bastion within days, handing over the huge base to Afghan troops.
“Our armed forces’ tremendous sacrifice laid the foundations for a strong Afghan security force, set the security context that enabled the first democratic transition of power in the country’s history, and stopped it being a launch pad for terrorist attacks in the UK,” Fallon added.
Camp Bastion has been the British troops’ main Afghan base since 2006.
The last US Marines unit in Afghanistan also ended its combat operations with the handover of nearby Camp Leatherneck. The US has lost 2,349 personnel in Afghanistan.
Thousands of soldiers have returned to Britain in recent months, leaving only a few hundred members of the Armed Forces operating in the country. Tonnes of equipment have been repatriated, to meet the deadline of ending combat operations by the end of 2014.
A few dozen British military personnel will remain in Kabul to operate an officer training facility nicknamed ‘Sandhurst-in-the-Sand,’ as part of the continued support of the Afghan people. Special forces will continue to operate in the region.
Chief of the General Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter told the ‘Sunday Telegraph’ the handover of Camp Bastion would be significant “not least because of the sacrifice that so many people have made in Helmand”.
“They are going to have challenges, but I am absolutely confident that the majority of the population in central Helmand will be secured by Afghan forces,” he said.
As the American-led forces pull out of bases across Afghanistan, they have faced attack after attack, with some ground attacks being launched on the day of departure.
Some security experts believe that the Taliban is trying to establish their superiority as soon as coalition forces depart.
The Taliban have carried out a series of operations in Helmand this summer, attacking in areas such as Sangin and Nad-e Ali, where British soldiers spent months battling to maintain control.

Kochi Oct 26:  
Kerala Fisheries Minister K.Babu has expressed concern over the deep sea fishing policy report, saying that ‘it is harmful to traditional fisher folk in the country’.
The suggestions in the report prepared by the B.Meenakumari Commission would badly affect the lives of fishermen. He said that new policies of the Union Government would destroy the fisheries sector and the State Government would convey its concern to the Centre shortly.
The Minister was speaking after laying the foundation stone for setting up of an Ocean Studies Campus of Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) at Puthuvypeen.
Emphasising the need for serious research on climate change, global warming, cyclones etc, the Minister hoped that the proposed Ocean Studies Campus of KUFOS would provide adequate human resources in the sector to address these problems. The campus would be made a centre of excellence in ocean studies, with international standards.
Inaugurating a one-day workshop for shrimp farmers, K V Thomas MP said that Vanammei shrimp culture would uplift living standards of fish farmers.

Telangana Budget session to commence from Nov 5Telangana Budget session to commence from Nov 5
V.Rishi Kumar
DIPR Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao
Hyderabad, Oct. 25:  
The maiden budget session of the Telangana Assembly to be convened from November 5 will provide an opportunity for the K Chandrasekhar Rao Government to outline the development agenda amidst several contentious inter-State issues.
A decision to convene the Assembly was finalised during late on Friday evening.
The session being held after couple of postponements is also likely to be stormy as it comes at time when the two new states of Telangana and residual Andhra Pradesh have several inter-State issues that need to be resolved. Both the States do not see eye to eye on many issues, particularly sharing of power and water resources, fee reimbursement for students among various other concerns.
The State Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had constituted 14 task force teams to facilitate the budget making process with the objective of outlining the Government agenda for the next five years rather than drafting a Budget for the remaining part of the year.
The interim Budget to be presented by the Finance Minister Etela Rajender will be first budget for the new State. Thus far, the Budget allocations have been based on vote-on-account passed by the unified Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly before the general elections and the bifurcation of the State.
During the recent Finance Commission meetings, the State has indicated the tax collections so far have not been as per initial projections post the division. There is also growing concern about small and medium companies registering their offices in AP, leading to loss of tax collection.
The opposition parties, the Congress, Telugu Desam Party are seeking to corner the Government particularly with regard to severe power crisis the State is faced with. The opposition is gearing up to expose the State in the way it has handled the farm sector issues and supply of power where industries are faced with two day power holiday per week and domestic and commercial consumers are faced with huge power cuts.
Among other issues that are likely to be taken up during the Budget session include the crop loan waiver estimated to be about Rs 20,000 crore. The task force teams have come up with their suggestions to ensure inclusive growth by taking the feedback from the grassroot level.
While the session focus would be on budget and its proposals, the issues of power and water sharing between the two states will be among key areas where the opposition parties would like to corner the treasury benches.

Leftist Dilma Rousseff narrowly wins re-election in BrazilLeftist Dilma Rousseff narrowly wins re-election in Brazil
Though CM  I am afraid of taking decisions for fear of scrutiny: Bihar CM Jeetan RamManjhiBihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 28, 2014 2:45 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 2:49 am
Further stepping pressure on JD (U) leadership to “reinstate faith in his leadership amidst volley of recent criticism”, Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi seemed to take dig at top party leadership as he said that though he was “CM but is afraid of taking hard decisions for fear of scrutiny”. Manjhi, who looks bent on consolidating his position as an independent leader, took an indirect dig at his political detractors by “hoping that next chief minister also comes from Gaya”. Manjhi belongs to Mahkar village of Gaya.
Speaking at a village school function at Manpur, Gaya on Sunday evening, Manjhi talked about building decision making qualities in students. “Though I am chief minister now, I am afraid of taking tough decision foe fear of scrutiny and criticism. If you get demoralised, it hampers your decision making power”. Though he did not refer to his predecessor Nitish Kumar, Manjhi is reportedly upset with the state government “being forced to revoke suspension” Patna Medical College and Hospital medical superintendent, who was suspended for “negligence in duty” in treatment of those injured during Dussehra Gandhi Maidan stampede. Manjhi reportedly had to buckle under pressure of top JD (U) leadership, more so after Indian Medical Association’ tough stand after Manjhi’s “chop off hands of doctors if found negligent about treatment of the poor”
Speaking at another function in Gaya, Manjhi seemed to balance his political stance as he praised both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar for taking up cause of social justice and “standing up for the oppressed”.
Manjhi’s past few statements regarding his growing assertion as the dalit face of the party has caused confusion iJD (U) cadre among party’s going back to leadership of Nitish Kumar, who will start his Sampark Yatra from West Champaran freshly take up special category status demand to mount pressure on NDA government and also get back to focus in state and national politics.

Market likely to remain bullish in Samvat 2071Stock market likely to remain bullish in Samvat 2071
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 24, 2014  | 16:38 IST
Indian stock markets are likely to remain bullish during the current Hindu calendar year (Samvat 2071) and investors would continue to reap rich gains, say experts.
This year has been euphoric for markets . Apart from the last one month or so, overseas investors have been buying heavily.
"Now, that markets have been acquiring higher peaks, we can see retail investors coming back gradually. We are likely to witness a rise in retail flow into the market this year. That will be healthy for the market as so far Indian market is totally dependent on the FII money," said S K Goel, Director, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"Expect the market to remain bullish from this Samvat to the next but volatility is likely to continue. In this rally so far, IT, pharma, auto consumer, banking had been the leaders and we expect these sectors to remain bullish. Cement and infra would do well in the coming year considering the fact that Modi government's focus has been on building new cities," he added.
The Sensex gained 5,590.42 points, or 26.37 per cent, in the entire Samvat 2070.
Analysts said that currently we are in a bull-market and stocks will remain as best asset-class in Samvat 2071, provided global markets remain stable.
BJP's win in two state elections (Maharashtra and Haryana) has raised expectations of additional reforms, they said.
Experts said markets have given a thumbs up to this win as now the new government would find it much easier to pass reform bills in the Rajya Sabha.
"With quick policy decision making and reforms clearances, we expect the new government to maintain and build higher confidence for FII investors," an expert said.
With stable macros and policy push by the Modi government, Indian markets should be able to continue doing good. Reforms at the Centre are the key for the next leg of rally, say analysts.
"This Samvat year would be positive for markets as macroeconomic data have been positive and there are expectation that slew of reforms would greet investors during this period," said Alex Matthews, Geojit BNP, Research Head.
Some tension at the borders can impact the market if they worsen from where they are today, he added.

The limitations of diplomatic immunityUpdated: October 25, 2014 02:27 IST
The limitations of diplomatic immunity

In this September 30, 2014 photo, Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. The lawsuit against Mr. Modi argues that victims of the communal violence in Gujarat were entitled to compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages.

The U.S.-based lawsuit filed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi is progressing
A federal court in New York has signalled its intention to take forward a lawsuit filed in the U.S. against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by issuing an order on October 21 calling on the plaintiffs to explain why Mr. Modi was not immune from prosecution for allegedly presiding over the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom that took place in Gujarat.
U.S. Judge Analisa Torres asked the American Justice Center (AJC), a non-profit human rights organisation, to respond to a “suggestion of immunity,” submitted to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 19 by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Mr. Bharara was prompted to do so by a September 30 letter from the State Department, which argued that “a prompt dismissal of the proceedings,” could have “significant policy implications.”
The lawsuit against Mr. Modi filed by the AJC argues that under the Alien Tort statutes the plaintiffs including “Asif,” “Jane Doe,” and multiple “John Doe’s,” said to be victims of the communal violence in Gujarat, were entitled to compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages and a declaration that Mr. Modi’s alleged conduct “amounted to ‘Genocide’” according to court documents.
Last month, even as Mr. Modi was attending numerous meetings with business and community leaders in New York City and then a summit meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, the District Court issued a summons against the Prime Minister to answer the charges made against him.
Despite the AJC offering $10,000 for the serving of the summons to Mr. Modi, this step was apparently not achieved while the Prime Minister was in the U.S., and at that time Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told The Hindu that the Indian leader was “ring-fenced.”
Senior U.S. administration officials were quick to clarify that the summons could not be delivered to him while he was in the U.S. and he was immune from prosecution at this time because “as a general legal principle, sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from suits in American courts. Sitting heads of government also enjoy personal inviolability while in the U.S., which means they cannot be personally handed or delivered papers… to begin the process of a lawsuit.”
The service of the summons, however, may depend on whether the U.S. court has subject-matter jurisdiction for the complaint, and it is possible that if the alleged violations of certain laws took place at a time before the defendant in the case became a head of government, then the defendant may neither be personally inviolable nor immune.
Notably, the State Department letter on the “suggestion of immunity” for Mr. Modi does not comment on the merits of the case against the Prime Minister, and only emphasises his immunity from prosecution under U.S. common law principles and customary international law, that too only “while in office.”
The AJC has since argued that Mr. Bharara’s filing was “not binding on the court, [as] the human rights violations committed by Mr. Modi before becoming Prime Minister and as Chief Minister of Gujarat are not immune.” AJC legal adviser Gurpatwant Singh Pannun added that the federal court therefore had jurisdiction to hold Mr. Modi accountable under the Alien Tort Claims Act and Torture Victims Protection Act.
A question that may be critical to the unravelling of the legal web around the immunity issue is the U.S. government’s view on whether immunity enjoyed at the present time by a foreign dignitary is retroactive, or applies to past acts as well, when that dignitary was not a head of government.
An earlier diplomatic row
In the past, the U.S. State Department has already spelt out its view on this matter in another high-profile case of a legal dispute concerning India — the criminal charges filed against Devyani Khobragade, former Indian Deputy Consul General who was arrested on the streets of New York last December and strip-searched in custody, sparking off a massive diplomatic row between the two countries. In that case, days after Ms Khobragade’s arrest, Department spokesperson Marie Harf said that in the event that the senior Indian diplomat was successfully reassigned to the United Nations and thus given full diplomatic immunity from prosecution, such immunity would only apply to her from the day on which she was officially confirmed to her new post and not retroactively.
“Generally speaking, if there’s a change in immunity… because of a different diplomatic status that immunity would start on the date it’s conferred,” Ms. Harf said on the record at the time.
Yet if that is in fact what U.S. law dictates, or that is what the current administration’s position is, then it may find little room for manoeuvre to argue for personal inviolability and immunity from subsequent prosecution for Mr. Modi for a complaint based on acts that he was said to have committed more than a decade before he became India’s Prime Minister.
The plaintiffs in the case appear not to be unaware of this point, and this week Mr. Pannun said, “The selective and arbitrary approach of the U.S. Department of Justice on the issue of immunity to foreign leaders will be the key factor in challenging the immunity to PM Modi.”

Writing about Clean India a service to nation: Modi tells mediaPrint
New Delhi, Oct 25 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday thanked the media for creating awareness about the Clean India Campaign, adding that the members of the fourth estate were doing a service to the nation by writing about it.
In his first formal interaction with the media after becoming the prime minister, Modi recounted his relations with the press as a party worker, and then talked about his pet Clean India Campaign.
"I am reading so many articles on clean India. Electronic and social media is also doing a comprehensive debate on it. This is a service to the nation. This is a good example of how the media can play a constructive role," Modi said at the media meet at the BJP headquarters here.
"I know 80 percent of it is criticism, but it is spreading awareness on an issue which has tainted India's image in the world," Modi said referring to his cleanliness campaign.
He said that by virtue of these writings, an environment was being created where citizens were coming together to work hand-in-hand with the government.
"Since independence, it was believed that the government would do everything. But the media is encouraging people to work for the nation. There is now an environment where citizens are realising that all have to work together," Modi said.
"This could not have happened if just the prime minister had taken a broom in his hand," he said.
He said he has had a close association with the media and that he wants to strengthen it.
"When I interact with the media, I not only get information, but I also get a vision," Modi said.
He said that he used to once help with the seating arrangement at media meets and used to interact freely with the press, and even though times have now changed, he was looking for ways to deepen his old ties with the media.

Weve no time please  were childrenUpdated: October 26, 2014 01:00 IST
We’ve no time please, we’re children
Kermaan Satha Munshi
children
Children are being increasingly deprived of the time, space and freedom to play and learn at their own pace. Indeed, this should be deemed to be their birthright.
My own seven-year-old daughter recently asked me for a hand sanitiser to take to school, to “quickly clean hands before I open my dabba”. “Why quickly?” I asked. It took me some time to realise that she was in fact responding to my repeated questions on why she was often not finishing her lunch in school. “If we go down to wash our hands, we do not have enough time to eat. Sometimes I have just a couple of bites and the bell rings.”
“But what about playtime?” “We aren’t allowed to go out of the class — if we eat fast, we can play ‘stone-paper-scissor’.”
That explained the unfinished food, the loss of weight and appetite, and the almost permanent slouch I was noticing in my child since the start of the academic year.
A couple of students who come to me for English classes reported similar treatment being meted out to them in their respective upscale CBSE schools. I write from Central India, but the situation must be similar in other parts of the country, where schools are systematically over-scheduling kids when it comes to academics and co-curricular activities (read CCE worksheets, “project work”, “formative and summative assessments” and sundry competitions), and shrinking recess hours to accommodate vast and ambitious curriculums that “raise the bar of learning”.
Children have their own sense of justice, and the feeling of revolt at being play-deprived is palpable when they open up to me. School managements, often with the active collaboration of ill-informed and overambitious parents, have been insidiously but determinedly robbing our children of a most basic need to play, explore, create and chill, at their own time, in their own space. We are talking of thousands of schools, pre-schools, “day-care” and “activity centres” across India that cite complex theories of learning, show brilliant images of neural connections develop at breakneck speed till the age of six, quote educationists from Maria Montessori to Howard Gardner to justify the need to shove new concepts down the throats of millions of children. Parents are spoilt for choice — i-math, calligraphy, sanskaar or the ubiquitous art and craft — and convinced they are raising a generation of child prodigies by minutely chalking out every moment of their day.
By depriving our children of physical space, good old sand pits and water play with buckets and shovels, we are robbing them of the only window they have to expand their awareness of space, develop their motor reflexes, their sense of touch and their own emotional space. No instructions are needed for sand and water play, and yet these, along with moulding play dough, constitute the most therapeutic of all activities. Through free play — and here I am talking good old catch-catch, kho-kho, kabaddi or hopscotch — they learn to distinguish between fair and unfair play, to take risks and to resolve conflicts, to form teams and show empathy. Such kids are clever, not cunning, non-violent yet not risk-averse!
What is a childhood without cuts, bruises, stained or torn clothes and a few tears? If kids do not fall, how will they learn to pick themselves up? Are school managements and teachers catering to overprotective parents or to their own need to avoid a mess and the hassle of managing turbulent tots? In either case, they shouldn’t be running schools in the first place. If kids are not given the time to share goodies and ideas over relaxed meals, how will they ever develop social skills? Authentic interaction rather than instruction is what hones social skills. What better place than a school where peers and resources are aplenty!
Finally, what of the child’s mental space? To get those great grades, answers or keywords are dictated in notebooks which kids regurgitate on their worksheets. Students are thus being robbed of the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them, of the ability to think on their feet, to organise their thoughts and use their own language and logic. How will this generation “Make in India” when they cannot even string up a decent sentence together on their own.
Unarmed and unmasked, the heartless robbers pursue their heist in broad daylight, relentlessly robbing our children of the time, space and freedom to play and learn at their pace, a freedom that should be every child’s birthright. Children do not have a voice, and schools, ministries of education and sometimes parents do not have a heart. And so the burglary goes on unchecked.
When will we realise that children do not just twiddle their thumbs and waste away if given some downtime? They may daydream, draw or doodle, but they are also learning. They may kick, hop, skip, fall, fight and make up, but they are still learning. Please let them learn. Please let them play.

The Andhra Pradesh Government has decided to increase the coffee plantation acreage to one lakh hectares from the present 58,000 hectares and increase productivity.
Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has asked the officials to increasing the productivity in the State which is very low at 170 kg a hectare (in the Visakhapatnam agency area) as against 700 kg in the neighbouring Karnataka.
Tribals take care of cultivation in about 55,000 hectares.
In a review meeting held on Sunday, the Chief Minister said the officials should introduce the best practices in plantation in order to increase productivity and increase incomes.
Despite favourable climatic conditions, the State was not able to produce more because of the obsolete farming and management practices.
The Chief Minister asked the officials to study the best practices and deploy technological solutions to improve the output and make the State the top producer of coffee in the country. “Besides increasing the incomes of tribals, it will also help earn the State a good branding,” he said.

Crude oil prices mixed in Asian tradeCrude oil prices mixed in Asian trade

Singapore, Oct 27:  
Oil was mixed in Asian trade today but remained subdued with no signs that the world’s key crude producers will cut output in the face of a supply glut, analysts said.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in December was up one cent at $81.02 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade, reversing earlier losses, while Brent crude for December delivery eased 25 cents to $85.88.
Both contracts were down on Friday, resuming their slide following a rebound the day before as traders shrugged off reports of a supply cutback in September by oil kingpin Saudi Arabia.
Production cut
World oil prices have fallen by a quarter since June as excess supply and weaker demand led to a glut in global markets, prompting some other exporters to call for cuts in output.
Analysts said however there are no indications of a production cut, and investors were looking for further developments during a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) next month.
“This year, global commercial oil stocks have surpassed the 5.0 billion barrel mark, growing at a rate of 1.16 million barrels per day on average over the first three quarters of this year,” British bank Barclays said in a research note.
“Such is the surplus in the market that is weighing on prices.”
It said that “the absence of an official policy statement, especially from Saudi Arabia in response to the fall in oil prices, has left a void in guidance“.
“This void has thus far been filled by a string of unsubstantiated assumptions in various press reports, as well as an extrapolation of the kingdom’s crude pricing and production data,” it added.
Phillip Futures said in a note that in the coming week, “it is unlikely that supply and demand factors would change’’.

Gold struggles as stronger equities hurt safe-haven appealGold struggles as stronger equities hurt safe-haven appeal
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 27:  
Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal’s safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened the risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks during the week-end were received calmly in the market.
Fed policy meet
Gold’s outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting, when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed’s two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank’s monetary policy.
“In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion,’’ Gan said.
Spot gold
Spot gold was steady at $1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn’t far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week. The metal’s losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain’s economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown.
Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher. Bullion traders were also closely watching investors’ positions in gold funds.
SPDR Gold Trust
SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the prices of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

Asian stocks rise as upbeat earnings  data sharpen risk appetiteAsian stocks rise as upbeat earnings, data sharpen risk appetite
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Oct 27:  
Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased recent global growth fears and sharpened the risk appetite.
The euro ticked higher but financial markets largely showed a muted reaction to Sunday’s health check results of euro zone banks, which painted a slightly brighter picture than expected.
Euro zone health checks
Of the euro zone’s 130 top lenders, 25 failed the health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank had said on Sunday.
Still, the test results were a sombre reminder that much work still remained, with the euro zone bank sector’s long-term attractiveness damaged by revelations of extra non-performing loans and hidden losses that will dent future profits.
“Banks face a significant challenge as the sector remains chronically unprofitable and must address their €879-billion exposure to non-performing loans as this will tie-up significant amount of capital,’’ accountancy firm KPMG noted.
The euro was up 0.1 per cent at $1.2699, edging away from a two-week low of $1.2614 hit last week in the wake of concerns about the bank tests.
Asian equities advanced, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 0.1 per cent and Tokyo’s Nikkei gaining 0.5 per cent.
“Stable housing starts in the US and solid Q3 GDP in the UK are likely to give the market some comfort after the recent concerns about global growth,’’ strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.
US home sales, UK economy
Data on Friday showed new US home sales rose to a six-year high, while Britain’s economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, still on track to outpace other advanced economies.
US stocks, recovering from a battering earlier in the month on worries about global growth losing momentum, gained on Friday on upbeat earnings from blue chips Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Easing worries over the possible spread of Ebola in the United States also helped.
The dollar traded at 108.08 yen after touching a three-week peak of 108.38, with a rise in US Treasury yields and improving risk appetite shoring up the greenback.
The Brazilian real’s non-deliverable forwards showed muted response so far after leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff's interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, but some traders think her re-election is already priced in as the real has fallen nearly 10 percent since early September.
Brent crude, spot gold
In commodities, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $85.81 a barrel, continuing a months-long rout as signs of rising global supply threatened deeper losses.
Iraq increased its oil supply in October and Libya’s output remains high, despite instability in both countries.
Gold edged lower as robust equity markets and strong US economic data dented demand for the precious metal.
Spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $1,230.97 an ounce.

Britain has ended combat operations in the Helmand province in Afghanistan, defense officials said Sunday.
They said U.K. troops have witnessed the lowering of the Union flag for the last time at the Camp Bastion complex in Helmand. U.S. and Afghan soldiers also observed the ceremony, which marked the end of operations for the Southwest Regional Command, a U.S. and U.K. coalition operating under NATO’s International Security Assistance Force, British officials said.

Camp Bastion has been the center of U.K. operations in Afghanistan since 2006. The handover of the base to Afghan control ends an important chapter in the 13-year Afghan campaign, which started after the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001.
UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement that the end of combat operations is being announced “with pride” and that Britain has helped give Afghanistan “the best possible chance of a stable future.”
But he told BBC’s Andrew Marr show that there is “no guarantee that Afghanistan is going to be stable and safe.”

He said the mission has succeeded in the sense that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists planning atrocities against Britain and the rest of Europe.
Fallon said Britain’s commitment to support Afghanistan will continue “through institutional development, the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, and development aid.”
Britain plans to withdraw its final combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year and is planning to give Afghan forces control of a base in Kandahar, the country’s second most populous city.

Panchkula (Haryana), Oct 26:  
Manohar Lal Khattar, a low-profile organisation man with active RSS background, was today sworn in as the Chief Minister of Haryana, where BJP has formed government for the first time on its own.
60-year-old Khattar, a first-time MLA from Karnal and a non-Jat leader known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was administered the oath along with nine ministers by Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki at a function here attended by a galaxy of BJP leaders including the PM, party chief Amit Shah, Union Ministers, Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states and veterans L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.
The six Cabinet ministers are Kavita Jain, state BJP president Ram Bilas Sharma, Abhimanyu, Om Parkash Dhankar, Anil Vij and Narbir Singh. Three others — Vikram Singh Thekedar, Krishan Kumar Bedi and Karan Dev Kamboj — are ministers of state (independent charge).
Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, whose party SAD had opposed the BJP during the Assembly elections despite being an NDA constituent, also attended the ceremony.
Among Union Ministers who were present were Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Power Minister Piyush Goyal, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Minister of Shipping and Transport Krishan Pal Gujjar, Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh and Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar.
Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states, including Madhya Pradesh’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vasundhara Raje from Rajasthan and Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel, were also present on the occasion.
In a departure from the past, the oath-taking function was held at Panchkula instead of Chandigarh, the common capital of both Haryana and Punjab.
Khattar is Haryana’s first non-Jat chief minister in nearly two decades. Jats have for long dominated politics in the State.

TOPICS
Haryana
The first non-Jat Chief Minister of Haryana in two decades, Mohan Lal Khattar was sworn in on Sunday in the presence of almost the entire frontline leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other BJP leaders at the function included L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Radha Mohan, Anant Kumar, Harsh Vardhan. Also present were Punjab Governor Shivraj Patil, Chief Ministers of States ruled by the BJP and its allies — Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Raman Singh, Anandiben Patel, Vasundhara Raje and Parkash Singh Badal.
This was the first time that the swearing-in ceremony was held in the ‘Mela ground’ in Panchkula instead of the customary Haryana Raj Bhavan.
Apart from Mr. Khattar, Ram Bilas Sharma, Captain Abhimanyu Singh, Om Prakash Dhankar, Anil Vij, Narvir Singh and Kavita Jain were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers; Bikram Singh Thekedar, Krishan Kumar and Karan Dev Kamboj were inducted as Ministers of State.
Shuns limelight
Known as a key strategist of the BJP who avoids the spotlight, Mr. Khattar has worked closely with Mr. Modi as his deputy, when the latter was in charge of Haryana affairs before becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Mr. Khattar is also said to have organised major relief activities during the Bhuj earthquake and managed the party’s campaign in a major portion of Varanasi during the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
The rupee ended on Monday a tad weaker at 61.31 against the dollar amid a narrow movement and weak domestic equity markets as European banks fail the stress test. However, improved sentiment from upbeat US data and smaller-than-feared capital shortfalls at European banks limited the fall in the rupee.
The domestic unit’s previous close was at 61.28 on Wednesday. Currency markets remained closed on Thursday and Friday on account of festival.
On Monday, the unit opened stronger at 61.19 after which it declined to 61.36 per dollar offset by weaker local shares and caution ahead of the US central bank decision.
The US Federal bank’s meeting ending on Wednesday is expected to end its government bond purchases, while giving accompanying assurances that it will respond if a global downturn threatens the US economy.
Analysts fear this could impact the emerging market currencies including the rupee adversely.
Call rates and Bonds
The interbank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short term funds from one another, ended at 8.25 per cent. Intra-day, it moved in the 8.00 per cent to 8.80 per cent range.
The yield on 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, ended at a year’s low of 8.31 per cent (last seen in September 2013) from the previous close of 8.35 per cent. The price of the security ended at Rs 100.53.

Hyderabad, Oct 27:  
There is a good news for those under VAT (value added tax) bracket in the cyclone-affected areas in north coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh as the State Government has extended the deadline for filing returns and paying taxes by a month.
Traders generally file their returns and pay taxes for the month of September by the end of October 31. They can now file their returns and pay taxes by November 30.
“No penalty and interest will be imposed for the delay in filing the returns and remitting taxes,” a Government release said here on Sunday.
The devastating HudHud cyclone had hit the normal life and business activity in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts for over 10 days.
Non-Plan expenditure cut
Meanwhile, the State’s Finance Ministry has decided to cut the non-Plan expenditure by 20 per cent. “However, there will not be any cut in respect of important expenditure in the form of salaries, professional services, contract services, stipends and scholarships,” the statement said.

Singapore introduces pre-departure video for migrant workersSingapore introduces ‘pre-departure video’ for migrant workers
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 27:  
A 14-minute ‘Pre-Departure Video’ has been made by the Singapore government for its migrant workers including Indians, explaining the proper employment practices and workers’ rights in the country to help them avoid getting duped by rogue agents and employers.
The video is one of the latest initiatives by the Singapore Manpower Ministry and Migrant Workers Centre (MWC) to make workers aware of their rights even before they step into the country, The Straits Times reported today.
“It is important now that we put in place this ’Pre-Departure Video’ to let them understand more about how and what and when they come to Singapore, what kind of rights they have,” said Yeo Guat Kwang, chairman of MWC.
“Because many of them told us before they come, they are already locked in with a big sum of money. And at the same time, they really do not know the terms and conditions that they will face when they come to Singapore and work,” he said.
MWC said that while some organisations can seek recourse for abuses that take place in Singapore, there is little they can do to recover overpaid agency fees done overseas.
A two-minute trailer of the “MWC Pre-Departure Video” was screened at a Diwali celebration event yesterday evening, which was attended by about 5,000 migrant workers who received free dinner, the report said.
The event was held at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Little India where the December 2013 riot involving migrant workers broke out.
MWC said it aims to make the videos available in the workers’ home countries, at places like the overseas Construction Skills Testing Centres.
In Singapore, the organisation plans to screen the videos in workers’ dormitories, and on board buses that ferry migrant workers to and from their dormitories and work places, the report said.
The video will be made available in the workers’ native languages, especially those from India, Bangladesh and China, who are often vulnerable to such employment malpractices, it added.

Brent drops $86 on Goldman price cut forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Electricity Act to get a facelift forreformThe government has proposed some key changes in the Electricty Act to remedy the situation and prevent the loss-ridden sector. (Reuters)
New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 10:57 am
With a decade’s existence of the Electricity Act of 2003 doing precious little in infusing efficiency and competition into the sector, the government has proposed some key changes in the Act to remedy the situation and prevent the loss-ridden sector, which is struggling to meet the reformist conditions of a financial restructuring package (FRP), from plumbing fresh depths.
The Union power ministry’s draft amendments to the Act, to be placed before the Cabinet soon, seek to separate “carriage from content”— meaning there will be separate licences for the wire business and the actual supply of electricity — with a provider-of-last-resort (POLR) facility, in what could eventually pave the way for open access for ordinary consumers.
Click here for graph
While open access for even bulk buyers, despite the 2003 Act providing for it, has rarely been achieved due to the prohibitive surcharges levied by the regulators, the ministry now proposes to make open access mandatory for buyers with a load of of 1 MW and more.
According to the draft amendments, to start with, the distribution network business and supply business of the extant discom in an area will be separated with dual licensing. While for the initial one year, there will only be functional separation with common ownership, subsequently, ownership will also be segregated and additional supply licences will be given to new players. Initially, the incumbent supply licencee only will have universal service obligation (USO). This means a consumer can resort to him if other suppliers fail. Over a period of three years from the grant of licence, each supplier will also have the USO, so that consumers are not deprived of supply, even while having the freedom to switch from one supplier to another, in search of cheaper and quality power.
Experts welcomed the move saying it’ll help bring down tariffs but added that to perform the role of POLR, licencees must be given incentives as in other countries where open access at the retail power distribution level is a reality. “POLR should have recourse to a Fund which the regulator will create by way of some levy to make good any loss that could be suffered by him due to this responsibility,” said Kameshwar Rao, leader, energy, utilities and mining at PwC India. Although there are concerns over a proposal to deprive bulk consumers using open access of the services of PLOR, Rao said since suppliers usually compete to rope in large consumers, it might not be problem.
What’s important is how ably various state regulators enforce the provisions, analysts said, citing the unimpressive track record of most of them in meeting obligations under the 2003 Act like reduction in cross-subsidisation and ensuring procurement from renewable energy continued…

Yahoo Movies Review: Happy New YearCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah, Jackie Shroff
Direction: Farah Khan
 
Rating: ***1/2
Will ‘Happy New Year’ make big money? Most definitely.  Are there instances that defy logic? Obviously. Does this multi-starrer entertain? Absolutely.
Farah Khan plays to her strengths. She has an ensemble cast that for the most part don’t disappoint. She has a convincing revenge saga, action sequences designed to thrill, plenty of song and dance, a generous dose of drama, a downplayed romantic track - all this is strung together with a thread of emotions by a director who knows her target audience.
 
The first half seemed to be moving very slowly; the setting-up took a lot of time and it wasn’t till Mohini’s (Deepika Padukone) entry that things seemed to really move along. I was pleasantly surprised that Deepika was used so well in this film. I was half expecting her to be a beautiful prop, where the men planned the heist and Shah Rukh hogged the limelight. In fact, in a film where romance just wasn’t integral to the general scheme of things, our heroine really did seem intrinsic to the narrative.
And that’s the other thing: Shah Rukh – Bollywood’s King of Romance, hardly spends any time trying to woo an object of affection. In fact, it is almost as if he is trying to reinvent himself as an action hero in this film – rippling muscles, a well-sculpted eight-pack and well-choreographed fights. Is Khan sending out a message to actors who think he is capable of only pulling-off mushy love stories?
It is commendable actually how well Farah’s cast works. The hero and heroine demand your complete attention when they are on screen. Bomani Irani is exceptional. Abhishek Bachchan and Sonu Sood deliver on their brief. Vivaan Shah is missable. But overall, it’s a competent cast.
It is a Farah Khan film, so may be you are willing to overlook some glaring loopholes – like the one where they’re trying to hide Nandu (Abhishek Bachchan) at parties but have absolutely no problem with him performing on stage. He’s exposed to way more people there but suddenly, that seems to be the least of their concerns. Okay, so it is cinematic liberty or whatever explanation the filmmakers will come up with.
What is more disappointing are the song and dance elements of the film. We are ready to overlook flaws in the narrative but except the ‘Lovely’ number, most of the other dances are completely average and I guess, that is explicable because our Indiawale can’t dance saala. But for the climax, I was expecting one jaw-dropping piece of choreography, at least by Deepika, even if the other members of the cast can’t be a part of it. Alas, that wasn’t to be.
Same goes for the music direction, Vishal-Shekhar’s music is disappointing to say the least. Not one hummable number with the exception of ‘Manwa Laage’.
Despite the ifs and buts ‘Happy New Year’ remains immensely watchable because Farah Khan had the audience break into whistles and claps at regular intervals. While I was looking for granular details and dissing the excesses, I couldn’t help but get a little emotional when they drum up the patriotic fervor at the end. I loved how she makes Shah Rukh pun on the lines from his previous films, and how Deepika gives the pep talk in typical ‘Chak De’ style.
 
Hell, yes, I quite enjoyed most of the film and especially, the end credits. It’s heartwarming to see the entire crew in Farah’s films. She manages to pack-in a little surprise in the credits too.
After a disastrous ‘Tees Maar Khan’, Farah Khan has definitely got her mojo back with ‘Happy New Year’.

Japanese auto major Nissan has announced that it would recall about 9,000 units of India-built compact car Micra and mid-size sedan Sunny to fix a faulty airbag. While the exercise is part of a global recall, this is fourth time that Nissan is facing issues in its India-made cars.
The latest recall will cover Micra and Sunny models, manufactured between 2008 and 2012, that use safety airbags made by its supplier Takata.
“Nissan is conducting a voluntary safety recall campaign on the certain Nissan models for Note, March/Micra, Sunny/Almera/Versa, Patrol and Cube, which are affected by a driver airbag concern that Takata reported to Nissan. Nissan plans to begin notifying customers soon. Nissan dealers will replace the driver airbag inflator with a correctly manufactured part at no cost to the customers for parts or labour,” said a company statement. Nissan had earlier faced issues in its models and announced recalls.
In May 2013, it recalled 22,188 units of Micra and Sunny to replace a faulty braking system. In February 2012, Nissan recalled 9,600 units of India-built Micra cars as part of the global recall of about 2.5 lakh units over faulty sensor.
Also during end 2010, Nissan had to carry out some changes in Micra cars produced for European markets, due to some technical issues relating to noise levels.
Nissan has been trying hard to boost its sales in the Indian market.
Even its latest small car Datsun failed to bring any big fortunes for the company.
However, after revamped dealer business, which was earlier outsourced, the company has aggressively been working on marketing strategies to increase sales.
During the first half of this fiscal, the company’s total passenger vehicle (PV) sales stood at 25,739 units, up 109 per cent when compared with a year-ago period.
Its share is just two per cent in the Indian PV market.
But, Nissan is the third largest exporter of cars from India with a share of 18 per cent in total PV exports. It exported over 55,500 units of Oragadam-built vehicles to various countries during H1.

From think tank to trade reports  IP on the boil  againFrom think tank to trade reports – IP on the boil, again
P. T. Jyothi Datta
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct. 26:  
Close to 10 years after the Indian Patents Act was amended in January 2005, discussions around intellectual property are on the boil again.
Last week, the Government set up a think tank to draft a national policy on intellectual property rights (IPR), and have a coordinated IP approach across various Government departments.
And while this is an opportunity for India to counter criticism from some global quarters on its IP enforcement track-record, the discussion is not without its concerns. From the composition of the think-tank to concerns on whether features in the amended Patents Act would be watered-down – questions abound. And transparency will be key, as the Government formulates its IP road-map and the think tank begins its meetings, the first of which is expected this week.
With Prime Minister Modi’s agenda of “make in India” as the canvas, the thrust will be on spurring innovation at home. While none may disagree with this, the challenge will be in protecting innovator rights, without for instance, whittling down public health concerns of citizens.
IP think tank member, senior advocate Pratibha Singh says, they would work as a support group, so the Government can have a coordinated approach and encourage more people to innovate and produce in India. Beyond this, the aim is to produce a single document outlining India’s IP achievements. These range from documenting measures taken involving online copyrights to communicating outcomes where foreign companies have in fact got injunctions in their favour.
Concerns on dilution
Healthworkers laud the presence of Justice Prabha Sridevan as Chairperson of the think tank, but express concern on the absence of other seasoned IP academicians. IP lawyers also worry on the fate of section 3 (d) of the amended Patents Act that disallows frivolous patents, unless the product shows greater efficacy.
Despite Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s assurances on the Patents Act, there is concern being expressed in IP circles on testimonies made by Arvind Subramanian, before he was appointed as India’s Chief Economic Adviser. He had termed some provisions in the Act as “problematic”, in submissions made in the U.S. earlier this year in the run up to two US trade reports.
The Special 301 report in April stopped short of further downgrading India, but nevertheless called for “out of cycle” reviews. This annual controversial report grades U.S. trade partners on their IP track-record.
The second report, by the U.S. International Trade Commission, is expected next month. Here, the U.S. evaluates the impact India’s trade policies have had on American businesses. And in the past, several U.S. trade and congress representatives have criticized India’s trade policies and IP enforcement, especially involving pharmaceuticals. In fact, they caution, the lack of IP protection would hold back both innovation and investment.
IP and innovation
Against this backdrop, a recent study – “Innovation, Intellectual Property, FDI & Economic Growth: A Scholarly Review of Findings”- by three academicians observed that while innovation was key to economic growth, suggesting strong IP rights were essential to provide incentives for innovation was “ambiguous” . Economists too are divided on the relationship between IP and foreign direct investment, it said, adding that stronger IP may induce “adverse welfare effects”.
A “careful and creative policy deliberation” involving multi-party dialogues is required, the report said, especially in markets where societies grapple with availability and access to healthcare and incentives for medical innovation. The report was commissioned by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, a body representing large Indian drug companies.
But as more conflicting, though well-reasoned viewpoints are put on the table, the think tank has its task cut out. But it’s going to be anything but easy.

Mathews not happy with timing of India tourTweet
0
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews has said his players have not had sufficient time to prepare thoroughly for the ODI series in India in November. Sri Lanka's players were in the middle of a break from international cricket but have been asked to fill the gap in the BCCI's calendar after West Indies abandoned their tour of India because of a payment structure dispute.
"The preparation for the series is not that great, we only had a few practice sessions especially with the weather interrupting," Mathews said. "It is not the ideal preparation for an Indian tour but we will do our best to prepare ourselves and take it as it comes."
After the home series against Pakistan in August, Sri Lanka were not due to play until they hosted England in late November. They were using the down time to rest some players who had been on the road since December 2013, and also began physical training sessions.

"We had a good break to improve our physical fitness; a good month and a half fitness session, and now we have to maintain that fitness," Mathews said. "I am sure during the Indian matches we won't be able to do strenuous training as we did in the past one and a half months, but we will try and maintain it and look at it positively."
"We were preparing for the England series because we knew that there weren't any tours coming before that. We were focused on a lot on fitness and we just started batting three days ago. We only had a few skill-training sessions. We needed to reach our peak levels during the England series but now that we've been thrown into a challenge we will try our best to be prepared as much as we can."
Sri Lanka will leave for India on October 28 and begin the tour with a practice game against India A in Mumbai on October 30, before the five-match ODI series starts on November 2.
"We will try to use the series to keep our momentum going as well as try and get our World Cup combinations right, that will be our main focal point," Mathews said. "Our World Cup preparations started from the Pakistan series. I need to make sure I get the team right before the series in New Zealand. The confidence level of the team is also pretty crucial as we move into the last few months of the World Cup but then again we need to look at our options and get the combinations right as well."
In the absence of Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal from the batting line-up, young players like Niroshan Dickwella and Ashan Priyanjan have an opportunity to book a place in the World Cup squad.
"We still haven't decided on our combination but all 15 are candidates to make it to the final 11," Mathews said. "The main idea is to look at the younger players as well. Niroshan is a really good player so we want to try him out."
Kumar Sangakkara is expected to keep wicket but he has a back niggle and Mathews said there is a possibility of Dickwella taking the gloves. "Sanga is having a small disc problem in his back, he was complaining of it, but it's nothing serious, he was getting better every day so hopefully he will be okay," Mathews said. "We might have to monitor him in the next few days, if he can he will keep otherwise we will have to play Dickwella."
With three openers in the squad - Tillakaratne Dilshan , Upul Tharanga and Kusal Perera - Mathews said they were looking at Tharanga as an opener, but if the need arose he could play in the middle. Injuries to fast bowlers Lasith Malinga and Suranga Lakmal forced the selectors to pick the uncapped Lahiru Gamage, a 26-year old medium-pacer.
"Champaka Ramanayake (from the coaching department) has recommended Lahiru because he has been working with him a lot and playing in A team matches and performing really well. We been hit by a few injuries so we want to see how Lahiru performs at top level," Mathews said. "It's a really good tour to prove himself, it's going to be tough. He is a seamer who bowls around mid 130s and gets in those yorkers as well. India is a tough tour and we all know that. He will find it difficult to bowl there but I am sure he will do well."
Mathews also said Rangana Herath was being rested for the series and that leaving out Ajantha Mendis was a "tactical move".
Mathews warned his team could not be complacent because the India captain MS Dhoni had been rested for the first three ODIs. "Dhoni is a great strength to the Indian team and if he is rested we have a very good chance but we still cannot be complacent because we all know that India is a difficult place to play cricket," he said. "We had bad experiences in the past. We will try and play positive and good cricket to win against them."
Sri Lanka have not won a bilateral ODI series in India. Their best performance was a drawn three-match series in 1997.

Reforming India faces an uncertain global situationReforming India faces an uncertain global situation
C. R. L. NARASIMHAN
Tweet
October 27, 2014:  
The linkage between the Indian economy and the global economy, always important for policymakers, has become pronounced recently. As the Modi-led NDA government embarks on some long-pending but overdue reforms in the petroleum and energy sectors, the dynamics of the global environment become particularly evident.
The decontrol of diesel prices, for long thought of but not implemented due mainly to political considerations, could be implemented at last as global oil prices took a tumble. What would normally be a controversial move became palatable as decontrol actually made retail diesel prices in India cheaper by more than Rs.3 a litre. With petrol prices having already been deregulated, the government has also rationalised the payment of LPG subsidies to the really needy.
The real test
However, the point needs to be made that if the unexpected fall in global prices has given a unique opportunity for reform, the real test for policymakers will come when oil prices move up from their present low levels. Real reform here would require them to stay away during different phases of the petroleum price cycle. Unless of course there are oil shocks that create crisis situations crying out for government interventions.
Right now, the fall in global prices has had an all-round beneficial effect in India — government finances will improve dramatically as petroleum subsidies get reduced. The fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of the GDP, once considered unrealistically ambitious, looks eminently achievable now. The current account deficit will fall to the extent the oil import bill is less. This, of course, assumes that the present trends in oil and other commodity prices will hold.
Declining oil prices
After declining gradually for three months, oil prices suddenly fell by almost $4 a barrel on October 14, the biggest single-day fall in nearly a year. The Brent crude international benchmark is substantially lower, trading now around $85. At its peak in June, a barrel had cost $115.
The dramatic decline in oil prices benefits India, but is obviously not so good for the oil producers. In normal situations, cheaper oil should boost global economic growth. This is because consumers in oil importing countries are more likely to spend the money quickly than cash-rich exporters. By boosting spending, cheaper oil can raise global output.
Do lower oil prices reflect weak demand or are caused by an abundant supply of crude? In the former case, weak demand may indicate economic slowdown. On the other hand, if the fall in oil prices is due to abundant supplies that may be potentially better news. Cheaper oil should boost spending and drive up the global economy.
The fact that there is no clear cut answer as to whether oil prices have fallen because of a slowdown in the world economy or because of abundant supplies is an indication of global uncertainty. This is something policymakers in India will have to reckon with. The global economy is certainly weak.
IMF’s outlook update
Just a fortnight ago, the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook update had forecast a slower than expected economic growth in the next year. India is one of the few countries that fared better in IMF’s assessment. Its growth rate, projected at well above 5 per cent for the current year, can go above 6 per cent next year, subject to India undertaking some much-needed reforms. But the IMF’s study has also pointed out that India’s potential to grow substantially higher is limited.
The U.S. economy, now firmly on the move up, and the U.K. are the only bright spots among developed economies. The European Union continues to be crisis-ridden. Japan’s GDP growth fell in the second quarter. But the biggest disappointment comes from two countries, which had hitherto spearheaded global economic growth — Germany and China.
Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe and indeed of much of the world, has cut its growth forecasts for this year and the next by more than 0.5 percentage point. Germany’s potential to stimulate global growth is enormous. It runs a huge current account surplus. Yet, the German government is loathing for embarking on any type of stimuli.
On the face of it, China’s economy chugs along with above-average growth rates. However, there are doubts about its financial sector and its inflated property market. However, the correlation between slower global growth and falling energy prices is not as watertight as it appears to be. There has also been a big increase in the supply of oil.
Where the oil prices will stabilise even over the short-term is still a matter of conjecture. In these circumstances, India — which imports 80 per cent of its oil requirements — needs a clear and proactive strategy to ride over the uncertain global outlook.

Gold prices fell 0.08 per cent to Rs 27,153 per 10 gram in futures trade today as participants reduced their positions largely in tandem with a weak trend overseas where precious metal dropped from a six-week high.

Likewise, the metal for delivery in February shed Rs 22, or 0.08 per cent, to Rs 27,370 per 10 gram in four lots.
Market analysts said eroding haven demand due to weakening trend in the overseas markets on investors expecting the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying programme this week, weighed on gold futures here.
Globally, gold fell by 0.30 per cent, to $1,227.51 an ounce in Singapore today.

NSEL crisis: Govt mulls Board changes for merged entityNSEL crisis: Govt mulls Board changes for merged entity
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
After ordering merger of crisis-hit NSEL with parent firm Financial Technologies to help affected investors get their dues, the Government is starting a process to assess compensation amounts and is also considering a proposal to make changes to the Board of the merged entity.
The Corporate Affairs Ministry last week unveiled a proposal to merge NSEL — which has been embroiled in an over Rs 5,600 crore payment crisis — with Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies (India) Ltd.
Sources said the Ministry would now start a process of assessing the compensation amount to be given to affected investors and a chartered accountant entity might be appointed in this regard.
Besides, the possibility of completely or partially replacing the FTIL board would also be looked into, sources said, adding that these proposals are being considered after taking into account suggestions made by the commodity sector regulator FMC (Forward Markets Commission) and other government departments.
This is the first time that the Ministry has invoked a clause in the Companies Act for a forced merger in the private sector due to “public interest”, while a takeover of FTIL board, if it happens, would be the first such development since the Satyam case in 2009.
In Satyam case, the scandal-hit IT firm was later sold to Tech Mahindra through a government-monitored auction.
Post merger, FTIL would take over all the liabilities of National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), including payments due to be paid to investors and others to help in repayment process.
Soon after the government’s amalgamation order on October 21, FTIL had said in a brief statement that it “is taking appropriate steps in the matter in consultation with legal counsel of the company“.
No immediate comments could be obtained from FTIL on the proposal for making changes to its Board following merger of NSEL, which itself would fructify after taking into account submissions and objections, if any, made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies.
FTIL shares were trading nearly flat at Rs 195.75 in morning trade after paring their opening trade gains.
The Ministry’s decision comes more than a year after the payment scam at NSEL came into light in July 2013. The move has been initiated taking into consideration “essential public interest” as the exchange is “not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues“.
So far, the crisis-hit spot exchange has managed to recover only little over Rs 360 crore dues from defaulters, a part of which has been disbursed and the rest is in an escrow account. Funds worth about Rs 5,300 crore are yet to be recovered for subsequent payment to affected investors.

Brent falls to $86 on Goldman price cut forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Saamna editorial says Sena is ready to back any CM as long as he has peoples blessingsSena supporters in Dadar celebrate the party’s victory.(Source: Express photo by Prashant Nadkar)

Softening its stand after BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Maharashtra Assembly polls, the Shiv Sena on Monday said it is ready to support any leader chosen by its estranged ally as the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra.
“On the day of Laxmi Pooja, (Devendra) Fadnavis met (Nitin) Gadkari and took his blessings. Later Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings. All these blessings are undoubtedly important, but the blessings of the people are the most important. Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who will take Maharashtra ahead with the blessings of the people,” Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
The party says that though Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has the experience to don the mantle in the state, the final decision will be taken by the high command in Delhi.  “The final decision (over the CM’s name) will be taken by the high command in Delhi, hence no point for the state leaders to think over this. Gadkari is well versed with the state and hence has a development vision for Maharashtra. On the other hand, Fadnavis does not have the experience of being involved in governance,” the party organ said.
“We are happy that the BJP won the elections and rooted the corrupt Congress and the NCP out of power. The state will benefit from the oust of both these parties,” it added. BJP’s central observers Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and J P Nadda will attend the legislature party meet in Mumbai tomorrow and elect the next Chief Minister of the state.
With no concrete talks having taken place between the BJP and the Sena over the allocation of portfolios, the Sena will have to wait for further clarity until the legislature party meet.
Meanwhile, newly elected BJP MLA from Mukhed in Nanded district Govind Rathod died here following a heart attack. Rathod was on his way to Mumbai by Devgiri Express when he was taken ill last night, party sources said. With Rathod’s passing away, the strength of BJP in the 13th Assembly is 121.

Govt may allow foreign firms to mine coalStory
Update: Govt may allow foreign firms with domestic units to mine, sell coal
Rupam Jain Nair and Krishna N Das     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 22, 2014  | 15:45 IST

The government could allow commercial coal mining by foreign companies if they set up units in the country, opening the door for global giants like Rio Tinto to access the country's coal reserves , a source familiar with the matter said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to open commercial coal mining to private players is a key step towards bringing order to the chaotic domestic power industry and ending the chronic blackouts that impede its economic rise.
Nearly a quarter of a century after the country embraced economic liberalisation, many businesses still rely on costly back-up generators for round-the-clock power and a third of its 1.2 billion people still lack access to electricity.
As of now, only domestic power, steel and cement companies can mine coal for their own consumption. Commercial mining is dominated by state-run Coal India (CIL).
However, now the government plans to allow companies like Rio Tinto India to mine coal commercially after it completes the auction of 74 coalfields for the exclusive consumption of power, cement and steel plants owned by domestic companies, said the source, who spoke on conditions of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
In a 27-page executive order posted on the Coal Ministry's website on Wednesday, the government said any firm incorporated in the country may be allowed to mine coal for their own consumption or sale, ending a 42-year-old ban. The document did not make any direct reference to allowing foreign firms.
Rio Tinto India Managing Director Nik Senapati declined to comment on the matter.
Other foreign players that may show interest in the nation are BHP Billiton and US-based company Peabody.
A CIL official said it would be natural for the government to allow deep-pocketed foreign companies to mine coal, given the need to invest heavily in order to quickly raise output.
MODI'S REFORMS
Opening up the industry would ultimately boost production of coal, a raw material that generates three-fifths of the country's power supply, while piling pressure on CIL to produce more.
"This is a first step but a very important one," said Manish Aggarwal, head of KPMG's energy and natural resources practice in India.
"What the government is really saying is that we will focus on domestic coal and on renewables to meet our energy needs... India needs the latest technology, the latest equipment and international expertise if it is to raise coal production."
PM Modi prided himself on supplying uninterrupted electricity as the former chief minister of Gujarat, and repeating that feat at a national level is one of his priorities.
It will not be an easy task.
The country sits on the world's fifth-largest coal reserves, and yet state-owned CIL, which has enjoyed a monopoly on commercial mining, has consistently failed to meet the rising demand of the rapidly growing domestic economy.
Instead, wretched inefficiency has turned the country into the world's third-largest importer of coal.
In September, the Supreme Court cancelled 214 of the 218 coal block licences issued since 1993, after ruling that they were allocated illegally, in a case that has become emblematic of the dysfunctional nature of the industry.
The government will re-auction the mines to private firms within four months. For the first time, revenue from the concessions will be paid to the states where the blocks are located, creating an incentive to speed up project approvals.
"Modi wants to include incentives... By giving the opportunity to coal-rich states to earn royalties," said a retired bureaucrat who helped the Prime Minister tackle power shortages in Gujarat.
NEXT STEPS
Boosting the supply of energy is only half the problem, industry experts say, and Modi is expected to now push individual states to reform the rickety distribution model.
The country's installed energy generation - more than half of it powered by coal - has surged by 20 per cent in the last three years, and the peak power deficit fell to 5.1 per cent in June from 9 per cent in 2012, according to official data released by the government.
However, cash-strapped distributors, whose tariffs are capped and are facing rampant power theft, have invested little in new transmission lines. This implies that, for all the extra power generated, not enough is delivered to consumers.
"This is not a complete solution... Fixing the transmission and distribution side is equally critical," said Aggarwal.

Xiaomi migrates some smartphone user data out of Beijing on privacy concernsData belonging to the privately owned company's non-Chinese users will be moved in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the US and data centres in Singapore.
By: Reuters | Beijing | Posted: October 24, 2014 3:14 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 4:34 am
Fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc said on Thursday it is migrating some data on non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing due to performance and privacy considerations.
Data belonging to the privately owned company’s non-Chinese users will be moved in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the United States and data centres in Singapore, Xiaomi vice president Hugo Barra said in a Wednesday blog post on Google Plus.
The migration matches in reverse Apple Inc’s move earlier this year to store Chinese user data with China Telecom Corp, the first time the iPhone maker has kept user data on the Chinese mainland.
User privacy remains a key issue for Xiaomi as it eyes overseas expansion, having risen in the three years since it was founded to become the top smartphone vendor in China, according to industry analysts. It has already faced several privacy controversies, including accusations from international security researchers and a government agency in Taiwan that it funnels unauthorized user data back to its servers in Beijing.
Apart from privacy, Barra also said the moving data to overseas servers has significantly boosted speed in markets such as Singapore, India and Malaysia. Xiaomi is targeting India and Brazil as its next big markets.
Technology companies typically keep data centres physically close to their user base to maximize service speeds, but the question of where to situate them has sometimes been politically wrought. Companies such as Google Inc, for instance, have chosen to store user data off mainland Chinese soil over concerns about privacy and the need to comply with Chinese censorship laws.
Moving data offshore “better equips us to maintain high privacy standards and comply with local data protection regulations,” Barra wrote. “This is a very high priority for Xiaomi as we expand into new markets over the next few years.”
Barra’s post came days after the Chinese web monitoring group Greatfire.org accused Chinese government-affiliated hackers of seeking to obtain Chinese Apple users’ personal data – an accusation which the government has strongly denied. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook discussed information security with a top Chinese official while visiting Beijing this week, according to Chinese state media.
Barra said Xiaomi will also begin using Akamai Technologies Inc’s content delivery service, which in the past has served clients ranging from Apple to Netflix Inc.

European Union doubles assistance to 1 billion euros to combat EbolaBy: Press Trust of India | Berlin | Posted: October 26, 2014 3:45 pm
The European Union has nearly doubled its assistance to combat the raging Ebola virus in West Africa to 1 billion euros.
The heads of state and government of the 28-nation bloc agreed upon the move at their two-day summit concluded in Brussels on Friday.
“EU member nations pledged at the meeting to increase their financial assistance to continue to provide emergency assistance for the population affected by the Ebola epidemic and to support a “sustained, coordinated and increased” effort to curb the spread of the deadly virus,” a joint statement said.
Before providing 1 billion euros (USD 1.26 billion), EU leaders had pledged nearly 600 million euros to pay for medical staff and facilities in the worst affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where some 4,900 people have died of the disease.
In addition to the financial assistance, the EU nations also agreed to increase the deployment of medical and support staff in the affected region.
While expressing their “deep concern” over the continuing spread, the member states said that the scale of the epidemic is a threat not only to the economy and stability of the affected countries, but also to the region as a whole.
They called upon the EU high representative on foreign affairs and the European Commission to develop a package of measures addressing the wider political, security and economic implications of the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
EU member nations and the European Commission pledged to provide appropriate care for international health workers within available resources to receive the treatment they needed, including thorough medical evacuation.
They also agreed on the use of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre to promote the deployment of voluntary health experts.
They shared the view that helping West Africa to cope with the crisis is the best way to prevent a serious outbreak of the disease elsewhere in the world.
However, in the wake of the first confirmed case of Ebola infections in Europe, the state of preparedness within the EU and further efforts to protect EU countries and their citizens must be given top priority, the statement said.
They called for precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contagion, including coordinated preventive actions within the EU such as sharing of information and best practices, training of health professionals and entry screenings if necessary.

Canon Q3 profit slides as demand for cameras tumblesCanon Q3 profit slides as demand for cameras tumbles
Reuters
Tweet
TOKYO, Oct 24:  
Japan's Canon Inc reported a 21 per cent drop in operating profit for the July to September quarter as a slump in the global digital camera market outweighed a boost from a weaker yen.
The consumer shift to smartphones for casual photo taking has pummelled demand for compact cameras, while the growing popularity of lighter mirrorless cameras has taken away market share from higher margin single-lens reflex cameras.
Operating profit came in at 71.8 billion yen ($665 million), down from 90.6 billion yen for the same period a year ago and not far off figures flagged by the Nikkei business daily earlier this month.
Revenue fell 4.5 per cent to 872.2 billion yen.
But bolstered by sales of printers and other office equipment, the export-reliant company lifted its full-year operating profit forecast for the year ending Dec. 31 to 370 billion yen, up from a prior prediction of 365 billion yen. The new forecast would mark an 9.7 per cent increase on the year.
Canon's shares closed up 0.8 per cent on Monday ahead of results.

Right pricing petrol & dieselOil companies should price their products according to their own cost structures
October 27, 2014:  
Fuel pricing has been the bugbear of many a government in India. Though de-licensing of oil refining and marketing, and decontrol of products such as naphtha, fuel oil, lubricants and aviation turbine fuel were one of the first accomplishments of the reform process in the early 1990s, freeing the pricing for transportation fuels — petrol and diesel — remained a challenge.
Last week’s decision by the Centre to deregulate diesel prices has to been seen in this context. For the first time since the short-lived experiment in 2002 when petrol and diesel prices were freed for a short period, oil companies will have the freedom to manage retail price of diesel on their own and adjust it at periodic intervals to reflect market levels. Petrol prices were deregulated in June 2010 but fortnightly revisions have been a reality only since January 2013.
Both petrol and diesel are politically sensitive commodities but unlike petrol, diesel price changes have a cascading effect across the economy on everything from bus and rail fares to vegetable and fruit prices. Governments have, therefore, been wary of freeing diesel pricing and the sustained rise in global oil prices from 2002 until the crisis in 2008 did not help matters. The Modi government has now grabbed the opportunity provided by a falling global oil price regime — prices of benchmark Brent have fallen from around $105 a barrel in April to about $86 a barrel now— to push through deregulation of diesel and it needs to be complimented for this. Yet, deregulation of diesel, noteworthy as it is, is only the first step in much-needed reform of the oil sector.
What we immediately need is some transparency and reform of the methods followed by the oil companies while setting fuel prices, whether petrol and diesel or cooking gas and kerosene. The concept of ‘under-recovery’ has to be jettisoned and competition between the different players — public and private — needs to be encouraged. That alone will allow proper price discovery for these economically sensitive fuels.
The concept of ‘under-recovery’ is unique to India. ‘Under-recoveries’ are nothing but the difference between the oil companies’ ‘desired’ price of a fuel, say diesel, and its prevailing retail price in the domestic market. This ‘desired’ price is calculated on trade-parity basis that takes into account the landed cost of imported fuel and the price at which it is exported by domestic refineries. Presently, the ratio is 80:20 in favour of landed cost. For instance, if the price of a litre of diesel as calculated on trade-parity basis is, say, Rs.70 a litre and the oil companies are selling diesel in the retail market at Rs.65 a litre, the ‘under-recovery’ will be Rs.5 a litre.
‘Under-recovery’ is not the same as a loss which happens when a producer is forced to sell his product below cost. Oil companies refine crude oil to produce diesel (and other products such as petrol, cooking gas and kerosene) in their own refineries in India. They have not been importing diesel or petrol for a decade now, thanks to a sharp increase in domestic refining capacity.
Given this, why should the landed cost of imports, which includes items such as freight, insurance, handling charges and, of course, customs duty, be considered for fixing domestic retail price? This is the unfair part about ‘under-recoveries’, a word that is often cleverly used interchangeably with losses. Let this be clear: ‘under-recovery’ is a notional concept and does not necessarily mean a loss. The only exception when it could include a loss is where global crude oil prices surge to abnormal levels and the retail price of fuels remains unchanged. There has not been such a situation in recent years.
But why do oil companies harp on ‘under-recoveries’ and demand that domestic price should be linked to that? Simply because the landed cost, which includes duties and other levies, offers them protection to cover up possible inefficiencies in their operations. This protection is unnecessary and unfair to domestic consumers and all it does is promote inefficiency. It is no secret that the public sector oil companies are saddled with high costs for reasons ranging from excess staff to duplication of facilities between them. By linking retail price to ‘under-recovery’ all that the government does is ensure that such inefficiencies are passed on to consumers. Again, global prices of crude oil and refined fuels such as petrol and diesel do not always move in tandem. The forces that drive their respective markets are different. For instance, the international market price of petrol and diesel can spike if there is a refinery outage somewhere in the world causing supply disruption. There have been instances in the past when refined fuel prices have surged due to a fire or a maintenance shutdown by a particular refinery. Crude oil prices are not affected by such factors. By taking into account landed cost of refined fuels rather than crude oil, the oil companies may be forcing consumers to pay a higher price when there is really no supply problem within the country.
Cost-plus pricing
The ideal way to go is for oil companies to price their products according to their own cost structures. Each company has a unique cost structure which is a factor of its refining efficiency. The final market price should be discovered on the basis of the cost of crude plus refining costs and the margin of the oil company.
This can happen only in a competitive environment where the oil companies compete with each other and against the three private players — Reliance Industries, Essar and Shell. As of now , the PSUs operate as a cartel when pricing their products, which is an anti-competition practice. Clearly, the next item on the agenda for the government should be to push the oil companies truly into the market era where fuel prices are linked to efficiencies and vary not just between the different players but between petrol stations of the same player based on which one is more efficient. That will be real reform.

Hyderabad, Oct 27:  
The special court for Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday adjourned the multi-thousand crore Satyam Computer scam case to October 30, 2014.
The main accused and founder-chairman of Satyam, B Ramalinga Raju, and others accused who are on the bail, appeared before the judge.
The special court is expected to announce the date of final verdict in the case on October 30. Hearing in the five-and-a-half-year-old case was completed in June this year during which 216 witnesses were examined.
Raju had confessed in January 2009 fudging of books to inflate profit over the years. He was later arrested by the Andhra Pradesh Police after which the CBI had taken over the investigation.
He, along with his brother and company team, was charged with cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery, breach of trust and violation of various I-T laws, among others.

PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 14:25 IST
Nissan Sunny
Japanese auto firm Nissan is recalling 9,000 units of its compact car Micra and mid-sized sedan Sunny in India to replace defective airbags as part of a global recall.
The recall will cover cars manufactured between 2008 to 2012 that use safety airbags made by its supplier Takata.
" Nissan plans to begin notifying customers soon. Nissan dealers will replace the driver airbag inflator with a correctly manufactured part at no cost to the customers for parts or labour," a Nissan India spokesperson said.
The global recall of 2,60,000 units by the Japanese auto major affects models, including Note, March/Micra, Sunny/Almera/Versa, Patrol and Cube.
These are affected by a driver airbag concern that Takata reported to Nissan, the company said.
Ever since auto industry body SIAM started voluntary vehicle recall for safety related issues in India in July 2012, over seven lakh vehicles have been recalled by various manufacturers including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Ford, Honda and General Motors.
Last month, Maruti Suzuki India announced recall of 69,555 units of Dzire, Swift and Ritz models manufactured between March 2010 and August 2013 to repair wiring harness fitment.
In April this year, in one of the biggest vehicle recalls in India, Maruti Suzuki recalled 1,03,311 units Ertiga, Swift and DZire -- manufactured between November 12, 2013 and February 4, 2014 to replace faulty fuel filler neck.
Last year, General Motors India recalled over 1,10,000 units of its multi-utility vehicle Tavera to address emission and specification issues.
The government is in process of framing a mandatory recall policy that would entail penalties as part of the new Central Motor Vehicle Rules.

Narendra Modi inaugurates HN Reliance Foundation hospital
Taking ahead from his digital media campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the need of upgradation in medical science and telemedicine in the country during the inauguration of the recently refurbished Sir Harkisondas Nurrotamdas Reliance Foundation hospital in South Mumbai on Saturday (October 25) evening.

“When our country is compared to other countries, the health care system in our country shames us,” Modi said. He added,  “Instead of focusing on treatment of patients, the health care system must focus on preventive care. It takes less to invest in preventive care than in treatment.”

While addressing several Bollywood stars and political dignitaries, including Maharashtra governor Vidyasagr Rao, present at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital’s inauguration, Modi emphasized on the urgent need to inculcate habit of hand washing as a preventive measure in the health care system.

“The women and child mortality is still alarming in the country,” he said, adding that he read that  40 per cent child death in Pakistan is caused due to absence of hand-washing.  “The roots of both the countries are the same and the situation is not very different in India,” Modi said.

After the launch of ‘Make in India’ campaign, Modi now encouraged the concept of foreign direct investment in the country’s health care system adding that telemedicine will benefit rural areas where expert knowledge can be used to conduct emergency surgeries. He also indicated that the Digital India campaign will be used to improve the telemedicine services in the country. Seen here with Nita Ambani. (Source: Express Photo)
“It is not possible to bring sophisticated technology in general hospitals. FDI should be encouraged in bringing about medical equipment for benefitting rural areas,” he added.

NSE Nifty to trade in a band of 7 800-8 200NSE Nifty to trade in band of 7,800-8,200 with immediate resistance at 8,050 levels
Ambareesh Baliga        Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 09:07 IST

The truncated Diwali week saw the Nifty closing at 8,014, recovering from a 'breakdown' scare and ending about 3 per cent higher to welcome the new Hindu calendar year - Samvat 2071 .
The markets were aided by the performance of the BJP in assembly elections and a slew of reforms, which laid to rest the growing sense of inaction on the policy front. These included the long-awaited diesel deregulation, gas pricing and labour reforms, and a roadmap on coal sector reforms.
Development was the key poll plank for the BJP and the state election results will give the central government renewed confidence and impetus to push forward its reform agenda.
The global environment has also been kind. Lower commodity prices, especially crude oil, have truly been a blessing for the government. If oil prices had hovered above $110, there was a bleak chance of either the diesel deregulation or any hope of reining in the fiscal deficit.
Being an 'Internal Consumption' economy, India would benefit from lower input prices in a stable currency scenario. With China stuttering, India would look a shade better as the domestic industrial climate turns brighter. The government's renewed mandate in state elections will ensure fast-tracking of reforms, which in turn could give the economy a much-awaited kick-start.
The moot question, however, will be the performance of the markets based on the hypothesis of the economy getting back on track. Although I am bullish from a longer term perspective, I still believe that the correction I was expecting is not yet complete.
The expected uptick in the economy due to the Modi factor has been discounted by the markets in the last few months with a 30+ per cent appreciation, and if the government hadn't moved on reforms even after 150 days in the saddle, market participants would have been sorely disappointed.
While the global environment is favourable for the country's economy, FIIs , who are the prime movers of the stock market in the country, may react differently in the short term due to pressures at home. With a probable rate hike in the US and slowdown in the euro zone and China, FIIs in the interim could prefer to be in a 'risk-off' zone. Despite increased domestic inflows, the mismatch could lead to a correction, which below the recent support zone of 7,800-7,850 could lead to a sell-off.
The high expectation faced by the government is the other risk factor for markets. The pace of reforms in the past week could set a new benchmark for delivery going ahead. The big test lies ahead on smooth implementation of GST and the new coal block allocation policy. The industry would also look for higher FDI in insurance. One also needs to see the follow-up action on policy measures already taken. The government has cleared defence projects worth Rs 800 billion, mostly to be sourced domestically, but defense FDI of 49 per cent is yet to draw visible interest from foreign majors.
On the macro data front, inflation has been benign and could continue to be so till November when the base effect wears out. The RBI too may not oblige the finance minister's wish for a rate cut. IIP data is yet to show signs of a sustained recovery.
The festive season sales seemed to have got a huge sentiment boost. Hero MotoCorp sold about 150,000 units in a single day and there are similar stories across various consumer segments. The next few weeks would be important for a confirmation of the continued buoyant sentiments.
Company results have been mixed so far and I don't expect any major positive surprises from companies announcing their earnings in the latter half of the season. The Nifty will stay in a broad band of 7,800-8,200 with an immediate resistance at around 8,050 levels. One should look to selectively accumulate in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods, cement, power and metals.
The outperforming sectors such as pharma, IT and auto ancillaries could take a breather due to international headwinds. I would advise maintaining a healthy cash ratio to utilise opportunities during a sharper correction.

Jindal Steel shares drop 8% on fresh CBI enquiryJindal Steel shares drop 8% on fresh CBI enquiry
25 out of 130 banks fail ECB test but capital hole mostly plugged25 out of 130 banks fail ECB test but capital hole mostly plugged

Frankfurt, Oct 26:  
Roughly one in five of the euro zone’s top lenders failed landmark health checks at the end of last year but most have since repaired their finances, the European Central Bank had said on Sunday.
Painting a brighter picture than had been expected, the ECB found the biggest problems in Italy, Cyprus and Greece but concluded that banks’ capital holes had since chiefly been plugged, leaving only a modest €10 billion to be raised.
Italy faces the biggest challenge with nine of its banks falling short and two still needing to raise funds.
The test, designed to mark a clean start before the ECB takes on supervision of the banks next month, said Monte dei Paschi had the largest capital hole to fill at €2.1 billion.
The exercise provides the clearest picture yet of the health of the euro zone's banks more than seven years after the eruption of a financial crisis that almost bankrupted a handful of countries and threatened to fracture the currency bloc.
While 25 of the euro zone's 130 biggest banks failed the health check at the end of last year with a total capital shortfall of €25 billion, a dozen have already raised €15 billion this year to make repairs.
Golman survey
A recent investor survey by Goldman Sachs found they believed the ECB ought to ask lenders to raise an additional €51 billion of capital for the tests to be credible.
Although investors may take heart, it remains to be seen whether the exercise can spur banks to lend more as the region's economic growth stutters to a virtual halt.
European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said the results could encourage banks to lend.
“There is some pick-up (in demand), but it is still slight,’’ Constancio told Reuters. "All this now can really start to change the environment and we hope it will also change the reality."
Alongside Italy, regulators said three Greek banks, three Cypriots, two from both Belgium and Slovenia, and one each from France, Germany, Austria, Ireland and Portugal had also missed the grade as of end-2013.
Analysts generally gave the results a cautious welcome, saying they marked the beginning rather than the end of a banking clean-up in Europe.
"I consider the stress test as an important partial success, which will help reduce uncertainty," said Marcel Fratzscher, president of Germany's DIW economic institute.
"However, important challenges remain unsolved. The stress test alone will not end the credit crunch for small and mid-sized companies in Southern Europe."
Some were more critical. "This seems as if it has been pretty unstressful," said Karl Whelan, an economist with University College Dublin.
"The real issue is the size of the capital shortfall and that is very, very small. I don't feel a whole lot more reassured about the health of the banking system today than last week."
The exercise nonetheless provided a snapshot of banks' vital statistics and forced them, for example, to revise the amount of risky loans - which have not been serviced in 90 days - upwards by €136 billion to €879 billion.
Clean-up ahead
The exercise, which saw officials trawl through more than 40 million individual bank figures, had two parts - a strict review by the ECB of assets such as loans, followed by a wider test of how banks would cope with a new economic crash.
It is the fourth attempt by Europe to clean the stables of its financial sector and has been billed as much the most rigorous.
Previous efforts failed to spot problems, giving lenders in Ireland a clean bill of health shortly before a banking crash drove the country to the brink of financial collapse.
"It is credible," said Nicolas Veron of Brussels think tank Bruegel. "But it is only the start of a longer sequence of cleanup that will extend well into 2015."
The ECB's passmark was for banks to have high-quality capital of at least 8 per cent of their risk-weighted assets, a measure of the riskiness of a banks' loans and other assets, if the economy grows as expected over the next three years, and capital of at least 5.5 per cent if it slides into recession.
Banks with a capital shortfall will have to say within two weeks how they intend to close the gap. They will then be given up to nine months to do so.
Unblocking lending
The ECB staked its reputation on delivering a thorough assessment in an attempt to draw a line under years of financial and economic strife in the bloc.
For many banks, the biggest impact of the tests was not in identifying capital holes but in finding that their assets, such as loans, had been overvalued.
In total, the ECB said banks had been valuing their loans and assets at €48 billion more than they are really worth. This was because they had not recognised €136 billion of bad loans.
That accounted for 11 billion of the €25 billion banks were collectively short of at the end of last year. It also eroded €37 billion of capital among the banks that passed.
Among the major listed banks, the biggest hits were to Greece's Piraeus bank, whose core capital fell by 3.7 percentage points after the ECB adjusted the bank's capital to reflect the new asset valuations.
Monte dei Paschi's capital was reduced by almost a third. There was also a big impact on Austria's Erste Bank.
The adjustments put many banks in an uncomfortable position. Thirty-one had core capital below the 10 per cent mark viewed by investors as a safety threshold, while a further 28 were had ratios just 1 percentage point above.
The ECB will not immediately force lenders with overvalued assets to take remedial action but they will have to hold more capital eventually, leaving less room to expand, lend or pay dividends.
For overall lending, the more fundamental question is whether the demand for credit is there in a moribund euro zone economy.

Subscription payment model fast catching up among infrastructure cosSubscription payment model fast catching up among infrastructure cos

Kochi, Oct 27:  
Software rentals through subscription payment model are fast catching up among infrastructure companies for timely completion of projects with IT assistance.
Majority of the companies are adopting this business model for cost reduction, as India’s infrastructure industry today is facing hard times. With huge debts, companies are even unable to undertake new projects and are struggling to complete the existing ones.
Given the situation, IT is proving to be infrastructure industry’s best bet for survival as well as growth, says K.Varghese Daniel, Founder Director and CEO of Kochi-based Wrench Solutions.
“We are entering a new era of construction project management. Gone are the days when project management software meant CAD and MSOffice and MSProject. Today, there is software designed specifically for the full cycle of engineering, procurement and construction, which is as comprehensive as ERP, much more affordable and faster to roll out”, he told BusinessLine.
Wrench, he said, recently introduced a subscription payment model, which allows customers to use its software as a service (SaaS). The market slowdown has forced companies to shift focus from Capex to Opex to reduce cost. Hence, SaaS would enable customers to simply stop using the system if the project is discontinued, he added.
Wrench’s switch over to SaaS model signals an encouraging trend in the IT market, as it allows companies a risk free way to leverage IT benefits even during cost-cutting phases, he added.

Centre files before Supreme Court affidavit in black money caseBlack money case: Centre discloses 8 more names to Supreme Court
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Centre today disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and Goa-based mining company, against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Pvt Ltd and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the Government.
The affidavit, filed days after the government came under attack from political rivals that it was chary of revealing names, said that these names have been received from French authorities and other countries.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under its scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal“.
The additional affidavit on the black money issue was filed today in furtherance of its affidavit recently when it had said that the names of account holders in foreign banks cannot be disclosed till there is evidence of tax evasion against them and prosecution is launched in India.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries''.
The list names Timblo Pvt Ltd and its directors Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. It was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its directors.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family Burmans said that the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income-Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added.
Lodhiya denied having a Swiss bank account. “We have already declared in the income-tax and there is nothing...we don’t have any Swiss account that is the only thing which I can say,” he said.
Radha Timbo declined to comment on her name being mentioned in the affidavit, saying she has to first study it before commenting.

Bilawal Bhutto booed during Kashmir Million March inUKPrint
PPP's leader Bilawal Bhutto.
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:13 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 6:30 pm
A protest march by a UK-based pro-Pakistan group on the Kashmir issue in the heart of London today fizzled out as barely a few hundred protesters gathered to wave placards and flags.
The so-called ‘Million March’ from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street descended into chaos as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stepped on to the makeshift stage to speak.
The crowd began booing and throwing empty plastic bottles and refused to let him speak.
“This march was to be about Kashmir and for the welfare of Kashmiris. Bilawal has no business being here,” said a group of angry protesters who had travelled from Derby in the East Midlands region of England.
The march was led by Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, referred to as a former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was supported by Mirpuri-origin British parliamentarian Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham.
While the group had claimed overwhelming support from various communities for the march, others had dismissed it as against the “national interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
A counter-protest held by a rival group on Sunday ended with memorandums submitted for the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their high commissions here.
The memorandums urged both India and Pakistan to “respect the fundamental human rights of all citizens of Jammu and Kashmir”.

Consistent govt policy needed for investor confidence: JSPL MDConsistent govt policy needed for investor confidence, says Jindal Steel MD Ravi Uppal

The Supreme Court had recently cancelled the permits of 214 coal blocks allocated between 1993 and 2010 by various Central governments. Miners have been given time till March 31, 2015, to wind up their operations. Jindal Steel and Power is among them and seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place. In the wake of these developments, Ravi Uppal, Managing Director and Group CEO of Jindal Steel and Power, spoke to Business Today on what needs to be done to make PM's 'Make in India' campaign a success.
Q. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT AWAY TO MAKE PM NARENDRA MODI'S 'MAKE IN INDIA' A SUCCESS?
A. First we have to get back buoyancy to the Indian manufacturing sector. The government must realise that that will happen when the private sector gets into it. Take the case of telecom and civil aviation. Any federal government must come to terms with it and accept it.
It's time we give up our infatuation with the public sector. The sector was important when the country became independent and resources were scarce. Then we were not focussed on productivity and technology. The government can rake in a lot of money by divestment.
Most public sector undertakings are living on oxygen provided by the government. We have the case of MTNL and BSNL - see how these superstructures have crashed. In manufacturing, petrochemical refineries can be divested. Even Steel Authority and BHEL can be. There is no need for the government to stay in these sectors. A lot of state undertakings are sick. Some of them require huge amount of technological inputs and are in a fierce competitive market. They will fall under their own weight. So let the private sector play a bigger role.
Second is gaining the trust of the private sector, which in India feels highly insecure. The governments has not been consistent; lot of reversals take place. Today people are even questioning the validity of any document or licence issued by the government.
The recent events such as the cancellation of the 2G licences and mining permits clearly erodes the private sector's confidence in any document given by the government. It comes to saying that the any such document must be endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Central Vigilance Commission, Central Bureau of Investigation and finally by the Supreme Court before it becomes a valid document.  
Q. DURING MODI'S VISIT TO THE US, MANY WALL STREET INVESTORS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE RECENT CANCELLATION OF COAL MINES. THE SC HAS INDICTED ONE AGENCY - THE GOVERNMENT. BUT THE PUNISHMENT IS BEING GIVEN TO INVESTORS. WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR YOUR COMPANY?
A. What is at stake is a total investment of Rs 36,000 crore that have been made in Chhattisgarh and Orissa.
Q. WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY LOST?
A. We employ 30,000 people in our mines, steel plants and power plants. They will be laid off. Opportunity lost will be in terms of future investment. As a company, the continuity of supply will be disrupted. Coal Indian does not have the wherewithal to supply the kind of coal we want and the regularity at which it has to be supplied.
Q. WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG WITH THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING THE MINES?
A. Some of these mines were operating for more than 10 years. These are captive mines. The plants were located there. In 1993, when the mining act was amended, the government was not able to generate enough power and steel because they are investment intensive sectors. To motivate the private sector and give them input material security, the government decided to give captive mines.
If you develop a three million tonne mine, the investment is Rs 800 crore. The kind of investment you make when you set up a 1,000 mW power project is about Rs 6,000 crore. So at that point of time, the government was not foolish. And they gave the worst of mines to the private sector.
The government asked Coal India to make a list of mines they were not interested in. Coal India was mining A,B and C grade coal. The private sector was given E, F and G grade where the ash content was anywhere between 45-55 per cent. These were discards as far as Coal India was concerned.
Now the private sector put in huge investment, put washeries to wash coal, remove soil and ash. So it suddenly started looking attractive. The government obviously did not remember the basis why these captive mines were given - it was to stimulate investment in core sectors.
Now, it is a serious setback to the investment process. There were 40 mines which were operative. They said you have six months to wind down operations. After six months, the mines will be auctioned or they will put them on auction again. It is like taking away your house and saying we will auction it.
There is a severe setback to private investment due to this.  It is a setback to investor confidence. So the government needs to win back investor confidence. There needs to be continuity and consistency in government policy. They should state that any decision made by the government is irrevocable. This is the kind of protection we need.
Q. AFTER THE RECENT SETBACKS, HOW EASY WILL IT BE TO FINANCE NEW PROJECTS?
A. Sectoral allocation by banks should also be more liberal, especially in the more investment centric industries. A steel plant of one million tonne costs $1 billion. If you ask a promoter to put in 25 per cent equity, he must have $250 million. Not many people have that kind of cash. The government should have a guideline that they can go up to 90 per cent lending. Lending norms have to be looked at. In the Middle East, the investment is very easy. We have set up $2 million tonne steel plant in Oman. The banks gave us money with a smile with favourable terms. The cost of loan is 6 per cent. In dollar terms, the rate is less than 5 per cent. India is at 12 per cent.

U.S. general: North Korea likely can build a miniaturized nuclear weaponsBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe

North Korea likely can develop a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can be launched from a mobile launcher, the top U.S. general in South Korea said — a capability that weapons experts have previously said they doubt is within the reach of the government of Kim Jong-un.
Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that North Korea has claimed to have already done so, and has had the right connections and technology to make it happen.
“I think given their technological capabilities, the time that they been working on this, that they probably have the capabilities to put this together,” he said. “I don’t believe that they have. I don’t know that they have at this point.”
Any “mini-nuke” would likely be launched from a system mounted on a truck, and carried by an intermediate or long-range missile. U.S. officials have mixed opinions on how far North Korea has come in developing one, but most believe that any missile launched will have very low reliability.
Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday afternoon that Scaparrotti speaks with Defense Secretary Hagel about the issue, and the Defense Department is monitoring the situation.”
But they have not moved — we have not seen evidence that they’ve done it,” Kirby said. “And we’ve not seen certainly any evidence that they’re testing or in development of it.”
President Obama said in April that there is no “magic bullet” to influence officials in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. 
Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye signaled in April that they were considering delaying a plan to give Seoul control of its own troops during any future war on the Korean Peninsula, rather than placing them under U.S. command. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and South Korean Defense Minister Han Min Koo formalized that Thursday . Instead of turning operational control of troops over to South Korea as planned in December 2005, they signed a memorandum of understanding that effectively postpones it indefinitely.

FM Arun Jaitley favours interest rate cutRatnajyoti Dutta and Manoj Kumar        Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 12:55 IST
Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley favours a cut in interest rates to trigger demand in the construction sector, a newspaper report said on Saturday, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has signalled it will not ease policy until it is confident of lower inflation .
In May, Prime Minister Modi was elected on promises that his government would create jobs and rejuvenate the economy, but experts were disappointed by Jaitley's first Budget and a lack of early progress on fixing structural economic problems.
"Currently, interest rates are a disincentive. Now that inflation seems to be stabilising somewhat, the time seems to have come to moderate the interest rates," Jaitley said in an interview to The Times of India.
Last month, the RBI sent a strong signal that it would refrain from cutting interest rates until the central bank was confident that consumer inflation can be cut to a target of 6 percent by January 2016.
India's retail inflation eased for a second straight month in September, but the risks of price shocks from weak monsoon rains and oil are expected to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon.
Consumer prices rose a slower-than-expected 6.46 percent from a year earlier, the lowest since figures were first published in January 2012.

Clocking the slowest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.9 per cent in terms of gross state domestic product, Uttar Pradesh is the lowest among the traditional BIMARU states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP) in this regard during the past nine years i.e. during 2004-05 and 2012-13, according to an ASSOCHAM study.
"Bihar has ranked on top among the BIMARU states registering highest growth rate of 9.3 per cent in GSDP during the aforesaid nine year period followed by Madhya Pradesh (8.8 per cent) and Rajasthan (8.2 per cent) even as India's overall gross domestic product (GDP) grew at eight per cent during 2004-05 and 2012-13," said a study titled 'Analysis of BIMARU states' conducted by ASSOCHAM.
"Though UP's share in terms of contribution to Indian economy has remained highest during the aforesaid period,its share has dipped from 8.8 per cent as of 2004-05 to 8.1 per cent as of 2012-13/. The share of other states in BIMARU category though has remained stagnant over these years but has slightly improved-Bihar (from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent), MP (3.8 per cent to 4 per cent) and Rajasthan (4.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent)," the study prepared by ASSOCHAM Economic Research Bureau (AERB) said.
"Total share of BIMARU states to India's economy has also slightly dipped from 19.5 per cent as of 2004-05 to 19.4 per cent as of 2012-13," D.S. Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM said while releasing the chamber's study.
Even on the agriculture and allied sector front, UP has proved to be the slowest in CAGR at 2.9 per cent ,well below the national growth rate of 3.7 per cent, it said.
Madhya Pradesh clocked highest growth rate of seven per cent in terms of agriculture and allied sector performance amid BIMARU states followed by Rajasthan (4.8 per cent) and Bihar (4.7 per cent).
he share of agriculture and allied sector in UP's GSDP has dipped from 29.7 per cent as of 2004-05 to 21.9 per cent as of 2012-13, the Assocham study said.
In Bihar, it has come down from 31.5 per cent to 22.5 per cent, while in Rajasthan it has slowed from 25.6 per cent to 19.9 per cent. MP registered just about three per cent decline i.e. from 27.7 per cent to 24.2 per cent during the period under review.
The contribution of agriculture and allied sector in Indian economy too dipped sharply from 19 per cent to 13.7 per cent during this period.
"On the industrial sector front, UP has registered 6.9 per cent growth rate during the said period while India clocked 7.4 per cent CAGR in the industrial sector," it said.
While amid BIMARU states, Bihar clocked highest growth rate of 13.9 per cent in the industry sector followed by MP (9.2 per cent) and Rajasthan (8.5 per cent).
The share of industry sector in UP's economy has marginally declined from 23.3 per cent as of 2004-05 to 23.2 as of 2012-13, while it has increased considerably in other BIMARU states - Bihar (from 13.8 per cent to 19.2 per cent), MP (27.1 per cent to 27.9 per cent) and Rajasthan (30.6 per cent to 31.3 per cent).
In the services sector too, UP has clocked slowest growth rate of nine per cent during 2004-05 and 2012-13 which is not only below other BIMARU states but also the national average of 9.6 per cent. Bihar registered highest growth rate of over 10 per cent followed by Rajasthan (9.7 per cent) and MP (9.6 per cent) during the period under review.
UP, however, has recorded highest growth in terms of services sector's contribution to the state economy as it rose from 47 per cent in 2004-05 to about 55 per cent as of 2012-13 followed by Rajasthan (from 43.8 per cent to 48.8 per cent), Bihar (from 54.7 per cent to 58.3 per cent) and MP (from 45.2 per cent to 47.9 per cent). Though, nationally the services sector share in the GDP increased from 53 per cent to 59.6 per cent.
At 4.8 per cent, UP has also registered slowest per- capita income growth rate between 2004-05 and 2012-13, while Bihar topped with 7.6 per cent CAGR amid other BIMARU states followed by MP (7 per cent) and Rajasthan (6.1 per cent).
Nationally the per-capita income grew by 6.2 per cent during this period.

ECB stress test: The data for each bankAbout this blog

Euro comes safely through ECB stress test  Aussie up0
Its New Zealand peer slid to 92.35 yen , retreating from a seven-year high of 93.97 set just on Friday.
Traders said investors were forced to take profits on bearish yen trades as a four-percent drop in oil prices to five-year lows triggered a selloff in energy stocks. That, in turn, saw the S&P 500 <.SPX> suffer its biggest fall since October.
Currencies of oil-producing countries fared poorly with the Canadian dollar reaching a fresh five-year low of C$1.1486 per USD . The Norwegian crown fell to a 5-1/2 year trough of 7.1872 per USD .
Asian stocks should track Wall Street lower in a move that will probably continue to support the yen in the hours ahead.
Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Raiko Shareef said there also appeared to be growing speculation that the yen's depreciation has come about too quickly.
"Japanese officialdom would be quick to agree, now sensitive to the complaints of Japan's importers. No doubt helped by some post-payrolls profit-taking, this is USD/JPY's biggest single-day fall since mid-October," he said, referring to Monday's performance.
Indeed, the sharp fall in dollar/yen helped drag the greenback down against the euro, which popped back above $1.2300 , from a two-year trough of $1.2247.
Still, investors were likely to remain wary of buying the common currency amid speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) was poised to ease policy further early next year.
Executive Board member Benoit Coeure kept those expectations alive on Monday, saying policymakers last week agreed unanimously to assess how and when to react to downward inflation risks in early 2015, and that they could then change their asset buying plans.
Several Federal Reserve officials spoke on Monday as well, but stuck to a dovish script that offered nothing new in terms of when the central bank will likely lift interest rates.

Nilofar is now a severe cyclone  to cross Naliya on FridayVery severe cyclone Nilofar may weaken ahead of landfall
Vinson Kurian

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 27:  
Arabian Sea Cyclone Nilofar is now a very severe cyclone, only one step away from class-topping super cyclone status, an India Met update said this afternoon.
But all available indications suggest that Nilofar will wind down to severe cyclone status due to a combination of adverse factors.
PEAK WINDS
Westerly winds associated with the western disturbance that steers Nilofar towards Naliya in Gujarat would be the primary culprit for the weakening.
Since Nilofar will hitch a ride on the westerly system, it would get directly impacted from the top as opposing winds tear into it.
A second reason is dry air intrusion from around the land – the cyclone would be in close proximity to mainland Pakistan and western India as it runs in.
Third are the cooler waters towards the north Gujarat coast, which caps evaporation and moisture build that is needed to fuel the cyclone system.
YELLOW MESSAGE
The Met located Nilofar to 1,170 km southwest of Naliya (Gujarat) and 1,230 km south-southwest of Karachi (Pakistan) at 1.30 pm.
In a ‘yellow message’ (warning), the Met said that the coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch would receive rainfall at most places from Thursday morning.
Isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also commence along these areas around the same time.
The rainfall intensity would increase gradually with heavy to very heavy fall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls from later in the night.
Squally winds speed reaching 45-to 55 km/hr and gusting to 65 km/hr would commence along and off Gujarat coast from Thursday morning.
SEA CONDITION
They would ramp up to between 100- and 110 km/hr with gusts of 125 km/hr at the time of landfall.
Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be ‘rough’ (13 ft in height) to ‘very rough’ (13- to 20 ft) from Thursday.
It would become ‘very high’ (30- to 46 ft) to ‘phenomenal’ (46 ft) from the afternoon.
Fishermen out at sea along and off Gujarat coast have been advised to return to the coast. The Met also notified suspension of fishing operations.
Coastal hutment dwellers should be moved to safer places. People in the affected areas should keep indoors.

ONGC on the hunt for overseas producing assets
Reuters
Business Line D.K. Sarraf
NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) wants to take advantage of falling oil prices to more than double its overseas output to the equivalent of 400,000 barrels per day of oil by 2018, Chairman D.K. Sarraf told Reuters.
Global oil prices sank to a four-year low at below $83 a barrel this month, hitting valuations of energy explorers.
The Indian government, which is preparing to float a $3 billion stake in ONGC, wants state firms to secure energy assets abroad to reduce the exposure of Asia's third-largest economy to supply risks.
India is the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, importing four-fifths of its needs as its own output shrinks.
"For meeting the short-term 2018 target we would like to aggressively go for producing assets, because you can't acquire an exploration block and then make it produce in such a short time," Sarraf said in a telephone interview on Monday.
ONGC, the country's biggest oil explorer, has often been criticised for stagnant output and the slow pace of exploration and development.
Sarraf reaffirmed ONGC's long-term plans to raise overseas output in two stages to 60 million tonnes of oil plus oil-equivalent gas by 2030 - or 1.2 million barrels per day.
The plan envisages investing around $180 billion between 2013 and 2030 on a gamut of projects including raising local and overseas oil and gas output, according to the company's website.
EXPLORATION ASSETS
Sarraf, however, added that ONGC was interested at the same time in acquiring overseas exploration assets, which would take longer to enter production, with a view to hitting its 2030 goal.
"More value is created through exploration assets," he said. "Even for the 2030 target we cannot get out of exploration (to production) if we don't start acting on exploration now."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has initiated a process to sell a 5 per cent stake in ONGC, which is 69 per cent state controlled.
ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, produced about 9 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (180,000 bpd) in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014, Sarraf said.
To achieve its pursuit of acquiring overseas assets ONGC has signed initial cooperation agreements with Mexico's national oil company Pemex, PetroVietnam, Ecuador and PdVSA of Venezuela.
In the last fiscal year ONGC Videsh bought a 20 per cent stake in a block in Mozambique, raised its stake in a deepwater block in Brazil and was awarded exploration blocks in Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Russia's Rosneft has also offered stakes in two Siberian oil fields to ONGC, which is already a partner in the Sakhalin 1 offshore project.
ONGC has 13 producing assets in eight countries. It had cash and cash equivalent of Rs 10,800 crore on March 31, 2014 and its profitability is set to rise after Modi's five-month-old government hiked gas prices and scrapped subsidies on diesel.
ONGC, along with other explorers, had been giving a discount on crude and products sales to state fuel retailers to partly compensate them for losses on retail sales at cheaper regulated rates for diesel, kerosene and cooking gas.
When asked where his firm was targeting oil and gas assets Sarraf said: "The globe. The target is so big we can't look for one geography and say no to another."
He listed Russia and the former Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the Middle East, adding, "We are not in the U.S. and Canada, we want to be there as well."

BEIJING, Oct 27:  
China's central bank said on Monday that it has authorised the nation's interbank foreign exchange market to start direct trading between the Chinese yuan and the Singapore dollar.

By: Associated Press | Washington | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:15 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 1:22 pm
One of the teenagers wounded in a Washington state high school shooting has died, raising the number of fatalities from when a student opened fire in a cafeteria to three. Officials at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett confirmed 14-year-old Gia Soriano died yesterday night.
Another girl was killed during the shooting Friday by a popular first-year student at Marysville-Pilchuck High School north of Seattle. The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, died of a self-inflicted wound. Three other students remain hospitalized, two in critical condition and one in serious condition.

At a news conference, Dr. Joanne Roberts read a statement from Soriano’s family. “We are devastated by this senseless tragedy. Gia is our beautiful daughter, and words cannot express how much we will miss her,” the statement said. Roberts said Soriano’s family was donating her organs for transplant. Earlier yesterday, parents and students gathered in a gymnasium at the school for a community meeting, with speakers urging support and prayers and tribal members playing drums and singing songs. Fryberg was from a prominent Tulalip Indian tribes family.
Young people hugged each other and cried and speakers urged people to come together during the gathering Sunday. “Our legs are still wobbly,” said Tony Hatch, a cousin of one of the injured students. “We’re really damaged right now.” Of the wounded students, only 14-year-old Nate Hatch showed improvement, though he remained in s erious condition in intensive. Fifteen-year-old Andrew Fryberg also remained in critical condition in intensive care. Both are cousins of Jaylen Fryberg.
Meanwhile, 14-year-old Shaylee Chuckulnaskit remained in critical condition in intensive care. Fryberg died in the attack after a first-year teacher intervened. It’s unclear if he intentionally killed himself or if the gun went off in a struggle with a teacher. The makeshift memorial on a chain link fence by the school, which will be closed this week, kept growing Sunday.
Balloons honoring the victims and the shooter adorn the fence along with flowers, stuffed toys and signs. The close-knit community, meanwhile, on continued…

Plastic bottles hurled at Bilawal Bhutto during Kashmir Million March inUKPrint
PPP's leader Bilawal Bhutto.
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 27, 2014 1:13 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 6:30 pm
A protest march by a UK-based pro-Pakistan group on the Kashmir issue in the heart of London today fizzled out as barely a few hundred protesters gathered to wave placards and flags.
The so-called ‘Million March’ from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street descended into chaos as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stepped on to the makeshift stage to speak.
The crowd began booing and throwing empty plastic bottles and refused to let him speak.
“This march was to be about Kashmir and for the welfare of Kashmiris. Bilawal has no business being here,” said a group of angry protesters who had travelled from Derby in the East Midlands region of England.
The march was led by Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, referred to as a former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was supported by Mirpuri-origin British parliamentarian Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham.
While the group had claimed overwhelming support from various communities for the march, others had dismissed it as against the “national interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
A counter-protest held by a rival group on Sunday ended with memorandums submitted for the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their high commissions here.
The memorandums urged both India and Pakistan to “respect the fundamental human rights of all citizens of Jammu and Kashmir”.

China s Xiaomi plans data centre in India to deflect privacy concernsChina's Xiaomi plans data centre in India to deflect privacy concerns
Reuters
Tweet
MUMBAI, Oct 27:  
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc said on Monday it plans to set up a data centre in India next year to store local user data, as the fast-growing company seeks to deflect concerns about privacy that could hamper its efforts to expand overseas.
The move by privately owned Xiaomi comes after it said last week it was migrating some data on non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing due to performance and privacy considerations.
Xiaomi, whose low-priced but feature-rich smartphones have made it the biggest smartphone vendor in China, entered India this year with plans to invest heavily to secure rapid growth in the world's third-largest smartphone market.
It sells its phones in India via Flipkart.com, the country's biggest online retailer, and said last month it planned to sell 100,000 phones a week in the country in October.
On Monday, Xiaomi said it had been moving Indian users' data from its Beijing data centre to data centres of Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing platform of the online retailer Amazon.com Inc, in Singapore and the US since early 2014. It said that process would be completed by the end of the year.
Xiaomi has faced several privacy controversies, including accusations from international security researchers and a government agency in Taiwan that it funnels unauthorized user data back to its servers in Beijing. Indian media reported last week that the country's air force had issued alerts to its personnel and their families against using Xiaomi phones on security concerns.
The Chinese company said on Monday it was attempting to contact Indian authorities for more details on local media reports, adding that it did not collect user data without permission.

Bangalore, Oct 27:  
Students of IIM Bangalore's Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) organised a 'Prayaas Day' in the college campus. Prayaas is a social responsibility initiative run by the EPGP students where the students try to do their bit towards improving the lives of the underprivileged.
Prayaas Day is an annual event where free Jaipur foot camps and eye screening camps are organised.
The programme was inaugurated by Dr L Prasad, a professor of organisational behaviour at IIM Bangalore and Dr Hanumappa Sudarshan, a renowned tribal rights activist and Padmashree award winner.
Dr H Sudarshan inspired the students with some anecdotes from his life and motivated the students to continue giving back to society.
The Jaipur foot camp, which was conducted along with Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, provided free calipers to those affected by polio and free artificial lower limbs to the needy.
The eye screening camp, conducted in association with Akshara Eye Hospital, provided a free eye checkup and helped in diagnosing various conditions such as glaucoma, poor vision, and cataract.
The event saw the active participation of students from across different programmes of IIM Bangalore, with many volunteering their time and money to conduct the event.
Lakshmi, an EPGP student and Prayaas volunteer, said "I saw a small girl who was provided calipers and when I saw the smile on her face after she was fitted with the calipers, I felt that all of us have an opportunity to bring a smile on the faces of people around us and we should make use of these opportunities."

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Shares of HMT surged nearly 20 per cent to touch its highest trading permissible limit for the day amid reports that the company may get another lease of life.
HMT’s stock soared 19.9 per cent to touch its upper circuit limit of Rs 36.75 on the BSE. On the NSE, the scrip zoomed 19.90 per cent to Rs 36.75.
Following the surge in the stock, the company’s market value rose Rs 455.1 crore to Rs 2,785.10 crore.
On the volume front, 5.88 lakh shares of the company changed hands on the BSE, while over 14 lakh shares were traded on the NSE.
As per media reports, the unprecedented demand for timepieces manufactured by the country’s first watch-maker has led the government to rethink its decision to close the loss-making public sector company.
According to reports, after the government announced the closure of the sick state-run company, demand for HMT watches has shot up sharply.
“The company has been incurring cash losses since last 15 years as can be seen in our annual reports submitted to you and other stakeholders from time to time. The company is on budgetary support for payment of salaries and statutory dues since over past 10 years,” the company had said last month in a filing to the BSE.
The present manpower of the company is 1,045 with an annual wage bill of around Rs 45 crore, it had said.

Islamic State threatens to kill British jihadis wanting to return homePrint
By: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 26, 2014 3:33 pm | Updated: October 26, 2014 3:45 pm
Muslim extremists from Britain, who went to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside the Islamic State, are now desperate to return home but are facing death threats from the militant group’s top leaders, a media report said.
“There are Britons who upon wanting to leave have been threatened with death, either directly or indirectly,” the Guardian reported, citing a source with extensive contacts among Syrian militant groups.
The report comes after the killing of another young Muslim from Portsmouth on the frontline in Syria, the fourth to die from a group of six men known as the “Pompey lads’ who travelled together to fight for ISIS.
19-year-old Muhammad Mehdi Hassan is understood to have died on Friday during the ISIS offensive to capture the Syrian border city of Kobani.
Hassan was part of a group of five calling themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys.
ISIS is an Al-Qaeda splinter group and it has seized hundreds of square miles in Iraq and Syria.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group, declared himself as Caliph renamed the ISIS as Islamic State.
Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from the group, chiding it for its lack of teamwork in its aggressive, brutal expansion.
The former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg confirmed that he was also aware of dozens of British men keen to return to the UK but they were trapped in Syria and Iraq, in effect held by a group they wanted to leave, the paper said.
Begg said he knew of more than 30 who wanted to come back. They had travelled to join rebels fighting the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad but had subsequently become embroiled with ISIS, some for language reasons – ISIS had more English-speaking members.
“When it becomes solidified as an Islamic State, a caliph and you swear allegiance, thereafter if you do something disobedient you are now disobeying the caliph and could be subject to disciplinary measures which could include threats of death or death,” said Begg.
There are an estimated 500 Britons who have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria. Overall, 24 Britons are believed to have died after travelling to fight in the bloody civil war.

Depression forms in Arabian Sea  may intensify soonDepression forms in Arabian Sea, may intensify soon
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 25:  
The well-marked low pressure over west-central and adjoining south and east-central Arabian Sea has concentrated into a depression.
At 5.30 am, it lay centred 1,400 km west-southwest of Mumbai and 940 km east-southeast of Salalah, Oman.
FURTHER INTENSIFICATION
An India Met Department update this morning said it would intensify another round into a deep depression by tomorrow (Sunday).
The depression would initially move west-northwest towards south Oman and adjoining Yemen, the Met said in its first assessment of its possible track.
But global models differ, with some continuing to suggest that the storm would head east mid-course towards the Sindh (Pakistan) and northwest Gujarat (India) coasts.
In any case, the system is likely to be declared a cyclonic storm by Monday, with the tag ‘Nilofar,’ a name contributed by Pakistan.
PROJECTED LANDFALL
The US Naval Observatory said this morning that the system will remain largely stationary during the next 24 hours after which it will resume gathering strength.
During the phase, it will briefly swerve to the northeast before resuming the west-northwest track towards south Oman and adjoining Yemen.
A few models see the prospective cyclone making landfall where it is currently headed to, but others are of the view that the cyclone will stay for longer in the sea.
According to them, the cyclone would approach and even graze the coast of Oman before coming under the influence of a passing westerly system.
WESTERLY INFLUENCE
Originating farther west-northwest in the Mediterranean, the western disturbance would head for Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
The cyclone would latch on to the underbelly of the westerly system before being jettisoned over the Sindh and adjoining northwest Gujarat coast, say these models.
They estimate that it would grow to a very severe cyclone ahead of landfall, on a par with cyclone Hudhud that hit India’s east coast 12 days ago.
This is the second cyclone to form in the Arabian Sea this year after ‘Nanauk’ that coincided with the onset of the southwest monsoon earlier in June.

Gold struggles on stronger economic data  higher equitiesGold struggles on stronger economic data, higher equities
A Ananthalakshmi     Singapore   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 11:15 IST
Photo: Reuters
Gold steadied on Monday but failed to make any recovery from three straight days of losses as stronger global economic data and higher equities curbed the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Asian equities rose, taking heart from upbeat earnings and US economic data that eased global growth fears and sharpened risk appetite. The results of stress tests on European banks at the weekend were received calmly in the market.
Gold's outlook this week will depend on a Federal Reserve policy meeting , when the US central bank is widely expected to end its bond-buying stimulus, OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said.
The Fed's two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will also be watched for clues on whether any slowdown in Europe or elsewhere could affect the central bank's monetary policy.
"In addition, the ECB stress test which gave most of its 130 banks a clean bill of health may continue to dampen safe-haven demand in gold. All these, and accounting for the relatively stronger greenback for the past month, should continue to inject downside risk for bullion," Gan said.
Spot gold was steady at $1,230.86 an ounce at 0309 GMT but isn't far from a one-week low of $1,226.17 reached last week.
The metal's losses come after global equities posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013 last week, while the US dollar also strengthened.
Data on Friday showed that new US home sales rose to a six-year high and Britain's economy expanded 0.7 percent in the third quarter, easing fears over a global slowdown. Strong corporate earnings also helped push equities higher.
Bullion traders were also closely watching investors' positions in gold funds. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.6 per cent to 745.39 tonnes on Friday.
Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish futures and option bets in gold for a second straight week, as the price of the precious metal rallied in the week up to October 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

BHEL, Dr Reddy's, GAIL, Coal India and Tata Power were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were HUL, Tata Motors, ONGC, Tata Steel and Hindalco.
Regulatory probes
Shares of companies facing regulatory probes led the Sensex downtrend.
DLF shares were down 7.84 per cent on concerns that the company may face a probe by the new Government in Haryana.
Jindal Steel and Power was down 7.9 per cent following reports that the CBI has started a fresh inquiry against unknown officials of the company for alleged diversion of forest land in Jharkhand for mining purposes.
Cairn India fell 3.65 per cent as Brent crude dropped below $86 after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts. Investors were worried as lower crude oil prices can hit the revenues of oil explorers.
Defence equipment makers rally
Shares of companies involved in defence sector rallied as much as 8.6 per cent today after projects worth Rs 80,000 crore were cleared by the government.
Defence projects worth Rs 80,000 crore were cleared by the Government on Saturday which decided that six submarines will be made indigenously and over 8,000 Israeli anti-tank guided missiles and 12 upgraded Dornier surveillance aircraft will be purchased.
Bharat Electronics was up 0.39 per cent and BEML gained 4.98 per cent. Bharat Heavy Electricals was up 4.98 per cent, and Larsen and Toubro gained 0.48 per cent.
European shares
Euro zone banks led European shares higher on Monday after the results of sector-wide financial health checks painted a brighter picture than many investors had expected.
The Euro STOXX banking index rose 1.1 per cent after Sunday's European Central Bank review concluded that capital holes identified at the end of last year had since then chiefly been plugged, leaving only a relatively €10 billion to be raised.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.7 per cent at 1,321.20 points at 0823 GMT.

New York Governor outlines policy for EbolaquarantineNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, speaks as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie listens at a news conference. (source: AP)
By: Associated Press | New York | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:21 pm
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has fleshed out guidelines for the mandatory, 21-day quarantining of medical workers returning from West Africa that he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered two days earlier, bringing the state closer in line with federal protocols.
Cuomo detailed the state’s protocols at a nighttime news conference with New York City’s mayor last night after the Obama administration said it expressed concerns to Cuomo and Christie about their states’ mandatory Ebola quarantines. The announcement also comes amid sharp criticism of the treatment of a nurse returning from Sierrra Leone who was forcibly quarantined in a New Jersey hospital isolation unit even though she said had no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola.
Under the outlined New York guidelines, medical professionals who have had contact with Ebola patients will be quarantined at home and receive twice-daily monitoring if they have no symptoms. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials. The state will also pay for any lost compensation, if they are not paid by a volunteer organization.
Cuomo had criticized Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, for not obeying a 21-day voluntary quarantine. But on Sunday, he called the health care workers “heroes” and said his administration would encourage more medical workers to volunteer to fight Ebola.
Meanwhile, Kaci Hickox, the first nurse forcibly quarantined in New Jersey under the state’s new policy, said in a telephone interview with CNN that her isolation at a hospital was “inhumane,” adding: “We have to be very careful about letting politicians make health decisions.”
Saying the federal health guidelines are inadequate, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine program Friday for medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa, either in their homes or in medical facilities, and Illinois soon followed suit. Twenty-one days is the incubation period for Ebola.
Sunday night, Christie also stressed that home confinement would be used for New Jersey residents and others when possible.
“The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home.
Non-residents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey,” said a statement from Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts.

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Future Supply Chains, part of Kishore Biyani’s Future Group, will acquire logistics start-up firm Brattle Foods for an undisclosed amount.
As per the agreement between the two firms, Brattle Food will merge with Future Supply Chains (FSC) and shareholders GTI Capital and Epiphany Ventures will get some shareholding in the Future Group company.

Snowman had raised a little over Rs 200 crore through an initial public offerings last month.

UCO Bank identifies Kingfisher Air as wilful defaulterUCO Bank identifies Kingfisher Air as wilful defaulter

Kolkata, Oct 27:  
City-based UCO Bank today said it has “identified” Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines as a “wilful defaulter” and will be sending a notice to the defunct carrier.
“We have identified KFA as a wilful defaulter. We are in the process of sending a notice to the company in this regard,” a source in the bank told PTI.
Other banks like State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank are also mulling this route.
United Bank of India has already declared KFA a ‘wilful defaulter’ for defaulting on a loan of Rs 350 crore.
UCO Bank will also send a notice to the company which had furnished a corporate guarantee for a loan of around Rs 450 crore, the source said.
As per RBI guidelines, a wilful defaulter tag would be given if it is found that a loan taken is diverted for some other use rather than for which it was availed, as well as the default is made in spite of having the ability to repay it.

Ahmedabad, Oct 27:  
Vadodara-based Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd today informed that the company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Alembic Global Holding, will acquire 49 per cent stake in Algeria’s Adwiya Mami SARL. This will make a quick entry for Alembic into the Algerian market.
The company did not disclose the financial details of the deal.
Alembic Global Holding (AGH) will invest to the extent of 49 per cent equity of Adwiya Mami. After the conclusion of the deal, the company will be renamed as Alembic Mami SPA, an official statement said.
However, the shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals fell nearly 4 per cent on Monday to close at Rs 406.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
“The investment in Adwia Mami will give AGH a quick entry to the attractive Algerian market, which is a large African market with a size of $3 billion (of which 70 per cent is generic and 30 per cent is innovator market),” an Alembic statement said.
At present, there are entry barriers and the local manufacturing units get a distinct advantage in marketing the products. Imports are prohibited once there is a local manufacturing, the company said.
Adwia Mami owns a latest formulation plant with annual capacity of 1.2 billion oral solids. The plant has been designed and developed by a leading European pharmaceutical company in line with the cGMP requirements. The plant has enough headroom for future expansion, Alembic said in a BSE filing.
Alembic Mami SPA will be jointly run by Alembic & Mami with equal representation from both on the board. The board has appointed Tagreed Alshunar as the first CEO of the company. A Jordanian national and professional with over 20 years of experience in the pharma industry, Alshunar will be the Alembic nominee.

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Mutual fund (MF) managers dropped their exposure in bank stocks to Rs 55,398 crore in September, after raising it for seven consecutive months.
According to the latest data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, MF investments in bank stocks as on September 30 declined to Rs 55,398 crore, accounting for 18.84 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 2.94 lakh crore.
In comparison, the MF industry’s exposure to banking sector had reached an all-time of Rs 56,625 crore in August this year. However, MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs last month with an exposure of Rs 31,834 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,908 crore), auto (Rs 18,892 crore) and finance (Rs 16,358 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market and the current decline is mainly due to profit-booking.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in banking stocks by equity fund managers and fund infusion has grown from Rs 30,339 crore in January to Rs 56,625 crore in August.
In percentage term, exposure has risen from 16.6 per cent to 20.10 per cent during the period.

Give preference to existing coal block allocatees in auction process: AssochamGive preference to existing coal block allocatees in auction process: Assocham

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India has suggested that the Government should give preference to companies who have an operational or soon to be operational end-use project but have had their coal blocks cancelled.
Assocham has written to the Prime Minsiter Office saying that coal blocks already allotted for end-use steel projects should be auctioned only for steel projects, while those for power projects should be auctioned only for power projects.
“The reserve price and upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable resource and not on the basis of geological reserves,” said the industry chamber in a statement.
“Clearances accorded to the existing coal blocks should automatically get transferred to the new allocatees. Obtaining these clearances again will lead to considerable delays in commencement of production from mines and adversely affect the end-use project,” the statement added.

Reforms pushing up Sensex to one week highUpdated: October 21, 2014 17:08 IST
Reforms pushing up Sensex to one week high
PTI
stocks
Markets rose for the third straight session today with Sensex gaining 146 points to end at over one-week high of 26,575.65 and Nifty jumping 48 points to regain 7,900-mark led by power, metal and banking stocks after government laid a broad roadmap for coal mine allocation.
In line with government’s initiatives, stocks of Jindal Steel Power, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Sesa Sterlite attracted good buying and surged up to 7.46 per cent, pushing up Sensex.
Besides, revival of buying by foreign funds after remaining net sellers on the Indian bourses for some time was another positive factor driving up markets, brokers said.
The 30-share index gathered another 145.80 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close at 26,575.65 after shuttling between 26,615.41 and 26,407.00. This is its highest closing since 26,637.28 on October 9.
The BSE gauge has rallied by over 576 points in 3 days.
After announcing diesel deregulation and new gas prices last week, the Modi government yesterday promulgation of an Ordinance to facilitate e-auction of coal blocks for private companies for captive use and allot mines directly to state and central PSUs. The move comes against the backdrop of the Supreme Court last month quashing allocation of 214 coal blocks to various companies since 1993.
“Revival of buying by foreign funds, helped pre-Diwali rally to gather further momentum”, said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based stock broker.
The National Stock Exchange index Nifty, reclaimed the key 7,900-mark by surging 48.35 points, or 0.61 per cent, to close at 7,927.75 after moving between 7,936.60 and 7,874.35.
In the 30-Sensex constituents, 22 ended higher, while 8 shares ended lower led by Coal India, ONGC, RIL and Infosys.
In broader markets, Financial Technologies (FTIL) stock tumbled 20 per cent after government ordered merger of crisis-ridden NSEL with holding firm, FTIL.
Sectorally, BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 2.63 per cent, followed by Power (2.55 per cent), Metal (1.71 per cent), Capital Goods (1.38 per cent), Banking (1.2 per cent) and Consumer Durables (1.18 per cent) among others.
Globally, mixed closing on other Asian markets and higher opening in Europe, also influenced the sentiment.
Meanwhile, provisional data released by Indian exchanges showed that Foreign Portfolio Investors bought shares worth a net of Rs 1,040.08 crore on Monday.

Was IAF notification on Xiaomi phones based on old F-Secure report Here is everything you need to knowPrint
There might not be a new security scare with Xiaomi phones, but the Chinese company is moving its servers out of Beijing.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 5:33 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 12:38 pm
Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi made its entry in the Indian smartphone market with its Mi 3 smartphone in July. The company made headlines after the Mi 3 handset sold like hot cakes on Flipkart. After just six weeks of massive sales in the country, Xiaomi discontinued the Mi 3 temporarily to give mileage to the much cheaper RedMi 1S smartphone, which arrived in September.
What is the data snooping concern regarding Xiaomi phones?
Before the launch of Redmi 1S, software security company F-Secure published a report in August stating that the Xiaomi RedMi 1S “sent the telco name to the server api.account.xiaomi.com. It also sent IMEI and phone number to the same server. The phone number of the contacts added to the phone book and also from SMS messages received was also forwarded.”
Commenting on the Mi Cloud service, the report stated, “the IMSI details were sent to api.account.xiaomi.com, as well as the IMEI and phone number.”
F-Secure published another report in a week, saying that Xiaomi had addressed the privacy concerns related to “MIUI Cloud Messaging Platform” by releasing an OTA update which made the messaging service “an opt-in feature, rather than a default one.”
The report confirmed that after the OTA update, the security experts “did not see any data being sent out from the phone.” Also, it stated that on logging into Mi Cloud, “base-64 encoded traffic is now sent.”
The updated report concluded by stating that Mi Cloud data was “now sent over HTTPS rather than HTTP, as seen in our previous testing.”
Is there still an issue?
Su Gim Goh, Security Advisor, APAC, F-Secure during his visit to New Delhi on September 1, the same day when Xiaomi RedMi 1S went for sale for the first time for Flipkart First subscribers, confirmed in an exclusive interaction with IndianExpress.com that Xiaomi has rectified the privacy issues raised by it. “The entire privacy issue was related to Xiaomi’s cloud messaging service. Previously, the cloud service got activated by default without asking for the user’s permission. So, related personal data were sent from the phone to Xiaomi’s servers in China. After we alerted about this privacy concern, Xiaomi has made the cloud service as an opt-in feature and not by default, said Goh.
As with every cloud service, data is obviously sent to servers located outside the country with the user’s permission. Goh further confirmed that the even if users opt for the Xiaomi’s cloud service, the data is now being sent over secured HTTPS than HTTP. “The privacy concerns were addressed by Xiaomi quickly and now it’s all good,” added Goh.
So, why did Indian Air Force issue a notification against using Xiaomi phones?
The Sunday Standard recently reported that the Indian Air Force (IAF) has notified its 1,75,000 personnel and their family members not to use Xiaomi smartphones on account of ‘spying’. The report said the IAF alert was based on the inputs from CERT-In.
What’s surprising is that the IAF notification seems to be hinting on the same report released by F-Secure in August to which the software security company had already confirmed that Xiaomi has rectified the issue and the company no longer breaches privacy.
Now, there can be two situations- either, the privacy problem with Xiaomi has returned or the IAF notification is based on older reports. We believe it to be the latter, as no new reports have surfaced since the F-Secure clarification in September.
Is this snooping or is this normal?
In every cloud service, be it Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp or in this case, MIUI Cloud Messaging Platform, data is sent and stored in servers outside the country. Xiaomi stores the data in servers based in Beijing. There is no rule or regulation from the government stating that cloud service providers will have to store data within the country only. So, if any user opts for any sort of cloud service, then its totally up to the service provider as to where they will store the data.
How has Xiaomi responded to the latest issue?
According to Reuters , Xiaomi has announced that it is moving some data of non-Chinese customers away from its servers in Beijing in several phases to Amazon Inc servers in the US and data centres in Singapore due to the recent privacy considerations. This may be a pure coincidence, or Xiaomi may have actually reacted to the IAF notification. Anyway, for a company hoping to make a strong presence across the globe it is highly unlikely that Xiaomi will do something that will put off its customers or affect its business in the slightest way. Xiaomi has sold just over half a million handsets (Mi 3 and RedMi 1S combined) in India.

5 more Ebola vaccines to be tested in March: WHOvaccines
The agency, however, warns that it’s not clear whether any of these will work against the deadly virus that has already killed over 4,800 people this year.
The World Health Organisation says millions of doses of two experimental Ebola vaccines could be ready in 2015 and five more experimental vaccines will start being tested in March.
Still, the agency warned it’s not clear whether any of these will work against the deadly virus that has already killed over 4,800 people this year.
Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny from the agency told reporters there could be millions of doses of an Ebola vaccine in 2015 if early tests prove that the two leading candidates are safe and effective.
If the early trials hint at success, larger trials testing the vaccines in West Africa could begin as soon as December, Dr. Kieny said. She said five other possible Ebola vaccines should start being tested in March.

Auction all coal blocks in one go: Assochamcoal
The reserve price and the upfront payment should be based on the mineable reserves
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) in a letter to Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, has suggested that auction of all cancelled coal blocks should be done by March 2015 so that the operations of existing end-use plants would not be affected. It has also suggested that the auction should be done either at one go or majority of them should be put on the block together. The industry body has sought a meeting with the Minister so that it could make a presentation and put forth its views. The reserve price and the upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable reserves and not on the basis of geological reserves, Assocham suggested.
Coal blocks earlier allotted for power-plants should only be auctioned for power plants while those allotted to steel plants should be reserved for that sector.
Assocham felt that the retrospective payment of Rs.295 a tonne penalty was erroneous as CAG had calculated that figure, taking into account all grades of coal.Assocham also pointed out that the government-suggested penalty was for retention of the 40 operational blocks and not for cancellation. It further suggested that the government could file for a review of the order.
The auction process should accord the right of first refusal to the existing allocates, who have end-use plants which are either operational or are going to become so soon, Assocham said.

China to watch Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung visit closely
Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung will arrive in India on Monday for a two-day visit, and the bilateral agenda will be seen as another strong assertion of India’s interests in the South China Sea. China will be closely watching the visit.
The Hindu has learnt that India and Vietnam will sign three agreements, one an MoU on prospecting by OVL (ONGC Videsh Ltd.) in two more fields in the South China Sea. Discussions will be held on supplying naval vessels to Vietnam. Both issues had seen statements of concern from Beijing in the past. However, officials confirmed that the current blocks under discussion to be signed during this visit, part of a batch of five offered by Vietnam in November, are in Vietnamese territorial waters, and not disputed.
The agreements, which will include oil exploration, economic and cultural cooperation, will be signed after meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Nguyen in Delhi on Tuesday.
During President Pranab Mukherjee’s visit to Vietnam last month, India signed a defence agreement extending a $100-million line of credit to the country. The agreement, which came just ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India, sparked off a Foreign Ministry statement in Beijing that China would not “support any agreement” that dealt with any “waters administered by China, or is not approved by China.”
According to a source, Mr. Nguyen and his delegation will discuss placing orders for offshore patrol vehicles at Indian shipyards using the $100-million line of credit.
India has been boosting Vietnamese naval capabilities in the contentious waters.

Letters that tell story of Bapu and Miras troubled relationshipPrint
Written by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:29 am
January 24, 1929, Muzaffarpur: Beloved Bapu — And now today I have your long Monday letter! How spoiled I am!!
October 27, 1928, Sevashram, Benares: But after all, my beloved Bapu knows everything that is in my head — he knows even better then I know myself!
April 7, 1933, Sabarmati Central Prison, Ahmedabad: “I hear you have got a telescope now-a-days! I once looked at the stars and planets through a very small one of my uncle’s & even that was a wonderful sight. Every night as I look at the starts I think how you, too, must be looking at them from Yervada — and I feel, in my mind’s fancy as if I saw you in the reflection of their light.”
These are excerpts from ‘Beloved Bapu: The Gandhi-Mirabehn Correspondence’, a book by Tridip Suhrud and Thomas Weber that claims to bring out for the first time letters between Gandhi and Madeline Slade or Mira, the daughter of a British admiral who became the Mahatma’s disciple.
The book, on this companionship of 23 years, says on the flap, “Mira and Gandhi shared a connection that was as close and loving as it was troubled. She was a woman of tremendous industry and drive, a quality that Gandhi grasped and admired greatly. However, he was also deeply ambivalent about the obsessive nature of her love — indeed, her infatuation — chastising her sharply for her “idolatry” on the one hand, and apologising for his harshness and keeping her close on the other.”
Suhrud is director, Sabarmati Memorial Trust and a Sahitya Akademi winner who is known as a new age “authority” on Gandhian studies. Weber is an Australia-based author who teaches political science and has written several books on Gandhi.
The letters from Gandhi published in the book are already in public domain while those from Mira are being revealed for the first time; they are under the custody of Sabarmati Ashram.
Most of the letters are a mundane detailing of their daily life — from their trips to a number of places and even the problems that this causes to their diet, some inducing constipation — and yet the book reveals some intimate moments, especially the “unfulfilled” wish of Mira who had longed for a “life in the Himalaya with her dearest Bapu”.
In one letter, Gandhi tells Mira that he prefers to write “love letters” on Mondays, which Mira awaits impatiently.
There are even some Hindi lessons for Mira. “The negative participle should always go with the verb, when the verb is to be negative and when the subject has to be qualified by a long phrase, the qualifying phrase should precede the subject,” Gandhi writes from Bangalore on July 17, 1927.
In a chapter in the book titled, “A Catch-22 relationship” the editors note: “Some may argue that there could have been some element of latent or repressed sexuality involved. Certainly some of his letters to Mira do sound like love letters as hers to him undoubtedly were.”
The letters of Mira are more revealing than continued…

Brent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecastBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecast

Reuters Pump Jacks are seen at sunrise near Bakersfield, California. Goldman’s projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank’s oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market’s long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Tokyo, Oct 27:  
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecast for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman’s projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank’s oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market’s long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman’s forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
“The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess,’’ he said.
“It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it’s a bargain now.’’
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: “The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts ... I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman.’’
Higher supplies
The 12-member OPEC meets on November 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far, only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals that it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Gold prices fell by Rs 350 to Rs 27,450 per ten gram in the national capital on Monday, following a long weekend and ending of festive season with demand drying up amidst a weak global trend.
Silver also eased by Rs 35 to Rs 38,200 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said fall in demand from jewellers and retailers due to end of festive season and a weak global trend where gold retreated from a six-week high as investors expected the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying programme this week, eroding safe-haven demand, mainly pulled down precious metal prices here.

Rajam Krishnan: A Relentless RaconteurTamil literature
I think a writer dies when he/she stops writing. The common phenomenon of death does not apply to them. Rajam Krishnan, (1925-2014) once prolific and a writer with a mission and purpose passed away recently at the Ramachandra Medical College.
Rajam Krishnan’s life once again is a testimony to how literature can be created, irrespective of educational or professional qualifications. Born in a conservative Brahmin family near Tiruchi, she got married at a very young age to Krishnan and started writing at the age of 16.
Her first story ‘Oosiyum Unarvum’ (Needle and Sense) won an international award for the Tamil short story in 1952. It was given by the New York Herald Tribune. In 1953, her novel ‘Pen Kural’ (Voice of the Woman) was the recipient of the Kalaimagal Narayanaswami Iyer novel. In 1958, she won the Ananda Vikatan novel prize for her ‘Malargal.’ The Sahitya Academy award was given to her novel ‘Verukku Neer.’
These apart, she conquered the writing world with several other awards such as the Soviet Land Nehru Prize, Ilaykkiya Sinthanai, Bharatiya Basha Parishad, Tamil Nadu Government award, Thiru.Vi.Ka prize, Saraswati Puraskar, and Akshara Award to name a few. She had also written a host of short stories.
When I first read her novel ‘Malargal’ (Flowers) as a nine-year old boy, I could not understand much of its importance or layers. It was the story of a struggling, mentally disturbed teenage girl who had to find a life for herself. But, when I read the same novel after several years, seeing life and its vagaries, I could understand the pains and pangs of Chithra, the protagonist. The psychological impact on a orphaned young girl who yearns for love and affection was effectively portrayed in the novel, especially in a chapter titled, ‘Iruttarai Payir’ (sapling in the dark room). I remember to have cried after reading it.
Rajam Krishanan’s novel later moved on to a different plane; she chose a topic or subject, visit the place, meet the people and then put them in a novel. Her ‘Mullum Malarnthathu’ (The Blooms of Thorn) centred on the rehabilitation of a dacoit for which she visited the places and forests in Madhya Pradesh and met many. ‘Karippu Manigal’ (Salty Pearls) depicted the lives of people working in the salt pans. ‘Setril Manithargal’ (People of Slush) narrated the trials of farmers. She had done extensive research on female foeticide and written the novel ‘Mannagatthu Poonthuligal’ in the most touching manner.
Most of her later year writings revealed an inclination to communism and feminism and a mind strongly against the changing styles of modernity and living styles. ‘Alaigal,’ a novella on child psychology, showed the turbulent mind of a young girl, who did not have parents and hence lived under the care of others. ‘Verukku Neer’ showed how the Gandhian ideals were crushed under the materialistic world even in the 1970. ‘Valikkaram’ was a love story expertly woven in the backdrop of Goa liberation struggle; the spill over was found in another novel, ‘Puyalin Maiyam’(The Eye of the Storm). ‘Koottukkunjugal’ dealt with child labour rampant in Sivakasi and ‘Idibadugal’ showed the changing values in our lives. She also authored two biographies - one on Dr Rangachari and another on Maniyammai.
Since Krishnan was an electrical engineer and his job involved transfers to different places, Rajam’s stories and novels depict vividly the lives in Ooty, Goa, and Chennai. ‘Kurinji Then’, is a beautiful novel on Padugas of Nilgiris spanning two generations. One cannot but feel moved while reading the last chapter. The only foreign land she visited was Russia and that was also figured in her novel ‘Annaiyar Bhoomi’ (Land of Mothers).
She did not change her views and writing style with the fast changing times. Her Tamil in later days became very chaste and tough and she preferred to use complex sentences and phrases. This is a rare phenomena and in a way her strength as well. Personal problems took away her writing skills in the last phase of her life.
She was a great conversationalist and my personal experiences with her as a fan were very cordial and rewarding.
Those who have read Tamil books will find that her style and approach in the initial years and in the later stages will be different and yet underscoring the concept of feminism and the lofty ideals of life.
“My first pen name was Lekhini,” she told me once; she laughed and added: “Even 'Rajam Krishnan’ is not my real name.” I didn’t ask her what her real name was. What is after all in a name when your writings are immortal and speak a lot about you? But at this moment I wonder - what indeed was her real name?

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing business rankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:18 pm
The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Substitute non-essential imports  make in India: PMThe government is concerned by the surge in imports from China that has hit some of the domestic industries.
Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: October 25, 2014 1:05 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Union ministries to discourage “inessential imports” and leverage the country’s manufacturing skills in substituting them. Towards this end, the Union ministries are required to furnish status reports every quarter and also brief the Prime Minister.
A senior government official said that during a meeting with secretaries in the last week of September, Modi said that imports should be appraised on a regular basis and a significant part of it should be reduced, recognising India’s own capacity to manufacture these products. “Modi’s logic for pruning imports is in line with his ‘Make in India’ programme,” the official said.
“Modi has told half-a-dozen ministries to review the imports under their respective jurisdiction with a view to rationalise inessential imports within the premise of India’s international commitments under the World Trade Organization, while making all-out efforts to strengthen the nation’s capacity to produce such products domestically,” the official added. It is learnt that some of the ministries are steel, coal, petroleum, agriculture, telecom and IT. The concerned ministries will have to institutionalise a mechanism within their domain for regular review of imports to ensure that “trade deficit is not allowed to increase irrationally,” the official cited the Prime Minister as instructing these ministries.
“Commerce secretary Rajeev Kher has written to the concerned ministries on October 1 to depute a joint secretary level officer to coordinate with his ministry in this connection,” the official said. The government is concerned about the surge in imports from China that has hit some of the domestic industries hard.
The ministry of communications has already launched the ‘Digital India’ programme which includes rationalisation of tariff structure for LCD and LED TV panels and increasing the basic customs duty on telecom equipment.
Ministries dealing with metals and commodities have consistently flagged the growing imports from China that are hurting local industry.
The steel ministry has raised concerns over the burgeoning steel imports from China that has during the second quarter of FY15 exceeded “the historic (quarterly) high” of 90 million tonnes and has also demanded doubling import duty on value-added steel products.
As for minerals like coal and iron ore, legal and regulatory issues have turned India into a net importer of the two crucial minerals.

In Dantewada  Centre opens up another hill for iron ore miningRichest in the country, the site has one-third of NMDC’s total iron reserves.
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: October 25, 2014 1:10 am
The Union government has given forest clearance, which was pending for years, to India’s biggest public sector iron ore site in Bailadila hills of southern Chhattisgarh.
Situated in the Maoist-dominated forests of Dantewada district, the site, named Tenement Number 13, contains proven iron ore reserves of 319.6 MT.
Spread across just 317 hectares, the rich tenement holds nearly one-third of the total 995 MT proved iron ore reserves with public sector iron ore miner NMDC across the country. It has a production target of 10 MTPA (million tonnes per annum), nearly half of the present NMDC’s output of 25 MTPA.
The clearance came after Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh pursued the case with the Centre after the NDA came to power. Singh attributed the clearance to “speedier processes” of the Centre.
“The project will not only provide employment to nearly 2,000 people but will also be a source of raw material to sponge iron industries of Chhattisgarh leading to further employment and development. The Government of India with its speedier processes has been taking all necessary steps for development of Chhattisgarh,” Singh told The Indian Express.
While the forested hills of Bailadila have 14 proven iron ore sites, all containing world-class ore, NMDC has mining lease for only six -Number 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 14 NMZ.
Operations are yet to begin in Number 5 and 13 due to the Maoist threat. The rebels oppose mining activity in the region and have often been able to strike even inside the NMDC complex.
NMDC has been mining on two of the several hills of Bailadila for nearly 50 years and work will now begin on the third hill.
The mining will be undertaken by a joint venture company between NMDC and Chhattisgarh Mining Development Corporation.
“There is a scarcity of iron ore for plants in the state. Fresh areas were needed. It is a welcome step Though the present site is smaller in area, it has very good reserves, among the highest density in the country,” Anurag Diwan, joint director Mineral Administration, Chhattisgarh, said.
The present clearance marks the Stage One forest clearance.
Officials noted that the first stage is often difficult and the second and final clearance should be easily granted within a year. “Mining should begin in two-three years,” said an official. For decades, locals have been demanding that the minerals of Bastar should be mined by the people of the state.

We are well positioned in Indian enterprise market: BlackBerryPDAs and smartphones
Canadian handset maker BlackBerry believes it is “well positioned” for the multi-billion dollar Indian enterprise market armed with smartphones across multiple price points and end-to-end mobility solutions.
“Today, BlackBerry offers an unparalleled global infrastructure, a combination of assets that deliver security at every level and across multiple platforms and an array of value-added services like BBM. We see great opportunities ahead of us, and BlackBerry has an aggressive plan to continue to lead the enterprise mobility market,” BlackBerry Executive Chairman and CEO John Chen told PTI.
The Waterloo-headquartered firm is the clear leader in this market, with the most secure devices, software, servers and network, he added.
On the Indian market, Mr. Chen said: “We are also well positioned to provide our enterprise customers with the best, most secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions."
Mr. Chen said BlackBerry is aggressively targeting enterprise customers in India.
“In India specifically, we are aggressively targeting large, mid-level and small businesses alike. Late last year, we announced the opening of BlackBerry Enterprise Solutions (BES) Centres in Mumbai and Gurgaon as part of our focus on the enterprise mobility market,” he added.
These centres will cater to the needs of the enterprise customers and provide them with a walk-in experience of BlackBerry’s robust enterprise mobility management solutions, including BES10, Mr. Chen said.
“BlackBerry has a strong base in India, and we are continuing to build share in this priority market by listening to our customers and delivering the devices and mobile solutions they want.”
For the quarter ended August 30, 2014, BlackBerry posted revenue of $916 million with about 46 per cent coming from the hardware business, 46 per cent from services and 8 per cent from software and other revenue.

Focus on flagship schemes; Anant Geete leads Sena team
Ahead of the crucial winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the NDA’s close to 400-odd MPs on Sunday evening that he expected them to take his government’s “pro-poor” initiatives pro-actively to the people, as these were not the exclusive property of some political parties/governments (a snide reference to the predecessor UPA dispensation). He also said he expected them to conduct themselves in a “righteous” manner, never indulging in any activity that may bring them into disrepute.
Mr Modi’s pointed message to his flock was delivered over high tea — attended, interestingly enough by the entire Shiv Sena contingent — on the lawns of 7 Race Course Road. It was the first such gathering of NDA MPs, but Mr Modi promised that this would become a regular feature.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, playing master of ceremonies, urged MPs to contribute to enhancing the quality of debates in Parliament, explained the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s objectives, and announced that Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 would be celebrated annually as Ekta Diwas, when all government servants will take the unity pledge. BJP veteran L, K. Advani congratulated party president Amit Shah for the election victories in Maharashtra and Haryana, while presenting him with a shawl.
For two hours, from 4 to 6 pm, the focus was on the importance of all ministers and MPs being fully briefed on key programmes so that, as a government source put it, “elected representatives are empowered to become effective political communicators” both inside and outside Parliament.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley briefed MPs on the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana, the recent ordinance on coal and Union Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari on the Adarsh Gram Yojana; among other presentations.

Brazil s Rousseff wins second termRIO DE JANEIRO, October 27, 2014

Brazil's Rousseff wins second term
AP
election
Left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race Brazil has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, giving the juggernaut Workers’ Party its fourth-straight presidential victory and the chance to extend its social transformation of the globe’s fifth-largest country.
Ms. Rousseff took 51.6 percent of the votes and centre-right challenger Aecio Neves had 48.4 percent, with almost all ballots counted. The result reflected a nation deeply divided after what many called the most acrimonious campaign since the return to democracy, with charges of corruption, nepotism and ample personal barbs thrown by both sides.
The re-elected leader faces an immense challenge of reigniting a stalled economy, improving woeful public services that ignited huge anti-government protests last year, and trying to push political reforms through a highly fragmented congress where the governing coalition has less support than it did four years ago.
Speaking in front of a banner that read “New Government, New Ideas” and a giant photo of Ms. Rousseff from her days as a militant who fought against Brazil’s long military regime, she thanked her supporters, starting with her political mentor and predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who picked her to take his place in 2010.
“My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,” Ms. Rousseff said. “I thank every Brazilian, without exception.”
She added that she “thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,” as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Ms. Rousseff sounded a conciliatory tone, saying during the live broadcast that she understood the heightened demands of Brazilians. “That’s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,” she said.
During the Workers’ Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programmes that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe’s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
“Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control. It is less likely she will be able to offer social inclusion and macroeconomic stability at the same time.”
The choice between Ms. Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender’s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
Ms. Rousseff and Neves fought bitterly to convince voters that they can deliver on both growth and social advances. This year’s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Neves had hammered at Ms. Rousseff over a widening kickback scandal Petrobras, with an informant telling investigators that the Workers’ Party directly benefited from the scheme.
Ms. Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
“We’ve worked so hard to better the lives of the people, and we won’t let anything in this world, not even in this crisis or all the pessimism, take away what they’ve conquered,” Ms. Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil’s biggest city of Sao Paulo, thousands of Workers’ Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Ms. Rousseff’s campaign jingles.
“I’m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,” said Liliane Viana, a 56-year-old retired federal government worker. “I was afraid we were going to move backward. Now I am extremely excited.”
Neves was a two-term governor in Minas Gerais state who left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating. He surged at the end of the presidential race to score a surprise second—place position and force a runoff vote against Ms. Rousseff.
Speaking from his hometown of Belo Horizonte, he thanked the “more than 50 million Brazilians” who voted for him.
“I will be eternally grateful to each and every one of you who allowed me to dream again of the construction of a new project,” he said. “I fought the good fight. I fulfilled my mission and I kept the faith.”

New York Governor outlines policy for Ebola quarantineNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, speaks as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie listens at a news conference. (source: AP)
By: Associated Press | New York | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:21 pm
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has fleshed out guidelines for the mandatory, 21-day quarantining of medical workers returning from West Africa that he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered two days earlier, bringing the state closer in line with federal protocols.
Cuomo detailed the state’s protocols at a nighttime news conference with New York City’s mayor last night after the Obama administration said it expressed concerns to Cuomo and Christie about their states’ mandatory Ebola quarantines. The announcement also comes amid sharp criticism of the treatment of a nurse returning from Sierrra Leone who was forcibly quarantined in a New Jersey hospital isolation unit even though she said had no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola.
Under the outlined New York guidelines, medical professionals who have had contact with Ebola patients will be quarantined at home and receive twice-daily monitoring if they have no symptoms. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials. The state will also pay for any lost compensation, if they are not paid by a volunteer organization.
Cuomo had criticized Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, for not obeying a 21-day voluntary quarantine. But on Sunday, he called the health care workers “heroes” and said his administration would encourage more medical workers to volunteer to fight Ebola.
Meanwhile, Kaci Hickox, the first nurse forcibly quarantined in New Jersey under the state’s new policy, said in a telephone interview with CNN that her isolation at a hospital was “inhumane,” adding: “We have to be very careful about letting politicians make health decisions.”
Saying the federal health guidelines are inadequate, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine program Friday for medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa, either in their homes or in medical facilities, and Illinois soon followed suit. Twenty-one days is the incubation period for Ebola.
Sunday night, Christie also stressed that home confinement would be used for New Jersey residents and others when possible.
“The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home.
Non-residents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey,” said a statement from Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts.

Nilofar is now a severe cyclone  to cross Naliya in Gujarat on FridayVery severe cyclone Nilofar may weaken ahead of landfall

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 27:  
Arabian Sea Cyclone Nilofar is now a very severe cyclone, only one step away from class-topping super cyclone status, an India Met update said this afternoon.
But all available indications suggest that Nilofar will wind down to severe cyclone status due to a combination of adverse factors.
PEAK WINDS
Westerly winds associated with the western disturbance that steers Nilofar towards Naliya in Gujarat would be the primary culprit for the weakening.
Since Nilofar will hitch a ride on the westerly system, it would get directly impacted from the top as opposing winds tear into it.
A second reason is dry air intrusion from around the land – the cyclone would be in close proximity to mainland Pakistan and western India as it runs in.
Third are the cooler waters towards the north Gujarat coast, which caps evaporation and moisture build that is needed to fuel the cyclone system.
YELLOW MESSAGE
The Met located Nilofar to 1,170 km southwest of Naliya (Gujarat) and 1,230 km south-southwest of Karachi (Pakistan) at 1.30 pm.
In a ‘yellow message’ (warning), the Met said that the coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch would receive rainfall at most places from Thursday morning.
Isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also commence along these areas around the same time.
The rainfall intensity would increase gradually with heavy to very heavy fall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls from later in the night.

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
In order to decongest the national capital, the Centre today announced plans for a rail network on Delhi’s lifeline Ring Road linking various areas in the city.
“There is a lot of traffic jam in Delhi everyday. We are considering to bring ‘Ring Road Train’, which will help us decongest roads in the national capital,” Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said here.
The Centre also has plans to construct several flyovers, elevated highways and ring roads across the city.
“In the upcoming days, many new flyovers, more ring roads, expansion of Metro lines and elevated highways will come up in Delhi following which congestion will be reduced in the national capital,” Naidu said at a function here.
The Minister said that to suggest necessary measures for these projects, he has constituted a committee led by the Urban Development Secretary.
“This committee will submit its final report within 45 days and thereafter, the Centre and Delhi Government will work on these projects,” he said.
“We are also working on a project which will allow vehicles coming from Haryana and wanting to go to other states to bypass national capital, and such vehicles don’t need to enter the city due to which there will be no congestion in Delhi,” Naidu said.
The Central Government has already set a deadline of three years to complete the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressway, which aims to decongest Delhi roads.
The two expressways — each about 135 km long — were planned in 2006 following a Supreme Court order to form a ring road outside Delhi for channelling non-Delhi bound traffic bypassing the national capital.
Eastern Peripheral Expressway envisages providing signal-free connectivity between Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gautam Budh Nagar (Greater Noida) and Palwal, while the Western Expressway connects Kundli to Palwal via Manesar in Haryana.

Tree plantation in Koraput to compensate for loss in CycloneHudhudPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Koraput (odisha) | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:32 pm
To compensate for the loss of trees in Cyclone Hudhud, Jeypore forest division in Koraput district has decided to take up plantation in over 200 hectares of forest land.
Officials said the thick forest cover of Ramagiri and Boipariguda forest range under the division was lost due to the cyclone which hit the district on October 12.
“Though it is impossible to regain the lost trees as those were decades old, efforts will be made to cover more forest land under plantation. As per a preliminary report prepared by the department the new plantation will be done in over 200 hectares. If more suitable patches are found then it will also be covered under plantation,” said Jeypore divisional forest officer Bijaya Kumar Acharya.
As per the damage report of the forest department at least 1,765 valuable trees comprising sal, teak, eucalyptus and chakunda varieties in the district were uprooted in the cyclone.
“As many as 629 sal and teak trees which were decades old have been uprooted in the Gupteswar forest range. As per preliminary assessment report the loss of trees is around Rs one crore,” Acharya said.
Officials said hundreds of new tress which were two to three years-old had also been uprooted in the cyclone and it will take several years to compensate the loss of green cover in real terms.
“Trees in large numbers belonging to private parties had also been uprooted in the cyclone, but assessment of those trees has not been done,” he said.
However, the most pressing problem now was shortage of staff which is impeding the removal of the fallen trees from the forests while both villagers and timber mafias are targeting the salvaged trees.
“As it will take months together to remove the uprooted trees we have formed mobile squads to keep an eye on them. With limited manpower we are trying to collect the uprooted trees from the forest at the earliest,” Acharya said.

Obama taking action to push manufacturing... 
October 27, 2014 06:05 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is expanding his push for increased manufacturing in the United States by directing federal money toward new technologies, apprenticeship programs and competitions designed to assist small manufacturers.
The White House is announcing the executive actions Monday as part of the day's focus on manufacturing, which administration officials consider one of the bright spots of the economic recovery.
The measures would:
— Allow the Pentagon, NASA and the Energy and Agriculture departments to collectively spend $300 million to develop advanced materials and new technology for sensors and digital manufacturing.
— Direct $100 million in Labor Department funds for apprenticeship programs aimed at advanced manufacturing.
— Authorize the Commerce Department to spend $150 million over five years in 10 states to help manufacturers adopt and market new technologies.

Agenda of Japan s Abe challenged as scandals mount...and
versions
TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's honeymoon with Japan's voters is fading as scandals and a slowing economic recovery take a toll on his popularity and hinder progress on his policy agenda.
The resignations of two ministers in Abe's newly reshuffled Cabinet and reports that political funds of the replacement trade minister were used in a visit to a sex show bar were just the start.
Those reports got people digging into the riches to be found in publicly available political funding disclosures. They show some lawmakers spending hundreds and often thousands of dollars a night on visits to restaurants and mahjong parlors, while ordinary households are struggling to keep up with rising costs for food, heating and other necessities.
The most recent opinion polls show Abe's approval ratings slipping to around 50 percent. They had mostly been in the 60s since 2013.
The controversies are unwelcome distraction at a time of sharpening divisions within the ruling party over whether Abe should press ahead with a sales tax hike next year that is needed to help fix the tattered finances of the world's third-largest economy.
News of possible election law and political funding violations forced the resignations last week of Abe's justice and trade ministers, both among the five women who had just taken office in the early September Cabinet reshuffle that showcased Abe's commitment to stronger roles for women in leadership.
"It's a serious setback. So much of the Abe Cabinet's shine was due to its aura of invincibility and inevitability," said Michael Cucek, a Tokyo-based analyst and fellow at Temple University Japan.
Troubles over campaign funds and related issues have long contributed to Japan's famous "revolving door" politics. Abe's first term as prime minister, in 2006-2007, ended when he was driven from office by scandals and health problems after just a year.
Abe got a rare second chance when his Liberal Democrats regained power from the Democratic Party in December 2012. Since then, the LDP's coalition with the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito, or Clean Government Party, has established majorities in both houses of the parliament.
This time around, Abe has cultivated a confident, relaxed style of leadership, repeatedly declaring "Japan is back!" while his chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga endeavors to keep their gaffe-prone allies more or less in line.
"Until this crisis it looked pretty certain he was just going to cruise," Cucek said. "Now that politics as usual has returned we could see the same sort of decay that we've seen in the past," he said.
Trade minister Yuko Obuchi, a rising star and daughter of a former prime minister, resigned on Oct. 20 after admitting to discrepancies in reporting of her political funding. Justice Minister Midori Matsushima also quit after the opposition filed a criminal complaint alleging that the distribution of "uchiwa," or hand-held fans, to her supporters violated a ban on gift giving.
Obuchi's successor as trade minister, Yoichi Miyazawa, then drew fire over an 18,230 yen ($170) tab listed in his political funds accounting for an evening's entertainment at a sadism and masochism themed establishment in his home city of Hiroshima. Miyazawa and his staff say he did not visit the club himself, and the money was paid back.
The next flap was over Miyazawa's ownership, as the minister responsible for the power industry, of shares in Tokyo Electric Power Co., whose Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant suffered meltdowns after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Miyazawa said Friday he had put the shares, worth about $2,000, in a trust.
Over the weekend, reports noted that political funds of Taro Aso, a former prime minister who is now finance minister, were used to pay monthly tabs of up to 1.5 million yen ($14,000) to a mahjong parlor in the Roppongi nightclub district.
Opposition questioning over such issues in the parliament is slowing work on the main priorities of the current Diet session: policies to revive languishing rural regions and increase female employment to help compensate for the aging and shrinking of the overall workforce.
"Abe is perceived to have made a mess of the early September reshuffle and is faced longer term with added popular doubt given a timetable of awkward policy decisions," said Stephen Church, an analyst at Societe Generale in Tokyo.
But Abe's strongest asset may be the weakness of the highly splintered opposition. The Democratic Party's rating, which had been hovering around 5 percent, has risen but remains in the single digits in most polls.
Abe appears undecided over whether to press ahead with a 2 percentage point increase to the national sales tax that is needed to offset a public debt that stands at about 250 percent of GDP.
The economy contracted 7.1 percent in April-June after a 3 point increase in the sales tax on April 1.
Instead of delaying the tax hike for the sake of political expediency, Abe will likely go ahead with it as promised before the end of the year but also announce extra economic stimulus, said Masamichi Adachi, an analyst at JPMorgan in Tokyo.
The bigger concern is whether Abe will take unpopular measures to help restore the country's waning competitiveness and ensure sustained growth after two decades of malaise.
Up to now, progress on those tasks has lagged, Adachi said.
"The process is going ahead but still quite slow and not sufficient to overcome the challenges this country is facing," he said.

The Indian rupee gained for the third session on Tuesday, surging by another five paise against US dollar to end at over one-week high of 61.31 on sustained selling of the greenback by banks and exporters in view of strong equity market and capital inflows.
The domestic unit resumed higher at 61.26 per dollar as against Monday’s closing level of 61.36 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market.
It hovered in a range of 61.2475 per dollar and 61.3700 per dollar before concluding the day at 61.31 per dollar, a gain of five paise or 0.08 per cent. It has gained 52 paise, or 0.84 per cent, in three days.
Tuesday’s rupee closing is the strongest since 61.1 on October 13.
Exporters and banks preferred to reduce their dollar positions in view of good foreign capital inflows into equity market amid government announcing a slew of reforms.
In New York, the US dollar ended steady on Monday as foreign exchange markets braced for a batch of Chinese economic indicators amid lingering investor worries over signs of a slowdown in Asia’s economic powerhouse and global growth.

Shares Of Hazmat-Suit Maker Are Soaringreddit
Shares in a company that makes hazmat suits soared 16 percent on Thursday after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in New York City .
The stock price of Long Island-based Lakeland Industries, which makes various types of protective garb, has more than doubled in the past month amid feverish news coverage of the deadly virus . The stock jumped from less than $7 a share in late September to as high as $29 on October 13, when Ebola panic in the U.S. was particularly high.
Shares have drifted lower since then, but got another boost on Thursday afternoon after the news that Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who recently returned to New York from treating patients in Guinea, had been hospitalized with Ebola symptoms. Later on Thursday he became the fourth person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.
The spike in stock price came after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.
“We’ve been getting a lot of calls in the last 24 hours,” Jordan Darrow, a spokesman for Lakeland, told The Huffington Post on Friday morning. “We’ve been getting a lot of calls for the last three months.”
He declined to comment on sales of hazmat suits.
Last month, Lakeland said it was increasing production to meet heightened demand for the suits, which cover the whole body. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids -- such as blood, vomit or feces -- of an infected person.
“We hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem,” Christopher J. Ryan, the president and chief executive of Lakeland, said in a statement last month. “With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.”
Lakeland’s stock fell about 4 percent in early trading Friday morning, to about $14.

Meet the 10 richest people in America 2014
Thanks to a buoyant stock market, the richest people in the U.S. just keep getting richer. That has made it harder than ever to join the ranks of the 400 wealthiest Americans. The price of entry to The Forbes 400 this year is $1.55 billion, the highest it’s been since Forbes started tracking American wealth in 1982. Last year it took $1.3 billion to score a spot. Because the bar is so high, 113 U.S. billionaires didn’t make the cut.
Bill Gates is the richest American for the 21st year in a row, with a net worth of $81 billion. (He’s the world’s second richest person, behind Mexico’s Carlos Slim.)
Facebook cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now the 11th richest person in the U.S., and the biggest dollar gainer on the list. His fortune soared to $34 billion, up $15 billion since last year, due to a sharp rise in the price of the social network’s shares.
All together the 400 wealthiest Americans are worth a staggering $2.29 trillion, up $270 billion from a year ago. The average net worth of list members is $5.7 billion, $700 million more than last year and a record high.
Check out the top 10 of the Forbes 400.

Make in India vs. Make in ChinaUpdated: October 26, 2014 07:58 IST
Make in India vs. Make in China
Puja Mehra
India-China
Markets across Indian towns and cities that are flooded with Chinese products, more so around festivals such as Diwali, are grim reminders of how Made-in-China has come to dominate our offices and homes.
Last Tuesday, Tata Motor’s Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) opened its first plant in Changshu, China. The luxury car-maker’s $1.78-billion Make-in-China push has come a little over a month after Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry confessed to be greatly encouraged under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to join the “Make In India” programme that, he said, brings together industry and government for crafting a new future.
This was at the glittery launch of “Make in India” in Delhi where a galaxy of global corporate leaders ranging from Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries Ltd. to Lockheed Martin India CEO Phil Shaw in response to Mr. Modi’s call had pledged to invest and manufacture in India.
The pitch had its origin in the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech when he invited global companies to pick India to locate factories, promising to replace red tape with red-carpet welcomes.
The jobs and incomes for Indians these factories would generate, he said, would in turn create the market for their output.
The goal the Modi government has set is to make India break into the top 50 in the World Bank’s ease of business index ranking from the current 134th position.
When companies such as Tata Motors choose where to locate a new factory, they consider a range of factors. But India fares badly on most of the counts. For instance, contract enforcement takes 1,420 days and going through the 12 procedures for starting business typically takes 27 days.
India’s chronic infrastructure and logistics deficit with inefficient transport networks makes it tough for manufacturing companies to achieve just-in-time production.
The Modi government has said it wants to radically de-bureaucratise, deregulate, change officers’ mindsets, cut paperwork and remove the notorious legal and infrastructure hurdles to starting and doing business in India. This is not the first time India is focussing on its manufacturing sector. In 2006, the UPA government put out a national strategy for manufacturing. It even dubbed 2006-15 as the “decade of manufacturing in India.” The five-year period of 2005-06 to 2009-10 was one of a smart 10 per cent plus growth for the manufacturing sector when several advantages — engineering skills, a growing domestic market, a raw material base and a large pool of skilled labour — trumped the vast barriers to doing business in India.
JLR’s China launch has set alarm bells ringing for the Modi government: “Make in India” will have to go quickly from being a statement of intent to real action on the ground. Markets across Indian towns and cities that are flooded with Chinese products, more so around festivals such as Deepavali, are grim reminders of how Made-in-China has come to dominate homes and offices. From furniture and gadgets to industrial equipment, India is importing almost all products from its neighbour, even yarn for saris. It is estimated that over 99 per cent of Bangalore silk saris are being made with Chinese silk yarn.
As a result, the rapidly growing bilateral trade between the two neighbours is tilting heavily in China’s favour, at a rate that India has termed unsustainable. Bilateral trade crossed $65 billion in 2013, but while India exported $15 billion worth of goods to China, but imported $51 bn. The quality of trade also goes against India. India exports raw materials such as iron ore but imports manufactured goods.
In pursuit of its reforms agenda of 1979, China has followed a more-exports-at-any-cost policy to boost its economy. The Chinese government’s support to manufacturing in the form of affordable cost of funds, cheap inputs and world-class infrastructure gives it an advantage over Indian manufacturers. The Confederation of Indian Industry estimates that Chinese manufacturing as a result enjoys a cost advantage of about 10 per cent over Indian manufacturing.
A fallout of which is dumping of products on big markets like India. To protect domestic manufacturers, India has been imposing an anti-dumping duty on 159 products — ranging from chemicals, petrochemicals, pharmaceutical, steel, fibres and consumer goods — imported from China since 1992.
The spurt in factory imports from China has coincided with a sharp slide in India’s manufacturing sector despite the UPA government’s efforts to push the sector.
Manufacturing output grew barely 1 per cent in 2012-13. In 2013-14, factory output contracted (-) 0.7 per cent. The share of the jobs-creating sector in the GDP has declined to 14.9 per cent in 2013-14 from the peak level of 16.2 per cent in 2009-10.
India’s advantage
But there is hope still. A new index of manufacturing costs, including productivity-adjusted wages, electricity, natural gas and currency movements, created by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) of the world’s 25 biggest exporters shows China’s traditional cost advantage is now under pressure denting its attractiveness. Under pressure from the U.S., China has had to appreciate its currency by 30 per cent since 2006, which is eroding its exports’ cost competitiveness. Just-in data from the International Monetary Fund show that China is no longer the largest trade surplus economy in the world.
Therein lies an opportunity “Make in India” must tap. India’s labour costs are among the lowest in the world. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average labour compensation (including pay, benefits, social insurance, and taxes) in India’s organised manufacturing sector increased only marginally, from $0.68 an hour in 1999 to $1.50 an hour currently. The average compensation in China’s manufacturing sector in contrast rose 20 percent year-on-year in the same period to $3 an hour.
Besides, the cost competitiveness, India boasts a nearly 500-million-strong labour force comprising unskilled workers and English-speaking scientists, researchers, and engineers, making it a potential destination for cost-effective research and development-oriented manufacturing.
Recent sporadic instances of the odd Chinese manufacturer setting up shop in India and a few Indian companies moving production bases back home from China are encouraging. Havells, Godrej, Micromax and auto-components maker Bosch are amongst a handful of companies that have recently moved back to India some part of their manufacturing or outsourcing in China owing to currency, labour and other cost advantages.
As Chinese factories move up the value-chain to hi-tech manufacturing, opportunities would open up for Indian entrepreneurs but they are up against stiff competition. On the BCG ranking, however, several countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, are better poised and ranked above India as of now to take gain from China’s loss of competitiveness. The coming together of smart entrepreneurs, employees, infrastructure and know-how could overtime become a durable advantage, as had happened in China’s case.

murder
Police said there were seven people in the house during the attack, and that the shooting followed an "altercation."
The captain of South Africa’s national soccer team was fatally shot when armed men broke into the house where he was staying, police said.
Goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was killed around 8 p.m. on Sunday after two gunmen entered a house in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg while an accomplice waited outside, the national police force said on its Twitter account. The three assailants then fled on foot, according to the police service, which offered a reward of nearly $14,000 for information leading to arrests in the case.
Police said there were seven people in the house during the attack, and that the shooting followed an “altercation.”
Authorities said they would do everything possible to find the killers.
South Africa has a high rate of violent crime, but it was not immediately clear whether the house where Meyiwa was staying was targeted by thieves or gunmen with another motive. Solomon Makgale, a South African police spokesman, declined to comment, referring The Associated Press to updates on the police Twitter account.
South African soccer club Orlando Pirates said in a statement that it “has learned with sadness about the untimely death of our number one goalkeeper and current captain Senzo Meyiwa.”
“This is a sad loss whichever way you look at it to Senzo’s family, his extended family, Orlando Pirates and to the nation,” Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza said.
Dean Furman, one of Meyiwa’s teammates, tweeted- “Beyond devastated at the loss of our captain & friend Senzo Meyiwa. Thoughts & prayers are with his family & friends at this terrible time.”
Meyiwa, 27, was South Africa’s captain in its four qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations this year, including its last game, a 0—0 draw with Republic of Congo on Oct. 15. He played for Orlando Pirates on Saturday in a 4—1 win over Ajax Cape Town.
It’s the second death to hit South African sports in three days, as former 800—meter world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday. At the time, President Jacob Zuma said “the nation has lost a true hero.”
Early Monday local time, the youth league of South Africa’s ruling party sent condolences to the families of Meyiwa and Mulaudzi, saying “their premature passing is indeed a great loss to the country and sporting nation.”

Govt likely to raise import taxes on vegetable oilsGovt likely to raise import taxes on vegetable oils
Reuters
Tweet
NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India is considering raising the import taxes on crude and refined vegetable oils to protect local farmers and the refining industry, two government sources said on Monday, as purchases by the world's top importer are expected hit a record this year.
The government could increase the duties on both crude and refined vegetable oils by more than 5 per cent, said an official who is part of the decision making process. Currently India imposes a 2.5 per cent tax on crude oils and 10 per cent on the refined variety.
"We are considering an increase in the import tax but it is not going to happen immediately because the official process will take some more time," said another government official directly involved in the decision making process.
The first source said that a final decision on the duty hikes will be taken by the Finance Ministry.
Hit by cheaper imports, industry body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) has petitioned the government to raise the duty on crude oils to 10 per cent and 25 per cent on refined products.
India is likely to import a record 13 million tonnes of edible oils in the new year beginning November, up from an estimated 11.6 million tonnes this year, including 8 million tonnes of palm oil.
New Delhi imported a record 10.4 million tonnes of edible oils in the 2012/13 year, data from SEA showed.
Nearly 60 per cent of India's annual edible oil demand of 18-19 million tonnes is met by imports, consisting mainly of palm oil sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia.
India also buys tiny amounts of soyoil from Latin America and sunflower oil from the Black Sea region.

Axis Bank eyes SME lending for growth in TNAxis Bank eyes SME lending for growth in TN
Our Bureau
Coimbatore, Oct 27:  
Axis Bank foresees Tamil Nadu region as a key SME lending destination over the next three years.
Aiming to be a partner in progress for the SMEs in the region, the bank is now proposing to roll out specially structured products to provide quick disbursement and faster credit delivery, strengthen its network and focus on supply chain finance as well, says G Edwin, Geography Head – South, SME Banking, Axis Bank.
“We've grown our SME portfolio in the region to Rs 5,800 crore. Quicker turnaround for credit, decentralised decision making, effective relationship management and a wide range of financial products and services is helping the bank emerge as a one-stop shop for all SME solutions,” Edwin told reporters here this afternoon.
He was in the city to introduce the bank's new initiative “Evolve” and one that is seen as a growth driver for the SMBs.
“We think we can be of assistance to the SMBs in non-financial areas as well,” he said, talking about this initiative.
Reverting to products and the time taken to process loan applications from the MSMEs, he said “we revert within a maximum period of three days if the papers are in order, indicating the status of the proposal to the applicant. They need not wait for a week or longer for the status. Thereafter, depending on the quantum of the loan sought, the sanction will vary between 10 days to a fortnight.''
Not only has the bank acquired a good number of new customers, but also increased its SME lending portfolio in the region significantly, Edwin said and pointed out that a-third of the bank's SME loan exposure is from the South.
“While advances to SMEs has increased by over 18 per cent year-on-year to Rs 35,500 cr and is a little more than 15 per cent of the bank's total advances, in Tamil Nadu, our SME portfolio has registered a growth of 17 per cent,'' he said, highlighting the growth potential.
Towards strengthening its network, the bank has opened a new SME centre at Erode and is looking at setting up a centre in Madurai shortly.
The bank currently operates 42 SME centres and 17 SME cells across the country. This network is expected to be strengthened further, Edwin added.

President Pranab Mukherjee
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Expressing concern over Parliament approving important legislative business without much debate, President Pranab Mukherjee today asked the Lok Sabha Speaker to find ways to devote more time for discussions on businesses such as passing of the Finance Bill.
“...as the Speaker (Lok Sabha) is present here, I would also like to take the opportunity of sharing my concern that we are not devoting adequate time in Parliament while sanctioning money, while imposing taxes, before scrutiny of the law, before scrutiny of expenditure proposals despite the establishment of an institutional arrangement like the Parliamentary Standing Committee not taking place before the passage of the Finance Bill,” he said.
“Therefore, much more time is required to be devoted either for legislations and for sanctioning money dealing with the financial transactions and both Chairman PAC (public accounts) and Speaker may ponder over and find a practical solution to achieve this objective,” he said at the inauguration of the Accountant General conference here.
The President said many studies conducted by Parliament itself indicated the time devoted for legislations in the first, second, third and fourth Lok Sabha for disposing off financial matters were much more compared to later Parliaments.
“Therefore, I do feel that the time has come to take some corrective courses. As it has been correctly pointed out by Speaker, Parliament has three important committees — PAC, estimates committee, and committee on public undertakings through which Parliament can exercise control not only over the policies, but also on how money was spent, how resources are utilised, how resources are mobilised,” he said.

ReGen Powertech launches made-for-India wind turbine
M Ramesh
Chennai, Oct 27:  
Chennai-based ReGen Powertech has come up with a made-for-India wind turbine with a capacity of 2.8 MW.
The machine’s blades will sweep a circle of a diameter of 109 metres. The wind turbine has been developed by ReGen’s wholly-owned R&D subsidiary in Germany, Wind Direct GmbH, and the company intends to make the machine available for sale by the end of next year.
A prototype of the turbine is currently undergoing testing at ReGen’s test site near Coimbatore.
Unique feature
A unique feature of this (permanent magnet, gearless) turbine is that it comprises two independent power systems of 1.4 MW capacity each. This allows operation of the turbine at half the rated power, so that when one segment is working, the other could be taken up for maintenance.
Besides, the box that sits on the top of the tower – the nacelle – weighs 156 tonnes, compared with 250 tonnes of other machines of similar rated capacity, says a press release from ReGen.
ReGen Powertech, set up by Madhusudhan Khemka, has been in the Indian market for the last six years and has about 1,500 MW of standing machines in India and Sri Lanka behind it.
It currently manufactures 1.5 MW synchronous permanent magnet gearless wind turbines with a technology agreement with Vensys, Germany. Its clientele includes names such as Tata Power, Renew Power, NSL Power, Green Infra, Greenko, Mytrah, NuPower, Orange Power and Bhilwara Energy.

India to consider extending incentives for raw sugar exportsIndia to consider extending incentives for raw sugar exports
Reuters
Tweet
NEW DELHI, Oct 27:  
India will consider extending the incentives for raw sugar exports after Oct. 29 when leading cane growing states forecast their sugar output for the new season beginning October, two government sources said on Monday.
"The cane commissioners of leading cane growing states will present their estimates on Oct. 29 and that will set the ball rolling for a decision on raw sugar export subsidy in 2014/15," a government official with direct knowledge of the matter, said.
In February, the government gave Rs 3,300 ($53.82) a tonne subsidy for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut down large stockpiles.
However, a delay in extending the incentives for the new 2014/15 season had led to misgivings in some quarters that New Delhi was against giving subsidy for overseas shipments of raw sugar.

Alembic Pharmaceuticals to pick up 49% stake in Algerias AdwiyaMamiPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:56 pm
Drug firm Alembic Pharmaceuticals will acquire 49 per cent stake in Algeria-based Adwiya Mami SARL for an undisclosed sum as it seeks to enter the north African country.
“The company’s 100 per cent subsidiary, Alembic Global Holding SA (AGH) announced the joint venture deal with Adwiya Mami SARL Algeria. The deal envisages investment by AGH to the extent of 49 per cent stake of Adwiya Mami,” Alembic Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
Post conclusion of the deal, the company will be renamed as Alembic Mami SPA, it added.
The joint venture entity will be mutually run by Alembic and Mami with equal representation from both sides in the Board.
Alembic nominee Tagreed Alshunar has been appointed as its first CEO, the company said.
Algeria is a large market with a size of USD 3 billion and investment in Adwiya Mami will give AGH a quick entry in the country, it added.
Highlighting the significance of the move, Alembic said: “There are entry barriers and local manufacturing units get a distinct advantage in marketing the products.”
Adwiya Mami currently has a formulation plant with the capacity of 1.2 billion per annum oral solids. The plant has enough headroom for future expansion, the company said.
Shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals were trading 2.35 per cent down at Rs 412 per scrip during afternoon trade on the BSE today.
 

Mutual Funds exposure to bank stocks drops to Rs 55 398 cr inSeptPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:54 pm
Mutual fund (MF) managers dropped their exposure in bank stocks to Rs 55,398 crore in September, after raising it for seven consecutive month.
According to the latest data available with Securities and Exchange Board of India, MF investments in bank stocks as on September 30 declined to Rs 55,398 crore, accounting for 18.84 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 2.94 lakh crore.
In comparison, the MF industry’s exposure to banking sector had reached to an all-time of Rs 56,625 crore in August this year.
However, MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs, last month with an exposure of Rs 31,834 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,908 crore), auto (Rs 18,892 crore) and finance (Rs 16,358 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market and the current decline is mainly due to profit booking.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in banking stocks by equity fund managers and fund infusion has grown from Rs 30,339 crore in January to Rs 56,625 crore in August.
In percentage term, exposure has risen from 16.6 per cent to 20.10 per cent during the period.

UCO Bank identifies Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines as wilful defaulterBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:49 pm
Kolkata-based UCO Bank today said it has “identified” Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) as a “wilful defaulter” and will be sending a notice to the defunct carrier.
“We have identified KFA as a wilful defaulter. We are in the process of sending a notice to the company in this regard”, a source in the bank said.
Other banks like State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank are also mulling this route.
United Bank of India has already declared KFA a ‘wilful defaulter’ for defaulting a loan of Rs 350 crore.
Beside KFA, UCO Bank will also send a notice to the company which had furnished a corporate guarantee for availing a loan of around Rs 450 crore, the source said.
As per RBI guidelines, a wilful defaulter tag would be given if it is found that a loan taken is diverted for some other use rather than for which it was availed, as well as the default is made in spite of having the ability to repay it.
 

Black money: Lodhya denies having a Swiss bankaccountBy: Press Trust of India | Rajkot | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:47 pm
City-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, today denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list. “I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media…. I am shocked,” Lodhya told reporters here.
“I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department,” he said. Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, “We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us.” Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers. The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said. It has two subsidiaries – Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya’s firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008. The central government today filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court in the black money case, naming three prominent businessmen Pradip Burman, formerly of Dabur group, Goa-based miner Radha S Timblo and Lodhya. The Centre told the court that it had no intention to withhold names of persons who have stashed black money abroad and stated that information received from foreign countries will be disclosed in all cases where tax evasion is established.
Foreign bank account legal, followed all rules: Burmans
With one of its members, Pradip Burman, being named as an account holder in a foreign bank in the black money issue, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans today said the account complied with all legal requirements. “We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added. Pradip Burman currently holds no position in the homegrowm FMCG major although he was once a Whole Time Director of Dabur India.
Regretting that there was a lack of differentiation between legal and illegal foreign bank account holders, the spokesperson further said: “It is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush.” “The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels,” the spokesperson added.

As new and old e-retailers focus on handlooms, lesser known weaver groups are beginning to reap the benefits
Little known rural groups in different parts of the country bring out hand-woven and hand-knitted shawls, stoles and jackets for the colder months. Most buyers wouldn’t have access to the products of these groups unless one knows how to source such products through specialised stores or travelling exhibitions. But now, with the help of online retailers, these groups get their space in the sun.
E-retailers have moved a step ahead from cataloguing products from different vendors, both established designer labels and small groups, and feel the need to have ‘promotional events’ just like brick and mortar stores to create a buzz. At the moment, jaypore.com is curating an ‘event’ showcasing vibrant hand-knitted stoles and shawls from Himalayas by Kilmora, a label promoted by Kumaun Grameen Udyog.
Meanwhile, on tjori.com, the focus is on cotton and silk quilted jackets by Jaipur Pitara group. From North East weaves and tribal jewellery to Chettinad checks, Afghani stoles to indigo-dyed apparels, e-retailers are tapping into the rich canvas of Indian weaves. And eager customers don’t seem to mind forking out a little more to lay their hands on exquisite handlooms and handicrafts.
Closer home, Kaumudi studio and Chenetha weaves are among the groups taking baby steps into e-retailing. Sharmila Nagraj Nandula of Kaumudi is gauging the buying patterns through portals skewed towards handlooms. “There is greater visibility when we sell online. But I am not sure if shoppers browsing through Amazon or Flipkart specifically look for handlooms. If one types a search term ‘handloom kurta’, I don’t know the probability of my brand showing up,” she says. Kaumudi unveiled exclusive lines on indianroots.in and craftsvilla.com. The group also retails through its portal kaumudistudio.com . “The mark-up price, when we sell through other portals, is comparatively higher. I was in a dilemma about this. If I was a buyer, I’d try to place an enquiry with the vendor directly and see if there is a difference in price. On the other hand, popular e-retailers have better visibility and a clientele that is willing to pay for handlooms,” says Sharmila.
Chenetha weaves is also studying the e-commerce market to see how it can benefit weavers. Karghaa, the label by Chenetha weaves, now sells through gocoop.com. “We’ve been selling online for six months and have clients from North Carolina, Australia and Malaysia. NRIs show interest in saris while the foreigners purchase home-linen and stoles,” says Sudha Rani, CEO. The group is happy that the weavers have a steady flow of work.
However, the smaller production scale of handlooms remains a concern. “Groups that supply both handloom and powerloom fabrics will be able to meet the growing online demand. Others will have to work harder. We also need staff to cater to online queries and do necessary photo shoots for product visibility,” she says.
Despite such challenges, both Sharmila and Sudha feel online retailing has opened up new possibilities for the handloom sector. Several groups have been tapping online consumers in their own way. Chanderiyaan.net, which showcases Chanderi weaves, is managed by a network of weavers’ self-help groups through Chanderi Weavers Resource Integrated Information Resource Centre. Handsofindia.com , based in Vrindavan, retails handloom apparels with tie-and-dye technique, soof and ahir embroidery from Kutch, hand made laces, batiks and more. Boyanika.com showcases products from the looms of Orissa — Sambhalpuri ikats, natural dyed Kotpad fabrics, hand spun wild silk, hand-woven brocades, Bomkai saris woven by Jala technique and more.
As Sharmila sums up, “Online platforms have widened our reach and will help us stay in public consciousness.”

Ukraine: Pro-European parties take leadvoting
With more than one-third of the votes counted, two allied pro-European parties in Ukraine that ran on a platform to enact tough reforms took a joint lead on Monday in a parliamentary election.
Partial figures showed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk’s Popular Front with 21.6 percent of the vote and President Petro Poroshenko’s party at 21.5 percent.
Mr. Poroshenko said after Sunday’s election that he wanted Western-oriented parties elected to quickly form a broad reformist coalition. Negotiations on forming that coalition are expected to begin Monday and be completed within 10 days.
A recently formed pro-European party based in western Ukraine, Samopomich, was running third with almost 11 percent of the vote.
The vote has led to an overhaul of a parliament once dominated by loyalists of former President Viktor Yanukovych, who sparked the protests that caused his ouster with a decision to deepen ties with Russia.
Anti-Russian sentiment has spiked in Ukraine as the country battles with separatists in the east many believe are supported by Moscow.
As a result, the election has favoured the chances of parties with staunchly pro-Western or nationalist agendas.
Nonetheless, the Opposition Bloc, which pundits believe largely drew its support from Mr. Yanukovych’s once-ruling Party of Regions, has put in a strong showing with a 9.8 percent, with around 33 percent of the vote counted.
Mr. Poroshenko last month laid out an ambitious agenda envisioning root-and-branch changes to the justice system, police, tax system, defence sector and health care to be completed by 2020.
Corruption has been an intensely discussed issue in Ukraine in recent months and was one of the main seeds of the discontent that precipitated Mr. Yanukovych’s downfall.
Among the tougher decisions likely to lie ahead will be allowing costs of basic utilities in the cash-strapped country to float in line with market demands. With the economy in a freefall this year, there is no imminent sense of a surge of prosperity that could temper policies that would prove agonizing to bear for the poor.
International observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were due to share a preliminary assessment of the election later Monday.
While around 36 million people were registered to vote, no voting was held on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March, or in parts of Ukraine’s easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where shelling remains a daily constant. The fight against armed separatists on the border with Russia has claimed the lives of more than 3,600 people.
With almost 3 million people in areas near Russia’s border unable to vote, it seems probable pro-Western parties were given an advantage.
Slightly more than half of the incoming members of parliament are being elected by means of party lists, and the remainder are picked in direct local contests. That has opened the door to likelihood of victories by candidates from smaller parties, such as the Right Sector ultranationalist group.
With half the votes counted in his district in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh was leading comfortably with 30 percent, almost twice as much as his nearest rival.

Bangalore/Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Value and Budget Housing Corporation (VBHC), a provider of affordable housing, after four years of operations in India, has opened its office in Dubai.
The company plans to facilitate customer interaction and engagement when servicing its NRI customers based out of Dubai and the entire West Asian zone who have displayed significant interest in purchasing properties in India. The launch was attended by bankers, investors and prospective customers.
Commenting on the development, Jerry Rao, Chairman and founder, VBHC, said: "It is an extremely gratifying moment for us to spread our wings internationally. We have made substantial achievements in the Indian real estate market, having delivered quality and commitment to our customers. We intend to start our global journey with the same mission and vision and believe we will be equally successful in the international market by continuing to deliver value to our customers."
VBHC in a statement said it has a large number of West Asian customers; hence the global expansion came as the next logical step for a company growing very rapidly in the domestic market.
Though buying property online has been a much adopted trend, having an operational office allows its customers the opportunity to have a better, wider and clearer knowledge of the properties, it added.
VBHC was co-founded by former MphasiS Chairman Jaithirth (Jerry) Rao and former Citibank Consumer Banking Head P S Jayakumar.
With marquee investors like HDFC, IFC, Carlyle and Caspian Advisers, VBHC has large-scale expansion plans and intends to deliver 18,000 homes in the next three years as it expands its national footprint across India.

inflation and deflation
Acknowledging that private investment is stifled in India due to “lots of regulations” and also scarcity of coal and electricity, new Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian has said that removing these bottlenecks will be key to kick start growth in the country.
“The Indian economy needs a couple of big things, better governance, a stronger state delivering security of contract, protecting property rights, providing infrastructure,” Dr. Subramanian said in a podcast interview to IMF.
“You need a bigger role for the private sector, means getting rid of the lots of regulations that stifled the private sector, which stifled employment creation that stifled the ability of the private sector to grow, to become big. These are the kind of broad twin challenges that India faces,” said the former IMF economist, who was appointed Chief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry on October 16.
Responding to a question, Dr. Subramanian said “a lot of projects are stalled, because there is not enough power, there is not enough coal, or the companies are over indebted.”
“So clearing these bottlenecks is going to be the biggest kick start to private investment and growth,” he said.
Bureaucrats were not taking some crucial decisions fearing that they would be sued in courts, he said.
“So I think, just creating the conditions for more expeditious decision making and then you need to get the infrastructure going again, making power and coal and addressing those would be a big priority,” he said.
Dr. Subramanian said a five per cent growth rate is “remotely not enough” for India to grow and provide the jobs for the expanding labour force.
“Growth would have to be brought back to seven-and-a-half and eight per cent consistently for about 10, 15, 20 years, if India is to really address all these challenges,” he said.
The Chief Economic Advisor said, “As reforms were lagging, inflation was very high and growth decelerating for many consecutive quarters and there seemed to be a kind of government paralysis, there was a sense in 2012 of India lagging behind.”
“But it is clear that there is a real optimism, because there is a sense that the new government can remedy some of those problems. Stock markets have risen tremendously; foreign capital has come pouring in and initial steps have been taken that kind of validate all that optimism,” he said.
“But that is just a start. A lot more needs to be done,” he said, adding that the Narendra Modi Government is trying to replicate the “Gujarat model” all over India of good governance and attracting private sector.
He emphasised that there are a set of macro challenges that needs to be addressed to bring down inflation further and to get the fiscal deficit down.
At the same time there is a need to provide the conditions for greater infrastructure and create conditions for the private sector to start coming back again, he said.
Dr. Subramanian, an Oxford-educated and an economist with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) like his predecessor Raghuram Rajan, said private sector investment needs to rise again if India has to achieve eight per cent growth rate.

Shares Of Hazmat-Suit Maker Spike On NYC Ebola Newsreddit
Shares in a company that makes hazmat suits soared 16 percent on Thursday after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in New York City .
The stock price of Long Island-based Lakeland Industries, which makes various types of protective garb, has more than doubled in the past month amid feverish news coverage of the deadly virus . The stock jumped from less than $7 a share in late September to as high as $29 on October 13, when Ebola panic in the U.S. was particularly high.
Shares have drifted lower since then, but got another boost on Thursday afternoon after the news that Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who recently returned to New York from treating patients in Guinea, had been hospitalized with Ebola symptoms. Later on Thursday he became the fourth person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.
The spike in stock price came after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.
“We’ve been getting a lot of calls in the last 24 hours,” Jordan Darrow, a spokesman for Lakeland, told The Huffington Post on Friday morning. “We’ve been getting a lot of calls for the last three months.”
He declined to comment on sales of hazmat suits.
Last month, Lakeland said it was increasing production to meet heightened demand for the suits, which cover the whole body. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids -- such as blood, vomit or feces -- of an infected person.
“We hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem,” Christopher J. Ryan, the president and chief executive of Lakeland, said in a statement last month. “With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.”
Lakeland’s stock fell about 4 percent in early trading Friday morning, to about $14.

US tech firm fined for underpaying IndiansUS tech firm fined for underpaying Indian workers
Michael Liedtke     San Francisco   Last Updated: October 25, 2014  | 18:14 IST
Picture for representation purpose.
A Silicon Valley company is paying more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after labour regulators found eight employees brought from India were grossly underpaid and overworked while assigned to a special project in the US.
The probe announced this week by the US Department of Labour uncovered several egregious violations at Electronics for Imaging Inc, a printing technology specialist that generated revenue of $728 million last year, when the misconduct occurred.
Among other things, Electronics for Imaging paid the eight workers far below California's required minimum wage - $8 per hour at the time - while they helped the company move its headquarters from Foster City, California, to Fremont, California, during a three-month period, according to the Labour Department.
While assigned to the project, some of the Indian workers logged as many as 122 hours in a week without being paid overtime. As result, they received as little as $1.21 per hour.
Electronics for Imaging says it "unintentionally overlooked" US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least minimum wage, with overtime for more than 40 weekly hours on the job.
Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US.
Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California.
"This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops," Eastwood said on Thursday.
The Electronics for Imaging case serves as a reminder of the economic divide between high-tech workforces in the US and less-developed countries.
While engineers and other technology employees are paid more than $100,000 salaries and lucrative stock incentives, workers handling other jobs for the same employer often receive paltry pay if they are based in countries such as India, China and Mexico.
Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.
Electronics for Imaging is paying more than $40,000 in back wages and damages to the eight Indian workers and a $3,520 fine.

Widening the activities coming under CSR ambit, contributions made by corporates towards Narendra Modi-led government’s two key initiatives — Swachh Bharat and Clean Ganga — will now be considered as social welfare spending work.
Making amendments to the Companies Act, the Corporate Affairs Ministry has said that contributions to ‘Swachh Bharat Kosh’ and ‘Clean Ganga Fund’ would come under CSR framework.
‘Swach Bharat Kosh’ has been set up to attract funds, from various entities including corporates, for activities related to Swachh Bharat initiative. The ‘Clean Ganga Fund’ is aimed at pooling money for taking up works to clean the Ganga river.
These two initiatives are the latest ones to be brought under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ambit where contributions made to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund has been included already.
Through a notification, the Ministry has inserted the words ‘including contribution to the Swach Bharat Kosh set up by the central government for the promotion of sanitation” in Schedule VII of the Act, which pertains to CSR activities
Besides, the words “including contribution to the Clean Ganga Fund set up by the central government for rejuvenation of river Ganga” have been inserted in the Schedule.

UPDATE 1-Ukraine leader wins pro-West mandate but wary of RussiaUPDATE 1-Ukraine leader wins pro-West mandate but wary of Russia
Ukraine voters embrace West and peace withrebelsBy: Press Trust of India | Kiev | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:01 pm
Ukraine’s pro-Western and moderately nationalist parties were on course today to score a crushing election win that boosted President Petro Poroshenko’s bid to merge his ex-Soviet country with Europe and end a pro-Russian revolt. A partial vote count and exit polls showed overwhelming support for Poroshenko’s drive to break his nation of 45 million out of Russia’s orbit despite the painful economic measures the Kremlin has levied on its western neighbour in reprisal.
Results with 30 percent of the precincts reporting had Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk’s People’s Front leading with 21.7 percent of the vote. The president’s Petro Poroshenko Bloc was a a hair behind with 21.6 per cent. Many in Kiev and the West blame the six-month uprising that has killed 3,700 on an attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to destabilise Ukraine’s new government and create a “frozen conflict” in its vital industrial east.
Parties with links to Moscow or the old Viktor Yanukovych regime that was ousted after his abrupt rejection in February of a landmark EU pact were routed at the ballot boxes yesterday. “I want the war to end and for our country to join the European Union, although I doubt this will happen very soon,” pensioner Bogdan Golobutskiy said as he trudged up to a Kiev polling station yesterday.
Radicals that rejected Poroshenko’s peace deal with the insurgents that gave the separatists limited autonomy also had a poor showing as did corruption-tainted politicians who had steered Ukraine through two decades of stuttering reforms. Analysts said it was almost certain that Poroshenko would now have to share power with Yatsenyuk as premier.
“Voters did not want a monopoly of power in one pair of hands. They voted for a Poroshenko-Yatsenyuk tandem,” said Vadym Karasyov of Kiev’s Institute of Global Strategies. A buoyant Poroshenko told the nation that “more than three quarters of voters who took part in the polls gave strong and irreversible backing to Ukraine’s path to Europe.”
The 49-year-old chocolate baron said a majority also supported his search for “political methods” to end the war in the country’s industrial east. Poroshenko and his slightly more hawkish prime minister are within striking distance of the majority needed to form a stable government that could pursue similar policies to those both back now. Yatsenyuk is widely expected to keep his premiership post and help Ukraine negotiate new loan agreements with the West.

Modi-Shah think beyond caste-region in making statepicksPrime Minister Narendra Modi being welcomed by BJP President Amit Shah during the party's parliamentary board meeting to assess the assembly poll results in New Delhi on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:58 pm
The appointment of Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister of Haryana, and the likely elevation of Devendra Fadnavis to the post in Maharashtra, indicate a preference in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah for “organisational work and electoral merit” over traditional calculations of caste and community.
Khattar is only the fifth non-Jat Chief Minister of a state that has traditionally been Jat-dominated. And Fadnavis is a Brahmin, who are only 3.5 per cent of the population of Maharashtra.
The Congress and NCP have always preferred a Maratha as head of government — of the 17 Chief Ministers so far, only seven have been non-Marathas. The Marathas are 30 per cent of the state’s population.
In his 25 years in the BJP, Fadnavis (44), has never been identified as the leader of a particular caste group. The MLA from Nagpur South West is, rather, seen as a meritorious politician who could win the support of people cutting across caste and community lines in all of Maharashtra.
Fadnavis has also been seen as a “neutral” politician who has steered clear of both the Nitin Gadkari and Gopinath Munde camps in the state BJP.
Some 24 hours ahead of the BJP legislature party meeting, a BJP MLA, echoing the view of several dozen colleagues who have already arrived in Mumbai, said on Monday, “The central leadership of the party has taken a decision (on the next Chief Minister) based on merit, which is acceptable. We leave it to higher-ups.”
A senior leader from Marathwada who was close to Munde said, “It is a lesson for all of us. In the past, we would keep switching from one camp to the other to ensure our political security. Modi and Shah have now sent the signal that what matters is loyalty to the organisation. Let your work speak.”
According to a general secretary of the state BJP, “The Modi-Shah combine has signalled a political culture in which merit and hard work alone will count, and the space for manipulators would shrink.”
Several party insiders acknowledged the long hours put in by Shah in producing the BJP’s 123-seat victory in the assembly election. A senior leader told The Indian Express, “Shah would begin work at 10 am at the party headquarters, and would continue well past 4 am the following morning.” According to these insiders, the BJP president receives reports of every development that takes place in the states.
After the central leadership put the lid on the clamour for Nitin Gadkari to lead the state, some voices from North Maharashtra made a pitch for the former Leader of Opposition continued…

Pradeep Burman s foreign bank account is legal: DaburPradip Burman's foreign bank account is legal, says Dabur
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 17:44 IST

Pradip Burman's foreign bank account was "opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account", Dabur India said on Monday in an official statement. Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who was also named by the government in Supreme Court having black money account, has denied having an account in Swiss Bank.
Pradip Burman is a member of the promoter family of Dabur India.
"The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels. We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," the official statement said.
Pradip Burman was once a wholetime director of Dabur India but he does not hold any executive position in the company now.
Dabur India is a 130-year-old fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company that started its journey from erstwhile Calcutta and has around 200 plus products in its portfolio.
Meanwhile, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list.
"I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media, I am shocked," Lodhya told reporters in Rajkot.
"I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department," he said.
Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, "We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us."
Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers.
The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said.
It has two subsidiaries - Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya's firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008.
The central government on Monday disclosed names of three people,  including Pradeep Burman, who are holding bank accounts in foreign  countries and are now under the lens of Income Tax authorities.

Chiquita Abandons Plan To Dodge U.S. Taxes In IrelandChiquita Abandons Plan To Dodge U.S. Taxes In Ireland

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Chiquita shareholders have rejected plans to merge with Irish fruit importer Fyffes that would have made the world's largest banana supplier.
Chiquita Brands International Inc. said Friday that the shareholders didn't approve a revised transaction agreement between the two companies during a special shareholders meeting. Chiquita and Fyffes PLC have given notice to terminate their agreement.
The proposed agreement with Fyffes was an all-stock deal, with the companies planning to incorporate in Dublin to take advantage of lower tax rates. Chiquita is now based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
On Monday proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that Chiquita investors support the Fyffes deal because it is the best option for shareholders. ISS had previously said shareholders should vote against the deal because Chiquita might get a better offer elsewhere.
Chiquita President and CEO Edward Lonergan said in a statement that while the company was convinced Fyffes would have been a strong merger partner, the companies "will now go forward as competitors."
Chiquita said it now expects to enter talks with investment firm Safra Group and juice company Cutrale Group on their competing offer of $14.50 per share in cash, or $681 million. Chiquita received the latest bid from the pair on Wednesday after previously rejecting buyout offers from the two Brazilian companies. The prior offer from Safra and Cutrale was $14 per share. They had bid $13 per share in August.
Shares of Chiquita added 49 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $14.25 in morning trading.

Free speech vs. voting rights and abortion rightsBy Will Baude October 25
Dahlia Lithwick has a piece in Slate complaining that the Supreme Court is more protective of some rights than others. It begins:
The Supreme Court of the John Roberts era gets one thing very right: It’s one of the most free-speech-protective courts in modern history. There is no purveyor of semi-pornographic crush videos, no maker of rape-aspiring violent video games, no homophobic funeral protester, no anti-abortion clinic counselor, and no filthy-rich campaign contribution–seeker whose rights and privileges will not be treated by the court with the utmost reverence and solicitude.
This is important and vital, and one doesn’t want to slag the court for the boundless attention and care it lavishes upon the most obnoxious speakers in America. After all, the First Amendment is kind of the constitutional gateway drug, the portal to the rest of the Bill of Rights. And without securing meaningful protection for the rights to speak, assemble, worship, and publish, so many of our other rights might be illusory. Great. Stipulated.
That makes it extra weird whenever the assorted (lets call them largely “conservative”) justices of the Roberts court, and judges on lower courts across the land, turn their attention to the protection of other rights—equally crucial but perhaps less sexy—like, say, the right to vote or to obtain an abortion. …
Lithwick’s basic point is that the right to vote and to obtain an abortion ought to get, but do not get, the same strong protection from the Court as free speech does. She suggests that this is because the Court doesn’t “see the poor and the powerless,” “the hundreds and thousands of voiceless voters and abortion-seekers” or belittles their claims “because they are poor or minorities or just women.”
[This makes me somewhat puzzled by this criticism by Scott Greenfield ( endorsed by Judge Kopf) which reads Lithwick as trying to "horse-trade" or "attack" the free speech cases. I'm not sure that's really a fair characterization of Lithwick's piece, which advocates leveling up, not leveling down.]
But I can’t help but noticing one interesting and important difference between the right to free speech, and the rights to vote or to obtain an abortion. The right to free speech is enumerated in the text of the Constitution. The rights to vote and to obtain an abortion are not — at least not as explicitly.
It’s true that the right to vote is mentioned in a series of constitutional amendments that protect the right from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, etc. But there’s no textual provision that just protects the right in and of itself. And while the voter ID laws that Lithwick writes about have been challenged as discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act, the main constitutional claim against them is that they burden the unenumerated right to vote. Similarly, while there are arguments to derive abortion rights from various textual provisions, I think everybody acknowledges that they aren’t as explicit as the right to freedom of speech.
That makes me wonder if it’s possible that there’s a different explanation for the pattern Lithwick alleges. Maybe it’s not that the Court lacks sympathy for the poor or the vulnerable, or that the other rights are not “sexy.” Maybe the Court thinks that rights that derive from the constitutional text are more powerful, or less subject to common-law doctrinal balancing, than rights that are derived from judicial precedent.
Now maybe this pattern wouldn’t hold if we brought other rights into the picture too. And even if it’s true that the Court treats the constitutional text with greater solicitude than non-textual rights, one could certainly mount arguments against that. Maybe the right to vote and the right to obtain an abortion should be placed on doctrinally equal footing with textually enumerated rights. But since that’s the glaring difference between the three rights Lithwick compares, it seems like that’s the argument she ought to confront.
Will Baude is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he teaches constitutional law and federal courts. His recent articles include Rethinking the Federal Eminent Domain Power, (Yale Law Journal, 2013), and Beyond DOMA: State Choice of Law in Federal Statutes, (Stanford Law Review, 2012).

Yechury waves a red flag over party resolutionCPI(M) leaders at the party office in New Delhi on Sunday. (Express photo by Amit Mehra)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:14 am
The CPI(M)’s bid to change tactics to meet present day political challenges has brought out divisions within the party, with senior leader Sitaram Yechury opposing the stand taken by the Politburo and, by extension, general secretary Prakash Karat. The CPI(M) central committee, during a four-day brainstorming session which started on Sunday, was attempting to revise its political-tactical line, adopted at the party’s Jalandhar Congress in 1978.
During the session, Yechury moved an “alternative document” to the draft review report finalised by the Politburo. He is learnt to have repudiated the conclusions made in the draft report, presented by Karat.
Yechury’s five-page document, circulated among members of the central committee, is learnt to have questioned the Politburo’s opinion that the political-tactical line adopted in 1978 had many shortcomings, which hampered its expansion outside Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, and its consolidation in the three states. This comes in the wake of a drubbing received by the party in the Lok Sabha elections.
One of the key directives of the Jalandhar Congress, held in the aftermath of the Emergency, was to forge the unity of Left and democratic forces to defeat the Congress. The party applied the “united front tactics” with what it called “various bourgeois-landlord parties” in several states and at the national level over the years fairly successfully.
The draft finalised by the Politburo is learnt to have concluded that the effort to mobilise the regional parties into a third front has proved to be unrealistic and erroneous.
Yechury, on the other hand, believes that there is nothing wrong with the 1978 line and argues that it failed because of shortcomings and “subjectivism” in implementation in the last decade. He further argues that this, along with organisational weaknesses, is to blame for the electoral setbacks.
Yechury’s repudiation of the official draft is the latest incident in the tug of war between him and Karat. His stress on shortcomings in implementation in the last decade is significant, given that Karat succeeded Harkishan Singh Surjeet as general secretary in 2005. Karat’s stint at the CPM’s helm comes to an end next year and the latest tiff comes in the backdrop of a succession war.
Sources said that Yechury had conveyed his point of view in the Politburo meeting held on October 13 and 14, but the Karat camp had the upper hand, because of which the draft was accepted for consideration by the central committee. Yechury, however, did not relent and moved his objections in the form of a note.
What complicated the exercise is the decision of another Politburo member, B V Raghavulu, to place his “views” in the form of a separate note. It is rare for Politburo members to present such notes before the central committee after the Politburo reaches a conclusion on an issue.

Tharoor lauds PM again for bringing sanitation to forefrontPrint
Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 2:35 am | Updated: October 27, 2014 2:39 am
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appreciating the clean-up campaign he launched in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram a day ago. He also lauded Modi for catapulting the sanitation programme to the “forefront of the national consciousness.”
Tharoor was recently removed from the post of Congress spokesperson after the Kerala unit of the party sought action against him for his praise of Modi and his support to Swachh Bharat initiative.
Disregarding the opposition he faced, Tharoor launched the cleanliness drive at Vizhinjam coast on Saturday, which was promptly acknowledged by Modi who called Tharoor’s effort a “great effort” and tweeted that Tharoor’s “active participation in the Swachh Bharat mission is very encouraging”.
On Sunday, Tharoor thanked Modi and posted a video message on his Twitter handle. The message contained visuals of his cleanliness drive. “Thank you narendramodi ji. Here’s a video of my clean-up & a request to you,” he tweeted. The request was for central assistance to clean up a polluted water body — Parvathy Puthanar — in Thiruvananthapuram. Tharoor, however, said that his action has no political significance.
“To my mind there is no political significance to this event. I didn’t see it as a political activity. But rather to me it was part of a national mission. After all, it was Mahatma Gandhi who declared before Independence that sanitation was more important than Independence… The first Congress government of India led by Jawaharlal Nehru gave the nation its first rural sanitation programme.
The NDA under (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee turned it into a total sanitation programme. The UPA government under Manmohan Singh expanded and enlarged this progamme. And I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has continued the UPA’s good work by re-baptising it as Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and raising it to the forefront of the national consciousness,” Tharoor said in his video message.
His Twitter bonhomie with Modi has once again raised the hackles of his partymen.
Senior Congress leader from Kerala K Muraleedharan said: “It could be because of his (Tharoor’s) political immaturity. He could have done all this before Modi’s announcement. He ceased to be a minister four five months ago. He could have led the cleanliness drive immediately after that. He could have done it when the Kerala government launched the clean Kerala mission.”

Police to submit report to Mudgal panel todayTweet
0
Dhoni and Raina - under the scannerA high-ranking police team investigating the 2013 IPL betting-fixing scandal is scheduled to submit its report to the Supreme Court-appointed Mukul Mudgal committee here on Monday.
The Mudgal committee will meet for the next four days consecutively, and submit its final report to the Supreme Court on November 3, said a source close to the panel. The next date of hearing is on November 10.
The police team was tasked to probe 13 persons, whose names the Mudgal committee had submitted to the apex court in a sealed envelope in February, along with its first investigation report into the scandal.
Of the 13 persons, the court only disclosed the name of BCCI president N. Srinivasan. The source said that among the rest, there are six international cricketers - widely believed to include India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina - and three first-class players. It is learnt that Dhoni and Raina were quizzed in Delhi recently when they came to the city to play the second One-Day International against West Indies on October 11.
AMONG the other three persons, one is Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of the sidelined BCCI president Srinivasan, who allegedly placed bets on IPL matches, and the other two are said to be small-time Bollywood actor Vindoo Dara Singh and Raj Kundra, co-owner of Rajasthan Royals, whose players were in the thick of the betting-fixing action.
"Whatever interrogation is being done this time, it's being done by the police team. The panel will collect the report from the police and then it'll decide," said the source. "The panel had told them to do it [probe] on their own and that's the best way," the source told MAIL TODAY.
The committee is likely to base its final report on the findings of the police team, besides its own analysis. "The panel will submit the report based on whatever they [the police investigators] have found. It will discuss the evidence and their report, and will then come to a conclusion," said the source.
The four-member police team is headed by 1983 batch IPS officer Bibhuti Bhusana Mishra, currently a Deputy Director General (Operations) of the Narcotics Control Bureau based at its New Delhi headquarters.
"The final discussions will start tomorrow and will go on for the next three days consecutively after that - from October 27 to 30. And the report will be submitted to the Supreme Court on November 3," the source informed.
"The police team has finished interviewing people and will submit its report to the panel tomorrow. The committee members will discuss the police report and analyse it before submitting their own report to the Supreme Court," he said.
"The police team is very good and doing a very thorough job. After all, the police commissioners of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have deputed them for the probe. The panel is very happy with them."
About the identity of the 13 persons under the scanner, the source said: "There are six international players and three non-internationals. We cannot name them because if their names don't come out [as guilty]... we cannot spoil their careers. He said the Supreme Court itself has disclosed Srinivasan's name and added that another would "obviously be Meiyappan", besides Vindoo and Kundra.

BJP approach over black money reflects black mind of its leaders: NitishKumarBy: Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:05 pm
Janata Dal (United) Monday made a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi government over its affidavit on black money saying it reflected BJP leaders’ “black mind” and mocked the party as “Bhrasht Jhoothi Party”.
“Kale dhan par BJP ka rukh unke kale maan ko dikhata hai (The approach of BJP on the issue of black money reflects black mind of its leaders),” senior JD(U) and former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on his facebook account.
He has also lampooned the PM and his predecessor Manmohan Singh through pictures to drive home his point.
“The party which had sought votes in the general election on the issue of corruption and black money during its five month tenure has come out with only three names which also they are not confirming,” Kumar, a known rival of Prime Minister Modi, said reacting to the Centre’s affidavit before the Supreme Court in the black money case.
“Kya is desh mein kewal teen logo ke pass kala dhan hain (do only three persons in the country have blackmoney)?” he said in his sarcastic comment.
“Everyday a new issue of BJP falsehood and fraud comes before people…BJP has become synonymous with ‘Bhrasht Jhooti Party’,” the senior JD(U) leader, who led his party’s snapping of ties with BJP last year over elevation of Modi, said.
Kumar’s hard-hitting comments came on a day when he is meeting JD(U) MPs, MLAs and office bearers on his 16-day “Samparak yatra” starting from November 13 ahead of crucial Assembly poll next year.

Rajiv Gandhi assassination: Apex court dismisses Nalinis pleaRajiv Gandhi assassination: Apex court dismisses Nalini’s plea
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Supreme Court today dismissed the plea of S Nalini, undergoing life imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, challenging the law mandating the Centre’s approval for her release and that of six other convicts.
“Sorry, we are not interested,” a Bench comprising Chief Justice HL Dattu and justices MB Lokur and AK Sikri said.
Nalini had challenged Section 435(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which mandates the state government to consult the Centre before premature release of a convict if the case was investigated by the CBI.
She has been in jail for the last 23 years and undergoing life imprisonment after her death sentence was commuted. She was sentenced to death by the trial court in the case on January 28, 1998.
Nalini’s death sentence was commuted to life term by the Tamil Nadu Governor on April 24, 2000.
“Though 2,200 life convicts who had put in less than 10 years of imprisonment were prematurely released by the Tamil Nadu Government during the last about 15 years, she was excluded from consideration for premature release only on the ground that her offence was investigated by the CBI, that is, her case was covered by Section 435(1)(a) CrPC. The said Section is unconstitutional,” her petition said.
The Centre had earlier contended that the Tamil Nadu Government can’t release the convicts without its approval and had derailed the state government’s decision to release them.
After the apex court had commuted the death sentence of convicts Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan, the Tamil Nadu government on February 19 had proposed to remit the sentences of all seven lifers, including the three, and release them.

Sravanthi Energy, DB Hospitality, Surana Industries, Shiv Vani Oil and Gas, Blue Coast Hotels, Orchid Chemicals, Skill Infrastructure, Era Housing, Murli Industries and Coastal Projects were the top ten NPA accounts of IFCI, collectively worth 1,449.24 crore of credit exposure.

Counter-edit: Why the Sena must not succumb to temptation of joining thegovtMonday's editorial is a publicly offered olive branch -- but Sena leaders have also been accepting in private that the party's stand on taking the BJP head-on is in the process of unravelling. (Source: IE archive)
Written by Kavitha Iyer | Mumbai | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:37 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 5:37 pm
 
Hungering for power after 15 years on Opposition benches, the Shiv Sena seems to be wolfing down humble pie. Monday’s editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna, heaping praise on Amit Shah for the BJP’s “win”, is a far cry from the self congratulatory observation, on the morning after counting, that it had robbed the BJP of a clear win.
Monday’s editorial is a publicly offered olive branch — but Sena leaders have also been accepting in private that the party’s stand on taking the BJP head-on is in the process of unravelling.
While it appears increasingly likely that the Sena will make a delayed entry into the Maharashtra government following negotiations, the arguments for it to refrain from doing so appears compelling. Here’s why the Sena might want to stay off the gravy train for now:
1. For the sake of the future: The decision to go it alone was not based only on who gets to be chief minister. Some hard-nosed analysis had produced the conclusion that ceding seats to the BJP carried with it a real danger of the national juggernaut destroying the smaller party, even if it was an ally of 25 years. The Sena has grown from 44 MLAs to 63 — despite the fact that the party has always had limited presence outside Mumbai and Konkan, and it has come in the face of the BJP’s exceedingly well-oiled election machinery, with a starcast of campaigners led by the Prime Minister himself.
2. To not be seen as having sold out: The voice of the average Shiv Sainik is different from the voice of the small group within the party that stands to gain from entering the government. The Marathi manoos who found appeal in the Shiv Sena’s Marathi versus Gujarati pitch, even if it appears to be bringing diminishing returns, would no doubt see the party’s decision to join the government as a sellout.
3. To give Uddhav a chance: If the huge turnouts at his election rallies and some emotional, rousing speeches were any indication, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has come of age. He has steered the Sena to a position where it is currently the only regional party to have withstood the BJP’s electoral might. In the Opposition, he would hold the moral high ground — not only over the discredited Congress and NCP, but also over the BJP that would require the NCP to abstain on every legislation or policy matter. This could be an opportunity — and a force-multiplier — for the Sena.
4. Because the gains aren’t that much: There are minimal gains from being in power. Issues of urban development that the Sena has been unable to tackle effectively in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation could get a leg-up, continued…

On suspicion of witchcraft  woman stripped  killed inpublicPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 4:31 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 4:37 pm
Twelve persons have been arrested for the alleged daylight murder of a 55-year-old woman Dukulhin Bai on suspicion of practising witchcraft in Bemetra district. All the accused are the relatives of the victim including her brother-in-law Nakul Patel and his wife Ankalhin Bai. According to Bemetara SP Narendra Khare, Patel’s son was unwell for several months and he suspected that Dukulhin had practised witchcraft on him.
Patel and Ankalhin led a mob of nearly two dozen relatives and barged into Dukulhin’s home in Banjarpur village late on Saturday evening. The village is around 50 km from the district headquarters.
They dragged her outside, took her to the village chowk and stripped her before public. All the while her husband, son and entire village remained silent spectator.
“They dragged my mother out of the home. I and my father tried to resist but they were too many,” Dukulhin’s 20-year-old son Ashok Patel said.
The crowd inserted red pepper in her mouth, nostrils and private parts, kicked her and thrashed her badly with sticks. “Entire village watched her but no one came forward for help,” Ashok said.
She sustained serious injuries and was taken to a nearby health centre later at night where doctors declared her dead. All the accused were arrested on Sunday evening.
“This is a family dispute. They killed her on suspicion of witchcraft,” Khare said.
Chhattisgarh has enacted a penal law that invites strict punishment for causing injury to women on suspicion of witchcraft.  Even calling a woman “tonhi” ( a woman who practices witchcraft) may bring imprisonment for three years, but tribal and rural areas of the state often see such violence.
Such is the extent of violence against women on this account, that even the relatives of ruling BJP leaders have complained of it. In March 2013, Hemanti Sai, the daughter-in-law of BJP’s tribal MP Nand Kumar Sai, blamed her in-laws for terming her a “tonhi” and expelling her from home.
In a related incident, two villagers were killed and at least six were injured in police firing in a village of Gariyaband district in June. The police had gone to the village following a complaint by a woman that some villagers tortured her and called her a “tonhi”.  As the police reached the spot, villagers got angry, set her home on fire and attacked the police team.

Pradeep Burman s foreign bank account is legal  says DaburPradip Burman's foreign bank account is legal, says Dabur

Pradip Burman's foreign bank account was "opened when he was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account", Dabur India said on Monday in an official statement. Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who was also named by the government in Supreme Court having black money account, has denied having an account in Swiss Bank.
Pradip Burman is a member of the promoter family of Dabur India.
"The Burman family is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and encourage ethical behaviour at all levels. We wish to state that this account was opened when he was an NRI and was legally allowed to open this account. We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable. Therefore, it is unfortunate that every person having a foreign bank account is being painted with the same brush," the official statement said.
Pradip Burman was once a wholetime director of Dabur India but he does not hold any executive position in the company now.
Dabur India is a 130-year-old fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company that started its journey from erstwhile Calcutta and has around 200 plus products in its portfolio.
Meanwhile, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Lodhya, who has been named by the Centre in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in the black money case, denied having a foreign bank account and said he was shocked to find his name in the list.
"I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media, I am shocked," Lodhya told reporters in Rajkot.
"I have declared all my wealth before the Income Tax department," he said.
Replying to a question on his future course of action, Lodhya said, "We will cooperate with all the authorities and legal procedure will be followed by us."
Lodhya is the owner of city-based Shreeji Trading Company, which is involved in bullion trading. It has business links in all major cities of the country for gold trading.
The firm offers wholesale delivery of bullion to domestic users like ornament manufacturers, goldsmiths, jewellers and semi-wholesalers.
The group, established 15 years back, has branch networks in Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, its website said.
It has two subsidiaries - Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd and Shreeji Realty.
Lodhya's firm also started a spot precious metal online trading system called Shreeji Spot in 2008.
The central government on Monday disclosed names of three people,  including Pradeep Burman, who are holding bank accounts in foreign  countries and are now under the lens of Income Tax authorities.

What s Really Killing McDonald sreddit
Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. Photographer: Noriyuki Aida/Bloomberg via Getty Images
As sales and profits have crumbled at McDonald's recently, some observers have blamed low-income Americans, saying they must not be able to afford Big Macs any more.
But that's wrong. If anything, Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. The real problem is that the iconic chain needs to win back its true base: middle-class Americans looking for a cheap, quick meal.
For the past 11 months, sales at U.S. McDonald's restaurants open at least a year -- a key measure of an eatery's health -- have fallen or remained flat. The company announced earlier this week that U.S. same-store sales fell 4.1 percent in September, the worst monthly drop in more than a decade, and that profits plunged 30 percent in its latest quarter. The company's stock price has tumbled about 11 percent over the past six months.
One common explanation for McDonald's woes is that low-income Americans are suffering from a sluggish recovery and unable to afford eating out at McDonald's any more.
But the numbers don't back up that take. For one thing, McDonald's has actually become more of a bargain relative to other food options in recent years: McDonald’s prices haven’t risen as quickly as prices at fast-casual eateries like Panera Bread, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. Nor have they risen as quickly as broader food inflation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data:
McDonald's menu prices grew more slowly than prices at fast-casual chains and food inflation overall between 2009 and 2014.
And yet diners are still flocking to other chains despite their typically higher costs. When Chipotle raised menu prices earlier this year, customers didn’t bat an eye -- the chain reported a profit jump of 25 percent the following quarter. That suggests McDonald's problem isn't so much pricing, but a perception that its food isn't worth any price -- unlike, say, Chipotle, which has positioned itself as offering fast, fresh and quality food for which customers are willing to pay more.
Unlike Walmart, whose fortunes have largely mirrored that of the poor , McDonald’s doesn’t take food stamps. That makes it an unlikely regular destination for low-income Americans, according to Joel Berg, the author of “All You Can Eat? How Hungry Is America?”
In fact, a 2011 study from the University of California-Davis found that fast-food consumption actually rises with income, until incomes reach about $60,000.
“That conventional wisdom is wrong,” Berg said of the notion that poor people are more likely to eat at places like McDonald’s.
Given the strength of that conventional wisdom, it's likely going to take a full revamp of McDonald's image to convince the middle-class customers who have fled the chain that it offers more than just cheap burgers for people who can’t afford anything better. What has been the quintessential McDonald’s experience for decades -- inexpensive food that tastes the same everywhere -- just isn’t as appealing any more.
To fix this, the company is working to convince diners it sells “fresh, quality food” at a reasonable price, partly through "transparency initiatives" like a campaign last week asking people to submit questions about its food, according to Heidi Barker, a McDonald's spokeswoman.
"McDonald’s appeals to customers of many diverse backgrounds and lifestyles," Barker wrote in an e-mail statement. "There’s value at every level of the menu, from our Dollar Menu and More to our premium sandwiches and salads, and McCafe beverages."
It could be a hard sell, as McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson acknowledged on a conference call with analysts Tuesday.
“The question is whether or not our value and our food options are resonating as strongly," he said. "I believe that that is the fundamental basis of some of the challenges that we are having.”

Goldman cuts 2015 oil price forecast as output tops demandGoldman slashes 2015 oil price forecast as output tops demand
Aaron Sheldrick     Tokyo/Singapore   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 17:56 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Goldman Sachs has slashed its 2015 oil price forecasts, making it the most bearish among major financial institutions, following a near 25 per cent fall in crude prices over the past five months.
The US investment bank said rising output will outstrip demand - and its new numbers weighed further on benchmark Brent crude prices - as forecasters generally pare back estimates for oil due to slowing global growth, a strengthening dollar and ample supplies.
Goldman analysts said in a report released late on Sunday that they expect US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)crude to fall to $75 a barrel and Brent to $85 a barrel in the first quarter of 2015, both down $15 a barrel from their previous forecast.
WTI could fall as low as $70 in the second quarter and Brent as low as $80, when oversupply would be the most pronounced, before returning to first-quarter levels, Goldman said.
Goldman's projections contrast with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago. He is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team cut their first quarter Brent forecast to $98 but pared back their forecast for calendar 2015 by just $5, to $105 a barrel.
Brent crude futures dipped 0.3 per cent on Monday to less than $86 a barrel, extending their decline despite a continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery, said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research & Consulting.
"I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman," Akuta said.
NYMEX crude for December delivery was up 4 cents at $81.05 a barrel by 0848 GMT, after settling down $1.08 on Friday following a spike up on Thursday.
If WTI fell to $70 a barrel next year, as Goldman Sachs is forecasting, it would be the US benchmark's lowest level since mid-2010.
RISING OUTPUT
Goldman said production outside OPEC countries was expected to accelerate, led by Brazil and drilling in the Gulf of Mexico with the end of extensive deep-water maintenance following the 2010 Macondo disaster.
Non OPEC-production outside the US lower 48 states is forecast to increase by 412,000 barrels per day this year, 573,000 bpd in 2015 and 505,000 bpd in 2016.
Output from Brazil's Santos basin is forecast to start to pick up, increasing Brazilian output by 206,000 bpd in 2014 and 325,000 bpd next year. Gulf of Mexico production is expected to increase by 155,000 bpd in 2015.
Among OPEC countries, Iraqi production is seen increasing by 200,000 bpd and Libya's output stabilising at about 700,000 bpd, compared with recent production of about 900,000 bpd.
Iranian production and exports are unlikely to see further growth because Goldman analysts do not expect a resolution to the country's nuclear dispute with the West by the Nov. 24 deadline, meaning sanctions on Tehran will not be lifted.
On the demand side, growth has only averaged 630,000 barrels per day year-on-year so far, less than half Goldman's initial forecast for 2014, the report said.
Global economic growth is forecast by Goldman analysts to increase to 3.5 per cent next year but there is a "risk that the historical relationship between global GDP growth and oil demand has weakened," the report said.
SHALE IMPACT
In the United States, rising shale production is increasingly affecting global energy flows and eroding OPEC's pricing power, Goldman said.
Anthony Jude, a senior adviser on energy and sustainable development matters for the Asian Development Bank , cited falling US oil imports as the primary reason for lower global oil prices.
The United States is "producing an additional 3 million barrels per day because of shale oil", he said on Monday on the sidelines of Singapore International Energy Week.
US crude oil imports have fallen to 7.0 million-7.6 million bpd from peaks above 10 million bpd in 2005 and 2006 since the advent of the shale oil and gas boom, according to data posted on the website of the US Energy Information Administration.
"US shale is the marginal swing barrel in the new order," Goldman said, adding that a slowdown in production will happen when WTI falls to $75 per barrel.
"US shale oil production has continued to surprise to the upside with US domestic oil prices incentivising strong investment," the report said.
Once prices fall and US production slows, Goldman expects cutbacks among OPEC producers including Saudi Arabia, which has been content to let prices fall in the hope of forcing US shale producers out of the market.
"Any near-term OPEC production cut will be modest until there is sufficient evidence of a slowdown in US shale oil production growth," the report said.

One killed in clash between TMC and BJPsupportersPolicemen carry an injured villager after the clash at Makra village in Birbhum on Monday. (PTI)
Written by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata | Posted: October 28, 2014 2:06 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 2:54 am
Three persons were killed and one sustained critical bullet injuries while at least five housed were gutted in a clash between Trinamool Congress and BJP supporters Monday at Makra village under Parui police station area in Birbhum district of West Bengal.
A strong police contingent under Additional Superintendent of Police Ananda Roy was present on the spot, sources said, adding that it failed to stop the violence.
The deceased were identified as Tausif Sheikh, 16, Soleman Sheikh, 25, and Mozzamel whose age could not be ascertained, police sources said.
While Tuasif and Mozzamel were from Makra village, Soleman was a resident of neighbouring Dubrajpur village. All three sustained bullet injuries from country-made pistols. Another Makra villager, Enamul Sheikh, too sustained bullet injuries and was admitted to a local hospital.
No arrests were made till the last reports came in.
The nearly three-hour-long violence, which broke out early morning, saw gunbattles and bomb attacks. It came at a time when National Security Advisor Ajit Doval along with NSG DG J N Chowdhury, and special secretary (internal security) Prakash Misra were inspecting the October 2 blast site in neighbouring Burdwan, just about 50 km away.
The clash, the sources said, broke out as the TMC tried to capture Makra village, which is considered a BJP stronghold and which has a mostly Muslim population. The violence captured live by regional channels showed villagers, even women, running with firearms, bombs and other weapons.
A police team lead by Alok Rajoria, SP, Birbhum, could enter the village nearly three hours after the clashes broke and started rescuing the injured.
Trading charges, both TMC and BJP have blamed each other for the violence.
District BJP leaders claimed that Tausif was a party supporter as he belonged to Makra village, their stronghold. They claimed a large number of villages in the area have become their supporters and the TMC was targeting them.
District TMC president Anubrata Mondal, however, claimed that all three victims belonged to his party.

Guwahati, Oct 27:  
The missing Executive Director designate of Indian Oil Corporation Kaushik Bora was found today near a jungle inside the complex of an oil well near Digboi in Upper Assam, police said.
Tinsukia Additional Superintendent of Police Lamhao Dongol said Bora was spotted this afternoon within just one kilometre from where his car was found last evening.
“Bora was perfectly fine and was found towards the jungle side within the oil well compound in the area. It is not a case of kidnapping. What we could gather from our investigation is that he is suffering from depression and he went himself,” Dongol said.
He said Bora’s wife had informed that he was taken to Apollo Hospital in New Delhi earlier this month.
Bora, who was to be promoted to the post of Executive Director of the Digboi Refinery of IOC, left his home yesterday in the afternoon for work but no news of him was received till evening.
His car was found from Digboi-Pengeri road near an oil well.

Shiv Sena talks sweet  backs BJP for CM post  favourscoalitionComments
Shiv Sena on Monday appeared resigned to backing it in government formation but there was no clarity yet on whether it will join the ministry.
As BJP prepared to elect the leader of its legislature party on Tuesday who will be the party’s first Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena on Monday appeared resigned to backing it in government formation but there was no clarity yet on whether it will join the ministry.
The newly elected BJP MLAs will meet here at 11 am tomorrow in the presence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and party’s general secretary in-charge of the state J P Nadda to elect their leader.
“After the legislature party leader is elected, we will call on Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and stake claim to form government tomorrow itself,” BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy told PTI.
State BJP president Devendra Fadnavis, 44, is being seen as clear favourite for Chief Minister’s post.
According to party sources, the new government will be sworn in on October 31 in the presence of top central leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several of his Cabinet colleagues and BJP Chief Ministers.
Speaking openly in favour of a BJP-led coalition government for the first time, senior Sena leader and spokesman Sanjay Raut said it will be a “stable” dispensation.
“If Shiv Sena and BJP come together to form a government it will be stable. Our ties with BJP are very old. Whatever happened during the election we have have forgotten. Ours is not like an India-Pakistan fight.
“The people have given mandate to BJP. It has got more seats. It is our duty (to lend support to BJP). Sena’s support will always be there for a Chief Minister who works in the interest of Maharashtra,” he said.
Though back channel talks were on between the leaders of the two parties which had parted ways just before the poll following failure of seat-sharing talks, there was no clarity yet on whether Sena will be part of the government or support it from outside.
Sharad Pawar’s NCP, with 41 MLAs, has already offered unconditional outside support to BJP, which has 121 MLAs and pre-poll ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha one in the 288-member Assembly, in its bid to form government.
Making things easier for BJP further, the party made it clear that it will bail out the new government during the trust vote if Shiv Sena does not join it.
“If Shiv Sena joins the government, there will be no problem. We will not be part of the government but do not want to create instability by voting against a minority government.
So, NCP will abstain, if there is voting,” party spokesman Nawab Malik told PTI.
NCP would like to honour the people’s mandate which is in favour of BJP, the single largest party, he said. BJP had won 122 continued…

Screen local films at least for one week  ULFA faction tells theatre ownersBy: Press Trust of India | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:25 pm
For a change, fugitive rebel leader Paresh Barua’s anti-talk faction of ULFA is not talking about his armed struggle for a “sovereign” state. Instead, he has asked theatre-owners in Assam to screen films made in Assamese and other local languages at least for one week so that the state’s film industry did not collapse.
The ULFA faction’s statement signed by its chairman Abhijit Asom and issued through email, came close on the heels of award-winning filmmaker Prabin Hazarika complaining that theatre-owners were not inclined to screen his latest film “Shrinkhal” and preferring Hindi films over his.
The ULFA anti-talk faction chairman, who issued a statement from his hideout in Myanmar, picked up from Hazarika’s complaint made two days ago after theatres removed his Assamese film for a Hindi movie and said the outfit was “concerned” over the “attitude” of theatre owners.
“It is a matter of concern that theatre-owners were not interested in screening Assamese films and preferred Hindi films instead,” he said.
“If theatre-owners can earn huge profits by screening Hindi films throughout the year, what is the harm in promoting the growth of Assamese films by screening each local film at least for one week?” the ULFA leader asked.
“Moreover, it would also be a kind of social responsibility,” he said, mildly warning that those who do not screen Assamese and local films were not well-wishers of Assam. Even if each theatre screened each Assamese film for one week, it is more than enough, he added.
Meanwhile, “Shrinkhal” director Prabin Hazarika, when contacted said it was true that most theatre-owners were not interested in screening his film. “My film is not a typical boy-meets-girl film. The story is by an eminent filmmaker like Bhabendra Nath Saikia. Moreover, the turn-out was very good in the first one week, which is one reason why it should have been continued,” Hazarika said.
His film which is currently running to full house in the second week in two theatres in Guwahati, is partly financed 60 per cent by the Assam Film Finance & Development Corporation and has two well-known Bollywood actors from Assam, they being Adil Hussain and Jaya Seal.

The S&P energy index <.SPNY> tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude  fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. Leading the decline, shares of Exxon Mobil  fell 2.3 percent to $91.70 while shares of Chevron  dropped 3.7 percent to $106.80.
The energy index is now down 12.8 percent for the year and is the only major S&P sectors in negative territory for 2014. [O/R] The S&P 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far.
Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market.
Meanwhile several of the year's biggest gainers also sold off, possibly due to year-end profit-taking, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among them, Apple  was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro  shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65.
"This has been a monster market, and it's been eking out new records. So it's taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done," said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69.
The tumble follows gains Friday, which had pushed the S&P 500 to a record high close for the 49th time this year.
Volume picked up after midday, while the S&P 500 moved more than 21 points from its high for the day to its low, its largest high-to-low swing in more than a month.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 71 more stocks made 52-week lows compared with those making new highs, the largest gap skewed in favor of new lows since Oct. 16, the day after the market made its bottom in the recent pullback.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 919, for a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,048 issues fell and 699 advanced for a 2.93-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
McDonald's  shares shed 3.8 percent to $92.61 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a steeper-than-expected fall in global same-restaurant sales in November and said fourth-quarter results would be hurt by a supplier scandal in China and a stronger dollar.
About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

5 Powerful Ways To Boost Your Confidence5 Powerful Ways To Boost Your Confidence
 | By                                                                Peter Economy

Self-confident people are admired by others and inspire confidence in others. They face their fears head-on and tend to be risk takers. They know that no matter what obstacles come their way, they have the ability to get past them . Self-confident people tend to see their lives in a positive light even when things aren't going so well, and they are typically satisfied with and respect themselves.
Wouldn't it be amazing to have this kind of self-confidence, every day of the week? Guess what? You can.
"Low self-confidence isn't a life sentence. Self-confidence can be learned, practiced, and mastered--just like any other skill. Once you master it, everything in your life will change for the better." -- Barrie Davenport
It comes down to one simple question: If you don't believe in yourself, how do you expect anybody else to?
Try some of the tips listed below. Don't just read them and put them on the back burner. Really begin to practice them daily, beginning today. You might have to fake it at first and merely appear to be self-confident, but eventually you will begin to feel the foundation of self-confidence grow within you. With some time and practice (this is not an overnight phenomenon), you too can be a self-confident person, both inside and out, whom others admire and say "Yes!" to.
1. Stay away from negativity and bring on the positivity
This is the time to really evaluate your inner circle, including friends and family. This is a tough one, but it's time to seriously consider getting away from those individuals who put you down and shred your confidence. Even a temporary break from Debbie Downer can make a huge difference and help you make strides toward more self-confidence.

Yet Another Reason to Watch Your Body Language: It Can Make You Happier
Be positive, even if you're not feeling it quite yet. Put some positive enthusiasm into your interactions with others and hit the ground running, excited to begin your next project. Stop focusing on the problems in your life and instead begin to focus on solutions and making positive changes.
2. Change your body language and image
This is where posture, smiling, eye contact , and speech slowly come into play. Just the simple act of pulling your shoulders back gives others the impression that you are a confident person. Smiling will not only make you feel better, but will make others feel more comfortable around you. Imagine a person with good posture and a smile and you'll be envisioning someone who is self-confident.
Look at the person you are speaking to, not at your shoes -- keeping eye contact shows confidence. Last, speak slowly. Research has proved that those who take the time to speak slowly and clearly feel more self-confidence and appear more self-confident to others. The added bonus is they will actually be able to understand what you are saying.
Go the extra mile and style your hair, give yourself a clean shave, and dress nicely. Not only will this make you feel better about yourself, but others are more likely to perceive you as successful and self-confident as well. A great tip: When you purchase a new outfit, practice wearing it at home first to get past any wardrobe malfunctions before heading out.
3. Don't accept failure and get rid of the negative voices in your head
Never give up. Never accept failure. There is a solution to everything, so why would you want to throw in the towel? Make this your new mantra . Succeeding through great adversity is a huge confidence booster.
Low self-confidence is often caused by the negative thoughts running through our minds on an endless track. If you are constantly bashing yourself and saying you're not good enough, aren't attractive enough, aren't smart enough or athletic enough, and on and on, you are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. You are becoming what you are preaching inside your head, and that's not good. The next time you hear that negativity in your head, switch it immediately to a positive affirmation and keep it up until it hits the caliber of a self-confidence boost.
4. Be prepared
Learn everything there is to know about your field, job, presentation -- whatever is next on your "to conquer" list. If you are prepared, and have the knowledge to back it up, your self-confidence will soar.
5. For tough times, when all else fails: Create a great list
Life is full of challenges and there are times when it's difficult to keep our self-confidence up. Sit down right now and make a list of all the things in your life that you are thankful for, and another list of all the things you are proud of accomplishing . Once your lists are complete, post them on your refrigerator door, on the wall by your desk, on your bathroom mirror -- somewhere where you can easily be reminded of what an amazing life you have and what an amazing person you really are. If you feel your self-confidence dwindling, take a look at those lists and let yourself feel and be inspired all over again by you.

A Handshake and a Drink in a Digital Worldreddit
If you are in business in the 21st century, you've heard from multiple sources that you need to have an optimized digital presence if you hope to succeed. This message may ring a little louder if you are an independent worker. But what does an "optimized digital presence" even mean? In so many words, it means an updated LinkedIn profile, active social accounts, participation in online discussions, and so forth, all with the goal of popping up in a potential client's search results.
Now, think about your last few projects. How did you find them?
If you answered Facebook or Twitter, good for you. You've finally broken through the independent consultant's glass ceiling. But you're in the minority; in-person referrals are still the best way for solopreneurs to get their next contract. In a study released last spring by The Career Advisory Board (CAB), 82% of independent workers claimed that word of mouth was their top source of work. Supporting this number is MBO Partners own State of Independence report that found that 75% of independent workers cited word of mouth as their main source of work. As for social media, 6% (CAB) and 2% (MBO) cited this as a top source of work.
However, small business owners (including the self-employed) aren't getting the memo . Forty-three percent of small businesses spend 6 or more hours per week twiddling around on social accounts, with 11% spending up to 20 hours a week! Sixty-six percent of small businesses report spending more time on social media this year than they did last year, and the vast majority reported that they aren't spending the same amount of time talking to potential customers; they're spending it looking for something to say.
What do the numbers mean for you?
If updates and shares are not converting to new business it may be time to rethink your strategy. How many social sites are you on? Whittle the number down to one or two that you've gotten the most traction on. Define a strategy, set a time limit per week, and stick to it. The two hours you save in a week just may be the happy hour that wins you the next big deal.
Better yet, do you have the cash to bring on a part-time social media guru to manage your accounts for you? If you found a service that costs a few hundred dollars a month, ask yourself this: how much is a billable hour worth to me, and how many hours do I spend on social? The service could pay for itself.
Even if that's not the move for you, it's ok to tone it down on social and refocus on good old-fashioned face-to-face networking.
If you've spent hours and hours on social each week, and don't have a dime to show for it, it's time to get back to your roots. A handshake and a drink is still the best way to seal a contract, as well as learn about others who need your services. At least we know that type of networking will never go out of style.

Still Need A Halloween Costume Print Thisreddit
Halloween is right around the corner, but some of us undoubtedly have yet to decide on a costume. A British company has the solution: printable masks.
Wintercroft is a company founded by Steve Wintercroft, an artist with a passion for craftsmanship and conservation. He came up with the idea for his geometric masks when he himself was struggling to come up with a Halloween costume a few years ago, according to his website .

"I sat down with a pile of old cardboard, some parcel tape, a pair of scissors and plenty of hot tea," he writes. "An hour or so later, and after some trial and error, I had made myself a fox mask ... The goal is to create a set of masks that could be built by anyone using local materials, removing the need for mass manufacturing or shipping and with the minimum environmental impact."
Wintercroft sells mask kits -- with designs including a pumpkin, tiger and stormtrooper -- at Wintercroft.com and on Etsy . The company provides downloadable masks with instructions to create the 3D product, which Wintercroft says takes between two and three hours with the help of some scissors and glue.
The masks cost around $8 each.

Rupee rises 8 paise against dollar in early tradeRupee snaps four-session rally, ends 3 paise down
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 18:41 IST

The Indian rupee on Monday snapped a four-session rally and softened by three paise to end at 61.30 against the Greenback on dollar demand from oil importers amid weakness in local equities.
A better dollar overseas ahead of two-day monetary policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve starting on Tuesday and slowing capital inflows also weighed negatively on the market.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic currency resumed strong at 61.19 a dollar from last Wednesday's close of 61.27 and immediately touched a high of 61.18 following initial rally in local stocks.
Later, it met with strong resistance in line with fall in domestic equities amid fresh month-end dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners, to day's low of 61.36 before settling at 61.30, a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent.
In the previous four trading sessions, the rupee had risen by 56 paise or 0.91 per cent. The Forex market was closed on October 23 and 24 on account of holidays.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, which was up by nearly 144 points in early stages, fell back and closed down by 98.15 points or 0.37 per cent. FPIs/FIIs sold shares worth Rs 12.38 crore last on Thursday as per provisional data.
The dollar index was up by a marginal 0.03 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: "Monday Rupee opened on a strong note taking cues from local equities. As the day progressed, rupee lost his way and closed in red due to month end dollar buying pressure from oil marketing companies. The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 60.80 to 61.80."
"We believe that the Rupee could remain weak as importers could continue to purchase Dollars for the month-end payments for defense and oil imports," said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India Pvt Ltd.

AIPA urges DGCA to stop low air fare schemesAir passengers' body AIPA urges DGCA to stop low air fare schemes
IANS     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 13:39 IST

Describing the frequent special discount fare offers by domestic carriers as "non-existent", the Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday urged regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to permit such schemes.
"We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger," APAI president D Sidhakara Reddy said in a communication to the DGCA.
In the latest instance over the last few weeks, budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday launched its 'Diwali Dhamaka' sale , with one-way fares starting as low as Rs.899 (including taxes).
According to the company, tickets can be booked October 21-26, 2014 for travel between November 1 to December 15, 2014.
" SpiceJet has fundamentally changed the air travel paradigm in India this year, with offers that are frequent and often lower than train fares," chief operating officer Sanjiv Kapoor said announcing the scheme.
"We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline's portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings," Reddy said.
Pointing out that it has become routine by airlines to announce such schemes almost once every 10-15 days, their aim appears to achieve cheap publicity for the airline, APAI said.
The association asked the regulator whether the carriers inform about the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with the DGCA showing the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered under the bucket pricing method.
"If they are not, then what action do you propose for not following the procedure?" APAI asked in its letter.
Reddy also said the association would explore the Right to Information (RTI) route if the DGCA did not respond in the matter.

A shocking slump in Chinese consumer demand will undermine World economic    growth and stock markets

The capitulation of the Chinese consumer threatens to drag stock markets    around the world into a death spiral as one of the pillars of global growth    is undermined.
Figures from the world’s largest consumer goods groups last week laid bare the    shocking weakness of consumer demand in China, which threatens to pull down    global stock markets that have been priced to perfection by more than five    years of extraordinary monetary policy and asset price inflation.
For China to avoid a hard landing it was essential for consumer spending to    pick up from where centrally planned infrastructure spending left off, but    there are signs this simply isn’t happening. Unilever, the world’s third    largest consumer goods company, said they were surprised by the “unusually    rapid” slowdown in Chinese consumer demand.
The company said that sales growth had slumped to about 2pc during the nine    months ended September, down from about 8pc growth last year. The slowdown    in Chinese sales growth to about 2pc is also an average – there are pockets    where trading is far worse. The company added that sales to the big    hypermarkets in the country are less than 2pc or even negative in some    cases.
Nestle, the worlds largest food company, recently reported falling sales for    the first nine months of the year and also warned of “challenging” Chinese    trading conditions. The fear of China going backwards is now becoming a    reality, as the Chinese consumer is not picking up from where capital    investment left off.

FTSE defensive shares for a market downturn
21 Oct 2014
Immediately after the 2008 banking crisis China launched the largest stimulus    package and infrastructure investment program the world has ever seen. China    has used 6.6 gigatons of cement in the last three years compared to 4.5    gigatons the USA has used in 100 years.
The stimulus package increased fixed capital investment to 50pc of GDP, while    domestic consumption withered to only 35pc. The lopsided economy led Hu    Jintao, the President of China until 2012, to call the period of growth “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable.” The hope was it    would eventually kick start consumer spending.
Those hopes have been shattered by the bursting of the Chinese housing bubble    that is having a devastating impact on consumer confidence. Chinese house    prices in September have fallen for the fifth month in a row and wiped out    all the gains of the past year, according to National Bureau of Statistics    (NBS) data last week.
House prices across 70 major Chinese cities declined by 1.3pc in September    from a year earlier. The housing correction is widespread with prices    falling month-on-month in a record 69 out of 70 major cities, up from 68 in    August, according to NBS data. This will have wide ranging effects on the    Chinese economy as according to French bank Societe Generale: “the aggregate    exposure of China’s financial system to the property market is likely to be    as much as 80pc of GDP.”
The unravelling of the China housing bubble is a serious problem for the world    economy. China is expected to be the largest constituent with almost $1    trillion of global GDP growth in 2015. Combined with the US the two    countries are estimated to generate more than 90pc of growth. In stark    contrast the next largest contributor is the UK with less than $200bn.
Undershooting global growth targets wouldn’t usually be a problem but stock    markets around the world are priced to perfection after more than five years    of extraordinary monetary policy. Last week the S&P 500 rallied by more than    3.7pc to 1,957, and has now nearly erased October’s sharp losses. According    to the Shiller  price earnings valuation for US markets they are 54pc    overvalued.
The US markets cheered signs that the Federal Reserve and the European Central    Bank could act in concert to pump more money into the system after the    October selloff spooked investors.  The Vix, the so-called “fear index” that    measures market volatility, has fallen back to more normal levels in a sign    investors believe everything is ok. The Vix spiked to two year highs in    mid-October as growth fears gripped markets.
UK markets are likewise staging a tentative recovery. The FTSE 100 index of    leading shares was up 1.3pc to 6,388 last week, still some way short of    highs of 6,904 in early September.
While stock markets may have been lulled into a false sense of security by the    soothing words from central bankers, investors should take a look out of the    window at the brutal reality in the real world.
The number of UK companies issuing profit warnings in the third quarter has    reached the highest total since the 2008 banking crisis, according to this    mornings survey from accountants EY. Having spent the past five years    pushing through price increases while wages remained static many companies    have now hit a profit ceiling.
Consumer’s disposable income is also reaching breaking point. In order to    shift goods retailers are facing a deflationary spiral. Unilever last week    reported European sales down 4.3pc, far worse than market consensus for a    1pc decline. Worryingly the group reported sales volumes down 1.7pc, and    price deflation of 2.7pc during the third quarter.
It is not just those exposed to consumers that are experiencing a sharp    slowdown. Engine maker Rolls-Royce, shocked investors with its second profit    warning of the year, blaming the shaky economy and the effect of Russian    trade sanctions for a revenue crunch this year and no earnings growth next    year.
The profit warnings are no longer isolated to one-off weather events, or    industries either, the slowdown is engrained in the real economy.
Bellwether corporates in the US such as MacDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Ford have    all reported dismal numbers. McDonald’s was particularly eye opening, as    last week the company said that U.S. same-store sales fell 4.1pc in    September, the worst monthly drop in more than a decade, and that profits    plunged 30pc in its third quarter.
Historically the last week in October tends to be good for UK stocks, but    investors shouldn’t use this as a buying opportunity. The clouds are    gathering and the 2015 global growth story looks holed beneath the water    line.
 

re-election as Brazil s presidentRousseff: Brazil's 'Iron Lady'
President Dilma Rousseff has promised to re-unite Brazil after narrowly winning re-election to a second term in office with 51.6% of the vote.
She said "dialogue" would be her top priority after a bitterly fought campaign against centre-right candidate Aecio Neves, who got 48.4% of the vote.
The left-wing leader said she wanted to be "a much better president than I have been until now".
She faced mass protests last year against corruption and poor services.
But Ms Rousseff, who has been in power since 2010, remains popular with poor Brazilians thanks to her government's welfare programmes.
Political reform
The vote split Latin America's biggest country almost evenly in two, along lines of social class and geography.
Whereas Dilma Rousseff did well in the poorer northern states, her opponent from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) took many of the wealthier and more developed southern parts of Brazil.
After an acrimonious and closely fought campaign, Rousseff supporters were clearly relieved to have won
Mr Neves's supporters saw their chance of ousting the PT from power vanish for another term
The president said that during the campaign "the word repeated most often was change and the idea most often invoked was reform".
Analysis: Wyre Davies, BBC News, Rio de Janeiro
The president's appeal for unity and dialogue was an important recognition that, despite 12 years of tangible social benefits under Workers' Party (PT) rule, millions of Brazilians are less than satisfied.
The standards of public services across the country in health, education and basic sanitation are too low for a country that prides itself on having the seventh largest economy in the world.
This government deserves credit for helping to bring millions of people out of poverty but, as a result, public expectations here are now much higher.
By the time Dilma leaves office in 2018, the Workers' Party will have been in power for 16 years.
That may prove too much for some to bear but it is undeniable that life for most Brazilians has improved immeasurably during the PT's mandate thus far.

"Sometimes in history, close outcomes trigger results more quickly than ample victories," she said.
"It is my hope, or even better, my certainty that the clash of ideas can create room for consensus, and my first words are going to be a call for peace and unity," she told a cheering crowd in the capital, Brasilia.
"Instead of widening differences and creating a rift, I have the strong hope that we can use this energy to build bridges."
She also thanked her supporters, especially her political mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Analysis: Katy Watson, South America Business reporter
Poorer Brazilians voted in Dilma Rousseff for a second term because of her party's track record in lifting millions out of poverty.
But the business community is more worried about the future. The election race was full of twists and turns - all closely followed by the financial markets.
On Monday, the benchmark Bovespa index plunged more than 5%; all of its gains this year have been wiped out.
Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil's economic woes. Key to this will be who she names as her new finance minister and what policies her government will adopt.
Will it be more of the same interventionist policies that businesses say stifle confidence and trade? Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday's election.
The divided nature of the vote was palpable in Sao Paulo, where disappointed supporters of Mr Neves chanted "Kick the PT out!" while PT voters waved flags and celebrated in the streets.
Mr Neves admitted defeat and thanked the "more than 50 million Brazilians who voted for the path to change".
He said that the "overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians".
Ms Rousseff promised wide-spread reform and a "rigorous fight against corruption", one of the grievances which led to mass protests last year.
She said she would "strengthen control mechanism and propose changes to the legislation to put an end to impunity".
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
She said she would "continue to fight inflation and make improvements in the field of fiscal responsibility".
With Brazil's once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.

It has ordered all the accused to appear before it on October 30
A local court trying the case of multi-crore accounting fraud in erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) may announce a date for verdict on October 30.
CBI special public prosecutor K Surender said the court has ordered all the accused to appear before it on that date.
The 10 accused in the case include prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju, his brother and Satyam’s former MD B Rama Raju, ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, Raju’s another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch Srisailam, and Satyam’s former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The trial in Satyam fraud case had concluded in June before the special court, which examined 216 witnesses and marked 3,038 documents during the course of the hearing.
Touted as the country’s biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009 after Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company’s account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees.
Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother.
In February that year, CBI took over the investigation and filed three charge sheets (on April 7, 2009, November 24, 2009 and January 7, 2010), which were later clubbed into one.
Raju and others were charged with offences like cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust, under relevant sections of IPC, for inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of various I-T laws.
During the trial, the CBI alleged that the scam caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to Satyam shareholders, while the defence countered the charges, saying the accused were not responsible for the fraud and all the documents filed by the central agency relating to the case were fabricated and not according to law.

Daily Record calls a "power grab"SNS/Action Images/Reuters
Graham Wallace (R) is axed as Ashley (L) flexes his muscles while fans can only look on
RANGERS chief executive Graham Wallace has been fired as part of Mike Ashley ’s Ibrox power grab.
Wallace – who is expected to be replaced by Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias – was axed on Saturday morning, moments after the club’s beleaguered board accepted a £2m crisis loan from the Sports Direct magnate and his departure was confirmed this morning.
It’s hotly anticipated his £300,000-a-year role will now be given to Llambias as part of a boardroom shake-up.

Ashley also wants another close pal, Stephen Mucklow, to replace finance director Philip Nash, who resigned on Friday. In return for his cash, Ashley demanded the right to make two changes to the board and also has security over two of the club’s main assets, the Albion car park and Edmiston House.

Record Sport can also reveal that, after learning of Brian Kennedy’s late counter offer of a £3m funding package on Friday morning, Ashley threatened the club’s directors with legal action if his own deal was rejected .
A source said: “Ashley was apoplectic when he heard Kennedy made a bigger offer.
“His lawyers made it clear to the board there could be devastating repercussions for those who tried to stand in his way. It’s no surprise a few bottles crashed. Ashley is not someone to be messed with.”
Wallace had approached Kennedy on Thursday in a desperate bid to block Ashley’s power grab. He then left for a holiday in Greece on Friday. Details of his severance package are as yet unclear.

Among those refused cover was Keith Dowley, a commercial property adviser from south west London, who bought a Range Rover this month after his previous one was stolen.
He said Range Rover told him it was his matter to resolve.
‘I had to tell them, ‘No, this is your problem, I have just bought a £100,000 car from you, if I can’t get insurance, I can’t drive it, and if I can’t drive it, I don’t want it’,’ Mr Dowley said.
He eventually secured cover from another provider.
A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said: ‘Our line-up continues to meet the insurance industry requirements as tested and agreed with relevant insurance bodies.
‘Nevertheless we are taking this issue very seriously.’

Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil's economic woes. Key to this will be who she names as her new finance minister and what policies her government will adopt.
Will it be more of the same interventionist policies that businesses say stifle confidence and trade? Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday's election.
The divided nature of the vote was palpable in Sao Paulo, where disappointed supporters of Mr Neves chanted "Kick the PT out!" while PT voters waved flags and celebrated in the streets.
Mr Neves admitted defeat and thanked the "more than 50 million Brazilians who voted for the path to change".
He said that the "overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians".
Ms Rousseff promised wide-spread reform and a "rigorous fight against corruption", one of the grievances which led to mass protests last year.
She said she would "strengthen control mechanism and propose changes to the legislation to put an end to impunity".
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
She said she would "continue to fight inflation and make improvements in the field of fiscal responsibility".
With Brazil's once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.
Aecio Neves admitted defeat in a speech to supporters in the southern city of Belo Horizonte

Chennai, Oct 27:  
Public sector general insurer United India as part of its plans to have presence overseas, was keen on setting up its first office in Sri Lanka, a top official said today.
“We are looking at Sri Lanka. We have not yet finalised. It is still in the early stages..”, United India Insurance Company Ltd Chairman and Managing Director, Milind Kharat told reporters here.
The company had earlier set up office in Hong Kong but was shut in 2002.
Elaborating, he said, “We are keen in starting one office in Sri Lanka. We have to get the regulatory approvals, clear the formalities...”.
United India Insurance, Director and General Manager, M Vasantha Krishna said the company was serious about setting up the footprint in Colombo.
“We are serious about it. Hopefully, we are looking at setting up an office this year...,” he told PTI later.
Asked on whether the company would set up the overseas office through a joint venture partner, Kharat clarified that the company would set up its office on its own. “We will be going alone there“.
To a query on the common third-party administrators mooted by public sector general insurers, Kharat said it was expected to function from next year.
“Yes, it is taking shape. IT consultants have been appointed. From next financial year, it will start functioning. It will be operating in New Delhi and Mumbai“.
On the wage revision issue, Kharat said the company has completed two rounds of talks with employees and offered 10.5 per cent increase in revision. “Discussion has been going on.
Of course, the demand is more. We have offered 10.5 per cent (increase)...,” he said.

Tripura medical college loses half PG courses  three de-recognized byMCIPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:35 pm
Tripura’s main medical college has lost half of its post-graduate courses after the Medical Council of India de-recognised six of them this year, three this month alone.
The Agartala Government Medical College is now left with permission to run just half of the courses it initially had, according to meeting minutes of the MCI through this year.
And, as things stand now, the college appears unable to expand in other areas as well – proposals to start four new PG courses have already been rejected.
In its latest meeting this month, the MCI recommended against granting further recognition to post-graduate courses in Pediatrics Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Psychiatry.
General Surgery had already been de-recognised in August 2014, following the same fate as the college’s Anaesthesia and Radio Diagnosis courses two months prior.
Their final fate appears to have been prophesied somewhat with the MCI having disapproved the college’s proposals to increase the seats available in all these courses as early as February.
That was the same month the apex medical body disapproved similar proposals to increase seats in Ophthalmology and Orthopedics.
The MCI had then also shot down proposals to start PG courses in Respiratory Medicine, Pathology, Anatomy and Physiology as well as a diploma course in Child Health.
Interestingly, all the proposals to start these four new courses cited one Professor Dr H Sharmah as the in-charge principal of all these planned new departments, something the MCI could not accept.
But those were not the only reasons, as repeated reports cited a lack of faculty and infrastructure needed to host or operate these courses, the same reasons cited in the decisions to de-recognise the PG courses that did exist.
In some measure of consolation, however, the MCI has recommended for the continued recognition of four courses, including in Forensic Medicine, ENT, Community Medicine, Microbiology (although a proposal to increase seats in the latter was rejected in February).

Screen local films at least for one week  ULFA faction tells theatreownersBy: Press Trust of India | Guwahati | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:25 pm
For a change, fugitive rebel leader Paresh Barua’s anti-talk faction of ULFA is not talking about his armed struggle for a “sovereign” state. Instead, he has asked theatre-owners in Assam to screen films made in Assamese and other local languages at least for one week so that the state’s film industry did not collapse.
The ULFA faction’s statement signed by its chairman Abhijit Asom and issued through email, came close on the heels of award-winning filmmaker Prabin Hazarika complaining that theatre-owners were not inclined to screen his latest film “Shrinkhal” and preferring Hindi films over his.
The ULFA anti-talk faction chairman, who issued a statement from his hideout in Myanmar, picked up from Hazarika’s complaint made two days ago after theatres removed his Assamese film for a Hindi movie and said the outfit was “concerned” over the “attitude” of theatre owners.
“It is a matter of concern that theatre-owners were not interested in screening Assamese films and preferred Hindi films instead,” he said.
“If theatre-owners can earn huge profits by screening Hindi films throughout the year, what is the harm in promoting the growth of Assamese films by screening each local film at least for one week?” the ULFA leader asked.
“Moreover, it would also be a kind of social responsibility,” he said, mildly warning that those who do not screen Assamese and local films were not well-wishers of Assam. Even if each theatre screened each Assamese film for one week, it is more than enough, he added.
Meanwhile, “Shrinkhal” director Prabin Hazarika, when contacted said it was true that most theatre-owners were not interested in screening his film. “My film is not a typical boy-meets-girl film. The story is by an eminent filmmaker like Bhabendra Nath Saikia. Moreover, the turn-out was very good in the first one week, which is one reason why it should have been continued,” Hazarika said.
His film which is currently running to full house in the second week in two theatres in Guwahati, is partly financed 60 per cent by the Assam Film Finance & Development Corporation and has two well-known Bollywood actors from Assam, they being Adil Hussain and Jaya Seal.

Honda Cars to replace inflator airbags in Brio  Azaze and CR-VHome News Markets Companies Tech Economy Opinion Features Portfolio Catalyst BL Ink Multimedia Blogs

Honda to replace airbags in Brio, Amaze, CR-V
Our Bureau
This is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Honda Cars India (HCIL) on Monday said that it would carry out preventive replacement of Driver Side Air Bag Inflator of 1,040 units of Brio, 1,235 units of Amaze and 63 units of CR-V manufactured between September 2011 and July 2014.
The company said it is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator.
In case of certain vehicles, due to incorrect assembly of the baffle plate, the pressure within the inflator may rise excessively when the driver side airbag deploys in an accident or other situation, causing damage to the container, HCIL said in a statement.
“HCIL is carrying out the part replacement as part of a global exercise by Honda Motor Company to ensure stringent quality standards for its products. There has been no reporting of any incident related to this part in India,” it said.  
The replacement would be carried out free of cost at HCIL dealerships across India, and the owners will be contacted individually, it said.
The customers can also check whether their car will be covered under this campaign by submitting their 17 character alpha-numeric vehicle identification number (VIN) on its microsite, which has been created on the company’s website, HCIL said.  
This is the second such case over the last one week. Nissan India on Friday had announced to replace 9,000 units of Micra hatchback and Sunny sedan due to defective driver airbags in the cars.
This was also part of the Japanese car major’s recall of 2.6 lakh cars manufactured by it globally between 2008 and 2012.

How  Charlie  aims to brief you on people you re about to meet0
The platform connects software to users’ Google calendars and syncs with their social media profiles. It uses names of meeting participants to search networks such as Google News, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, then builds a profile that includes things such as company information and common interests, founder and CEO Aaron Frazin said.
“It looks for anything that can help them build a relationship with that person or company,” said Frazin, 24, a Deerfield native.
The company says Charlie will deliver the profile summaries one hour before every scheduled meeting. The service also will deliver, on request, scouting reports on people not associated with a scheduled meeting.
Charlie is free for now, and Frazin said he is looking toward a “freemium” model, in which users get the service for free on a limited basis but pay for a more comprehensive product. He said the company hasn’t determined prices.
“We’re focused on growth now,” he said.
John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas, called Charlie “a very interesting idea because it reflects habits people have already.”
Challenger said he advises job-seekers to find out before meetings about people they’ll be talking to. “You can use information to get much more quickly to common ground with someone,” he said.
The idea for Charlie came about two years ago when Frazin was graduating from Indiana University. He said he was frustrated with the time it took him to research people he was meeting in job interviews.
“I wound up turning down a job offer and starting this company,” he said.
He since has teamed up with Rob Volk, former CTO of Beyond Diet and now co-founder and CTO at Charlie.
Frazin said he and Volk originally planned Charlie as a mobile app but that they now believe “most executives want a personal assistant to email them a one-pager, as opposed to showing it on a mobile app.” Yet their plans include mobile.
The company graduated from the DreamIt Ventures accelerator in Philadelphia, then settled in Chicago and worked out of 1871. Charlie is now based at Space a co-working space in River North.
Other investors joining the seed round were Confluence Capital Partners, Patrick Spain and Apex Venture Partners’ Lon Chow and Armando Pauker, said a company statement announcing the launch.  
Frazin said he plans to use the seed funding to improve the product and to invest in marketing.

Nine easy riders  resurrectedEvolution of Design | 23 October 2014
Nine dead motorbike names revived for the 21st Century
By  Ronald Ahrens
Read more about these links.
Rockets from the crypt
The 21st Century has put lumberjack beards onto men’s couture runways, banjos into rock music and weariness into riders assessing the so-called Universal Japanese Motorcycle. The generic UJM lasts forever but can run light on character. Motorcyclists are demanding tradition, authenticity and uniqueness. In response, and inspired by the resurgence of Triumph, entrepreneurs have revived names dormant for decades. Most can claim heydays with speed records, military service and celebrity riders – Marlon Brando and Lawrence of Arabia among them. The trend is doing wonders for wire-spoked wheels and crowned steel fenders, and for nostalgists keen to make contact with riding’s halcyon early days, it's irresisitible. Here is a look at nine prime examples driving the trend. (Photo: Midual)
Indian
Country of origin: United States
Dossier: Indian’s return, with sales internationally, was justifiably big news in 2013. Between 1901 and 1953, the company from Springfield, Massachusetts, wielded a magic touch, dominating the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race in 1911 and setting US distance records with Cannonball Baker in the saddle. Among production models, the Scout and Chief, both powered by a V-twin engine, solidified the brand and fostered an obsession whose depth is characterised in the 2005 film The World’s Fastest Indian. But – get used to these words – the company stumbled after World War II. Various attempts to revive Indian finally succeeded after acquisition by Polaris Industries in 2011. In addition to the beautifully crafted Indian Chief models, buyers will also find an entry-level Scout ($10,999 in the US, minus delivery charge) and barge-like Roadmaster touring bike ($26,999), pictured.

Ariel Motor
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: Having produced motorcycles since 1902, Ariel Motor reached a high point with the 1931 Square Four. It hooked up a pair of upright twin cylinders for a compact 500cc of total engine displacement. The Square Four kept evolving until 1959, but Ariel would be out of business by the same time Mick Jagger found his fullest swagger. Roughly a decade ago, Ariel Motor began to develop its Honda-powered Atom sports car. And in June 2014, it announced the Ace (pictured), which features a provocative perimeter chassis machined from solid aluminium. Honda’s 1.2-litre V-4 engine, one of the best in the business, will be used. Ariel plans to produce up to 150 highly individualised examples annually starting in 2015, from £20,000 (about $32,000). (Photo: Ariel Motor)
Horex
Country of origin: Germany
Dossier: Fritz Kleemann’s single-cylinder Horex-Fahrzeugbau bikes began collecting victories in 1923. (The name “Horex” fused Kleeman’s home of Bad Homburg and Rex, his family’s glass jar company.)  Within 10 years, Horex had muscled up with the S8, a sophisticated 800cc twin. Although the Imperator 500cc twin represented an important post-war achievement, sales faltered and production had already ended by Daimler-Benz’s 1960 takeover. Fifty years would pass before Horex’s revival. Since 2012, the company has made VR6 models – Roadster, Classic and Cafe Racer 33 Ltd (above) – in a factory located in the Bavarian city of Augsburg. Sold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland starting at 24,500 euros (roughly $31,000), the bikes carry minimal bodywork – the better to gives maximum display to their engines, a complex and untraditional 1.2-litre V6. Horex claimed insolvency in September 2014, reportedly without suspending production, and at last notice was seeking additional investment. (Photo: Horex)
Norton
Country of Origin: Britain
Dossier: In 1902, Norton set to work building an impeccable pedigree. The marque eventually won at the Isle of Man and Brooklands, as well dominating the gruelling contests on the Continent. Norton was the last word in motorcycle performance in the ‘30s and immediately after World War II. Chassis engineering took on a lightly poetic aspect when the Featherbed frame arrived in time for the ‘50s. Next, the Commando’s success transcended sales figures as it became a touchstone of the Swinging ‘60s. A late-century malaise, the kind that plagued much of British industry after the rise of Japanese manufacturing, followed, but in 2010, after fresh investment, the Commando 961 (pictured) brought Nortons back to the streets of Britain and mainland Europe. They eventually found nostalgia-bitten bikers in distant markets such as California and even Japan. (Photo: Norton Motorcycles)
Midual
Country of origin: France
Dossier: Striving for timelessness through retro-futurism, the Midual Type 1 brings together aspects of French Art Deco cars, England’s post-war Douglas motorcycles and Swiss watches. Olivier Midy intended to revive Douglas, but in failing to get rights, he and his team renewed that marque’s spirit with the Midual Type 1. Prototypes were shown on 3 September in London. The first series of 35 bikes goes on sale in Europe in 2016 for the stutter-inducing equivalent of $185,000 apiece. The Type 1’s in-line, 1,036cc twin banks forward at 25 degrees in a cast-aluminium chassis that incorporates internal fuel storage of 3.7 gallons (14 litres). "We love metals, rare leather, and instruments with needle gauges,” Midual notes on its website. Customers who love same – only more so – can individualise their bikes nearly without limit. (Photo: Alexis Goure/Midual)
Matchless
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: Who could resist Kate Moss on Marlon Brando’s bike from 1953’s The Wild One? Certainly not the Malenotti brothers, who introduced their Matchless London clothing collection in 2013 with help from the fashion model and the film’s iconic Triumph. Expected in Milan for next month’s EICMA show – Europe’s largest motorcycle trade fair – is the Matchless Model X Reloaded. The return of Matchless began with the Malenottis’ acquisition of the marque in 2012. Matchless had built motorcycles from the year 1901 at Plumstead Road, London. The seductive Model X was born in 1929. Matchless also pioneered the development of protective clothing, marketed as Matchless Wear, which was sold at a factory store and through a catalogue. But it ended for the company by 1966. For the sake of subtlety, the forthcoming, steampunk-ish Model X Reloaded (pictured) will have S&S Motors’ 1,916cc V-twin engine and a front brake with a 12-piston caliper. Further details are to be revealed. Whatever the price, were Jules Verne alive and riding, he would put down a deposit. (Photo: Matchless London)
Bultaco
Country of origin: Spain
Dossier: When the Montesa team left racing in 1958, engineer Paco Bultó left Montesa. (The Bultaco moniker for his start-up fused first and last names together, in reverse order.) Bultaco made speedy road bikes such as the Metralla Mk2; meanwhile, off-road models excelled by adapting lightweight, powerful and dirty two-stroke engines. The Pursang was deeply revered in the US, and the Sherpa T won five consecutive world trials championships. Yet production in Barcelona ended by 1983. The new Bultaco, announced early in 2014, plans 2,000 examples of the Rapitán and Rapitán Sport (pictured), low-maintenance electric bikes coming from a Madrid factory by late 2015. The Rapitán’s proprietary powertrain relies heavily on energy recapture to provide projected in-town range of 200km (120 miles). Meanwhile, Bultaco is already offering apparel, gloves and even a little balance bike that helps kids from 18 months old “develop a sense of equilibrium and mobility”. (Photo: Bultaco)
Crocker Motorcycle
Country of origin: United States
Dossier: Al Crocker developed a series of single-cylinder speedway bikes in the depths of the Great Depression. In 1936, the Crocker Twin – over-engineered, over-strong, and very large-capacity – introduced new standards in American riding. The V-twin engines displaced up to 91 cubic inches (1.5 litres), and an astonishing 110mph was achievable. Manufacturing ended during World War II, with only about 100 Crockers made. In 2012, the new Crocker Motorcycle Company, located near Los Angeles, revealed its first “continuation” bike, exactingly made to original specification using silicon bronze, high-strength stainless steel and other premium materials. Three have been built, and enough parts exist for another nine or 10 bikes, according to  Michael Schacht, the bike’s builder and holder of Crocker naming rights. The price: $150,000. Schacht adds: “For a hand-manufactured bike, we’re giving it away.” (Photo: Crocker Motorcycle)
Brough Superior
Country of origin: Britain
Dossier: The gleaming Brough Superior SS100 that surprised observers of the 2013 EICMA exhibition is two parts locomotive, one part coffeepot. Is the Tin Man is still around? it would be his favourite motorcycle if production begins, as projected, later in 2014. After going on sale in 1921, Brough Superior was advertised as the Rolls-Royce of motorcycles, and 3,000 were sold worldwide before production ended in Nottingham after 20 years. TE “Lawrence of Arabia” Lawrence, owner of many Broughs, perished in 1935 after swerving his SS100 to miss two bicyclists. Brough ended production in 1940. The new Brough comes about after entrepreneur Mark Upham purchased the name in 2008. The SS100 prototype’s titanium chassis and magnesium fork will provide the exotic aspects, and the 997cc V-twin will get it all moving. Upham says he hopes to sell a few hundred at £50,000 ($80,000) each, but he may entertain reviving other models. (Photo: Brough Superior Motorcycles)

Former radio host convicted of mortgage fraud15
Prosecutors alleged that Ballentine acted as the real estate lawyer at closings involving nearly 30 fraudulent loans. He knew that the buyers did not qualify to buy the properties in Chicago and the suburbs, authorities said.
Outside the courtroom, Ballentine's attorney, Lewis Myers Jr., vowed to appeal, saying Ballentine was ignorant of the scheme and made only about a combined $8,000 for his work at the closings while the real masterminds reaped millions.
Myers noted that several of Ballentine's co-defendants cut deals with the government and testified against him.
"The people who concocted this scheme, they never talked to (Ballentine). ... They never had a single conversation with him about it," Myers said.
Ballentine, 43, who formerly lived in suburban Country Club Hills but now resides in Durham, N.C., had professed his innocence in a Facebook posting at the time he was charged early last year.
"I made a standard fee on closings," he wrote at the time. "I know some may say everybody says their (sic) innocent. Well I am."
In a posting before the trial started earlier this week, Ballentine thanked God "for the vindication that will surely come."
Ballentine's trial was delayed from last week after Myers tried to pull out of the case at the last minute, claiming his client was not cooperating with him. Ballentine told the judge he'd been suffering from depression and family health issues and admitted he'd stopped returning his lawyer's phone calls. Kennelly, however, refused to let Myers off the case.

Norway: the road to a sustainable economyeconomy (general)
If forewarned is forearmed, Norway has a pretty big arsenal.
Oil discovery in the 1960s made the country one of the richest in the world with high wages and free education. In fact, it is still very much a part of the oil age with about 70 per cent of its exports being hydrocarbons.
But pegging the fortunes of a welfare state on the vagaries of the oil market is a high-risk proposition, and the question on everyone’s mind is ‘what do we do after the oil’? Sure, the country has a huge savings from oil money invested in the world markets, but what is a trillion dollar these days — an ageing population heavily dependent on pensions and social support means there is a constant drain on the assets.
The quest for an alternative economy has occupied the top business and political leadership of Norway for many years and one of the solutions that have been put in place is Innovation Norway, an organisation that acts as a trade council, a business incubator, angel investor and promoter rolled into one. Formed in 2004, the state-owned company spearheads the government’s efforts to transition to a diversified economy that is stable and green. Not an easy task when the country is chest deep in an industry that produces the world’s worst pollutant.
Anita Krohn Traaseth, who took over as CEO of Innovation Norway in September, is quite aware of the challenge. “We as a people don’t feel enough pain yet because we still have a very healthy economy,” she told The Hindu in Oslo recently. “And going through this transition — moving on from being a pure, vulnerable oil-and-gas economy to a sustainable, renewable or you can call it bio economy — when we don’t feel enough pain, is a challenge.”
How Innovation Norway helps the country
On the bright side, there is no lack of awareness among Norwegians on the need for a transition to a renewable, sustainable economy, she said. The transition is being seen as an opportunity to revive Norway’s traditional industries such as agriculture and fisheries and the sector that formed the backbone for oil exploration, shipping.
Innovation Norway swallows some of the risks of this transition. It identifies the companies and industries that need to be invested in or need to be helped during the change. “It cannot be driven by the market alone as it is too early,” said Ms. Traaseth. It has handheld all sorts of industries, from wind farm clusters to innovative oil exploration technologies, claiming to have delivered for these entrepreneurs a growth 21 percentage points higher than comparable ventures.
It is also the funnel through which the government pours money into the transition — funding start-ups as well as realignment of existing industries. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries and other stakeholders in the company, including county municipalities, poured nearly half a billion dollars into the transition process in 2013 through this vehicle.
To expand presence in India
Innovation Norway is also the Norwegian government’s official trade representative abroad, and has offices in over 30 countries including in India, in New Delhi.
Ms. Traaseth made clear Norway’s interest in the opportunities that India offers in the transition. But she also pointed to the need for Norway to be ‘very humble’ while approaching India “because it is obvious that the Indian market is interesting for Norway. [But] it is not that obvious to India what specific knowledge from Norway can be useful in developing India 2.0.”
Information and communication technology, she said, was one possible area of cooperation. Norway has one of the greatest research environments in the field but not much commercialisation like in India. “There is lot to learn from each other here.” India could also draw on Norway’s tradition and expertise when it comes to hydropower and waste management, she added.
She saw the Modi government’s ‘red tape to red carpet’ statement as good signal for Norway. “Defining what the red carpet means and how they are going to make it possible will help us,” she said.
Innovation Norway is also looking to expand its presence in India with an entrepreneurship programme in 2015.

Hilton Foundation Invests $12 Million to End Homelessnessreddit
The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation is receiving well-deserved attention and accolades for its $12 million investment in efforts to increase the supply of supportive housing throughout Los Angeles County, California, helping thousands of long-term, chronically homeless people transition from homelessness and build new lives. http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-12-million-homeless-housing-20141014-story.html
Supportive housing combines the stability of a home with wraparound community services that keep people housed. Initial investments from the Hilton Foundation have leveraged nearly $270 million in public financing and over $336 million in private financing for homes for people experiencing long-term homelessness. Their commitment has been instrumental in funding dozens of supportive housing projects, including many that were stalled during the last economic downturn.
The Hilton Foundation investment is multiplying capacity in the housing and human services sectors to serve more clients. Because public costs such as health care and public safety decline after people move from the streets to supportive housing, the Hilton Foundation's generosity is saving local governments money with each individual moved into housing. The average annual public cost for a chronically homeless person is over $63,000. That number drops to $17,000 after the client is placed in supportive housing, a reduction in public costs of almost 75%.
We know chronic homelessness is solvable and the data and outcomes prove supportive housing is the right approach. It's more cost-effective for taxpayers, and it's more humane for people struggling with homelessness. Over 80% of people in supportive housing stay in their homes and avoid ending up back on the streets.
The Hilton Foundation is looking to the future. In collaboration with key partners such as Home For Good, CSH, other foundations, and city and county agencies, they are embracing smart and innovative tools and investments, such as:
• Encouraging the use of a triage tool in hospitals that can identify the highest-need, highest-cost homeless persons so they can be targeted for supportive housing.
• Working with Los Angeles County and community partners to reach people with long histories of homelessness who are incarcerated in jails to connect these men and women to supportive housing upon release, reducing their likelihood of becoming homeless or returning to jail.
• Promoting the use of a tool to assess homeless transition age youth ages 18-24 to determine risk for long-term homelessness.
The Hilton Foundation's partners will loan at least $7.5 million to providers in the next five years, resulting in at least 200 new units of supportive housing.  Also, funds will be used for small rehab loans for private property owners to make improvements to units for supportive housing, security deposit loans for supportive housing tenants, and incentive and stalled project loans. Together, these financing mechanisms will lead to an additional 580 supportive housing units.
Because of the caring leaders at the Hilton Foundation, who eagerly embrace evidence-based solutions and results, Los Angeles is getting the assistance it needs to help homeless people turn around their lives.

Tree plantation in Koraput to compensate for loss in Cyclone HudhudPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Koraput (odisha) | Posted: October 27, 2014 3:32 pm
To compensate for the loss of trees in Cyclone Hudhud, Jeypore forest division in Koraput district has decided to take up plantation in over 200 hectares of forest land.
Officials said the thick forest cover of Ramagiri and Boipariguda forest range under the division was lost due to the cyclone which hit the district on October 12.
“Though it is impossible to regain the lost trees as those were decades old, efforts will be made to cover more forest land under plantation. As per a preliminary report prepared by the department the new plantation will be done in over 200 hectares. If more suitable patches are found then it will also be covered under plantation,” said Jeypore divisional forest officer Bijaya Kumar Acharya.
As per the damage report of the forest department at least 1,765 valuable trees comprising sal, teak, eucalyptus and chakunda varieties in the district were uprooted in the cyclone.
“As many as 629 sal and teak trees which were decades old have been uprooted in the Gupteswar forest range. As per preliminary assessment report the loss of trees is around Rs one crore,” Acharya said.
Officials said hundreds of new tress which were two to three years-old had also been uprooted in the cyclone and it will take several years to compensate the loss of green cover in real terms.
“Trees in large numbers belonging to private parties had also been uprooted in the cyclone, but assessment of those trees has not been done,” he said.
However, the most pressing problem now was shortage of staff which is impeding the removal of the fallen trees from the forests while both villagers and timber mafias are targeting the salvaged trees.
“As it will take months together to remove the uprooted trees we have formed mobile squads to keep an eye on them. With limited manpower we are trying to collect the uprooted trees from the forest at the earliest,” Acharya said.

Corruption has taken deep root in Mizoram  govt unable to stamp out on its own: CM LalThanhawlaPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:56 pm
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Monday said “corruption has taken deep root” in Mizoram and hit out at the “idleness” among the state’s government employees while saying corruption is not only mean swindling public money, but includes “laziness, idleness, lack of passion for one’s work and expecting a higher income than what one’s work is worth.”
Speaking at the opening of RTI week in Aizawl, Lal Thanhawla said, “The government cannot fully stamp out corruption on it’s own, so we need the support of the public as well as the media, and one way is for people to use RTI to help the government.”
“In Mizoram, the best things are owned by the influential and the rich and common man does not get benefits,” the five-time CM said.
Elaborating on his dismissal of state government employees’ work culture, Lal Thanhawla said, “We pay little heed to filing property returns and while elsewhere people pay close attention we do not even border to intimate the government and we buy movable property like TV sets and cars as if it was paan.”
Lal Thanhawla’s two consecutive terms in office have been partly based on his party’s promise of a corruption-free government in an apparent bid to score over the Mizo National Front’s perceived corruption during the rebel-group turned political party’s ten-year rule, which ended in 2008.

Creative Muvo MinireviewPrint
The Muvi Mini is water-resistant, which makes it great to carry outdoors.
Written by Mihir Patkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:47 pm | Updated: October 29, 2014 4:29 pm
What Is It?
The Creative Muvo Mini is a Bluetooth speaker that emphasises its portability. It’s small, its rubber-coated body gives a nice grip, and a fall from a height of 5 feet didn’t cause any damage in looks or sound. The Muvo Mini packs two 1.3-inch full range drivers and an oversized passive driver for bass. There’s Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC connectivity, and you can also plug in standard 3.5mm audio input.
Price:  Rs. 5,999 (Rs 4,200 in stores)
Anything That Makes It Special?
The Muvi Mini is water-resistant (IP66 for the technically inclined), which makes it great to carry outdoors. You can’t dunk it into a swimming pool or carry it out in pouring rain, but it will be fine if you spilled a drink on it or had it by the pool with water splashing on it. This ruggedness gives you a sense of security and makes you worry less about a gadget when everything seems fragile these days.
What Sounds Good and What Sounds Bad?
The Muvo Mini isn’t the best set of Bluetooth speakers we have heard in this price range, but it’s still very good. If you’re listening to bass-heavy music, the Muvo Mini is going to sound flat compared to other speakers like the JBL Flip or Osaki Jukebox. However, playing Bollywood songs, Western classical, and classic rock is a good enough experience.
In Real-World Conditions, Can You Actually Use It For Hands-Free Calling?
It depends on how far you will be from the Muvo Mini. At a distance of about 5-6 feet, the Mini could pick up our voice clearly and the call was smooth. At 7-8 feet, the person on the other line could barely hear what we were saying.
How’s The Battery Life?
The Muvo Mini’s most impressive feature is its battery life, given its small size. Even though it is more portable than any other Bluetooth speakers we’ve used, it managed to eke out 11 hours of continuous music playback, and 10 hours with intermittent calling. Plus, it can be charged by a standard microUSB cable, so you don’t need to carry a separate charger for it.
Should I Buy It?
If you’re going to use your Bluetooth speakers in your room and not carry it around, then no, the Muvo Mini isn’t the best purchase. But if you’re looking for speakers that you can take to the beach or out on the lawn for a winter evening, we strongly recommend the Muvo Mini.

The S&P energy index <.SPNY> tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude  fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. Leading the decline, shares of Exxon Mobil  fell 2.3 percent to $91.70 while shares of Chevron  dropped 3.7 percent to $106.80.
The energy index is now down 12.8 percent for the year and is the only major S&P sectors in negative territory for 2014. [O/R] The S&P 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far.
Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market.
Meanwhile several of the year's biggest gainers also sold off, possibly due to year-end profit-taking, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among them, Apple  was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro  shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65.
"This has been a monster market, and it's been eking out new records. So it's taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done," said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69.
The tumble follows gains Friday, which had pushed the S&P 500 to a record high close for the 49th time this year.
Volume picked up after midday, while the S&P 500 moved more than 21 points from its high for the day to its low, its largest high-to-low swing in more than a month.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 71 more stocks made 52-week lows compared with those making new highs, the largest gap skewed in favor of new lows since Oct. 16, the day after the market made its bottom in the recent pullback.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 919, for a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,048 issues fell and 699 advanced for a 2.93-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
McDonald's  shares shed 3.8 percent to $92.61 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a steeper-than-expected fall in global same-restaurant sales in November and said fourth-quarter results would be hurt by a supplier scandal in China and a stronger dollar.
About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Pakistan’s army says military jets and helicopters have destroyed nine hideouts of militants in two separate airstrikes killing 33 militants in an ongoing offensive in the North Waziristan tribal region.
An army statement on Monday says early morning airstrikes near the Datta Khel area destroyed five such hideouts killing 18 militants during the offensive. Later in the day, helicopter gunships struck four more hideouts in Gharlami area killing another 15 militants, the army said.
North Waziristan was a safe haven to a mix of local and foreign militant groups until the military launched its operation there in the middle of this year.
The military offensive has driven out over 800,000 residents from North Waziristan, where the army says it has cleared of militants in 90 percent of the tribal region.

I’ve long much liked Ward’s work, including his “The Legal Analyst” (about which he guest-blogged here ; see also Ken Anderson’s post praising the book) and his “ Classical English Rhetoric .” His new book likewise looks excellent; here’s a summary (paragraph break added):
Restitution is the body of law concerned with taking away gains that someone has wrongfully obtained. The operator of a Ponzi scheme takes money from his victims by fraud and then invests it in stocks that rise in value. Or a company pays a shareholder excessive dividends or pays them to the wrong person. Or a man poisons his grandfather and then collects under the grandfather’s will.
In each of these cases, one party is unjustly enriched at the expense of another. And in all of them the law of restitution provides a way to undo the enrichment and transfer the defendant’s gains to a party with better rights to them. Tort law focuses on the harm, or costs, that one party wrongfully imposes on another. Restitution is the mirror image; it corrects gains that one party wrongfully receives at another’s expense. It is an important topic for every lawyer and for anyone else interested in how the legal system responds to injustice.
In Restitution, Ward Farnsworth presents a guide to this body of law that is compact, lively, and insightful — the first treatment of its kind that the American law of restitution has received. The book explains restitution doctrines, remedies, and defenses with unprecedented clarity and illustrates them with vivid examples. Farnsworth demonstrates that the law of restitution is guided by a manageable and coherent set of principles that have remarkable versatility and power.
This is an important area of the law, to which law students, lawyers, and law professors often pay too little attention; I much look forward to Ward’s posts on the subject.
Eugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.

This image provided by NASA shows the sun emitting a significant X3.2-class flare erupting from the lower half of the sun, peaking at 5:40 p.m. EDT Friday Oct. 24, 2014. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly and captured images of the event.

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has spotted an image of a gigantic sunspot - the largest in last 24 years.
The flare erupted from a particularly large active region dubbed as AR 12192. The sunspot soon grew to be the largest active region observed in the current solar cycle - a periodic change in the Sun’s activity and appearance - which began in 2008.
This is the fourth substantial X-class flare from this active region since October 19. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.
Giant sunspot erupts today with 4th substantial flare since Oct 19. Details: http://t.co/Ft2qernaxP @NASASunEarth pic.twitter.com/npepZgLP7d

“The sunspot region is about 80,000 miles across, which is wide enough for 10 Earths to be laid across its diameter,” NASA said in a statement.
Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. These can also disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

Honda to replace airbags in Brio, Amaze, CR-V
Our Bureau
This is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Honda Cars India (HCIL) on Monday said that it would carry out preventive replacement of Driver Side Air Bag Inflator of 1,040 units of Brio, 1,235 units of Amaze and 63 units of CR-V manufactured between September 2011 and July 2014.
The company said it is part of Honda’s global recall regarding a possible incorrect assembly of the ‘baffle plate’ in the inflator.
In case of certain vehicles, due to incorrect assembly of the baffle plate, the pressure within the inflator may rise excessively when the driver side airbag deploys in an accident or other situation, causing damage to the container, HCIL said in a statement.
“HCIL is carrying out the part replacement as part of a global exercise by Honda Motor Company to ensure stringent quality standards for its products. There has been no reporting of any incident related to this part in India,” it said.  
The replacement would be carried out free of cost at HCIL dealerships across India, and the owners will be contacted individually, it said.
The customers can also check whether their car will be covered under this campaign by submitting their 17 character alpha-numeric vehicle identification number (VIN) on its microsite, which has been created on the company’s website, HCIL said.  
This is the second such case over the last one week. Nissan India on Friday had announced to replace 9,000 units of Micra hatchback and Sunny sedan due to defective driver airbags in the cars.
This was also part of the Japanese car major’s recall of 2.6 lakh cars manufactured by it globally between 2008 and 2012.

Centre to name only those having prosecutable case: Arun Jaitley on black moneyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:18 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:27 pm
The Central Government will make public names of only those people against whom there is a prosecutable case in connection with tax evasion through offshore accounts, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday, amid the Congress asking for disclosure of all names of black money holders.
“We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence,” he told reporters.
READ: Black money case: Centre names three account holders
His remark comes hours after the government disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and a Goa miner against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under the scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal”.
Earlier, Congress leader Digvijay Singh attacked Jaitley for his comments that Congress would be embarrassed when all names of those who stashed money abroad were made public.
Terming Jaitley’s remarks as “mischievous”, Singh said: “If he (Jaitley) has guts, he should reveal those names.” He said if any Congress member is found to have stashed money abroad illegally, the party would “punish” the person.
READ: Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre to SC
Another Congress leader and a former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said the party has no problem if all names are put out in public domain.
Jaitley had earlier said the government would not be pushed into an act of adventurism and jeopardise the chances of getting cooperation of other countries in future.
The NDA government’s approach on black money, he had asserted, “is doggedly persistent, not adventurist.”
He had also blamed the agreement entered into by the Congress government with Germany in 1995 as a constraining factor in disclosing details of black money stashed abroad.
In the run-up to Parliamentary polls, BJP had promised to bring back black money kept by Indians in overseas banks while targeting the UPA government for not taking effective action on the issue.

Imposition of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centres involvement in the issuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre to SCPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:25 pm
The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Swiss government has indicated its willingness to provide information on “stolen data” containing names of Indians who had allegedly stashed black money in banks there.
The government said the “development” is very significant as the Swiss government had earlier refused to provide any information regarding it.
“Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information in respect of cases where investigations have been carried out by the IT Department independently from what Swiss government considers as stolen data. This development is very significant because there are several cases of account holders which were investigated by the Department independently.
“Earlier the Swiss government had not agreed to provide any information in such cases on the ground that these were stolen data and have been obtained in breach of Swiss law,” it said in its affidavit.
The government said the Swiss Federal Tax Administration has agreed that their counterpart authority would assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank accounts.
“The Swiss authorities have also agreed to provide the requested information in a time bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline,” the Centre said.
It told the apex court that Switzerland has also assured it of commencing talks with India for concluding an Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement between the two sides at the earliest after completion of their domestic procedures.

Kerala-born businessman tops list of powerful Indians in GulfBy: Press Trust of India | Dubai | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:19 pm
Kerala-born businessman and the Managing Director of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali MA, has retained his top position in the annual list of powerful Indians in Gulf countries for the fifth time in a row.
The ‘Indian Power List’, published Sunday by Arabian Business, named Ali as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf countries.
His Lulu Group has a strong presence in the Middle East’s retail sector and is planning expansion in new markets.
A key reason for Ali being considered as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf is also his close proximity to the various ruling family members of GCC countries.
Ali has recently been elected as Director Board Member of Abu Dhabi Chamber for the third consecutive time, becoming the first and only Indian till date to occupy such a position.
He also featured in the Forbes Top Global Billionaire 2014 list.
Lulu Group has operations in 32 countries, with staff strength of 31,000 and has reported revenues of USD 5.2 billion (Rs 33,500 crore) in 2013.

A spokesman for South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority says prosecutors will appeal the verdict and sentencing of Oscar Pistorius, who was handed a 5-year prison term after being convicted of culpable homicide.
Prosecution spokesman Nathi Mncube said on Monday that the next step is to file papers in court.
Pistorius started serving his prison sentence on Oct. 21 after he was acquitted of murder by a judge and found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a toilet door in his home.
Under the current terms, the Olympic runner is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest.

NHTSA issues airbag warning on 4.7 million vehiclesNHTSA issues airbag warning on 4.7 million vehicles

NHTSA says airbags may fail on 4.7 million Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, BMW and GM vehicles.
Takata airbag issue potentially affects 4.7 million more vehicles from the early 2000s, NHTSA says.
NHTSA urges owners of 4.7 million vehicles equipped with Takata airbags to get vehicle serviced immediately.
If you drive a car made in the early 2000s, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants you to see your dealer -- right now.
The federal agency issued a rare alert Monday, warning that owners of vehicles fitted with airbags made by Takata Corp. should have their vehicles inspected as soon as possible. The airbags could fail to deploy properly, the agency said.
TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T and other Japanese automakers on Monday recalled almost 3 million cars with potentially explosive air bags supplied by Takata Corp 7312.T, bringing the total recall so far to about 10.5 million vehicles over the past five years. ( Yoko Kubota and Ben Klayman )
The warning is particularly urgent for owners of vehicles in Florida and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other regions of the Caribbean and South Pacific, because humid weather could aggravate the problem.
The warning affects more than 4.7 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, BMW and General Motors. A full list of the affected cars and model years is below.
At the same time, Toyota Motor Sales issued its own Takata-related warning, saying it would conduct a “supplemental safety recall” of 247,000 of its own Corolla, Matrix, Sequoia, Tundra and Lexus SC vehicles manufactured from 2001 to 2004. These vehicles are all equipped with the same suspect Takata airbags.

Artist and his kingdompeople
Artist and organiser of all things cultural, T. Kaladharan calls the city, in its entirety, his creative space; the place that nourished the creative in him. His alma mater, he calls it. He says he is richer for having been able to work here. “Kochi is my kingdom,” he says.
Kaladharan belongs to a generation of artists who were able to look beyond the narrow confines of their ‘area of specialisation’. He embraced art in it is many forms – as drama, cinema, music, literature and others. He had his art education under MRD Dethan, M.V. Devan, C.N. Karunakaran and Artist Namboodiri. When M.V. Devan founded Kerala Kalapeetom in 1978, Kaladharan found his karmabhoomi under his guru. Over the years he has become synonymous with Kalapeetom, the identities seem to have merged.
When Devan was looking for a space for Kalapeetom, Kaladharan offered the property on Karikkamuri Cross Road that belonged to his father. And Kerala Kalapeetom got an address. Later on it moved to PT Usha Road before returning to its original location in the early 2000s.
In time, Kalapeetom became Orthic Creative Centre and in 2008 Nanappa Art Gallery, as a tribute to his father Narayanankutty Menon known as Nanappa. That Kerala Kalapeetom has all but ceased to be pains him. He says, “my family and friends have advised me not to revive it and I trust them.”
More than as an artist, his creative space is also as an organiser. Kerala Kalapeetom organised the popular ‘Sahitya Sandhya’, ‘Nataka Sandhya’, ‘Sangeetha Sayhanam’ and ‘Nritya Sayhanam’ through the 80s, 90s and sporadically in the last decade.
He says his is a case of the mountain coming to Mohammed. “I wasn’t able to travel much. But so what? I have had the privilege of hosting greats such as Mulk Raj Anand, Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna, Kamala Devi (in both her avatars), M.T. Vasudevan Nair, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and so many others I wouldn’t have been able to meet otherwise.”
The airy, well-lit Nanappa Art Gallery doesn’t see as much activity as it did in the past. The well-loved space is perfect for artistic pursuits and also a good place to listen to stories about a long ago Ernakulam before it became Kochi. Among the paraphernalia of art shows – brochures, remnants of art shows and art works – there are stories. Stories of how Balamuralikrishna offered to sing as a fund-raiser for Kalapeetom, disagreements, artists’ tantrums, heated discussions, and some wonderful memories of a bygone passionate era. The bamboo wind chime’s soothing notes sound the background score for the art gallery. This is Kaladharan’s personal space, his home, his work – “my life.”
“Times have changed. In the past Kalapeetom used to be packed with youngsters – as volunteers and participants. Today, participation of youngsters is nil. Those days parents gave children the space to engage in activities other than academics. Art was a collective effort in those days,” there is a touch of sorrow in Kaladharan’s tone. Physically too “the road blocks due to work on the Kochi Metro should not become a mental block to getting here to Nanappa Art Gallery.”
The city has grown in stature, artistically it has moved to greater things like the art biennale. But, one can’t help wondering if the genesis of it all lay in Kaladharan’s Kerala Kalapeetom which to many, is Orthic Creative Centre and to many others Nanappa Art Gallery.

Millennials are actually really good at saving moneyBy Jonnelle Marte October 23 Follow @jonnelle
(Photo from Flickr user OTA Photos used under Creative Commons license)
Millennials are looking beyond beach vacations and nights out when it comes to finding the best way to use their cash.
More of them are putting money away for retirement, according to a new analysis released Thursday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. About 40,000 workers in their 20s and early 30s signed up for their employer’s 401(k) plan for the first time during the first half of this year, the report found. That is up 55 percent from the same time last year and more than the 37 percent increase seen for all age groups.
“If you look at the millennials, they’re actually by nature better savers,” says Kevin Crain, managing director and senior relationship executive for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank analyzed data from its 401(k) business, which has $128.9 billion in assets and includes 2.5 million participants.
What’s pushing millennials to be more responsible? It’s not all due to strong will power. More companies are taking the work out of the saving process by automatically enrolling workers into savings plans and automatically boosting their saving rates by a certain percentage amount each year, the report found. As of June, 213 plans used both auto enrollment and auto escalation to help people save, up 19 percent from a year earlier.
However, millennials might deserve some credit for not opting out of the plans after being automatically signed up, Crain says. And some of the growth was due to choice: The number of people who voluntarily signed up for automatic rate increases grew by 27 percent over the past year, according to the report.
The higher saving rates might also be spurred by a feeling among millennials that they are on their own for retirement. Workers between the ages of 25 and 37 expect to receive 32 percent of their income in retirement from personal savings and investments, compared to 19 percent for baby boomers, according to a separate survey by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave . In contrast, millennials expect 12 percent of their retirement income to come from an employer-sponsored pension, compared to 19 percent for boomers.
Where workers age 25 to 37 expect to get their income from in retirement. (Merrill Lynch and Age Wage)
Indeed, more employers are asking workers to carry the burden of saving for retirement. Many companies are freezing pension plans , even when they’re over funded, as a way to reduce future liabilities and lower operating costs. As a result, the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for retirement saving, yet many people are not saving enough . For recent college graduates in particular, goals of setting aside money for retirement are often trounced by more immediate needs like  student loan payments .
Often, the biggest advantage younger workers have when it comes to retirement savings is time — since money that is stashed away and invested can grow tax free for decades. But Crain points out that saving isn’t enough. People who are too conservative with their investments when they’re young may end up short in their later years, he says.

Multiple Grammy nominee Ric Fierabracci on being part of a music workshop in the city
For someone who entered the music field quite late, Ric Fierabracci has done well for himself — he is a multiple Grammy nominee and has performed and recorded for a number of artistes such as British jazz and rock drummer Gary Husband, American jazz fusion and blues guitarist Scott Henderson, former guitarist of The Police Andy Summers (with Sting as a special guest), Stevie Wonder, and others.
In the city to host a five-day workshop in association with Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music (SAM), Ric says his experience at the academy has been fantastic, “I feel that the environment is friendly and inviting for both beginners and advanced students.”
Ric’s tryst with music started when he was 14: “I had a friend who was a bass player and I bought his old bass when he upgraded.” When he turned 16, he accompanied a friend to the University of Miami: Frost School of Music where he was offered a four-year scholarship in their Studio Music and Jazz programme. In 2003, Ric moved to New York and started playing with The Chick Corea Elektric Band. Five years later, he debuted with an album called Hemispheres that was nominated for a Grammy.
Ric has since played with Dave Weckl, Chick Corea, Virgil Donati and others. “When I was playing with Corea, Stevie (Wonder) came down and sat in one night. It was great to hear him blend in with our band. Corea is one of my favourite musicians. Gary Husband is a musical genius and my friend and I always look forward to any musical journey he is involved with.”
This is Ric’s first visit to India and he says that he has listened to Indian percussionist and composer Trilok Gurtu’s work. “His concept of time is a  special thing. I hope to have a chance to play with him in the near future.” Talking about Indian music in America, Ric says that it’s highly regarded “especially in the rhythmic sense and in the use of 1/4 step intervals. I played a handful of concerts around 2000 with L. Subramaniam. He and his wife are wonderful musicians. Those were fun gigs,” he explains. 
Ric cites Michel Petrucciani, Michael Brecker, Allan Holdsworth, Vinnie Colaiuta, Phil Turcio, Brett Garsed, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald as some of his influences and says that he enjoys Chennai and has made some new friends as well.

Four-step fitness testphysical fitness
How much do you score?
Are you fit? No, I’m not asking you how far you can run or how much weight you can lift. I’m asking you if you consider yourself fit. Think about it and come up with a strong yes or no. 
I understand you can run many hundreds of miles or can lift monstrous weight at the gym or are amazing at yoga. But for the next couple of minutes, I need you to set aside your ego, look past your biases and consider the following simple practical tests of mobility. Give yourself one point for each test you pass. 
Can you squat? 
And I’m not talking about the silly quarter squats you do at the gym. I’m talking about being mobile enough to squat low enough to get your hips below your knees, stable enough to keep your heels on the floor, upright enough to make eye contact with someone standing in front of you and strong enough to hold that position for an easy couple of minutes. 
I know you think this is a ridiculous standard. But let me tell you that the squat is the most basic human movement there is: you, and every other baby, squatted before you stood up. Squatting was a natural resting position before chairs ruled over us. Squatting is the most recommended excretory position for colon health and the squat is a movement that helps with strength, mobility, endurance and, in turn, fat loss. So, can you squat? 
Can you lie down and stand up? 
Seriously, can you? No, it’s not too easy. Try it for yourself. Lie down completely on the floor. Now, slowly, sit up and then stand up completely but without using any support from your hands or any momentum by rolling. Being able to stand up like that requires core strength, coordination and a whole lot of mobility. So, can you, slowly and under complete control, lie down and stand up without assistance? 
Can you tie your shoe laces without support? 
One more of those things you probably think are beneath your fitness level. You wear shoes at least once a day. How often do you find yourself searching for a stool or a chair? Do you really need it? How comfortable are you wearing your shoes without any support? 
Can you pick up a pen? 
You can? That’s awesome. Now can you bend forward at your waist and lift that pen from the floor without bending your knees? It’s not about how heavy a pen you can lift but about whether you’re able to fold at the waist and touch the floor without feeling any strain on your lower back. So, are you fit enough to lift that pen? 
The second one was harder than you thought, wasn’t it? While some of these tests may be hard for the elderly or for those with specific health or joint conditions, anyone considered to be in good health and fitness irrespective of sex, age or nationality should be able to score at least 3 on 4. How did you do? Are you fit?

Book tracks Tata Group s journey to success  respectBook explores Tata Group's journey to success, fame
PTI        Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 15:32 IST
Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus at Tata Sons.
The values at the heart of the Tata Group as well as the role played in its development by the philanthropic trusts that own two-thirds of the company are explored in a new book that is a brief history of the Tatas.
How did Tata transform itself from a family-owned venture to the position it is today in an array of unrelated businesses? What is the 'Tata Way', which has earned it much admiration and respect?
These are among several aspects that the book "The Greatest Company in the World?: The Story of Tata" by Peter Casey looks into.
It charts the contribution of every Tata chairman - from Jamsetji Tata, who set up the company in 1868, to Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry in transforming the company into one of the most professionally-managed enterprises in the world.
As founder and Executive Chairman of Claddagh Resources, Casey decided to write the book initially to help his recruiters and executive search consultants have a better understanding of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which over 14 years, had become his company's biggest client.
"It was supposed to just be a short 15-page summary, but the more I started studying TCS and Tata, the more captivated I got and the project developed a life of its own," he says.
According to the writer, while other successful capitalists and captains of industry started companies to create profit and, thereby, wealth, Jamsetji Tata planted the seeds of philanthropic trusts, which now own 66 per cent of the Tata Group.
"In harmony with his religion, Tata's company would exist to finance and initiate projects to improve the lives of the people of India," he says.
"So, Jamsetji Tata became not only a catalyst for sweeping change in his vast homeland, but, in the process, conceptualised an entirely new way of doing business as well as philanthropy. What he began has changed the lives of billions, as the company he founded continues to work for the betterment of society," he says.
In the words of Jamsetji, "We think we started on sound and straightforward business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and the health and welfare of the employees, the sure foundation of our success."
Today, the Tata Group employs nearly half a million people, and earns revenues of $100 billion. It reported a profit of $6.23 billion in 2011-12, and controls assets valued at $77.7 billion.
"The philanthropic trusts control a majority of the Tata holding company, Tata Sons. The Tata family is a very small shareholder. Yet, the owners are only one of four stakeholders Tata sets out to serve. In addition to the owners (which include shareholders) are employees, customers, and society itself," the book, published by Penguin, says.
"The guiding principle for everyone at Tata is sharing the wealth. With Tata reporting annual profits in 2012 of $6.23 billion, this means that a very large amount of money is invested back into the economy every year just from this one source," it says.
The members of the Tata family have established a set of philanthropic trusts to which the majority of the family's personal wealth has been dedicated and bequeathed.
Like their father, Dorabji Tata and Ratan Tata also donated the majority of their personal wealth to trusts they established.
The book also talks about Jamsetji Tata's successor Dorabji Tata's passion for sports and how he advocated India's participation in the Olympics as early as 1919, much before the nation had established its own Olympic committee.

New Potter short story to be released on Halloween
IANS
arts, culture and entertainment
Author J.K. Rowling made Harry Potter fans excited as she recently announced that a new short story set in the magical world of wizards will be released on Halloween.
The upcoming story, around 1700 words, will focus on the spiteful Hogwarts professor Dolores Umbridge, who first appeared in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was published in 2003, reports contactmusic.com.
The witch is well known for forcing Harry to scar himself on the hand while he reportedly wrote the sentence, “I must not tell lies” with a Blood Quill.
“Umbridge is not only one of the most malicious Potter characters, she is the only person other than Lord Voldemort to leave a permanent physical scar on Harry,” said the update posted to Pottermore.com on October 24.
“The new exclusive J.K. Rowling content provides a rich, 1,700-word back story about Umbridge’s life filled with many new details, as well as Rowling’s revealing first-person thoughts and reflections about the character.”
Professor Umbridge was portrayed by British actress Imelda Staunton in the film series, first appearing in 2007.
This will be the latest spin-off of Harry Potter that Rowling will have released since publishing another short story in July, which was a 1,500 word tale depicting the adult lives of the young wizard, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, many years after their storied adventures, reuniting at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, all aged 34.

The Supreme Court on Monday declined to entertain a writ petition filed by Nalini Sriharan, convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, challenging Section 435 CrPC which provides for consultation with the Centre before a State government exercises its powers of remission to release a life convict.
The apex court had stayed the order passed by the Tamil Nadu government directing the release of the death row and life term convicts in the case.
On Monday, a three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice H.L. Dattu and Justices Madan B. Lokur and A.K. Sikri refused to entertain the petition after hearing counsel M. Radhakrishnan.
Ms. Nalini said she has been undergoing imprisonment for life in the Special Prison for Women, Vellore. She has already served more than 23 years and is awaiting release under the scheme for premature release of life convicts available in Tamil Nadu.
As per Section 435 (1) (a) of the CrPC, a State government cannot exercise its powers under Sections 432 and 433 of the CrPC except after consultation with the Central Government if the State government wants to remit or commute a sentence in a case investigated by the CBI.

Kerala-born businessman tops list of powerful Indians inGulfBy: Press Trust of India | Dubai | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:19 pm
Kerala-born businessman and the Managing Director of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali MA, has retained his top position in the annual list of powerful Indians in Gulf countries for the fifth time in a row.
The ‘Indian Power List’, published Sunday by Arabian Business, named Ali as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf countries.
His Lulu Group has a strong presence in the Middle East’s retail sector and is planning expansion in new markets.
A key reason for Ali being considered as the most powerful Indian in the Gulf is also his close proximity to the various ruling family members of GCC countries.
Ali has recently been elected as Director Board Member of Abu Dhabi Chamber for the third consecutive time, becoming the first and only Indian till date to occupy such a position.
He also featured in the Forbes Top Global Billionaire 2014 list.
Lulu Group has operations in 32 countries, with staff strength of 31,000 and has reported revenues of USD 5.2 billion (Rs 33,500 crore) in 2013.

Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre toSCPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 6:25 pm
The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Swiss government has indicated its willingness to provide information on “stolen data” containing names of Indians who had allegedly stashed black money in banks there.
The government said the “development” is very significant as the Swiss government had earlier refused to provide any information regarding it.
“Switzerland has indicated willingness to provide information in respect of cases where investigations have been carried out by the IT Department independently from what Swiss government considers as stolen data. This development is very significant because there are several cases of account holders which were investigated by the Department independently.
“Earlier the Swiss government had not agreed to provide any information in such cases on the ground that these were stolen data and have been obtained in breach of Swiss law,” it said in its affidavit.
The government said the Swiss Federal Tax Administration has agreed that their counterpart authority would assist India in obtaining confirmation of genuineness of bank accounts.
“The Swiss authorities have also agreed to provide the requested information in a time bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline,” the Centre said.
It told the apex court that Switzerland has also assured it of commencing talks with India for concluding an Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement between the two sides at the earliest after completion of their domestic procedures.

reddit
ATLANTA (AP) — An exhibition at Atlanta's High Museum of Art showcases a group of impressionist and post-impressionist works amassed by a private collector who described the pursuit and acquisition of the pieces as an adventure.
The exhibition, "Cezanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection," includes 50 pieces, including works by Paul Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh, Edouard Manet, Amedeo Modigliani, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin and Henri De Toulouse-Lautrec. It opens Saturday at the High.
The centerpiece of the exhibition is 24 works by Cezanne, including 16 rarely exhibited watercolors.
One of the first paintings visitors see in the exhibition, Chaim Soutine's "View of Ceret," in which a cityscape is hardly recognizable, was Henry Pearlman's first major acquisition made in 1945. In Pearlman's "Reminiscences of a Collector," which is printed in the exhibition's catalog, Pearlman writes that he would get a "lift" when he saw that painting whenever he arrived home.
"This first pleasant experience with a modern painting started me on a road of adventure that has been both exhilarating and satisfying. I haven't spent a boring evening since that first purchase," he wrote.
Pearlman, whose Eastern Cold Storage Company made significant contributions to marine shipbuilding during World War II, and his wife Rose went on to build an impressive collection that has been housed at the Princeton University Art Museum since 1976.
The collection includes works that are considered among the best by the respective artists, including van Gogh's "Tarascon Stagecoach," Modigliani's portrait of Jean Cocteau and Cezanne's "Mont Sainte-Victoire." But it also lacks anything by Pablo Picasso and others that would seem natural inclusions for a collection of works from that era.
"There are relationships between things, but it's not a textbook collection," said High director of collections and exhibitions David Brenneman. "It's really Pearlman looking at things and drawing relationships."
Pearlman greatly admired Cezanne, and his collection includes works featuring familiar subjects for the artist — landscapes set in the countryside of Provence in southern France and still lifes of objects from his studio.
Some of the oil paintings seem incomplete with patches of canvas showing through, and it's not clear whether Cezanne had reached a point at which he was satisfied or whether he meant to come back to the paintings later, Brenneman said. Graphite drawings provide the framework for the watercolors, with colors added in varying intensity and the bright white of the paper shining through in places.
Soutine, the second most represented artist in the exhibition, is perhaps less familiar to the casual art consumer. But Brenneman said he hopes the exhibition will help expose more people to the works of the French expressionist who painted with thick strokes that leave markedly raised ridges of paint on the canvas.
To that end, the High borrowed five Soutine portraits from a private collection to supplement the seven other Soutine works included in the exhibition. Just as Soutine's landscapes verge on abstraction, his portraits nearly cross the line into caricature, Brenneman said.
Other highlights of the exhibition include "The Sacred Grove" by Toulouse-Lautrec, a parody of a classical scene by academic painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes that includes objects and people from Toulouse-Lautrec's time, and carvings by Gauguin and Modigliani.
The exhibition runs through Jan. 11 at the High. Then it will be at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, Canada, (Feb. 7-May 18) and will finish its tour at the Princeton University Art Museum (Sept. 12-Jan. 3, 2016). It previously was shown at museums in England and France.

National Republic's two branches will reopen as branches of State Bank of Texas, which is assuming all $915 million of National Republic's deposits.
State Bank of Texas also agreed to buy $626 million of the failed bank's $954 million assets, which typically consist of loans.
The last bank to fail in Illinois was GreenChoice Bank in Chicago on July 25.
As of June 30 there were 76 banks owned by Asian or Pacific Islander Americans, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. records. National Republic Bank of Chicago ranked in the top 10.
In July, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered the dismissal of Hiren Patel as chief executive and chairman and Edward Fitzgerald as president.

Data migration from China has nothing to do with IAF alert: Xiaomi India headPrint
The data migration process had started in early 2014; part of this migration will be completed by the end of the year.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 25, 2014 10:29 am | Updated: October 28, 2014 10:02 am
Xiaomi has again made headlines but this time for something serious. Days after it was reported that the Indian Air Force (IAF) had issued an advisory asking its personnel and their families not to use Xiaomi smartphones on account of ‘spying’, Xiaomi’s global vice president Hugo Barra’s blog post on Google Plus on Wednesday titled “ We’re moving your data ” has sparked a new row.
Manu Jain
It seemed like Xiaomi’s decision to migrate data from Beijing to US and Singapore was in response to the recent IAF notification. However, Xiaomi has denied this completely.
“The process for data/server migration started in early 2014, part of this migration will be completed by the end of the year. We believe that this migration will help improve the performance of our services. It will also provide some peace of mind for users in India in ensuring that we treat their data with the utmost care and will always maintain the highest privacy standards,” Manu Jain, head of Xiaomi’s India operation, told IndianExpress.com.
(Here is all you need to know: Indian Air Force alerts its personnel not to use Xiaomi phones )
IndianExpress.com had reported earlier that the advisory issued by IAF might be based on an old F-Secure privacy report. The same has been confirmed by Xiaomi now.
“We are not sure, but this might be some kind of misunderstanding. We do not have full information about the circular issued by IAF, however we believe that this advisory circular is based on events about 3 months back. We believe, it refers to the F-Secure test done on the Redmi 1S in July 2014 about the activation of our Cloud Messaging service by default,” said Jain.
F-Secure had confirmed, in a week, that Xiaomi had fixed the issues in its RedMi 1S smartphones through an update. “We immediately addressed the concerns raised by F-Secure. We scheduled an OTA system update on August 10, 2014 to implement a change, which ensured that all the users had to manually activate the Cloud services, instead of being activated by default. This change was directly acknowledged by F-Secure 4 days later, where they confirmed that their concerns were addressed,” added Jain.
The same was confirmed by Su Gim Goh, Security Advisor, APAC, F-Secure during his visit to New Delhi on September 1.
If the IAF advisory is totally based on the old F-Secure report, then it makes little sense now as the issue has been confirmed to be solved by the same software secure company who was the first to report the privacy breach incidence. The IAF advisory claims to be based on ‘inputs’ from Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). However, nothing specific has been mentioned.
The OTA update has now made Xiaomi’s cloud services as an opt-in feature, rather than a default one. Mi Cloud is turned off by default. Users must log in with their Mi accounts and manually turn on Mi Cloud. Users can also turn it off at any point of time.
Responding to the privacy concerns, Jain said, “Xiaomi never uploads photos, text messages, or any other data without the user’s consent. The storage of data in Mi Cloud fully respects the local laws of each country and region. When the data is sent to the cloud, we take rigorous precautions to ensure that all data is secured when uploaded to Xiaomi servers and is not stored beyond the time required. Strict encryption algorithms are implemented to protect user privacy. This is no different from other cloud backup services. If users want, they can use cloud services from Google, Dropbox and many others.”
Xiaomi is yet to reach out to IAF to get more clarity as to why the advisory was issued against using their smartphones. “We would be happy to talk to IAF to explain the entire situation to them. I am confident that we would be able to resolve any concerns / questions that they might be having,” said Jain.

Corruption has taken deep root in Mizoram  govt unable to stamp out on it s own: CM Lal ThanhawlaPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 5:56 pm
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Monday said “corruption has taken deep root” in Mizoram and hit out at the “idleness” among the state’s government employees while saying corruption is not only mean swindling public money, but includes “laziness, idleness, lack of passion for one’s work and expecting a higher income than what one’s work is worth.”
Speaking at the opening of RTI week in Aizawl, Lal Thanhawla said, “The government cannot fully stamp out corruption on it’s own, so we need the support of the public as well as the media, and one way is for people to use RTI to help the government.”
“In Mizoram, the best things are owned by the influential and the rich and common man does not get benefits,” the five-time CM said.
Elaborating on his dismissal of state government employees’ work culture, Lal Thanhawla said, “We pay little heed to filing property returns and while elsewhere people pay close attention we do not even border to intimate the government and we buy movable property like TV sets and cars as if it was paan.”
Lal Thanhawla’s two consecutive terms in office have been partly based on his party’s promise of a corruption-free government in an apparent bid to score over the Mizo National Front’s perceived corruption during the rebel-group turned political party’s ten-year rule, which ended in 2008.

New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Bharti Infratel today reported a 68 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 465 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of increased number of tenants on towers.
The company had reported a net profit of Rs 277 crore in the corresponding period last financial year.
Revenue rose 9 per cent to Rs 2,930 crore for the second quarter of 2015 fiscal as compared to Rs 2,684 crore last time.
“The telecom industry is entering into a phase of growth led by robust data uptake.
“The auctions in February 2014 gave lot of confidence and stability to the operators and a testimony to the fact is addition of close to 4,000 tenancies in this quarter for Bharti Infratel, an increase of over 100 per cent as compared to same period last year,” Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta said.
He added bulk of the incremental tenancies is on account of rollout of data networks.
“We believe that the upcoming spectrum auctions in February 2015 will further accelerate this trend,” Gupta said.
The company said consolidated EBITDA improved to Rs 1,220 crore, up 13 per cent year—on—year, representing an operating margin of 41.6 per cent and consolidated EBIT at Rs 673 crore, witnessed a 25 per cent y—o—y growth.
The total tower base of the company stood at 84,303 with an average sharing factor of 2.05 whereas 3950 co—location additions took place during the reported quarter.
The net cash of the firm stood at Rs 3,322.2 crore at the end of September 2014.

PE investments up 47% at $3.1 bn in July-Sep: Grant ThorntonPE investments up 47% at $3.1 bn in July-Sep: Grant Thornton
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
Private equity investment in the July—September quarter reached $3.1 billion, registering a growth of 47 per cent over the corresponding period last year driven by the Flipkart deal, says a report.
According to the advisory firm Grant Thornton, private equity investments witnessed a significant improvement both in terms of value (47 per cent) as well as volume (37 per cent) in the July—September quarter this year.
In the quarter, PE investments amounted to $3.12 billion through 157 deals, while in the corresponding period last year there were 115 such transactions worth $2.12 billion.
“Private equity witnessed a 47 per cent increase in values led by the billion dollar investment in Flipkart and 37 per cent increase in volumes driven by the IT&ITeS sector with over 40 per cent share in total deal volume,” the report said.
There were several big ticket deals in the quarter. As many as 15 investments were over $50 million each, including two over $100 million and one billion dollar investment, the report said. In the third quarter of 2013 there were only nine investments worth over $50 million each.
Sectorwise, IT/ITES, mainly driven by e—commerce, dominated PE deal values and volumes and going forward the sectors that are expected to see renewed deal activity include infrastructure, energy, consumer and financial services.
“We expect valuations to go up given the renewed business sentiments which in our view would be both a challenge and an opportunity for dealmakers to close deals in the coming quarters,” Grant Thornton India Partner Raja Lahiri said.
“We believe that this momentum of deal activity will continue to increase and we look forward to closing the year on a high note,” Lahiri added.
PE investment so far in 2014 stood higher at $8.4 billion as against $7.8 billion in 2013, with 38 per cent higher volumes in 2014 as compared to 2013, led by the technology sector.

AP to fund women self help groups  village bodies for sand miningAP to fund women self help groups, village bodies for sand mining

Hyderabad, Oct. 27:  
The Andhra Pradesh Government has decided to provide a Rs 5 lakh loan to village organisations from banks for sand mining and sale which has been entrusted to women self help groups.
The women self help groups of DWCRA (Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas) started sand mining and sale as part of Pedarikam Pai Gelupu (victory over poverty) campaign.
The State Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has decided that a loan of Rs 5 lakh would be provided to each Village Organisation through bank linkages for sand mining and sale.
At a meeting with AP Mineral Development Corporation and other departments, the Chief Minister said that DWCRA women should be motivated to work as if they are running their own organisation. This will enable them to make the sand sale a robust business and reap profits.
The Chief Minister added that eight women could be chosen from local self help group or Village organisation. They could work in two shifts, four in each shift, to monitor operations.
The Chief Minister was informed that consumers could order for sand online by registering with their Aadhar number through Mee Seva or through website. The consumer can pay the amount online through a bank transaction.
He added that the consumer could be informed about the status or movement of vehicle carrying sand by continuously monitoring it through GPS tracker from the control room at the stock point centre.
Naidu suggested that closed circuit television (CCTV) and global positioning system (GPS) trackers and other installations could be outsourced to support the sand mining and sale. This would help the outsourcing agency monitor operations without any discrepancies.
Of the 81 identified sand reaches in the State, sale of sand has begun in 70 of them. Eleven reaches (four of them in Odisha, one in Karnataka, four in Puducherry and two in Telangana) are inter-State sharing sites.
In a pilot project carried out in East Godavari district, 1.9 lakh cubic metres of sand has been excavated. Of this, 40,000 cubic metres has been sold and has fetched Rs 2.95 crore.
The Chief Minister said 75 per cent of this amount would be transferred to Farmers’ Empowerment Corporation.

Escaping residents report dozens more girls and young women have been abducted by Islamic extremists in northeast Nigeria, raising doubts about an announced cease-fire and hopes for the release of 219 schoolgirls held captive since April.
The residents say about 30 teenage girls and boys have been kidnapped in recent days from villages 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.
Another 40 girls and young women were abducted from neighbouring Adamawa state on Oct. 18, the day after Nigeria’s military announced a cease-fire agreement with Boko Haram insurgents.
It quotes escapees saying they are forced to become Muslim, forced into marriage and raped.

Modi effect: Japan s SoftBank to invest $10 billion in IndiaJapan's SoftBank to invest $10 billion in India
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 20:40 IST
Telecom giant SoftBank has pledged an investment of $10 billion (over Rs 60,000 crore) in India's IT and communications space, one of the biggest investment commitments from a Japanese firm after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to that country.
Softbank-one of the major telecom and internet corporations of Japan-will look for opportunities in telecom and the fast-growing e-commerce sectors in India.
The proposed investment was committed by Softbank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son in a meeting with Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, an official statement said on Monday.
"Mr Son today assured the Minister that SoftBank would like to invest approximately $10 billion in India in the coming years. He placed it on record that India is the top most priority for SoftBank," the Telecom Ministry statement said.
Son told Prasad the visit of Prime Minister to Japan has created a climate of hope and optimism about greater economic cooperation between the two countries, it added.
With a market cap of $92 billion, SoftBank has operations in broadband, fixed line telecom, e-Commerce, finance, media and marketing. SoftBank already has made investments in Indian companies including InMobi and Hike.
"He (Son) further expressed immense faith in the great eCommerce potential of India. He estimated it to become a $0.5 trillion business in the next 10 years," the statement said.
Sources said that SoftBank has plans to invest in ecommerce firm Snapdeal. However, Softbank and Snapdeal did not immediately respond to queries on the matter.
SoftBank Chairman also asked Prasad to develop a robust mobile phone infrastructure and resolve spectrum issues.

Chris Paul: Becoming a Mentor Like the Ones Who Helped Me Succeedreddit
Working with the My Brother's Keeper program gives me an opportunity to look back through my life and realize how blessed I am to have had mentors and coaches who have helped me become the man I am today. My wife, Jada, and I are also using the advice, shared experiences and love that our parents and extended family have shown us to be the best parents we can.
My parents taught my brother and me about the importance of family.  We watched them make sacrifices for us to ensure that we had a good education and understood the importance of keeping God first in our lives. I also learned the importance of discipline that has shaped me now that I am a parent.
My grandfather taught me about the importance of hard work and setting a goal and reaching it. He was the first African American owner of a gas station in North Carolina. My brother and I spent summers changing oil, rotating tires and learning to be respectful to his customers.
When I went to Wake Forest Coach Skip Prosser taught me about the importance of discipline on the basketball court. He shared with our entire roster the importance of playing like a team, trusting each other and understanding the importance of being a student of the game, so we could achieve greatness on an off the court.
My bother CJ has been at my side all my life. When I was drafted he was there and he continues to be a sounding board for me to talk to, bounce ideas off of and encourage me. He is always honest with me regardless if I agree with him or not. He is one of my most trusted advisors.
I have had teammates who mentored me like Chauncey Billups and Willie Green. They both taught me how to be a better leader, on and off the court.
And I have Doc Rivers as a coach and mentor. He navigates the waters for our entire team and is a constant source of advice, both from the perspective of being a player and a coach. He is always available and because he knows the pressures of being a player, he knows how to motivate each of us. Doc will tell you the truth, plain and simple. He doesn't mince words and because of what he has achieved in his career, you know you are getting the best advice from someone who can back up what he says. His guidance is priceless.
When I have an opportunity to mentor someone, I find the most important thing is to listen to them when they tell you about themselves. That will always give you an idea of what type of support they need.  For example, at my basketball camps I always look for the young man who is a bit shy. He might stand back and you don't see him being confident in some of the drills we may be doing. I will make sure that I have time to talk to him during our drills and will seek him out during breaks and when we are having meals together. I listen to him and share stories about myself that I think he can relate to in his own life.
There are times when I will also look to mentor a young man who is a bit too confident, which can sometimes make his teammates and friends feel insecure or unimportant. That is an opportunity for me to share the importance of being humble and using ones talents to help others, whether it is on the court, in the classroom or other areas of his life.
I am proud to be a member of the NBA and as president of the National Basketball Players Association I get to see the kind of impact players in the NBA can have on their communities and on young people. That is why are working together to support President Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative and helping to recruit 25,000 new mentors over the next five years.
We want mentors who are passionate and understand the opportunity they are being given to change and motivate young men. I continue to monitor myself as I know that young men are looking at what I am doing. I want to be my very best to make certain that my activities off the court and through my foundation, ensure that young men see the entire package.

Brooklyn Bowling Alley  The Gutter  To Reopen After Ebola CleanupPost by The Gutter .
Although bowling alleys where people rent shoes and share balls are notorious incubators of germs, it's extremely unlikely that you can get Ebola from a bowling ball. "There is no evidence that it has been passed, as colds or flu sometimes are, by touching surfaces that someone else touched after sneezing into their hand," says a separate article in The New York Times .
Still, closing its business down for cleaning was probably a smart move for the bowling alley. "They’re losing some money obviously by being closed, but what they gain in peace of mind and goodwill I think is worth a lot to them," said Lynda Maddox, a marketing and advertising professor at George Washington University. Maddox noted that this is the first time Americans are dealing with ebola on their soil and there's currently a lot of skepticism with regards to how the CDC is handling the virus. A little extra care is going to be well-perceived.
Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old doctor who contracted New York's first case of Ebola , told authorities that he had gone bowling at The Gutter on Wednesday night before taking an Uber back to his apartment in Manhattan .
Uber said on Thursday that the car and driver involved were not a risk for ebola.
The following morning, Spencer felt feverish and was diagnosed at Bellevue Hospital.
The Gutter said it had been told by doctors advising the New York Health Department that there was no risk to its staff or to any customers . The New York Health Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.
While there have been some reports saying Spencer also "caught some music" at The Brooklyn Bowl, a larger bowling and concert venue nearby, Brooklyn Bowl said on its Twitter page that Spencer did not go there.
The musician Questlove, who plays a regular show at Brooklyn Bowl on Thursday nights, said Thursday that the venue was safe to hang out at :

The United States launched its first airstrikes on militants in Syria on Sept. 23, and has continued the onslaught since.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday that 533 people have been killed in airstrikes since they began. That group counted 32 civilian deaths, including six children and five women. The Observatory has been tracking conflict in Syria for years, and has a large network of activists on the ground.
Visually, the deaths look like this:
The human rights organization said that the number of militants could be much higher. Most of the deaths occurred around Kobane, the border town in northern Syria where militants have been locked in a fierce fight with Kurdish forces trying to protect it from falling. More than 130 U.S. airstrikes have been launched on targets around Kobane.

Facebook announced a new stand-alone mobile app that enables people to communicate anonymously—a change in the company's long-standing policy.
Called "Rooms," the app is a sort of updated version of chat rooms or web forums, as it enables people to communicate around different topics.
The idea, says the blog announcing the new product , is that people can create "places for the things you're into, and invite others who are into them too." Users can customize the look and feel of forums, and share photos and videos about any topic—the app suggests 'City Gargens' and 'Pug Lovers.

This is a departure for Facebook, which has had a long-standing policy against using fake names. In contrast, Rooms allows people to contribute anonymously, under multiple pseudonyms. Other anonymous and private apps, like Secret and Whisper, have seen rising popularity, as have sites like Reddit.

Why Humble  Empathic Business Leaders Are More Successfulreddit
It's increasingly evident that business leaders who are capable of experiencing and demonstrating empathy, compassion, and humility have greater success. Research as well as direct business experience confirms this. One recent example is a study of 1500 leaders and their employees . It found that humble leaders who have increased self-awareness and insight experience greater commitment and performance from their employees.
According to the research findings , "Leaders with a strong self-insight demonstrate a good understanding of their own needs, emotions, abilities and behavior. On top of that, they are proactive in the face of challenges." The study found that when employees experience this type of leadership, it has a positive effect, and that's especially true when the leader is humble.
More broadly, research in recent years indicates that the capacity for compassion and empathy are innate, and it can be strengthened through conscious effort and focus. These capacities reflect letting go of ego-driven attitudes and behavior; and they enhance positive, effective relationships. We are now seeing evidence that they are linked with greater business success, especially in the form of increased competitive advantage. For example, billionaire founder/CEO of Virgin Group, Richard Branson has pointed out that "In business... companies that want to survive...are smart enough to know that caring and cooperation are key."
Today's organizations require what the New York Times columnist Adam Bryant has described as a "quick and nimble" management culture. This, in turn, requires leaders to let go of focusing so much on themselves; to let go of the "alpha male" role, as Georg Vielmetter of the Hay Group has called it. Then, they are more able to engage with diverse employees, and from a more humble perspective. Vielmetter pointed out that
The time of the alpha male -- of the dominant, typically male leader who knows everything, who gives direction to everybody and sets the pace, whom everybody follows because this person is so smart and intelligent and clever -this time is over. We need a new kind of leader who focuses much more on relationships and understands that leadership is not about himself...who knows he needs to listen to other people...to be intellectually curious and emotionally open...(and) needs empathy to do the job.
These capacities are also evident in a study from Catalyst , described in Jeanine Prime and Elizabeth Salib's Harvard Business Review Blog. It found that when employees observed diminished ego in their managers -- such as humbleness and empowering workers -- they reported being more innovative and engaged; more likely to suggest new product ideas and ways of doing work better.
In a global marketplace where problems are increasingly complex, no one person will ever have all the answers. As Google's SVP of People Operations, Lazlo Bock, says , "Your end goal is what can we do together to problem-solve. Without humility, you are unable to learn." In fact, Bock says that humility is one of the traits he's looking for in new hires. "Your end goal is what can we do together to problem-solve. I've contributed my piece, and then I step back." And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute, says Bock--it's "...intellectual humility. Without humility, you are unable to learn."
That's consistent with the Catalyst study , which shows that altruism makes employees more innovative and engaged - especially when working with employees from diverse backgrounds, which is increasingly common. In fact, it found that humility is one of four critical leadership factors for creating an environment where employees from different demographic backgrounds feel included. Employees who perceived altruistic behavior from their managers also reported being more innovative, suggesting new product ideas and ways of doing work better. Moreover, they were more likely to report engaging in team citizenship behavior, going beyond the call of duty, picking up the slack for an absent colleague -- all indirect effects of feeling more included in their workgroups.
In a similar vein, Richard Branson stresses the importance of seeking and supporting a wide, diverse range of people ; and, being open to input and potential solutions through active listening: "Over more than 40 years of building our businesses at the Virgin Group, (we have seen) that employing people from different backgrounds and who have various skills, viewpoints and personalities will help you to spot opportunities, anticipate problems and come up with original solutions before your competitors do."

Scaling Up: What It Takes To Create Responsible Practices On A Global Scalereddit
The complexity -- and potential for good -- of global reach.
Companies that are the largest in their industry, such as Unilever or Nike, face a unique challenge each time they make a move in sustainability. Should they use their scale to change their industry globally for the greater good, or should they prioritize quick wins, creating aspirational, sustainability-based fame for their products?
Think of Starbucks and disposable coffee cups. For years they tried to chip away at the issue of waste on their own, but they ground to a halt at the point where they were leading the industry and couldn't move the needle any further than 10 percent post-consumer recycled content. But in 2008, they took the issue to the industry. Multiple "Cup Summits" took the cup from something they led alone on to something that transformed the pulp and paper, packaging, and catering industries and even re-imagined the way waste streams functioned globally. It took years to change the fundamental ways food packaging is produced and taken back into the waste stream, and today, Starbucks is even going beyond recycled content, targeting 100 percent reusable or recyclable cups by 2015 and working in partnership with competitors like Tim Horton's. What started as a Starbucks project ended up bigger than the industry.
Why am I telling you about recycled coffee cups? The reason is goose down, the material that fills many of our comforters, jackets, sleeping bags and pillows. In the past few years we've seen rising concern over where down comes from. When we dug into this, we saw many disturbing vulnerabilities -- practices like force-feeding ("gavage" for foie gras) and a potential for live plucking in the related food industry. We also saw that in many cases, down used in products could not be traced back to its origin.
Other companies began to pay attention to these types of issues, too. IKEA began making down alternatives. Gap and Zara said goodbye to angora -- which was going through a similar moment of transparency. However, due in part to limited regulations on animal welfare and food-down supply chain complexities, the industry struggled to find a way to source responsible materials at scale. Some companies have tried to develop ways to mitigate risks and mistreatment of animals; however, these approaches have typically only been applicable to a single company's own supply chain or specific supply chain type. Good for one brand -- not great for all.
So we faced a choice: Do we ensure The North Face brand's down is from responsible sources, or do we take on the challenge as a leader and bring our industry -- and other industries -- along with us? Going it alone would have been the easier choice.
While many people know The North Face for its jackets and gear, not as many know the story behind the name. The north face of a mountain (in the northern hemisphere) is the most formidable route to climb. Taking the toughest route means forging a path that might be more challenging -- you might have to lead a new route -- but this is the legacy and the company culture that helped support us in establishing a standard that brings the whole industry along -- creating a source of responsible down not just for our company, but building an economically viable, global market for responsible down. It is still a new path that will continue to change and adapt.
To develop the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), we worked with farmers, collectors and processors across Eastern Europe and Asia to create what is today the largest global, publicly available certification system for the responsible sourcing of down that addresses animal welfare and material traceability. From the outset, we knew that we needed help creating a quality standard that could be applied globally and used by anyone. We worked with several partners, including the animal welfare group FOUR PAWS , down suppliers like Allied Feather & Down and Downlite , third party, independent auditor Control Union, and certification standards experts at Textile Exchange , which now owns and governs the standard on behalf of the industry. We even worked with our competitors to develop a standard the entire industry could access.
For us, responsible down doesn't mean only prohibiting animal mistreatment such as force-feeding and live-plucking. We took a holistic approach by including requirements and guidelines on things like food and water quality, housing, stock density and outdoor access, animal hygiene, and pest and predator control in the standard. To ensure validation of these practices, the standard also includes strict requirements to document the traceability of the down from its origination through to the final product.
We set a goal of 30 percent of all of the down that goes into our fall 2015 products to be RDS-certified material, including all of our technical Summit Series products and all products we sell in Europe. Thirty percent is an aggressive goal given the volume of down we use and the infancy of the standard. However, widespread adoption of the standard within the down supply chain has yielded enough certified down for us to exceed our 30 percent goal.
Why are we sticking with 30 percent? This is actually a crucial strategy for building a global market for certified down. By sharing the supply of certified down with others in the apparel, bedding and hospitality industries, a more diversified and stable market for responsible down can take root.
Making change at a large organization can be tough. But when your efforts can help improve the welfare of animals across an entire global supply chain, it can be worth every obstacle on the "hardest side of the mountain."

Kaiser Permanente Is Failing Its Mental Health Patientsreddit
In September, after more than a year of stonewalling its patients and employees, Kaiser Permanente finally paid a $4-million fine levied against it by state regulators because of the HMO's chronic, illegal, and too often tragic failures in mental health care.
Spurred by whistleblower complaints from Kaiser's own mental health clinicians, an investigation by the state's Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) found the HMO guilty of "serious" and "systemic" violations of California law that put mental health patients at risk. The result: In June 2013 the DMHC hit Kaiser with a $4-million fine -- the second largest in the agency's history -- for forcing thousands of patients to endure illegally lengthy waits for care, falsifying patients' appointment records, and violating the California Mental Health Parity Act, which requires HMOs to provide psychiatric services that are on par with their primary health services.
Kaiser appealed, of course, but, faced with the prospect of a hearing during which patients and whistleblowers would have given public testimony regarding Kaiser's deficient care, the HMO's lawyers finally threw in the towel. Kaiser had attempted to negotiate a settlement with the DMHC in hopes of avoiding such a spectacle but failed. And when, on the hearing's first day, Administrative Law Judge Ruth Astle declined to seal all the hearing's documents and questioned the ethics of Kaiser's star witness -- a former DMHC prosecutor now in private practice defending HMOs against regulators -- Kaiser's attorneys finally saw the writing on the wall .
The National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), which represents 2,500 mental health professionals at more than 100 facilities throughout California, stands with the thousands of patients who have suffered as a result of Kaiser's violations in applauding the DMHC for holding Kaiser accountable. But Kaiser's mental health care crisis is far from over. Kaiser clinicians have provided the DMHC with ample evidence that Kaiser continues to delay and deny care to its mental health patients, in violation of state and federal law.
Kaiser simply does not staff its psychiatry departments with enough psychologists, therapists, and social workers to handle the caseload. And that caseload is growing rapidly. This year Kaiser's enrollment has increased by 387,000 members in California under the Affordable Care Act. Withholding services while increasing membership is an effective way to score record profits -- Kaiser has made more than $13 billion since 2009, and this year's profits are on pace to double last year's -- but it has led to woefully inadequate care, as well as five class-action lawsuits filed by patients and families who say Kaiser's violations contributed to tragic outcomes, including suicides.
And the violations continue:
• As of September 2014, pediatric patients requiring neuropsychological testing waited 22 weeks before receiving a phone call from Kaiser's San Francisco psychiatry department to schedule an appointment, according to Kaiser's records.
• In August 2014, Kaiser's psychiatry department in San Francisco was so severely understaffed that dozens of patients' calls to the "Triage Team" languished in the voicemail system for more than a week before staff could even listen to them, let alone respond to them.
• In July 2014, Kaiser instructed employees in at least one clinic to falsify appointment records rather than provide patients with urgent appointments within 48 hours, as mandated by state law.
• In May 2014, Kaiser failed to provide timely mental health appointments to more than 60 percent of the patients seeking care at Kaiser's Oakland and Richmond facilities, according to data supplied by Kaiser.
• In April 2014, one of Kaiser's Southern California clinics required patients with acute conditions -- including auditory hallucinations -- to wait more than seven weeks for an appointment.
The parallels with the scandal that engulfed the Veterans Affairs Administration earlier this year are striking and prompted NUHW in June to call for a federal investigation into Kaiser's mental health services.
The DMHC is expected to release a follow-up survey of Kaiser's mental health services in November. While the findings in that survey are not yet known, a hint was proffered last month by a DMHC official. At a mental health forum in Santa Rosa , California, hosted by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson and Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane, during which Kaiser was blasted by patients who had suffered as a result of its inadequate psychiatric services, Sherrie Lowenstein, the DMHC's deputy director for legislative affairs, vowed, "We are not done with Kaiser."
Considering the severity of the violations, and considering the preponderance of evidence that Kaiser continues to violate the law, NUHW strongly urges the DMHC to stay true to its mission by forcing Kaiser to fix its dangerously inadequate mental health services.
Without strict enforcement, Kaiser mental health patients will continue to endure illegal and unethical wait times for appointments; patients in need of ongoing one-on-one therapy will be forced to seek care outside Kaiser; and many patients in need of acute care will go untreated, sometimes with tragic consequences.

Ford to spend more than $2.5 billion to overhaul Lincoln brandFord to spend more than $2.5 billion to overhaul Lincoln brand
By Paul Lienert and Bernie Woodall, Reuters
Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers The Lincoln Motor Company Mercedes-Benz
Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, Mark Fields, is giving the automaker's long-moribund Lincoln brand what his predecessor Alan Mulally never could: a little love and a lot of cash.
Lincoln, a storied Detroit brand which Ford has owned since 1922, has been in a swoon for the past two decades, leaving dealers and customers wondering if Ford management had left the brand for dead.
Now, with the renewed backing of Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the company's board, Fields has committed the automaker to a multiyear, multibillion-dollar overhaul of Lincoln that includes a significant investment in a new premium vehicle platform that will underpin several future Lincoln vehicles, four sources told Reuters.
Ford could spend $5 billion or more over the next five years to revive Lincoln, revamp its product portfolio and reposition it as a true competitor to such global luxury leaders as Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG , the sources said. Details of the new platform and the size and scope of the investment have not previously been reported.
"It's really important for us to have a relevant and vibrant luxury brand," Fields told Reuters on Friday. "You need to make the investment and build this brand over time."
He declined to discuss details about Ford's spending and product plans.
Fields said Ford is looking at the Lincoln rebuilding effort "in terms of generations of products," an effort that will stretch well into the next decade.
Hire some Honda and Toyota engineers and designers. Bring back a full-size RWD sedan for the limo industry. That's how you save Lincoln.

Ford executives said last month that the immediate goal of the latest Lincoln turnaround effort is to triple the brand's global sales to 300,000 vehicles by 2020.
Several industry analysts have challenged that mark as overly optimistic, as have some former Ford executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A longer-range target is to restore Lincoln's luster as a premium automotive marque in the United States and build it into a formidable competitor in China, where Ford is just now launching the brand years after most of its global luxury rivals entered the China market. On Friday, Ford delivered its first Lincoln in China, an MKZ sedan.
The springboard for the Lincoln revival plan is a new family of vehicles that will be built on a highly flexible premium platform that can be configured for front-, rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles, according to industry sources familiar with Ford's plans.
That is a critical element that has been lacking in several previous, under-financed attempts to resuscitate the brand. Versions of the platform will be used by both the Lincoln and Ford brands, the sources said.
Former CEO Mulally, who stepped down in July, declined to make more than a nominal investment in Lincoln - and even considered selling or closing the brand, according to two sources.
But his successor, Fields, has directed his management team to try to reverse a long-term U.S. sales skid that has seen Lincoln sink from the No. 1 spot in 1998 to eighth place among luxury brands, with about half the sales of General Motors Co's Cadillac and one-quarter the sales of segment leader Mercedes. Last year, Lincoln sales were 81,694, less than half of the 187,121 cars it sold in 1998.
 
FLEXIBLE DESIGN
The revival effort is backed by the first significant investment in Lincoln in years, one that will see every product redesigned or replaced over the next five years.
Ford already has spent about $2 billion on Lincoln in the past two years, according to one source, about half of that to prepare for the brand's introduction this week in China and half to update and expand its product stable to tide Lincoln over until the new family of vehicles is ready toward the end of the decade.
Ford has said in some years it spent only $500 million or less on Lincoln. In September, the automaker told investors it plans to spend more than $2.5 billion through 2019 on Lincoln product development, facilities and tooling.
But that figure does not include spending on engineering, advertising and other sales-related expenses for Lincoln, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Friday.
Much of the new investment is earmarked for development and tooling of the new premium platform, known internally as D6, sources said. The development is being overseen by new Lincoln President Kumar Galhotra, an engineer.
The flexible architecture of the D6 will provide the mechanical base for a wide variety of sedans and crossovers starting in 2019, all designed to give Lincoln more differentiation from its Ford-branded siblings, as well as a stronger foundation on which to build more competitive luxury models to pit against the sector leaders.
Before the first of the new D6-based models arrive, Lincoln will update most of its existing products, starting with a redesigned MKX midsize crossover in spring 2015 and a replacement for the MKS large sedan in spring 2016, sources said. The latter model will include a long-wheelbase version with more room inside for Chinese customers, Galhotra said.
The Navigator fullsize utility vehicle is slated for an extensive overhaul in autumn 2017, according to sources, when it will share a version of the new Ford F-150 chassis and will get aluminum body panels.
A redesign of the compact MKC crossover is tentatively scheduled in autumn 2018, the sources said.
The first of the all-new D6 models, due in 2019, are a midsize sedan that could replace the MKZ and a large seven-passenger crossover that could replace the MKT, sources said. Both new models are expected to be offered in front- and all-wheel-drive versions.

Air travellers' body questions ‘non-existent’ low fare offers

The association sought to know as to what action the regulator intends to take against the carriers on the issue.

Apex air travellers’ association, Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) on Sunday questioned the frequent “special fare” offers by domestic carriers and termed them as “non-existent”, even as it urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) not to allow such schemes.
The association, in a communication to the DGCA, also sought to know as to what action the regulator intends to take against the carriers on the issue.
“We strongly believe that the DGCA must put an end to this practice of offering ridiculously low fares which are non-existent and are not really available to the passenger,” APAI president D. Sidhakara Reddy said.
Domestic carriers, incuding SpiceJet and Jet Airways , have been rolling out limited period “special sale” offers in the last few weeks.
“We have received several complaints that the passengers do not get access to the airline’s portal and if they are able to do so and look for the advertised (special) fare for a particular sector, it shows sold out, whereas most of the other types of fares are only available for bookings,” Mr. Reddy alleged.
Pointing out that it become a routine practice by all the airlines to announce such schemes almost once in 10-15 days, APAI said: “the airlines seem to be doing this with certain objectives in mind as it gives them tremendous publicity at no cost.”
The association has also sought to know from the regulator whether the carriers do inform of the percentage of seats they offer under the special fare as they are supposed to file their fares with DGCA, indicating the quantum allocated under each type of fare offered by them under the bucket pricing method.
“If they are not then what action do you propose (to take) for not following the procedure?,” Mr. Reddy questioned in his communication.
APAI will explore the RTI route if the DGCA did not respond to its communication, Mr. Reddy added in his communication.

Engagement season: Is that romance in the air - or pumpkin spice0
Naturally, the arrival of fall in all its pumpkin-spiced glory means that the Wedding-Industrial Complex shifts into high gear, which makes Engagement Season nearly as dangerous for the soon-to-be affianced as Duck Season is for mallards.
That's not just because the average wedding cost $29,858 last year, or because one out of every eight couples end up with significant wedding debt (and corresponding money squabbles) because of overspending on their Perfect Day. Or even because nearly half of all weddings now end in divorce, which guarantees both parties will be poorer than if they'd stayed single, and also are likely to die sooner.
No, it's because the actual things you do during Engagement Season could very well doom your marriage before the flower girl drops the first perfect satin rose petal ($12.50 per package) from her $65 Isabella Flower Girl Basket while also bearing the $54 Here Comes the Bride Canvas Wedding Banner.
Exhibit A: The engagement ring.
Ring-a-ding dud
According to new research from Andrew Francis and Hugo Mialon of the economics department at Atlanta's Emory University, the more expensive the engagement ring, the shorter the marriage. Their survey found that men who spent $2,000 to $4,000 on the ring had a 30 percent greater risk of divorce than if they'd spent $500 to $2,000.
Why, you ask? Well, maybe it's because of the financial stress that comes from buying an expensive rock and the fact that a guy who drops four grand on a ring will likewise spend like crazy on the wedding, which is another factor associated with short marriages. Or it could just be that his new bride comes to her senses when she realizes she married the kind of chump who spends $4,000 on an engagement ring.
Despite all that, getting -- and staying -- married is an investment that means you'll be more prosperous, happier and live longer than singletons. So, if you do pop the question this Engagement Season, make sure that instead of blowing your dough on a big wedding bash or a shiny finger bauble, you spend your money on the important things -- like a home with separate bathrooms.
With, of course, pumpkin-spice air fresheners.

Brent crude falls to $86 on Goldman forecastsBrent drops below $86 after Goldman cuts price forecasts
Osamu Tsukimori     Tokyo   Last Updated: October 27, 2014  | 12:18 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Brent crude futures fell below $86 a barrel on Monday after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts for the contract and for US oil in the first quarter of next year by $15.
The US investment bank said in a research note on Sunday that it had cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to $75 a barrel from $90 and that for Brent to $85 from $100, with rising production in non-OPEC countries outside North America expected to outstrip demand.
The bank expects WTI to fall as low as $70 a barrel and Brent to hit $80 in the second quarter of 2015, when it expects oversupply to be most pronounced.
Goldman's projections contrast sharply with those of Standard Chartered Bank's oil analyst Paul Horsnell, known for having called the market's long rally a decade ago, who is sticking with a more bullish bias.
Last week, Horsnell and his team pared their forecast for 2015 Brent crude oil by $5 but only to $105 a barrel, still among the highest prediction around after a wave of reductions in bank forecasts over the past few weeks.
London Brent crude for December delivery was trading 19 cents lower at $85.94 a barrel at 0453 GMT. On October 16 it had dropped below $83, its lowest in almost four years.
US crude for December delivery was up 8 cents at $81.09 a barrel. However, for the first time since January, US crude futures are poised to flip into contango, a structure in which prompt prices are below longer-dated contracts, typically signalling a weaker market.
The spread between December and January US oil futures fell as low as 24 cents on Monday, the same as Friday, which was the lowest since February.
Goldman's forecasts had an impact on the market even though some other researchers have already projected a slide in Brent and US oil to around $75 a barrel, said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan.
"The market is worried about further weakness as Goldman Sachs said, and doubts beget doubts as there are no indications of a clear sign of recovery in demand, while supplies are no doubt in excess," he said.
"It's not at the stage where participants could buy oil wholeheartedly believing it's a bargain now."
Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said: "The fall in prices despite continued easing of worries over the global economic recovery is likely to have been prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecasts. I personally think prices have room for declines though not as steep as Goldman."
HIGH SUPPLIES
The 12-member OPEC meets on Nov. 27 to consider adjusting its output target of 30 million barrels per day for the first half of 2015. So far only a minority of members have called for an output cut.
Saudi Arabia has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
Global oil supply remains high despite disruption in producers such as Iraq and Libya. Yemen resumed exports from its main oil pipeline on Saturday, a day after an attack by tribesmen temporarily halted flows, industry sources said.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for signs on when the US central bank could raise interest rates. The Fed is likely to conclude its bond purchases after recent data showed the US economy gaining strength.

Homelands failures as message TVSuraj Sharma as Aayan in “Homeland.” (Season 4, Episode 1). (Joe Alblas/Showtime)
This post discusses the plot of the Oct. 26 episode of “Homeland,” “About a Boy.”
It is very easy to make a highly entertaining spy drama if you do not care very much about the morals or ethics of the people involved in the spy trade. If you are free to spend your mental energy choreographing great chase sequences or tense fights constrained by the need to avoid discovery, you can make movies and television that feel tense and exciting. But if you have set yourself the task not simply of making espionage look cool but of saying something serious about both the trade and the positions of the participants, everything gets a lot harder.
In recent years, we have had a couple of movies about spycraft that managed to deploy style and substance, if not in exactly equal measure.
Sam Mendes’ “Skyfall” is every inch in the James Bond tradition, but despite a flamboyant villain and a lot of snazzy explosions, it is also a melancholic meditation on the limitations of the British empire . And while I know some critics found Thomas Alfredson’s adaptation of John le Carré’s “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” difficult to follow, his chronicle of spy George Smiley’s (Gary Oldman) redemption and rise to power is told with a sense of both agonizing love and ethical squalor.
One of the problems “Homeland” has at present seems to be a sense that, in order to pronounce judgment on the War on Terror and what it has done to us, only extreme dourness will do. To a certain extent, the show has locked itself into this position as a result of past artistic choices and events: Carrie’s (Claire Danes) mental illness, her doomed affair with Brody and the abandoned child that resulted all cast a depressive fog over the series.
But I wonder if digging into that tone is a mistake. Part of what is powerful about le Carré’s work or the best adaptation of Ian Fleming’s is that it conveys just how satisfying it can be to pull off a perfect operation, how powerful you can feel when you have access to a secret world. If intelligence is a quick route to misery and emotional illness, and if the people in it are fated to fail in painful and embarrassing ways, we would not have to frown in sorrow about its dangers and appeal. Showing spies being competent and exercising great power is critical both to entertaining and audience and leading them to an authentic moral judgment on this work and the people who do it.
Take Carrie’s seduction of Aayan (Suraj Sharma). On a different, shallower show he might be an adult, and their romp would be a flirtation of equals. At the very least, there might be something genuinely sweet about Aayan’s sexual awakening. But “Homeland” digs in on the grubbiness of her tactics.
“It’s against my faith,” Aayan tells her the morning after. “I don’t want to sin, I want to be devout.” “It’s all right,” Carrie tells him. “We don’t have to do anything.” Of course, she proceeds to seduce him again, promising to be his sexual tutor so he will know what to do, for his pleasure and for hers. She emotionally connects to him, which of course means he is in for some sort of disaster, and even confides that she would have liked to be married to Brody. And if it was not all seedy enough, Quinn (Rupert Friend) shows up tell Carrie that while she may think she is recruiting Aayan, “to me it looks like you’re f—ing a child.”
Then, there is the pathetic dissolution of Dennis (Mark Moses) and Martha’s (Laila Robins) marriage. “Don’t make up a story. If you want to leave, say it to my face,” Martha tells Dennis, who slinks off to drink himself silly in a bar. “Men secretly fear their wives are crazy, and wives secretly fear their husbands are losers,” Martha tells John (Michael O’Keefe) when he fetches Dennis home. “He was dashing. A bright light. That guy is gone.”
There is absolutely truth in the idea that marriages can fall apart when gender roles are reversed to one partner’s displeasure, when one partner does not have meaningful work, or when the couple lacks a social network. But taken with Carrie’s latest seduction, this kind of grinding misery makes it hard to stick around for the lessons “Homeland” is supposed to impart to me. The show sometimes feels like the equivalent of burying vitamins not in ice cream but in castor oil.
Thank goodness for the few people in Islamabad who appears to have a sense of style. John wanted Carrie’s job as station chief; he may be bitter, but he hasn’t let that cramp his killer deadpan. “I don’t know how great he was, but he was all right to drink with,” he says in the bar with Dennis. And then there’s Ghazi, who may be a thug and a killer, but who has enough game to lure Saul (Mandy Patinkin) into a trap.
This season of “Homeland” may be a reboot. But for it to work as both morality tale and entertainment, the series and its main characters could learn from its villains and the minor players on their own side that they have shunted aside.

JSW Steel plans to add 6 mtpa capacity at Bellary plant
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
JSW Steel plans to raise capacity at its Bellary plant by 60 per cent to 16 million tonnes a year at an estimated investment Rs 30,000 crore that will make the unit the largest single-location steel facility.
The proposal to raise the capacity from 10 mtpa now was put up by the Sajjan Jindal-led steel maker earlier the month to the Steel Ministry which has forwarded to Environment and Forest counterpart for its approval, sources in the know said.
The capacity addition plan is in line with JSW Steel’s overall target of achieving a portfolio of 40 mtpa by 2025 which in turn would help the steel maker to retain its market share of 13-14 per cent.
JSW Steel has 14.3 mtpa installed capacity spread across Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. In July this year, company Chairman Sajjan Jindal had announced plans to increase the overall steel capacity to 40 mtpa by 2025, which will entail a capital outlay in the range of $ 22 billion.
M V S Seshagiri Rao, JSW Steel’s Joint Managing Director and Group Chief Financial Officer, could not be reached for comments immediately.
The capacity raising plan of the company is in sync with government’s plan of more than trebling country’s steel making capacity to 300 mtpa by 2025 requiring a whopping $ 200 billion investment over the next decade.
It generally takes $ 1 billion investment to create a one million tonne steel capacity. Going by the industry thumb rule, JSW Steel may have to invest $ 6 billion or roughly about Rs 36,000 crore to crate the additional capacity.
However, since the expansion would be brownfield in nature, it might require less for the company, but not less than Rs 30,000 crore, an industry source said.
With the objective of touching 40 mtpa in next decade, it is expanding capacities at its existing sites and setting up plants in new locations.
“On the anvil are two 10 million tonne greenfield facilities in West Bengal and Jharkhand,” it said in its website.
The company was the largest exporter in the country during the April-September period of the current fiscal, contributing 61 per cent of the total shipments.

Tripura Congress file PIL over multi-crore RD block scam  demands CBIprobePrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:32 pm
The opposition Congress on Monday filed a PIL in the Tripura High Court demanding a CBI probe into the multi-crore Bishalgarh RD block scam unearthed by an internal audit of the state government.
Congress spokesperson Dr Ashok Sinha, the petitioner, said the PIL was filed because “the state police is unlikely to conduct an impartial probe into the scam,” in relation to which one official has been suspended and an FIR lodged against 11 others by incumbent Block Development Officer Subrata Das.
The Bishalgarh RD block financial scam has become a major political issue with the opposition parties attacking the Left Front government, which has been in power for more than two decades, over several financial irregularities that has surfaced over the past few months.
Another scam involving the apparent misappropriation of almost Rs 25 crores of NRHM funds over eight years has also resulted in the sacking of at least one official and an investigation by higher officials instituted.
The main accused in the RD block scam, Bimal Chakraborty, has been arrested and is currently in police custody. He was Deputy Director of the state’s Information and Cultural Affairs Department before he was suspended, and was formerly the BDO at Bishalgarh, West Tripura.

Centre to name only those having prosecutable evidence : Arun Jaitley on blackmoneyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:18 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:27 pm
The Central Government will make public names of only those people against whom there is a prosecutable case in connection with tax evasion through offshore accounts, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday, amid the Congress asking for disclosure of all names of black money holders.
“We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence,” he told reporters.
READ: Black money case: Centre names three account holders
His remark comes hours after the government disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and a Goa miner against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under the scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal”.
Earlier, Congress leader Digvijay Singh attacked Jaitley for his comments that Congress would be embarrassed when all names of those who stashed money abroad were made public.
Terming Jaitley’s remarks as “mischievous”, Singh said: “If he (Jaitley) has guts, he should reveal those names.” He said if any Congress member is found to have stashed money abroad illegally, the party would “punish” the person.
READ: Swiss govt willing to disclose info on black money: Centre to SC
Another Congress leader and a former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said the party has no problem if all names are put out in public domain.
Jaitley had earlier said the government would not be pushed into an act of adventurism and jeopardise the chances of getting cooperation of other countries in future.
The NDA government’s approach on black money, he had asserted, “is doggedly persistent, not adventurist.”
He had also blamed the agreement entered into by the Congress government with Germany in 1995 as a constraining factor in disclosing details of black money stashed abroad.
In the run-up to Parliamentary polls, BJP had promised to bring back black money kept by Indians in overseas banks while targeting the UPA government for not taking effective action on the issue.

Imposition of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centres involvement in theissuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Maoists apologise for killing of unarmed  unwellcopPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:41 pm
The CPI (Maoist) has apologized for the killing of an unarmed Chhattisgarh constable in Sukma district earlier this month. Shiv Kumar Sidar was  unwell and travelling in a passenger bus from his camp in Chintalnar to a health centre when the Maoists forcibly halted the bus and killed Sidar.
“Our guerrillas killed a policeman but this happened without the permission of our party. We seek an apology (for the act). Shiv Kumar Sidar was going for the treatment of his illness. He was not carrying arms for people’s exploitation. In such circumstances, we consider it wrong that he was nabbed and killed,” said a statement released on Monday by the South Regional Divisional Committee of CPI (Maoist).
The statement added that “our stand towards the police remain the same what we had earlier said. Hum bina target wale police ko nahi marenge.(We will not kill police without target).”  The apology also urged the security forces to stop harassing and torturing innocent villagers.
This statement marks yet another apology from the rebels for their actions in the last 18 months. They apologized for the killings of two Bastar journalists last year. This April, they issued a “public apology” within 48 hours after blasting an ambulance and a minibus in Bastar that killed 14 persons, including five teachers and two men on medical duty, and expressed “extreme empathy” for the families of the deceased and the injured.
Last October, Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee Secretary Ramanna had also noted that the killings of PCC Chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel in Darbha was a mistake.

BJP to launch mobile  online membership drive on Nov 1Print
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:10 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the first BJP leader to have his party membership renewed through a mobile text message, a first of its kind of measure introduced by the organisation, as it launches its membership drive from November 1.
Party General Secretary J P Nadda said BJP aims to “break all records” in enrolling new members in the six-month long drive as the party seeks to strengthen its base following its unprecedented victories in Lok Sabha elections as well as recent Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana.
For the first time, BJP has introduced the use of mobile and internet for people to become a party member. Anybody interested will have to call a mobile number, which would be disclosed on November 1, to start membership process, he said while addressing a press conference here.
“The emphasis would be on mobile and internet…Party President Amit Shah will make Prime Minister Modi the first member through SMS and Modi will make Shah the second member by similar method at the party headquarters on November 1,” Nadda said.
The party generally seeks to increase its members by 20 per cent during the drive, which is launched every sixth year, but this time it will work to break all previous records, Nadda said.
The party presently has 3.25 crore members, though not all of them are active workers.
The drive, however, will not be launched in poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, where it will begin only after the Assembly elections.
Enthused by the “connect” of its catchy slogans with masses during Lok Sabha elections, BJP has come out with new ones for the membership drive which include ‘sashakt Bhajpa, sashakt Bharat (strong BJP, strong India)’ and ‘saath aayein, desh banayein (come together, build the country)’.
BJP will hold three workshops in Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata on October 29, 30 and 31 and similar exercises would be held at the state-level as well, Nadda said.
While Bangalore would cater to south and west Indian states besides the UTs, Delhi would host central India states and Kolkata the eastern states. States will start membership drive from November 2.

McDonald s Happy Meals problem6
It's not an insurmountable problem in that the company had $35.8 billion in systemwide U.S. sales in 2013, according to QSRMagazine.com. Sales could slide an awfully long way over an awfully long time before anyone overtakes it. The next closest chain was Subway, with $12.7 billion in 2013.
In fact, you can combine the 2013 U.S. sales of Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Chick-Fil-A, KFC and Five Guys, and McDonald's still comes out almost $200 million ahead.
Which bring us to lunchtime with the girl, 8. We had an hour between gymnastics classes. We were a block from McDonald's.
"I only want to go there if they have a prize I want," she said.
They didn't.
Later, over quesadillas at Chipotle, she suggested McDonald's could win her affection with a full-size American Girl doll in its Happy Meals. "But," she said, thinking about it for a moment, "that Happy Meal would probably cost $100."
If an 8-year-old feels that way about Happy Meals and Mighty Meals, what about the grown-ups taking them out to eat? And what happens when those 8-year-olds become 18?
"More choices, sophistication and better quality are driving kids' attitudes away from McDonald's and toward these other restaurants," Tristano said. "When kids get into that 8-to-12 range, before they become tweens even, they not only want something different, they want something better. What's changed is the fast-casual industry — like Chipotle and Panera — all these offering other choices and higher quality."
McDonald's has said it understands that millennials, like all of its customers, "share a desire for fresh, quality ingredients," and it's looking to expand its offerings to meet that demand. It's also trying to tap into digital marketing and mobile ordering platforms.
But the lesson about the Happy Meal is it has to be about the food, not the geegaws and gimmicks. As the Beatles, absent parents and spurned self-financed politicians all will tell you, real loyalty is earned not bought.
"Trying to change who you are, which we all know as individuals, is very difficult," Tristano said. "This is a big train that needs to slow down and stop before it changes direction. … The next generation may be the one that they're going to get to return to McDonald's, and that could start with the kids' meals."
Keeping eyes on the prize for McDonald's means keeping the focus on the food.

All The Wealth The Middle Class Accumulated After 1940 Is Gonereddit
Here's more proof the middle class is dying.
The middle-class share of American wealth has been shrinking for the better part of three decades and recently fell to its lowest level since 1940, according to a new study by economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics.
In other words, remember the surge of the great American middle class after World War II? That's all gone, at least by one measure.
In this case, "middle class" is defined rather expansively as the bottom 90 percent of all Americans. "Wealth" is the total of home equity, stock and bond holdings, pension plans and other assets, minus debt. As such assets are mostly owned by mid- to higher-income households -- and considering most Americans define themselves as "middle-class" -- it seems reasonable to use the bottom 90 percent as a proxy for the "middle class."
Saez and Zucman discussed their paper in a blog post for the Washington Center For Equitable Growth on Monday that included this stark chart:
Debt has been the big force driving net wealth lower for the middle class, according to Saez and Zucman. Brief bubbles in stock and home prices in the 1990s and 2000s only temporarily offset the steady, depressing rise in mortgage, student-loan, credit-card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent.
"Many middle class families own homes and have pensions, but too many of these families also have much higher mortgages to repay and much higher consumer credit and student loans to service than before," Saez and Zucman wrote.
Another important factor has been that incomes have stagnated for most Americans over the past few decades, once adjusted for inflation. Along with rising debt levels, stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money.
And who has been the beneficiary of this middle-class misery? The top 0.1 percent of Americans, whose incomes have just kept rising, and whose share of wealth has soared to levels not seen since Jay Gatsby was still staring at the blinking green light at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock:
In fact, the middle class is not alone in suffering from shrinking wealth. The rest of the top 10 percent of Americans below the 0.1 percent -- the "merely rich," Saez and Zucman call them -- have also suffered from falling household wealth over the past four decades.
This rising inequality of wealth can only lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future, Saez and Zucman warned, echoing French economist Thomas Piketty. The very rich will just keep getting richer by living on the returns from their wealth, while the rest of us will keep falling behind.

Uber for Kids: Shuddle Wants to Shuttle Your ChildrenEmail
Little Suzy has soccer practice. Timmy needs to get to his recital. You have an important meeting. Don't worry, a new startup says it has you covered.
It's called  Shuddle . It was founded by Nick Allen, one of the guys behind Sidecar, a ride-sharing service like Uber and Lyft that connects drivers with passengers through a smartphone app. This service, however, is meant for (although not necessarily limited to) children. 
Shuddle
"The foundation of this whole thing is trust," he told TODAY. "When you create an account, you actually get a phone call from us welcoming you. We are there to answer any questions you might have, and parents have a lot of them."
Obviously, the idea of entrusting a child to an unknown driver will give some parents pause. That is why Shuddle only hires drivers with two references confirming that they have experience working with children. They also have to pass national and local background checks, a vehicle inspection, and a face-to-face interview and training process. 
After that, ordering a car from Shuddle works like this:
Parents download the app and sign up for a Shuddle Pass membership, which costs $9 a month, plus fares for each ride. 
Rides can be scheduled anywhere from a day to a week in advance through the app. 
The driver arrives and answers a secret word chosen by the family to confirm their identity as a Shuddle driver.
Parents can watch the progress of their kids in real time on their phones. 
Once the ride is over, parents get a message from Shuddle telling them their kids have reached their destination. 
Right now, the service is only available in San Francisco, but Allen plans to expand in the future. He originally got the idea watching parents order Uber cars for their kids. Companies like Uber and Lyft, he said, don't have the insurance to cover passengers under the age of 18.  Shuddle does. 
He is also using the family-focused service to attract female drivers who might not be comfortable driving drunken guys home from a bar at 2 a.m.
"Most of our drivers are nannies, teachers and child-care providers," he said. "Our value proposition to them is, 'Hey, our customers are all families, these rides are happening during the day and you can schedule them ahead of time,' and that really resonates with women."
In fact, right now all of Shuddle's drivers are women. The company is accepting new members slowly to make sure it can recruit enough drivers to offer families rides whenever they need one.
It certainly sounds convenient. But would you put your kid in a Shuddle car? Tell us what you think!

There s Now a Host of Ambitious Terminology for Women in the Workplace -- Are Men Feeling Left Outreddit
Every study indicates Millennial males are an evolved model of masculinity: kinder, more accepting, not intimidated by dirty diapers, comfortable sharing power with a new generation of high-achieving females.
But how well do we really know them -- particularly in the workplace? The new generation of women at work has been peeled, prodded and parsed from every angle -- their education, their numbers, their issues, their needs, their frustrations. But you would be hard-pressed to find one illuminating equivalent study on the male side of the gender divide.
The lexicon of women and work is crowded with terms like "queen bee," "glass ceiling," "burnout," "have it all," "mommy track," "on ramps," and "lean in." Name one for young men.
There are some indications that the adjustment isn't as smooth as the assumptions of an evolved male might indicate. Pew research finds that young women are, for the first time, surpassing young men in career ambition: 67 percent of women put career success high on their list of life's goals, versus 60 percent for males. It's a statistically significant difference, and an even more significant shift from decades past -- when the majority of women were just happy to be in the game.
All such surveys run into the same question: is the rebalancing -- in this case, of career expectations -- a matter of males trending down, or females catching up? Are the genders working their way toward equilibrium, or are we seeing the start of long-term trends?
Either way, for men born after 1980, theirs is a generation of adjustment. They have seen a rebuilding of architectures of support in everything from girl's sports to female-only scholarships to the broad encouragement for females to break down barriers. All of that, of course, reflects the maturation of a better, fairer society -- where ability has blown large holes in the former battlements of privilege.
In a Shriver Report article "Has a Man's World become a Woman's Nation?" sociologist Michael Kimmel, a leading researcher and author on men and masculinity, sees distinct male reactions to the new power-sharing.
Some see the rise in female power as an "invasion." They are in a fighting mood, determined to recapture lost territory. Others, he argues, are largely indifferent to economic and other measures of female progress. For these "masculinists," it's about retrieving an "inner sense of their own masculinity." Many, he says, find it in men's empowerment groups or in the reaches of cyberspace.
It's likely that most male Millennials in the workforce fall into Kimmel's third category. They fall somewhere between "eager embrace and resigned acceptance." They think it's right. They think it's fair. But they are largely along for a "rather apolitical ride." Their support is rooted in the reality of change.
Adapting to what's right and inevitable means getting past what many see as a continuation of the unequal support this generation has experienced since childhood. Roughly 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have organized and funded women's-affinity groups. The number of men's-affinity groups are a handful and largely informal. Companies talk openly about their commitment to hire more women and put them on special development tracks. Men in many organizations see flextime, job sharing, and extended maternity leave largely as gains for females.
It's a fair point that, by numbers and culture, entire organizations can be called a male-affinity group. But for male Millennials, that is a situation not of their making. It would be understandable that they look at these special support programs and see an unfair advantage to those competing for the same promotions.
Since there is so little about male Millennial opinion, I asked a number of young male managers their thoughts on the fairness of the new corporate rule book. These conversations -- though well short of a representative sampling -- found both support and questions.
Said one: "When you think about it, we all grew up at a time when women were getting extra support. It's just been part of our lives. But I think most men will tell you that it makes no sense that 90 percent of a school's athletic budget goes to boy's sports. Or that a woman qualified for a job gets moved aside because she's a woman.
"On the other hand," he quickly added, "let me tell you what I just experienced. A number of us applied for an open position. It went to a woman who was in the Women's Leadership Group. The supervisor for that position is the sponsor of the group. "You look at that, and you wonder. Is she the best candidate? Quite possibly. Did being a woman and a member of the leadership group give her just enough of an edge to get the job? How can you rule that out?"
Another had a different view. "It's not like they suddenly imported a whole new category of people to compete for a finite number of jobs. The talented competition has always been there. It's just that, now, a lot of that competition is female. I see some extra support. But I don't see outright bias. I don't believe things like women's groups and mentoring are discrimination--certainly not the kind that used to block the way for women."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that just over half of "management, professional and related occupation" positions are now held by women. Smart employers who want to find and develop the best talent regardless of gender should make sure they equally tuned in to the hopes and needs of the other half. Listen carefully. They tend to be quiet.

3 Lessons on Financial Inclusion and the Sharing Economyreddit
Why is it that despite new technologies and widespread innovation, today's financial sector provides such ill-fitting products and services to so many people and leaves so many more entirely unserved? We are missing a huge opportunity for business, policy and society alike - a missed opportunity with lasting negative effects.
For an economy to thrive, we must have appropriate, affordable financial services available to a majority of people and organizations operating in it. In other words, we need financial inclusion. Historically, however, many financial services have been available only to wealthy and better-off individuals, leaving many disadvantaged and low-income people "unbanked."
Setting the economic stage: from microfinance to macro effects
Since the late 1990s, microfinance has become a major tool for financial inclusion. Microfinance is the provision of small (micro) loans and savings products for people living at the base of the economic pyramid (BOP). It has historical links to rotating savings and credit associations (or ROSCAs) that operate like community lending circles. Microfinance clients are often called microentrepreneurs; classic microfinance is focused on the provision of working capital loans - funding to build and grow small enterprises.
Modern microfinance is typically traced back to the 1970s when Mohammed Yunus began experimenting with making small loans to groups of poor women in Bangladesh. Today microfinance is credited with lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty around the world. Collectively, microentrepreneurs represent a formidable force in the global economy.
Yunus' original work was primarily grant-driven: it did not involve commercial capital. However, as the concept caught on - and especially, as repayment rates remained close to 100% over time - investors began to take notice, with mostly great and sometimes negative effects.
The advent of "commercial" microfinance dates to the early 2000s (for context, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006). I was fortunate to be at the proverbial fifty-yard line of microfinance at this time, advising investors, foundations and microfinance institutions (MFIs) around the world. One of my clients was Kiva , which at the time was tiny and less than one year old - ahead of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms like Lending Club, or crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. Kiva today is on track to facilitate (cumulatively) more than $1 billion in loans to microentrepreneurs around the world. In places like Congo, Kiva is the largest private lender in the country.
Microfinance works because it is built on a premise of trust and reputational capital, and it meets the needs of people left out of the current system. It enables poor microentrepreneurs to disintermediate loan sharks and, usually, save money for the very first time. This money can help put children in school, provide a buffer for emergencies, and increase resilience overall. The social returns of microfinance are enormous. In addition, at the societal level microfinance proves that being poor does not mean greater risk; it forces us to rethink what, why and in whom we invest.
Microentrepreneurship, take 1 (courtesy Kiva)
At the same time, microfinance is not a panacea. We saw that, especially with the entry of venture capital and private equity investors, many MFIs were forced to compromise their core social mission, some markets got saturated, with borrowers taking loans that no socially responsible lender would have ever offered. Often, investors' demands were prioritized over microentrepreneurs' needs. In a few cases, the results were disastrous: MFI client suicides, massive non-repayment, and MFIs going out of business.
In hindsight, during this era we learned the power of commercial capital to help an innovative tool grow and scale. There is no question that without commercial investment, microfinance would not have reached as many people successfully - with overall repayment rates still near 100% - as it did. However, we also learned that funding without a social mission as its unequivocal top priority can be toxic, and that MFIs who do not look at clients' overall needs (including financial literacy) are much more likely to fail.
Microentrepreneurs: from Bangladesh to Brooklyn, Berlin and beyond
Fast forward to today's blossoming sharing economy, with new business models based on "access over ownership" and underutilized assets. We're building community marketplaces in unparalleled ways: from carsharing and ridesharing, to sharing all kinds of skills and spaces. Many of these models rely essentially on new technologies: in effect, we're building online platforms to enable sharing in the offline world.
In the process, an entirely new class of microentrepreneurs is emerging. It includes Airbnb hosts, Lyft drivers, TaskRabbit taskers, Skillshare teachers, Park My Pooch dogsitters, Shyp pick-up people, AnyRoad tour guides, RelayRides car owners and many others. They are earning income, saving money, building livelihoods, engaging in their communities, and sometimes just squeaking by thanks to these platforms. Sharing economy marketplace dynamics are also driven by trust and social capital, reaffirming the conclusion that one's reputation matters more than bank account balance.
The degree to which the term microentrepreneurs is being used today is unexpected, but perhaps not surprising: according to the Freelancers Union, Intuit and other sources, it is estimated that by 2020, more than 40% of the U.S. workforce will be "freelance" - not connected to any one company or organization. So this is not just a sharing economy issue, this is a major economic trend underway.
Some companies, such as the ridesharing platform Lyft , are actively seeking to engage with a broader community. Lyft not only enables its drivers (many of whom were previously underemployed) to earn income, but also it seeks to expand its offerings to lower-income areas through its Community Solutions initiative. However, neither Lyft nor other sharing economy platforms are able to provide financial services. We have yet to effectively fill this gap.
Today's microentrepreneurs (courtesy Lyft)
Etsy , a P2P platform for creative goods, shows how these issues and trends play out. Although Etsy is distinct from sharing economy companies (because it does not focus on sharing of underutilized assets), its more than one million sellers around the world are a prime case of microentrepreneurship - and the issues around financial inclusion.
The majority of Etsy sellers lack access to financial services to grow their businesses. Interestingly, Etsy sellers rarely need investment capital. They don't want to grow "big"; they appreciate the P2P nature of the business because it allows them flexibility and to do what they love. In the aggregate, this is as if a leading global corporation (or an entire country) lacks the financial tools to thrive. And ironically, typical responses such as providing access to Small Business Association (SBA) capital aren't appropriate. We need to think differently.
Companies like Etsy, and the broader sharing economy, represent an economic bridge: they have the capacity to help smooth the transition from old to new ways of economic thinking, working, caring for our families and connecting with community. The sharing economy will not solve today's global economic woes, no more than microfinance can (not) single-handedly solve global poverty alleviation. But it is a powerful and helpful option to have that did not exist before, and should be promoted as such.
Three lessons (and three services) for today
Today's microentrepreneurs - and society at large - can learn a lot from past experience with financial inclusion. There are three key lessons:
Microentrepreneurs in the sharing economy are ill served by financial services.
Meanwhile, many people who could benefit by participating in the sharing economy are left out of it, because they lack access to appropriate financial tools.
Points 1 and 2 represent huge opportunities for financial institutions and entrepreneurs alike, on both macro and micro levels. (And I often feel like I am watching a movie on repeat, with a deep sense of déjà vu.)
Kiva was in many ways the pioneer of today's crowdfunding and P2P lending phenomena. It bridged the proof of concept that Yunus had established (building trust, reputation and social capital) with new technologies that enabled access to finance in new ways (e.g. online lending platforms and mobile banking).
Unfortunately, thus far the "innovation" we have seen by traditional players has been limited to traditional clients (such as the Barclaycard, which allows well-off customers to donate profits but doesn't actually serve low-income clients directly).
In particular, the following are services that are ripe for development - their market is already primed:
Income tracking, saving and investment services for microentrepreneurs
Financial literacy tools: a fundamental building block, which also increases the return for all other transactions and services provided
Simple credit card access: many sharing economy platforms require a credit card to participate, leaving out many people who could benefit - and thwarting inclusion
The economy, jobs, livelihoods and the role of finance are all undergoing significant shifts. The rise of microentrepreneurship, at scale, represents a new economic force. In order to unlock its full potential, we must develop services to address new needs. In doing so, we may also find a key to success amidst these shifts - and a world of new opportunity.

Amazon.com Inc. Jeff Bezos Consumer Goods Industries House of Cards (tv program)
SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's once fairy-tale ride on Wall Street has hit its most jarring bump yet.
The company that for years enthralled investors with improbable growth and earned one of the technology sector's highest valuations drew widespread ire after a spectacular results letdown on Thursday.
Amazon missed expectations across the board - on margins, on its net loss and on revenue. An unaccountably poor 7 to 18 percent revenue growth forecast for the typically strongest holiday quarter was the final straw for some.
Coming just three months after a big letdown in July, the warning may represent a tipping point for investors who are already wary of a triple-digit price-earnings ratio and a persistent unwillingness to throttle back spending.
Investors are losing patience with Jeff Bezos’ game. Amazon stock swooned Thursday and it’s diving deeper today after the company reported weak earnings and predicted a dismal holiday season. ( Russ Mitchell )
"They're becoming much too distracted in all these other efforts" outside core businesses like online retailing and web services, said Matthew Benkendorf, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. Benkendorf unloaded his Amazon holdings a year ago and said he would be skeptical of future involvement even if the stock falls further.
"They are their own worst enemy to success," he said. "They really need to do some soul searching and get focused."
After some rough patches following the dotcom boom, CEO Jeff Bezos for years weaved a spell over Wall Street, riding a track record for upending the retail industry with Amazon's low-cost, speedy-delivery model. But Bezos has increasingly sought leading positions in Internet computing, digital media, and on-demand services.
8
Investors have given Bezos a lot of leeway based on past success, including the introduction of Amazon Web Services. The cloud-hosting and computing service started out as a low-cost option for cash-strapped startups but now vies successfully with IBM on government and corporate IT contracts.
But the company is entering a phase when many investors are expecting to see profit improvements, said Andrew Cupps, president of Cupps Capital Management in Chicago. Cupps now owns about 20,000 Amazon shares, down from around 30,000 earlier this year.
Amazon shares fell 8.3 percent on Friday to a year's low of $287.06, wiping out more than $12 billion in value.
Including Friday's plunge, Amazon's stock is down by nearly a third since January. Investors had begun questioning Bezos' growing spending on perceived side-projects since his company missed second-quarter profit targets.
Such long-term endeavors included Hollywood-style content and mobile devices to compete with Apple Inc and Google Inc . But while Amazon's original drama series "Transparent" has won rave reviews, the jury is still out on whether the company can consistently deliver Netflix-style hits like "House of Cards." Meanwhile, its "Fire" smartphone project appears in trouble. The company took a $170 million writedown in the third quarter, largely because of unsold phones. And last month, it slashed the phone's price (with a two-year AT&T contract) to 99 cents from $199.
That's why brokerage analysts previously enamored of Amazon's prospects struck a pessimistic note. At least 20 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock on Friday.
cComments
Amazon has built it's business on the backs of it's suppliers, who bear the cost of the absurdly generous return policy without any benefit. People think that you can order 10 pairs of shoes, have them sent to you and send back 9 that you don't want. Somehow they think this is...

"Even if Bezos is unconcerned about institutional investors' near term, he needs to care how the stock impacts his ability to attract and retain talent, particularly given the broadening tech expertise he needs," said Macquarie's Ben Schacter. "If the stock continues to get hit, we could even end up in a situation with activists calling for significant changes."
SICK OF IT
To be sure, short interest in Amazon remains low compared with most companies, suggesting that few investors deem the company to be in trouble. But it has increased over the past six months. About a year ago, 0.3 percent of the shares available for short bets were being used for such activity.
That's increased to about 1.6 percent as of Thursday, according to Markit, which tracks share lending.
And despite Friday's steep target-price cuts, no brokerage yet has a sell rating on the stock. Of the 44 analysts covering Amazon, 28 have a 'buy' or higher rating on the stock, though that's down from 32 three months ago.
Some still give Bezos the benefit of the doubt.
"I get it that people are frustrated that they've done a lot of different things that haven't helped them that much," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which will hold onto Amazon for now. "We'll hang in there a little longer to see if this thing will come to fruition for them."
Others have begun to waver. During Thursday's earnings call, analysts pressed Amazon on when it would see a payoff from heavy investments in China, devices and other areas. Wolfe Research analyst Aram Rubinson asked what metrics Amazon tracks "because it's a little hard to see any of it making positive progress."
"We are at the point where they're getting sick of it," said John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, who has been shorting Amazon for about two years. He took issue in particular with executives' assertions that they rely on cash flows as one of their prime performance metrics.
"They're using a cash conversion cycle – meaning, they take your money in today when you buy something, but they don't pay their supplier for 75 days. That is what creates cash flow and that's what everyone on the Street looks at," he said. "That's an entirely fallacious way of valuing a company."
"If Amazon were to exit China and use the savings to buy back stock, we could easily get far more optimistic," Rubinson said in a separate note. "But we are not holding our breath."

Black money case: Centre reveals names of three account holdersBlack money case: Centre discloses 8 more names to Supreme Court
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
The Centre today disclosed before the Supreme Court eight more names, including that of Pradip Burman, one of Dabur India promoters, a bullion trader and Goa-based mining company, against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Pvt Ltd and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the Government.
The affidavit, filed days after the government came under attack from political rivals that it was chary of revealing names, said that these names have been received from French authorities and other countries.
Promising to disclose more names of black money holders who have come under its scanner, the government said that all foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as “illegal“.
The additional affidavit on the black money issue was filed today in furtherance of its affidavit recently when it had said that the names of account holders in foreign banks cannot be disclosed till there is evidence of tax evasion against them and prosecution is launched in India.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries''.
The list names Timblo Pvt Ltd and its directors Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. It was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its directors.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family Burmans said that the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson said in a statement.
“We have followed all the laws and the complete details regarding the account have been voluntarily, and as per law, filed with the Income-Tax Department, and appropriate taxes paid, wherever applicable,” he added.
Lodhiya denied having a Swiss bank account. “We have already declared in the income-tax and there is nothing...we don’t have any Swiss account that is the only thing which I can say,” he said.
Radha Timbo declined to comment on her name being mentioned in the affidavit, saying she has to first study it before commenting.

Restrain from making provocative comments: Panel to KCRRestrain from making provocative comments: Panel to KCR
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 27:  
A three-member panel constituted by Press Council of India has recommended that Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao be directed to restrain himself from making provocative statements against journalists.
The committee comprising journalists Rajeev Ranjan Nag, K Amarnath and Krishna Prasad was constituted by PCI Chairperson Justice (retd) Markandey Katju to probe threats to the media in Telangana after certain remarks reportedly made by Rao were brought to the Council’s notice.
While listing its findings, the panel noted that “the Chief Minister of Telangana did make the statements attributed to him from a public platform that he would break the necks and bury media persons and that they should salute the Telangana people if they wish to live in Telangana.”
The Committee said that by making these statements from a public platform, the Telangana Chief Minister had violated the letter and spirit of Article 19 (1)(a)(e)and(g) which pertain to freedom of speech and expression, freedom to reside and settle in any part of India and practise any profession.
The Committee recommended that PCI and Central Government should impress upon Rao that “blatant threats to the media and media personnel violates the oath of office he took to protect and defend the Constitution of India and follow the rule of law.”
“The Chief Minister of Telangana should be directed to restrain himself from making provocative statements against journalists or in saluting and supporting organizations which seek to limit the flow of information to the people, on the basis of nativity or domicile status,” the panel recommended in its report.
The report of the three-member committee was placed before the Press Council today and adopted, sources said.
The committee report also stated that Telangana Government should be directed to take immediate action to create conditions and atmosphere where free and fair journalism can be practiced by print and electronic media without fear of retribution by the state or the “sword of business terrorism” by non-state actors.
It sought that all cases registered against journalists for participating in protest actions should be withdrawn or fast tracked.
Prompt action should be taken against the police official responsible for attacking journalists and roughing up women journalists at Hyderabad and Warangal, the committee recommended.
The photographers and videographers whose equipment was damaged during the police action should be compensated, it said. The State should not discriminate against the journalists on the grounds of their nativity, it added.
The committee has recommended that the state government should immediately take steps to enable MSOs to withdraw their blackout of channels TV 9 and ABN Andhra Jyothy in the interest of freedom of media and people’s right to know, as enshrined in the Constitution.
It also recommended that print and electronic media organisations must put in place sterner mechanisms for greater editorial scrutiny of public interest journalism.
The Committee, in its report stated that it sought appointments with Telangana Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police to elicit their views on the points of reference made to the committee.
They (Committee) waited on both days for the confirmation of appointments but to no avail, the report said.

Mumbai, Oct 27:  
Gold prices dropped sharply at the domestic bullion market on the back of heavy unwinding by stockists and investors amid sluggish demand outlook.
Silver also plummeted owing to massive speculative sell—off, coupled with subdued industrial offtake.
The overall trading sentiment turned highly volatile as traders are very cautious and avoiding any long positions at this juncture due to ongoing uncertainty in global markets over the interest rates hike sooner than previously expected, a bullion dealer commented.
It is widely expected that the US Federal Reserve is going to announce the end of quantitative easing — a massive stimulus program introduced aftermath of the financial crisis when the Federal Open Market Committee concludes a two—day meeting on Wednesday.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) slumped by Rs 260 to conclude at Rs 27,055 per 10 grams from last Wednesday’s closing level of Rs 27,315.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) shed by Rs 255 to end at Rs 27,205 per 10 grams against Rs 27,460.
Silver (.999 fineness) tanked by Rs 460 to finish at Rs 39,015 per kg compared to Rs 39,475 previously.

BJP to launch mobile  online membership drive on Nov1Print
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:10 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the first BJP leader to have his party membership renewed through a mobile text message, a first of its kind of measure introduced by the organisation, as it launches its membership drive from November 1.
Party General Secretary J P Nadda said BJP aims to “break all records” in enrolling new members in the six-month long drive as the party seeks to strengthen its base following its unprecedented victories in Lok Sabha elections as well as recent Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana.
For the first time, BJP has introduced the use of mobile and internet for people to become a party member. Anybody interested will have to call a mobile number, which would be disclosed on November 1, to start membership process, he said while addressing a press conference here.
“The emphasis would be on mobile and internet…Party President Amit Shah will make Prime Minister Modi the first member through SMS and Modi will make Shah the second member by similar method at the party headquarters on November 1,” Nadda said.
The party generally seeks to increase its members by 20 per cent during the drive, which is launched every sixth year, but this time it will work to break all previous records, Nadda said.
The party presently has 3.25 crore members, though not all of them are active workers.
The drive, however, will not be launched in poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, where it will begin only after the Assembly elections.
Enthused by the “connect” of its catchy slogans with masses during Lok Sabha elections, BJP has come out with new ones for the membership drive which include ‘sashakt Bhajpa, sashakt Bharat (strong BJP, strong India)’ and ‘saath aayein, desh banayein (come together, build the country)’.
BJP will hold three workshops in Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata on October 29, 30 and 31 and similar exercises would be held at the state-level as well, Nadda said.
While Bangalore would cater to south and west Indian states besides the UTs, Delhi would host central India states and Kolkata the eastern states. States will start membership drive from November 2.

New Zicom CCTV kit allows surveillance fromsmartphonesUsers can access the CCTV footage from almost any computer connected to the Internet and even from smartphones.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:41 pm
Zicom has launched its new CCTV Surveillance Kit that allow users to monitor their home or business premises from their smartphones. Priced at Rs 14,300, this surveillance kit comes with two IR dome cameras (720 TVL), one digital video recorder (4 Channel DVR), three power adapters, one remote control to use with the DVR and four BNC connectors.
All cameras are equipped with infrared Array LED (IR) sensors which gets activate automatically in low-light or no-light situations to allow you to see up to 30 meters (95 feet) away and deactivate once lighting conditions are brighter to allow.
The digital video recorder uses H.264 compression to record video simultaneously from all cameras. Two more cameras can be added to this kit at a later stage, should the need arise.
Users can access the CCTV footage from almost any computer connected to the Internet and even from smartphones. Zicom claims that the kit can be easily installed without any expert help.

Indian startup aims to sell portable washing machines at Rs1 500Venus mini portable washing machine can be mounted on any plastic bucket to wash all types of laundry.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:35 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 8:39 pm
A Mumbai-based startup is looking forward to manufacture a washing machine for people who cannot afford to buy a regular washing machine or do not have enough space in their house. This pocket-friendly machine is obviously not like any other regular machine washing. It appears like a big electronic hand blender which can be mounted on any plastic bucket to wash all types of laundry.
“The simplicity of design will enable us to make this machine at a very low price – if mass manufactured. Making this device available in the market for an affordable price for the poor families in the third world will help millions of women who presently are forced to wash clothes by hand,” said Piyush Agarwalla, founder of Vimbas Navrachna, the group which is manufacturing Venus mini portable washing machine.
The project went live on crowd funding website Indiegogo on October 13. The Vimbas Navrachna team has to generate US$ 50,000 by December 12 to start the mass production of Venus. “Our aim is sell the Venus machine for Rs 1,500 or less if possible. Every contribution will help bring us closer to realizing our dream of mass manufacturing this device and selling at an affordable price,” said Agarwalla.
With a plastic bucket of 25 litres capacity (minimum 20 litres bucket), users can wash up to 2.5 kilograms of load per five minutes wash cycle. The Venus can be useful for people living alone like students, bachelors, working men & women, according to the project’s Indiegogo page .
The team even has plans to manufacture a direct current (DC) version of the Venus if they exceed the funding goal. The DC version can be operated with the help of batteries making it ideal for campers.

The wife of senior Congress leader Amarinder Singh, Ms. Kaur said she had always replied in the negative to inquiries in this regard in the past as well.
Former UPA Minister Preneet Kaur on Monday said she had received an Income-Tax Department notice in 2011 regarding purported existence of a foreign bank account in her name.
“In this regard, I can confirm receiving such a notice in 2011, and having replied to it wherein I have strongly denied any such allegations. In keeping with my reply to the I-T Department, I would like to state that I never had, and do not have, any bank account (s) overseas in my name with any foreign bank,” said Ms. Kaur in a statement.
The wife of senior Congress leader Amarinder Singh, Ms. Kaur said she had always replied in the negative to such inquiries in the past as well.
Ms. Kaur’s response came amid unconfirmed reports that three other Congress leaders, two from a prominent family in Maharashtra and one from Uttar Pradesh, were also under the I-T scanner.

Dozens of Nigerian girls abducted by BokoHaramhis Monday May. 12, 2014 file image taken from video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network, shows the alleged missing girls abducted from the northeastern town of Chibok. (Source: AP)
By: AP | Maiduguri | Posted: October 27, 2014 8:43 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 9:00 pm
Dozens of girls and young women are being abducted by Islamic extremists in northeast Nigeria, raising doubts about an announced cease-fire and the hoped-for release of 219 schoolgirls held captive since April.
Thirty teenage girls and boys have been kidnapped since Wednesday from villages around Mafa town, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, the local government chairman Shettima Maina told reporters.
Escaping residents said Boko Haram insurgents abducted 80 girls and women from neighboring Adamawa state on Oct. 18.
Older women in the group were released the following day and said the extremists kept about 40 younger women and girls, according to the residents. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the insurgents.
On Oct. 17, Nigeria’s military announced a cease-fire had been agreed with Boko Haram. He ordered his troops to immediately comply.
But the insurgents have launched several attacks since then and on Friday a multinational force including troops from Nigeria and Niger wrested back control of a town held by Boko Haram on the western shores of Lake Chad.
Witnesses and a security official said more than 20 insurgents were killed in fierce fighting at Abadam in which the Nigerian Air Force bombed occupied posts and ground troops opened fire after which the insurgents fled.
Boko Haram had hoisted their black and white flag in Abadam a week before, when they killed at least 40 civilians and forced hundreds in the farming community to flee across the border into Niger, according to some residents who escaped to Maiduguri, 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the east.
Also last week, a car bomb exploded in a bus station in Azare, a town in north-central Bauchi state. Five people were killed and 12 hospitalized with injuries, according to police spokesman Deputy Superintendent Haruna Muhammad. No one claimed responsibility but suspicion immediately fell on Boko Haram, which in December 2011 bombed Azare’s police station and several banks.
The continued fighting and abductions raise questions about the cease-fire. Ten days after the announcement, Boko Haram has yet to indicate that it has agreed to a truce.
Officials had said the cease-fire would lead to the speedy release of the 219 girls kidnapped from a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok on April 15.
Abducted girls are subjected to horrific treatment, Human Rights Watch said in a new report Monday, quoting escapees who described forced marriages and rapes, forced conversions to Islam, forced labor and forced participation in attacks.
The insurgents mainly target Christians and girls who go to school, said Human Rights Watch.
More than 500 girls and women have been kidnapped by Boko Haram since 2009, according to an estimate by the New York-based rights group. Unknown scores of young men also have been kidnapped and forced to join the extremists as continued…

V-shaped stock rebound catches bears offsidesV-shaped stock rebound catches bears off guard

The stock market’s sharp decline earlier this month was followed by a classic V-shaped rebound rally, catching many investors off guard. But can the rally last?
Last week, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rallied more than 4%, posting its best weekly gain of the year — and ending a four-week losing streak. In late-morning trading Monday the S&P 500 was down 7 points or 0.35%, to 1958.
But many investors did not expect the large-company stock index to bounce back that fast or that far, after tumbling more than 9% from its intraday high to its intraday low earlier this month amid fears of a global growth slowdown, Ebola and other market headwinds.
“If you blinked, you missed it,” is the way Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group described last week’s flash rally, which was powered by strong corporate earnings reports. Hickey’s firm supplied an intraday stock chart from Oct. 1 to Oct. 21 to show just how violent the S&P 500’s V-shaped upside reversal has been:
The S&P 500 has delivered a V-shaped recovery since its Oct. 15 intraday low. (Chart: Bespoke Investment Group)
The question now is: Can the rally last?
Citing historical data of how stocks have reacted after similar drops and sharp rebounds, the answer is there’s a good chance the rally could have legs, notes Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Lee’s research notes that the S&P 500’s current pullback from Sept. 19 to Oct. 15 was 9.8% from it intraday high to its intraday low. Following the past 49 times the S&P 500 has dipped at least 7% (but did not fall into a bear market, or a 20%-plus drop), more than half of the corrections ended after a decline of 10%. But he stresses that “markets either fall 10% or less or they continue to fall much deeper, or 20%-ish.” The fact this current pullback ended at less than 10% is a good sign, history suggests.
Historical performance data also supports the argument that stocks can rebound more than skeptics believe.
“The faster the decline, the faster the recovery,” Lee told clients in a report.
In terms of timing, Lee’s work shows that the market recovery normally takes 1.4 days for every day of a decline. So after a 10-day decline, markets normally get back to even 14 days later.
His work also shows that more than 50% of the time the S&P 500 tends to be 11% to 17% higher eight weeks after the correction bottoms.
“90% of bull market bottoms are V shaped,” Lee said.
In the chart below supplied by Fundstrat, you will notice that the median return eight weeks after a market bottom is 11%, but more often than not the gains are much larger.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is snuffing out smoking in its offices and buildings.
The nation's second-biggest tobacco company informed employees Wednesday that beginning next year, the use of traditional cigarettes, cigars or pipes will no longer be permitted at employee desks or offices, conference rooms, hallways and elevators. Lighting up already is prohibited on factory floors and in cafeterias and fitness centers.
The no-smoking policy will go into effect once Reynolds builds indoor smoking areas for those still wanting to light up indoors, spokesman David Howard said.
"We believe it's the right thing to do and the right time to do it because updating our tobacco use policies will better accommodate both non-smokers and smokers who work in and visit our facilities," Howard said. "We're just better aligning our tobacco use policies with the realities of what you're seeing in society today."
While Reynolds will no longer allow smoking, it will allow the use of smokeless tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, moist snuff and pouches of finely milled tobacco called snus (pronounced "snoose").
The company also will allow the use of Eclipse, a cigarette made by Reynolds that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit by a lighter. First released in the mid-1990s, Eclipse is in limited distribution and one of the top-selling brands in the cafeteria at the company's Winston-Salem, North Carolina, headquarters.
The percentage of Reynolds' 5,200 employees that smoke is in line with the smoking rate in the U.S. That is about 18 percent of adults, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
Through its subsidiaries, Reynolds American also makes Pall Mall cigarettes, Grizzly smokeless tobacco and Vuse-branded electronic cigarettes.
Altria Group Inc., the Richmond, Virginia-based owner of the nation's biggest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, doesn't allow smoking on factory floors and in places like elevators or hallways, said spokesman David Sylvia. Employees with separate offices can smoke in them, but otherwise the company has designated smoking areas in office buildings, conference areas and cafeterias, he said.

New Microscope Allows Scientists To View The World Like Never Beforereddit
You've never seen cells up-close quite like this.
Developed at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a powerful new microscope can record the activity of living cells, molecules, and embryos in 3D and in real-time. Just check out the video above that shows a HeLa cell dividing , and prepare for your mind to be blown.
The microscope uses a technique called lattice light-sheet microscopy , which involves scanning a cell with ultra-thin sheets of light . This process allows scientists to collect high-resolution images while minimizing light damage to the cells. The research was described in a paper published online in the journal Science on Oct. 24.
"There are many cells you could look at forever in 3D ," Dr. Eric Betzig, a physicist, inventor, and engineer at the institute who developed the microscope, said in a written statement. "We know what the microscope can offer in terms of the imaging, but I think there are a lot of applications we haven't even thought of yet."
For instance, observing the intricacies in the way cells behave may allow scientists to better understand the causes and development of cancer and how different congenital problems develop, Betzig told The Washington Post.
Betzig won the Nobel Prize in chemistry this year for the development of another powerful microscope technology called super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.

Google puts Sundar Pichai in charge of major products  servicesGoogle puts Sundar Pichai in charge of major products, services

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 25:  
Google Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Page has put Sundar Pichai, one of his key lieutenants, in charge of the Internet company's products.
The India-born executive will have oversight over products such as search, maps, Google+, commerce, advertising and infrastructure, according to a Google spokesman. Six executives who previously reported to Page, including the heads of research, social media and search, will now report to Pichai, according to Re/code, which first reported the change on Friday, citing an internal memo.
The change will free Page from having as many direct reports and product units to oversee so that he can better focus on "the bigger picture," according to the Re/code report, which also cited anonymous sources.
YouTube, Google's popular video website, will be unaffected by the new structure and will continue to report directly to Page.
The move puts Pichai, 42, in charge of many of Google's main services, including its core search and advertising units, which generate the bulk of the company's revenue.
Google, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has experienced several high-level management changes this year. Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora departed unexpectedly in July to become Vice-Chairman of Japan's SoftBank Corp and was replaced by longtime Google executive Omid Kordestani. Vic Gundotra, the head of Google's social networking services, left in April.
Pichai, who has risen rapidly through the ranks since joining Google in 2004, is viewed by many industry insiders as potential CEO material. In addition to his duties overseeing the various products, Pichai will continue to lead Google's Android and Chrome software operating systems as well as Google's Apps business.

How Sophia Broke the Rules for Advice Based Businessesreddit
I have wanted to interview Sophia Bera for quite a while because I love her story, and I want to share it with all of you.
You see Sophia completely smashes the myth that advice based business has to be done face to face -- and in particular that financial advice has to be face to face -- and cannot be done online.
You see I have been arguing that for quite some time -- and many people I know, and respect, have told me that it was impossible.
But, then along comes Sophia Bera, and she is living proof that it is possible. Sophia is the Founder of Gen Y Planning.
Not only that, Sophia goes another step forward and demonstrates how she has built a recurring revenue business -- and with clients that do NOT have assets under management. How clever is that!
You see, Sophia works virtually with her clients, the majority of whom are in their 20s and 30s -- a target market frequently ignored because, generally, they don't have assets under management.
Sophia has built her business on that target market.
In the interview I did with Sophia, which you can listen to here , you can hear how Sophia manages her business fully online, how she breaks the other myth of not being able to build strong relationships virtually, and how her clients find her online!
If you want to listen to someone who has taken the traditional approach to advice based business and turned it on its head, then listen to this interview with Sophia .
Sophia is someone I admire and respect, and I am thrilled to share her story with you today.

Navigating Your Career Through Breast Cancerreddit
I was recently having a conversation with a friend about how much the world has changed since the global financial crisis of 2008.  The ways in which we spend have changed.  We have different attitudes about debt, and even though the job market has improved, millions continue to struggle as wages have not caught up.
Somehow, we began to talk about the dissolution of the financial giant Lehman Brothers.  Some argue that was the moment that signaled life as we know it had changed.  My friend, like many people, lamented how 'corporate greed' has destroyed the world.
I didn't take on that discussion, but I did share with her a story about a woman I know who worked at Lehman Brothers.  I felt the story was a good illustration of why we should not cast anything as 'all good' or 'all bad.'
The story comes to mind as we turn an important spotlight on breast cancer this month.
Meet Hannah
In June of 2005, Hannah Burns was Managing Director of Corporate Communications at Lehman Brothers, and fulfilling one of her major responsibilities: Getting the company's quarterly earnings results out to the public.  As the numbers were being released, Hannah set-up a meeting with her boss -- he believed she was going to update him on the media's coverage of the data.  Instead, she had to deliver a far more difficult story.
"I've got good news, and bad news," she told him.  "The good news is that it's early and very treatable, the bad news is that I have breast cancer."
Burns describes herself as a private person, but she went straight to her bosses' office when her doctor delivered the news over the phone.  "Being in my function I can't just disappear and not tell anybody.  I just wanted to get it off of my chest and move on.  It was an easy conversation.  He was incredibly sympathetic, and shocked."
The fact that this Mother of two daughters had her disease detected early had her believing that she would be able to 'get it off of her chest and move on.'  The next few months, however, would prove to be a physical and emotional challenge that she could not have imagined.
Three weeks later, there was the surgery, which was followed by a rigorous four month period of chemotherapy, and bone marrow shots, and then seven weeks of radiation.
In a feat that can be described as nothing short of heroic, aside from a one week recovery period after surgery, Hannah only missed one day of work throughout her entire four months of treatments.
"In addition to wanting to teach my daughters a lesson on how to work through adversity, the firm was so supportive that I wanted to do my absolute best to show my gratitude," says Burns.  "The firm said do whatever you need to do to get well.  Knowing you've got that support is half the battle."
Not only did Lehman provide Burns with inspiration, but the firm also gave her the flexibility to work through her challenge.  She had her treatments on Wednesdays, did not have to return to work, and she was able to come in late on Thursday's. Burns says her worst side effects set in on Friday afternoons, and Lehman allowed her to leave in the afternoon. The company also provided her with car service to and from the office throughout the entire ordeal.
If This Happens to You
One of the many things Hannah taught me was that not everyone -- not even corporate giants like Lehman Brothers -- has all the answers. Hannah simply had to tap into her courage and give the company a blueprint to help her best navigate this challenge. Otherwise, her boss may not have known what to do and there may have been a different result.
If you find yourself trying to work through this situation, here are some tips that may help:
Talk to your doctor before your employer: You need to know what you can expect physically and psychologically, so that you can be clear about your needs to your employer.  That way you can come to your boss with a clear plan of action. Hannah, for example, purposely scheduled her treatments on Wednesday's. That way she would have the weekend to recover when the worst of the side effects hit about 48 hours later.  She knew she would need Friday afternoons off.
"Work is a very important part of a women's life, and if she can continue to work, she's going to do better, " says Dr. Ruth Oratz, reknowned oncologist and associate professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine. "But they need to be flexible, and realize that they may have to make some changes."  Oratz adds that work is not going to be an option for all women.
Be true to yourself when it comes to talking to your boss: "How much you tell your boss depends on your own personal style," according to Kate Sweeney at Cancer and Careers.  "If you have an open relationship, be open.  If not, just present the situation, and tell them what you will need."  Also, if you have an open relationship with your co-workers, you will likely want to share details of your recovery.  If you're more private you may just want to say "I'm doing fine," and don't be afraid to leave it at that."
Find out what your company has done with employees in this situation in the past: This is particularly true when it comes to leave and benefits.  You are trying to determine if former policies will work for you. Supposed, for example, you want to work from home, yet you find out this has not been allowed. You want to be able to bring that up to your boss, as something you will need. Maybe your company has never been in this situation before.  You need to find out if it is going to be up to you to guide them, when it comes to helping you remain as productive as possible.
Know your legal rights: In the U.S., for example, people with cancer are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act which gives you rights in the workplace.  In addition, protection is provided under the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year.  The weeks do not have to be taken consecutively. Human resource departments can be a great resource when it comes to knowing your legal rights.  They can also be of great help with your insurer. A company calling on your behalf will likely have a lot more leverage with an insurance firm than you calling as an individual.
Pay attention to how you feel: If you take time off for treatments, you can expect to have a lot of mixed emotions as you transition from patient back to employee.  If you don't feel psychologically up to speed, you may want to seek out some counseling, or attend workshops and seminars to refresh your work skills. Physically, take a look at your workspace.  Tell your employer if it needs to be redesigned with something like back support.
Organizations like Women at Risk , and Cancer and Careers , have great information on their web sites.

iron and steel
With 62.41 million tonnes output, India remains the world’s fourth largest steel producer in the first nine months of the current year, preceded by China, Japan and the US.
World Steel Association (WSA) data showed India’s steel production grew by 1.8 per cent, the second highest among the top four steel producing nations, during the January-September period from 61.27 MT in the same period last year.
India has been the world’s fourth largest steel maker for the last four years. The order is likely to remain unchanged in current year too, an industry expert said.
During the first nine months, China produced 618 MT steel which is a little more than half of world’s total production at 1,231 MT.
China logged 2.3 per cent growth during the period. But its steel production remained static in September, as per data revealed by WSA, at 67.5 MT when compared with the same month last year.
Japan remained the remote second with 83.1 MT production during the nine-month period clocking just 0.8 per cent growth over 82.4 MT production in the same period last year.
The US stood at the third spot with 66.33 MT production compared to 65.3 MT output during the January—September period of the last year.
Though the growth in world’s third largest producing nation grew by 1.6 per cent during the period, in September steel production in the US fell by 0.1 per cent over the same month last year.
Russia and South Korea vie for the fifth slot with 53.4 MT and 53.2 MT output in the first nine months of the current year.
The balance is, however, tilted towards the Asian nation as it logged 9.4 per cent growth, highest among major steel producing nations, in steel production during the period compared to Russia’s 3.1 per cent.

PRADEEP S MEHTA
Urgent and transformative changes to the civil services are a must to enable successful economic reforms
October 26, 2014:  
All secretaries to the Government of India should have received ‘outstanding’ grading over their last five annual appraisals, by and large, otherwise they won’t be eligible to claim the coveted title. As one babu quipped, if all of them are ‘outstanding’, why is their performance so average as evident from the poor results in many cases? Granted, truly excellent officers have to work with average colleagues and an archaic system, and cannot really work as lone rangers.
This babu friend had unfortunately got ‘Very Good’ once and that meant his death knell in terms of his dream of becoming a hallowed secretary or even an additional secretary to the GoI. Usually, in civil services, promotions happen automatically. Some selection criterion does exist in the Central Government, but merit is not considered in its proper dimensions.
There are counter arguments to this — many say favouritism can allow sycophantic officers to go higher than the deserving ones. In the armed forces, it is said, promotions take place mainly on merit and officers get weeded out even before they retire. Efforts to bring in the same system in the civil services have not been successful and that is needed if economic and governance reforms have to succeed.
Perhaps the establishment is inured to the Peter Principle, that a person reaches his level of incompetence sooner or later.
Lacking a system
Consequently, we get an average administration which is good at pushing files. Many babus earn plaudits for not taking any decisions rather than for taking decisions because of the fear of vilification and/or punishment.
In my 30 years of public advocacy, I have come across a variety of babus to whom the Peter Principle applies without doubt, but the system protects them from being weeded out. And many of them, aided by a strong fraternity, end up in some sinecure post for five more years after retirement. This makes a mockery of the system and the nation has to bear the burden.
On the other hand, if one looks at the armed forces, a person can rise to the level of colonel or captain in the navy or group captain in the air force after 23 years of service. But that may be at the end of his career, unless he has successfully undergone training and promotion tests for going up. Unlike the forces to which people enter via specialised training centres, civil servants can be from any discipline but have to qualify through the UPSC exams. Thus we also find doctors, scientists, engineers, management graduates and social scientists who end up in the service that requires general skills and a good IQ.
Misplaced skills
The investment in specialised skills is lost to the society. Also, other aspirants to such an education also lose the opportunity since the seats are limited in good professional institutions.
Besides, the civil services have always opposed the lateral entry of good professionals in overnment. For example, in 1959, an industrial management pool was created to engage successful private sector executives in public enterprises. Many joined, sacrificing their compensation packages, and have risen up in the Government. But recruitment took place only for one year and the system was pulled back, ostensibly to protect the civil services.
Nearly 200 civil servants have been occupying posts in public enterprises since then. This is not to say that exceptional econocrats or even scientists have not held senior positions in the Government but they were exceptions. How does all this apply in Narendra Modi’s push for Make in India? Hugely. Unless civil service reforms are carried out, doing business in India will remain difficult in spite of tomes of studies and reports, and platitudes.
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Veerappa Moily had gone in depth into civil service reforms to make it more efficient, but the recommendations are yet to be implemented fully. Some simple steps have been taken but they have not been able to address the structural issues.
Need urgent reform
Recommendations have been made to mandate mid-career training as a promotion criterion. By and large, civil servants having worked for nearly 25 years are being sent, rather than phased out into 10, 15 and 20 years service.
Having interacted with many, one does not find any significant change in them or their attitudes after they have come back. Sometimes, one sees an officer working in a particular discipline being sent abroad for specialised training but coming back and spending the rest of his career in jobs where that training will never help.
The Second ARC had recommended many armed forces-like changes in the civil services. This included the establishment of a National Institute for Public Administration to run specialised degree courses for aspirants, but conceded that aspirants from other disciplines may also be admissible after doing a bridge course. Capacity building was also defined in depth and it was suggested that for every promotion a mandatory training was needed.
Most importantly, the Second ARC also recommended that officers be put into specific domains, based on their academic qualifications, experience and aptitude, so that “the most suitable for the post is selected”.
A similar practice was also followed under the ICS. The Second ARC had also suggested that there should be competition for senior positions, but that has translated into jockeying rather than being done through a logical process.
Among many sterling suggestions, the Second ARC had also recommended lateral entry for positions of additional secretary and above, which does not exist in the armed forces. Another critical suggestion was borrowing from the armed forces’ practice of weeding out officers after 20 years of service and suggesting that appointments should only be made for 20 years and their continuation would depend on their performance.

Blending poetry and processorsThe Innovators, Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster
This book on the digital revolution logs you into an enchanting world of craziness and camaraderie
October 26, 2014:  
In 1801, Frenchman Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented the automated loom, which changed the fortunes of the silk weaving industry. The loom was a scientific wonder. It showed that the whole weaving exercise could be ‘programmable’. Until then, looms had followed a manual process: they created a pattern by using hooks to lift selected warp threads, and then a rod pushed a woof thread underneath.
The Jacquard loom, however, used a series of cards with punched holes to control this process. The holes determined which hooks and rods would be activated for each pass of the weave, thus automating the creation of intricate patterns. Each time the shuttle was thrown to create a new pass of the thread, a new punch card would come into play. This was a seemingly simple and utilitarian result that was supported by an enchantingly complex idea. In fact, Jacquard developed the idea of the loom based on the thoughts and ideas of inventors Basile Bouchon, Jean Baptiste Falcon and Jacques Vaucanson.
The Jacquard loom would influence inventors of myriad hues in the years to come. Among them was an Englishman, Charles Babbage, who was so enamoured by the idea of using punched cards to control intricate patterns that he decided to borrow the idea to develop a complex device he was fancying to build — the Analytical Engine, an idea he conceived in 1834.
Like all great inventors, Babbage too possessed an uncanny ability to combine “innovations that had cropped up in other fields”, writes Walter Isaacson in The Innovators. Babbage realised he could use the punched cards in place of the steel drums in his Analytical Engine, to input an unlimited number of instructions to the machine. This was conceived as a general purpose computer that would carry out a variety of different operations based on programming instructions given to it — exactly what a computer does today.
Ahead of their times
Babbage’s machine was an idea that was a hundred years ahead of his time, Isaacson notes. But he didn’t find too many takers for his seemingly utopian idea — except one. And that was Ada, the Countess of Lovelace. Isaacson paints a strikingly vivid portrait of the relationship the ‘father of modern computer’ shared with the countess, a mathematical genius who was the first one to envision the modern computer.
Born on December 10, 1815, Ada was the only legitimate child of legendary English poet Lord Byron. Ada’s margin notes to her translation of a study in Italian of Babbage’s Engine, written by a (then) young engineer called Luigi Menabrea, became more famous and coveted than the thesis itself. Menabrea later became the prime minister of Italy. It was in these notes that Ada discussed the idea of a general purpose machine, which later evolved into the modern computer.
Many rightly believe her works in the area of computing and mathematics didn’t get the deserved attention, even though over the years she was celebrated as a feminist icon and computer pioneer, especially in the initial decades of the digital revolution. Hers could be one of the first and perhaps the most important case of criminal neglect the computing industry later became notorious for.
To his credit, Isaacson devotes a significant amount of real estate to sketch Ada’s interestingly eccentric life, even though one gets a sense that even he is not thoroughly convinced of her genius. “Whether due to her opiates or her breeding or both”, Isaacson writes, Ada developed an outsize opinion of her own talents and started describing herself as a “genius”. Interestingly, in his biography of Steve Jobs (2011), Isaacson appeared to be all awe describing Jobs’ eccentric and self-obsessed ways.
The collaborators
In his journey tracing the evolution of the digital revolution, Isaacson introduces an ensemble cast — many known and some unknown. There are the usual suspects such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and a refreshing multitude of interesting faces that makes The Innovators the most interesting account of the history of the digital era. The depth of Isaacson’s research is spectacular to say the least. And his narration is dexterously non-linear, making it an intelligent reader’s delight.
A former managing editor of Time magazine, he obviously has the probing eyes of a curious journalist, while maintaining a philosopher’s detachment to the events and ideas he discusses. He is bewitchingly lucid even when describing the most complex concepts in computing. His profiles of hackers and geeks beam truthfulness and striking nonchalance.
Unlike the industrial revolution, which was made possible to a large extent through individual brilliance and resilience (like James Watt or George Stephenson), the digital revolution — despite the cult faces that pop up in most manuals — was a collaborative effort.
A continuing journey
There were leaders such as Jobs or Gates, but there were no “solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell and Morse”. Most of the key inventions of the digital era came from the collaboration of hackers, inventors and entrepreneurs.
Even though Isaacson declares at the outset that it’s the story of collaboration that he is trying to capture, he ends up highlighting many cults. But that’s pardonable, given that each character, representing an epochal event in the history of computing, stands testimony to the camaraderie and unity that propelled digital inventions. While narrating the stories, Isaacson captures how each invention in the digital universe has helped humanity leapfrog on many fronts and how these devices, services and events helped make complex tasks simpler and more enjoyable.
Technology, especially computing technology, has made human lives a highly entertaining affair. In the second half of the past century, especially at the tail end of it, computers and the internet started influencing human life like no other forces of nature have.
In the past decade or so, we saw the world wide web — invented by the ideas of Tim Berners-Lee who was, like Gates and Jobs, also born in 1955 — and the internet (which was an offshoot of a military mechanism for communication) redefining the contours of nations, triggering revolutions, challenging militaries. Computing technology even gave us a new, global currency (bitcoin) and the world’s first free, open repository of information (Wikipedia) and many more services and devices.
This is a continuing journey, an unstoppable revolution. And as Isaacson notes, what is making this revolution even more enchanting and likeable is the interplay of art and science in it.
And as Ada, Countess of Lovelace had believed, — and as Isaacson sums up — innovators are people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. This chemistry will spring more surprises in the years to come.

The too-long arm of the law  contdThe heat is slowly turning up on the government’s use of civil asset forfeiture procedures to extort money out of innocent individuals without the messy need to actually show that they did anything wrong or wrongful.   I blogged about this a couple of weeks ago, and today’s New York Times has a front page article detailing another wrinkle in the civil forfeiture scam :  seizures of funds deposited in violation of the “anti-structuring” provisions of the federal code.
As you probably know, banks have an obligation to report all cash transactions of more than $10,000 to the federal government.  What you may not know is that it is a federal crime to “structure a transaction,” including by “breaking down a single sum of currency exceeding $ 10,000 into smaller sums, . . . “for the purpose of evading the [reporting] requirement.”  The reporting requirement itself is designed to alert the government to possibly suspicious transactions involving proceeds from money laundering, or drugs or gambling or other cash-intensive activities.  But the statute makes the evasion itself a crime — even if the money was derived from perfectly lawful activities, and even if the “purpose of evading the reporting requirement” is a perfectly benign one.  And to make matters much worse, the IRS doesn’t even have to charge you with the crime of “structuring” in order to seize the proceeds of the transaction under civil asset forfeiture laws, and the Times article details growing use of this procedure to take and keep money belonging to innocent individuals who are never even charged with the crime at all.
As it happens, I have a particular interest in and connection to the “structuring” issue.  Back in 1993, when I clerked for Justice Ginsburg, the Court decided the case of Ratzlaf v. US (510 US 135 (1994)).  Ratzlaf admitted that he structured a cash transaction with knowledge of, and a purpose to avoid, the banks’ reporting requirement.  [He owed $1000,000 to a Las Vegas casino, and the casino helpfully provided a limousine to take him around to a number of local banks where he could get cashiers' checks for $9,900 without triggering the recording requirement)  The anti-structuring statute at the time, however, called for proof that the actor had not merely violated the anti-structuring provision but "willfully violate[d]” it - and the Court (with Justice Ginsburg writing for the majority of five) held that the government had not proved that Ratzlaf acted “willfully.”  (Law students take note – it’s a very interesting decision about how to construe the word “willful” when it appears, as it does not infrequently, in statutory criminal provisions.  And an odd lineup, which usually means something interesting was going on in the case:  Ginsburg joined by Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Kennedy in the majority; Blackmun, Rehnquist, O’Connor, and Thomas in dissent).  The Court noted that “willfully,” when used in federal statutes, usually means that the actor had “specific intent to commit a crime,” i. e., “a purpose to disobey the law” – that the defendant knew that he was acting unlawfully but went ahead nonetheless.  Adding the modifier “willfully” is the legislature’s way of overriding the usual rule that “ignorance of the law is no excuse”; ignorance of the law is an excuse, if the statute requires the government to show that you acted “willfully.”
Ratzlaff, the Court held, didn’t act “willfully,” because even though he knew of the bank’s reporting requirement (and was acting to evade it), he didn’t know that such evasion was itself a crime, so he could not be said to have acted with a specific purpose to disobey the law.  The government argued that that the intent to evade the reporting requirement was alone enought to satisfy any “bad purpose” requirement signalled by use of the word “willfully”; because “structuring is not the kind of activity that an ordinary person would engage in innocently,” it was therefore “reasonable to hold a structurer responsible for evading the reporting requirements without the need to prove specific knowledge that such evasion is unlawful.”
The Court (wisely, in my view) rejected that argument:
“Undoubtedly there are bad men who attempt to elude official reporting requirements in order to hide from Government inspectors such criminal activity as laundering drug money or tax evasion.  But currency structuring is not inevitably nefarious. Consider, for example, the small business operator who knows that reports filed under 31 U.S.C. § 5313(a) are available to the Internal Revenue Service. To reduce the risk of an IRS audit, she brings $ 9,500 in cash to the bank twice each week, in lieu of transporting over $ 10,000 once each week. That person, if the United States is right, has committed a criminal offense, because she structured cash transactions “for the specific purpose of depriving the Government of the information that Section 5313(a) is designed to obtain.”  Nor is a person who structures a currency transaction invariably motivated by a desire to keep the Government in the dark. But under the Government’s construction an individual would commit a felony against the United States by making cash deposits in small doses, fearful that the bank’s reports would increase the likelihood of burglary, or in an endeavor to keep a former spouse unaware of his wealth.”
[I've often wondered whether Justice Ginsburg's familiarity with perfectly lawful tax-structured transactions - her husband Marty having been one of America's top tax lawyers - helped make her more receptive to the notion that the "evasion of the reporting requirement" alone is not enough to trigger criminal liability; just because a statute says "If you do X, the consequence is Y," avoiding X in order to avoid Y is not, standing alone, a criminal act - if it were, a lot of tax lawyers and their clients would be in jail.]
Unfortunately, Congress, responding to alarms that this holding would make it harder to find and to prosecute money launderers and drug dealers, rather quickly responded by deleting the word “willfully” from the statute, leaving us with the mess we now have.

The White Paper Is Not Deadreddit
White papers seem to be falling out of favor. Perhaps our preferred screens have become too small and our attention spans too short. Or maybe it's the perception that white papers are only for large, corporations selling complex technologies.
I am here to tell you that rumors of the death of the white paper are greatly exaggerated. And they're not just for the Fortune 500. White papers may have the longest shelf life of all content, and they can be sliced and diced to meet a variety of marketing purposes and repurposes.
I sat down recently with Gordon Graham, aka "That White Paper Guy" and author of White Papers for Dummies, which is part of the "Dummies" series from Wiley. My interview with him will debunk some of the misconceptions about white papers, and may get you thinking of ways to include them in your own content mix - even if you are a small business or a B2C marketer.
Fox: Gordon, I want to key in on your small business background and how a white paper can help a small company find and connect with customers. I understand as VP of Marketing you helped take a company in wireless barcode scanning from $250,000 to $14 million. How did you do it?
Graham: I think it was the willingness of the business owners to try different things. I would suggest something, and more often than not they would say, "Yes, let's try that." Two things that really connected for us and really got us traction were white papers and case studies.
Fox: Give an example of a successful white paper you created for the business.
Graham: It ended up being more of a booklet that featured a fictitious company we called Acme Tricycle Works. It involved two people - Victor the Vice-President, who was the decision maker, and Martin the IT Manager, who made technical recommendations. We had them walking through Acme, going into every department and making observations about how things were before our technology and after. It was something of an extended customer story based on a fictitious composite of a lot of our customers.
Fox: It was a published as a physical document?
Graham: Yes, as a book. It was the late '90s, so I might look at it differently now. But we deliberately decided to make it like a physical trophy. It was the most lavish thing we ever did, but that little booklet earned us millions of dollars' worth of sales.
Our west coast sales rep summed it up nicely when he said, "I go to a meeting and I put a copy of our little book at everyone's place, and you can see in their eyes that we have just risen to the top of their vendor short list because we look like a big, professional company."
Fox: What's interesting is that here you turned a lowly white paper into a story that people could identify with.
Graham: It was powerful, especially since we were a small company competing with big companies who had been in business much longer and had millions of dollars to spend. Yet, we would regularly beat them out on projects. Finally, one of our big competitors got so tired of dealing with us, they just bought us out.
Fox: That is powerful, yet when I talk about white papers to clients these days, their eyes roll up in the top of their heads. They're like, "Oh, no. Here we go again!"
Graham: Well, I guess there is something of a fatigue factor. I've seen so many articles lately with people posing the question, "Are white papers dead?" or outright declaring, "The white paper is dead!"
I think anything that's poorly done is going to fatigue people and I would say the majority of white papers out there are not very effective. They make the same mistake over and over - too much selling. A white paper's not supposed to be a sales document. It's supposed to help people understand some kind of issue or solve a problem or make a decision.
Fox: It seems to me that another attribute of a good white paper is that it contains content you can re-purpose and reuse.
Graham: Yes, a problem-solution white paper can generate probably three or four blog posts. You just take every section, boil it down a bit and post it. Then at the bottom say, "For more discussion, see the full white paper here." Another obvious way to re-purpose a white paper is to boil it down to a slide deck, and then you can post that on sites like SlideShare .
Fox: We have been talking mostly about B2B - how can white papers help companies that sell consumer goods and services?
Graham: Here is a B2C example from a small business in Pennsylvania, a guy who runs an interesting niche. He mails invitations and special offers to new people who have moved into a neighborhood, information he gets from residential sales, movers and the US postal service. People who move into a new house in a new town need all new services and information on local businesses. Imagine you get this mail with offers like, "Come to Joe's Garage and we'll give you a free oil change." You go to Joe's Garage and chances are they will become your new garage.
We developed a white paper to help attract local retailers like Joe's Garage. It talks about why people move, how they move, where they're moving and other information, including graphics to show the opportunity.  This white paper has been on his website for seven years now, and it's still being downloaded hundreds of times a year! As long as prospects are still suffering the same pain and struggling with the same problems, it remains relevant and useful.
Fox: How does a business go about developing a white paper?
Graham: The general process of doing an effective white paper is to start with a problem that your prospects are facing [most likely, your customer service team has a long list and FAQs]. And then do some research to flush out the problem in detail. Also, get a good handle on your purpose, which is most often related to the sales funnel. Are you trying to generate more leads? That's the top of the funnel. Nurture existing prospects or keep them engaged through a complex sale? That's the middle. Supporting an evaluation or business case is the bottom of the funnel.
Fox: In your book, you discuss three kinds of white papers that you label as the popular ice cream flavors of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. I think that's brilliant because everyone loves ice cream, or at least can relate to it!
Graham: Exactly!  The idea came to me while I was going through the list of white papers I had written, and realized that most of them fell into one of three buckets. I figured, why not turn them into buckets of ice cream!
Fox: Vanilla is the prototypical backgrounder, the usual technical or financial business benefits of something. My apologies in advance for a bad pun, but how about a few licks of strawberry and chocolate...
Graham: Chocolate is the problem-solution white paper. I call it chocolate because it's the richest and most complex flavor. It's the one you can post on a website for years, refreshing it if needed with more recent statistics. It will keep generating leads, literally for years.
Strawberry is light and lively. The really fun, fresh flavor of strawberry white papers is the Numbered List. I would say these days at least half of the white papers I do wind up being numbered lists because everybody likes them. Another light version of a white paper is something I call the " Cheat Sheet " which is a geared to help B2B marketers when their sales reps ask for something short they can leave behind at a meeting or e-mail to prospects. The fact is, we all have too much to read and too much information coming at us from all different angles. That's what makes strawberry so popular.
Fox: Do you include graphics or anything else to liven up the story or highlight particular points? And how are most white papers published these days?
Graham: White papers have become more visual and better designed over the years. I would say definitely put a visual cover on it. Use charts and graphs and good typography. If you have a budget, spend some extra money on a professional designer.
As for publishing, usually they are published as PDFs and distributed online. There are sites like Knowledge Storm and Find White Papers for publishing white papers. Also check out your industry trade magazines or associations to see if you can get your white paper posted on their site or run and ad with a link to the white paper back on your site. It's a great way to attract new prospects.
Too much information remains locked up in the minds of subject matter experts. A white paper can capture that know-how to help promote any B2B concern, and many B2B companies as well. It's a foundational piece of content that sales teams want and prospective customers need.
Gordon's book, " White Papers for Dummies ", is an excellent resource for developing and writing white papers. Lean more on his website, thatwhitepaperguy.com , which also offers helpful tips and advice.
Additional resource::  Here's a list of common synonyms for "white papers." Depending upon your audience, these terms may help you strike the right tone for your resource...even better than "white paper."

Why Many Good Mortgage Loans Are Not Being Madereddit
The housing sector today is not providing the economic stimulus we had come to expect during periods of economic recovery. A major reason is that the underwriting rules and practices that determine whether or not an applicant qualifies for a home mortgage are much stricter today than they were before the financial crisis.
In part, the tightening reflects changes in the market environment that make mortgage loans generally more risky than they were before the crisis. The major factor was the nationwide decline in house prices between 2006 and 2009, the first such decline since the 1930s. The very liberal terms that prevailed prior to the crisis were based on a widespread belief that such declines were a thing of the past. When price changes are always positive, it is very difficult to make a bad mortgage loan. Now that the market understands that house prices can decline, mortgages are considered riskier.
A second factor has been the post-crisis practice of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to require lenders originating loans for sale to the agencies to buy them back if they default too quickly. This has caused many lenders to impose underwriting rules (referred to as "overlays") that are more restrictive than required by law and regulation,
A third factor has been the post-crisis tightening of underwriting standards imposed by law and regulation. The riskier mortgage types that experienced the highest default rates are no longer permitted. This includes loans that allow negative amortization where the payment does not cover the interest, and loans that allow interest-only where the payment convers only the interest.  Monthly payments today must be fully-amortizing, meaning that if continued through the life of the loan, the balance will be paid off at term.
In addition, riskier loan features that are still allowed carry a larger penalty than they did before the crisis. For example, a borrower refinancing with "cash-out" is subject to a larger price penalty relative to a no-cash refinance than before the crisis, and may also be subject to a higher credit score requirement, a higher equity requirement or both. The same is true of loans on 2-4 family properties and condos, relative to loans on single-family homes.
But the tightening of underwriting rules following the crisis has gone beyond these rational adjustments to a riskier environment. It also included knee-jerk responses to pre-crisis abuses, particularly to the many cases of loans granted to people who obviously couldn't repay them. A system of hastily enacted rules and procedures designed to prevent this from happening again are now blocking many good loans from being made. The following are major features of this system:
A belief that all mortgage loans should be affordable. In fact, there are numerous circumstances in which an unaffordable loan is in the interest of a borrower, and where the evidence is compelling that the loan will be fully repaid. One example is a cash-out refinance by an owner who wants to remain in the house a few more years before selling, and uses the cash to make the payment. Underwriter judgments are needed in such cases, however, and these are not a part of the new system.
Underwriter discretion is substantially narrowed. Rules have largely eliminated discretion, and the major role of underwriters today is to check for conformity with the rules.
Ratios of debt-to-income above 43% indicate over-commitment by the applicant. Given the wide range of circumstances that can affect a borrower's capacity to meet obligations, fixation on any ratio as a maximum makes no sense. But again, the sense should be provided by an underwriter with the discretion to make a call, and that no longer exists.
The affordability requirement is absolute and not affected by the applicant's credit score or equity in the property. Applicants making a down payment of 40% with a credit score of 800 are turned down if their income is not adequate. This makes no sense.
Income must be fully documented. Prior to the crisis, documentation requirements ranged from full-doc to no-doc, with three or four partial- docs in-between. The less complete the documentation, the higher the price and the larger the required equity and credit score. That sensible system is now gone and all loans must be fully documented. This is why I keep getting letters from self-employed applicants who cannot qualify despite having large equity and a high credit score.
Much of the system of rules and beliefs described above stem from Dodd-Frank, and were formulated in an atmosphere hostile to lenders. But borrowers are the ones paying the price.
The issues need to be reconsidered in an atmosphere free of vindictiveness toward lenders. It could begin with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and their supervisor the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which could re-examine their rules, identify those that should be liberalized, and determine which they could fix on their own and which would require new legislation,

The ECB Assessment of Eurozone Banks  Health Will Not Dissipate Fundamental Questionsreddit
After months of waiting, we just received the results of the assessment of the health of Eurozone banks by their new supervisory authority: the European Central Bank. They were predictable, but the exercise has limitations which result in delivering only a partial health bulletin.
What the numbers say
Of the 130 banks 25 have insufficient capital. Their aggregate needs amount to 25 billion euros, or 1% of the equity of banks in the Eurozone. Over-valuation of assets amount to 48 billion euros, or 0.15% of the assets of European banks. Those numbers are reassuring.
Of the 25 billion, Greek (8.7) and Italy (9.7) account for almost 75% of the missing equity. France (0.1), Germany (0.1) and Spain (0.0), the main Eurozone countries (with Italy), are in almost perfect health.
None of the 20 largest Eurozone  global banks is included in the list of banks with insufficient capital.
This reading is reassuring, and given the methodology used, the results are indisputable.
What the evaluation does not say
While there are three Basel III ratios that banks will be required to comply (liquidity, leverage and capital adequacy), the analysis of the ECB is only focusing on lack of capital. The Asset Quality Review is in the context of capital adequacy.
The Asset Quality Review generally excludes any form of reduction in the nominal value of bonds issued by sovereign states of the Eurozone. They are  considered worth their face value when they are detained in the core portfolio of Eurozone banks. This ignores that the Eurozone has violated its own dogma in the case of Greece and Cyprus. Unfortunately, the size of sovereign bonds create one of the systemic worries. Country risk is absent from this assessment and all state bonds are considered as strong as Germany.  It would, of course, be extremely politically sensitive.
The absence of the 20 largest global banks in the Eurozone from the list poses a question: the choice of banks. Slovenia, Portugal, Slovakia and Estonia do not represent a systemic risk by themselves. Their presence in the sample was purely political and a matter of national pride. Monte dei Paschi alone, which would have fallen into bankruptcy without the intervention of the Italian government last year, can be considered systemic. Everything has been built so that only the less significant banks are caught in claws of the ECB.
Systemic risk is not taken into account. The vulnerability of banks in countries where they operate are not taken into account, especially those who are over-indebted, such as France, Greece and Italy. That is a shortfall since sovereign risks represent 115% of the equity of banks in the Eurozone.
The analysis of asset quality is also limited by a methodology that ignores "exotic" assets in the balance sheets of major global banks, and in particular the risk on derivatives. It's the same structured products. Such risks are generally absent from smaller bank balance sheets.
Risks associated with the universal banking model and the size of major European banks are not part of the debate. European banks continue to threaten the Eurozone with assets of 31 billion euro, representing 250% of GDP (against 75% in the US).
A reassuring health bulletin in the absence of crisis.
The assessment of the European Central Bank has merits: it pushed a number of major banks to take restructuring measures, sometimes at the last minute such as the capital injection of AXA into AXA Bank last Friday. Deutsche Bank took drastic measures and increase its capital in the first half. Until the last minute, it was unclear whether it would be affected by the AQR.
What the analysis does not touch, even if public statements are sure to pretend an absence of systemic risk, is that with 31,000 billion for 13,000 billion capital Gross Domestic Product, and the Eurozone is over-banked. As such, the taxpayer will have to bail out in the case of a collapse of a major bank, despite the new bank resolution mechanism set up by the European Union.

24 European Banks Fail EBA Stress Test: Is a Major Banking Crisis Loomingreddit
The European Banking Authority, in conjunction with the European Central Bank, conducted a stress test of 123 leading banks within the European Union. A total of 24 banks failed the stress tests, which gauges the ability of a bank located within the EU to withstand macroeconomic pressures, which are rapidly accumulating not only in Europe but throughout the global economy. This represents a full 20 percent of all the major banks subjected to the stress test by the EBA and ECB.
Nine of the banks with failing grades are Italian; three are Greek and another three are Cypriote. Though only one of the banks on the list of vulnerable banks is Irish (Ireland had previously been afflicted with a major banking crisis, requiring a massive bailout), that institution, Permanent TSB, is one of Ireland's largest financial institutions. Permanent TSB was found to have a massive €854.8 million hole in its reserves. Overall, the EBA found that the banks surveyed in the stress test were short of 24.6 billion euros in capital reserves--the amount required in their modeling to withstand a three-year recession. This is the equivalent  of 31.17 billion U.S. dollars at current exchange levels.
Since the global economy imploded into systemic crisis in 2008, central banks and regulating authorities in major economies throughout North America and Europe have held periodic stress tests, apparently in an effort to reassure the public in those countries that their banks are in generally good financial condition. There is a suspicion among many that those stress tests are often rigged in a manner designed to present the most favorable indication possible regarding those banking institutions. The fact that this most recent stress tests undertaken by the EBA reveals that 20 percent of the European Union's major banks are in trouble, and this at a time of economic stagnation throughout Europe, with increasing indications of looming recession, should serve as a warning klaxon on how fragile Europe's financial health remains a full six years after the onset of the global economic and financial crisis.

Euro edges up on better-than-expected ECB stress testsYen benefits from falling oil prices; commodity currencies slide
By Masayuki Kitano and Ian Chua, Reuters
8
Commodity currencies extended their recent losses, with the Australian dollar setting a four-year low, while the Canadian dollar hit a five-year trough versus the U.S. dollar.
Against the yen, the greenback fell 0.4 percent to 120.25 yen , pulling further away from a seven-year high of 121.86 yen set on Monday. The yen also rose versus the euro, which shed 0.5 percent to around 148.02 yen .
0
The dollar may retreat further versus the yen in the near term due to the potential for more position squaring in the wake of its recent rally, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
"The size of volatility in the dollar's moves versus the yen has become quite stark," Murata said, adding that choppy trading conditions could persist toward the year-end.
"I think we may even see levels around 119.50 yen or so today," he said.
The dollar's rise to a seven-year high on Monday marked a gain of about 11 percent versus the yen after the Bank of Japan expanded its monetary stimulus at the end of October.
Commodity currencies remained under pressure, with the Australian dollar touching a four-year low at one point and last trading at $0.8241 , down 0.7 percent on the day.
The Canadian dollar slipped to as low as C$1.1501  versus the U.S. dollar earlier on Tuesday, its lowest level since July 2009, as oil prices hit five-year lows.
Market participants said the U.S. dollar remained supported by expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates some time next year.
Earlier on Tuesday, the dollar had gained a lift from a Wall Street Journal report saying that Fed officials are seriously considering dropping an assurance that short-term interest rates will stay near zero for a "considerable time", when the Fed issues its policy statement next week.
The Fed's policy meeting takes place on Dec. 16-17.
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 89.104 <.DXY>. On Monday the dollar index had set a five-year high at 89.55.
The euro held steady at about $1.2313 , staying above a two-year low of $1.2247 set on Monday.
Investors were likely to remain wary of buying the common currency amid speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) was poised to ease policy further early next year.
Executive Board member Benoit Coeure kept those expectations alive on Monday, saying policymakers last week agreed unanimously to assess how and when to react to downward inflation risks in early 2015, and that they could then change their asset buying plans.

A journey into humilityUpdated: November 22, 2014 14:34 IST
A journey into humility
fiction
“In Australia, the Man Booker Prize is seen as something of a chicken raffle. I just didn’t expect to end up being the chicken.” This year’s winner, Richard Flanagan, gets candid about his prize-winning book, and why he thinks the novel is not dead.
Richard Flanagan is nothing if not a man of his word. When his incredibly personal novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction, he said, “Writing is a journey to humility.”
Then just a few days before the prize was to be announced, Flanagan — easily among the finest Australian writers of his generation — was quoted as saying, “In Australia, the Man Booker is seen as something of a chicken raffle.” A couple of days later, he won the raffle, thereby becoming the third Aussie to get the Booker after Thomas Kenneally and Peter Carey. 
His words stayed in the memory of his numerous readers across the world. And in his mind too. Soon after he received the Man Booker prize — where he pipped to the post, among others, Neel Mukherjee and Howard Jacobson, who won the prize in 2010 — Flanagan did not forget his words, merely adding, “In Australia, the Man Booker Prize is seen as something of a chicken raffle. I just didn’t expect to end up being the chicken.” Then he happily talked of humility, taking care to bring in a reference to his grandparents. “I do not come out of a literary tradition. My grandparents were illiterate.”
What he did not say then, but said to The Hindu, was that his father was a prisoner of war for three and a half years in Burma where his award-winning novel is set. For years, Richard heard tales of people surviving on stale rice, living with open wounds, constant humiliation and, ultimately, a life of denial; a life by the deadly railway track linking Burma and Thailand. He heard it all from his father and siblings. Then, one day, he “decided to tell the story”, though his father never asked him about its contents. Flanagan and his five siblings grew up “as children of the Death Railway”. They “carried many incommunicable things” and he “decided to tell the story” through the book.
Thus was written The Narrow Road to the Deep North. It is a journey that took him 12 years; long enough for the Tasmanian to consider picking up a job in the mines of Northern Territory in Australia to meet his daily expenses. For such a long time, he lived each of the characters. “The central character — Dorrigo Evans — is me. And so too the Japanese commandant, Nakamura, and the murderous Korean guard, the Goanna. All are me, because within each of us lives the universe and the universe is never one thing. Its harmony lives in its oppositions.” Incidentally, the place claimed some 90,000 labourers’ lives.
Unfortunately, the day Flanagan mailed the publishers the manuscript of the war-time novel — dedicated to his father — Flanagan Senior, then 98, passed away. And the author, who had in the run-up to the D-Day, admitted, “I would miss my father if I did (win the prize)”, did indeed miss him when he got the award.
“Out of a literary ghetto to the biggest literary prize” is how he summed it up in a chat hours after the award ceremony. The ceremony in the U.K. was kind of a home-coming for Flanagan who had, early in his life, studied at the University of Oxford. As a teenager who left school at age 16 in Australia, Flanagan had won a scholarship to Oxford where he completed a Masters degree. All along, he worked as a river guide before taking to academic writing full-time. History, though, could not interest him for long. Soon, he switched to fiction.   
He wrote The Narrow Road... in his shack on Bruny Island, an island off Tasmania. “It looks out on some trees, the sea and an array of animals there, including quolls.” From that far end of the world, he has written six novels, including Gould’s Book of Fish, which was a bookie’s favourite for the Booker about 12 years ago. Incidentally, this time too his book was a bookies’ favourite; his work seemed to tick all the boxes: it related a very human story of love and war, a deeply enriching novel that seemed to cry out for the medium otherwise said to be fading away. It was set in Burma, in news for many reasons of late. And it came from the pen of an Australian, somebody who had never won the award earlier. If, in the run-up to the award, Flanagan was the bookies’ favourite, the award has aroused new interest in his work. The book sold some 60,000 copies in Australia before the finals; in next 24 hours, orders for 10,000 copies were placed.
Understandably, he was less than pleased when it was suggested that the novel is a dying art. “Much has been made about the death of the novel. It is said to be assailed by technology, by the web. I don’t share that pessimism because I think it is one of the great inventions of the human spirit. It is one of the greatest spiritual and intellectual inventions of our age. As a species, it is story that distinguishes us and one of the supreme expressions of the story is the novel. Novels are not a mirror to life or a guide to life. They are life.”
Hardly a surprise considering he is happiest when writing and is a rare writer who is fond of human company, of places where people gather and talk. Post-Booker, he won’t be short of either the company or the place.
Hey, didn’t we talk about Flanagan’s humility at the beginning? Yes, we did. And Flanagan showed that characteristic in ample measure after winning the award. “The fractious tribe of writers is not readily given to fraternity. But I was honoured to be a writer among the writers on this short list. I said to Howard (Jacobson) that there was a good argument to be made for any of the short listed books being the winner. And there is. I hope readers remember 2014’s Man Booker Prize not for my book alone, but for the formidable strength of its shortlist of which I am proud to be part.”
This, after he nudged ahead of them all. How is that for humility for a writer? “To be a writer is to journey into humility. It is to be defeated by ever greater things.”
Indeed. Out of the literary ghetto and all the way to the Booker night. How is that for accomplishment?

Constitutional challenge to quarantine unlikely to succeedBy Eugene Kontorovich October 27
Kaci Hickox, the nurse forcibly quarantined by New Jersey upon her return from West Africa, is threatening a legal challenge to her confinement. Her lawyers claim she is being deprived of her liberty in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Due process cases are fact specific, and I am not privy to information NJ authorities had before them or their decision-making process. However, it is highly unlikely that she will prevail.
While the Supreme Court has long held quarantines to be constitutional, it has not ruled directly on the scope of permissible quarantines. However, in the famous case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts , the Court did uphold a blanket mandatory vaccination law, under which resisters were put in jail. The principle here is the same as with quarantine – that one’s normal rights to bodily integrity are suspended by a general and serious public need, especially of an epidemiological variety.
Still, in part because quarantines have rarely been imposed since World War II, there is relatively little direct precedent on their permissible scope and circumstances. But a brief review of the cases suggests it extremely difficult to challenge such an action without a clear showing of medical unreasonableness, or discriminatory application. Indeed, I found no cases in which a quarantine has been lifted due process grounds (though there have been some successful challenges to conditions of quarantine).
One case upholding a quarantine has facts that look strikingly like Hickox’s. In U.S. ex rel Siegel v. Shinnick, 219 F.Supp. 789 (E.D. NY 1963), the plaintiff was confined for 14 days on her return from a “smallpox infected area” abroad, despite a lack of any evidence of direct exposure or symptoms. The court upheld the action, noting:
[The] judgment required is that of a public health officer and not of a lawyer used to insist on positive evidence to support action; their task is to measure risk to the public and to seek for what can reassure and, not finding it, to proceed reasonably to make the public health secure. They deal in a terrible context and the consequences of mistaken indulgence can be irretrievably tragic. To supercede their judgment there must be a reliable showing of error.
Perhaps the ACLU, which is also questioning the current quarantine, thinks that due process has expanded so much that it might even prohibit this most traditional use of the police power. I doubt it. There are extremely few contexts where the state can deprive someone of liberty without any showing of wrongdoing, or any personal conduct whatsoever: conscription, quarantine, and in a milder fashion, jury service. The case law basis for conscription goes back only to 1918 (also the time of the first widespread quarantines n the U.S.), but it has proven impervious to a liberalized due process clause. Quarantine is safe too.
Moreover, 20th century quarantine cases have typically death with tuberculosis and small pox, both of which are far less lethal than Ebola, and about which much more was known. (The most common form of smallpox had a 30% fatality rate, less than half that of Ebola.) All this shifts the presumption of validity even more towards the state.
Under the basic Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test for these kind of deprivations of liberty, the gravity of the of government’s interest and adequacy of pre-deprivation process are key factors. The long incubation period and deadly effects all counsel for allowing a deprivation of liberty without any showing of illness. Locking a patient up after they develop a fever simply does not substitute for doing so in advance.
UPDATE: I just saw news reports that the nurse is being released.

Imposition  of Hindi: BJP TN unit seeks Centre s involvement in the issuePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: October 27, 2014 7:14 pm | Updated: October 27, 2014 7:15 pm
The BJP’s state unit Monday took up with Centre the issue of alleged imposition of Hindi through commercial broadcast in state-run All India Radio (AIR).
Party’s state unit president Tamizhisai Sounderrajan took up the matter with Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi.
Sounderrajan “requested Javadekar to stop the four hour commercial programme on AIR. The Minister immediately asked his officials to stop the programmes,” a release by the state BJP unit here said.
Last week, NDA constituent PMK had accused the Centre of trying to “impose Hindi” through local radio broadcast and asked the government to give up the proposed initiative.
Party founder S Ramadoss had said that Centre had planned to impose Hindi through local broadcast by regional radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the name of commercial broadcast, claiming that its duration in Hindi had been fixed for four hours a day, effective October 26.
Another local outfit, Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, had also opposed the move.
The state run broadcaster had responded to the accusation, saying it was “committed to conserve, enrich and promote regional languages and cultural heritage,which it will continue to do without any misconceived intention of imposing any language in an area where it has not sufficient speakers of a non-mother tongue.”

Telangana may reduce power cuts on industrial consumersTelangana may reduce power cuts on industrial consumers
Our Bureau
Tweet
Hyderabad, Oct. 27:  
The Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has today called upon TS Transmission Corporation to reduce the two-day power holiday per week on the industrial consumers to one day a week.
The suggestion comes in the backdrop of drop in demand from the agriculture sector following fall in temperatures due to widespread rains and also the kharif season nearing completion.
In the midst of a demand-supply mismatch leading to huge power cuts in the new state of Telangana, this comes in as good news for the industrial power consumers who are faced with hard times due to inadequate power supply to run their units leading to production loss. The small and medium enterprises are amongst the worst hit.
The directive of the Chief Minister to the D Prabhakar Rao, Chairman and Managing Director of TS Genco and TS Transco, comes in at a time when the two States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are in a major spat over power generation at the major hydel reservoirs of Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar, with the latter accusing of violating the existing government orders.
The Government move to reduce power cuts is the first sign of demand from the farm sector coming down over the past two days due to wide spread rains caused due to cyclone resulting in drop in temperatures and also demand from the farm sector pump operations.
The demand from the farm sector operation, which is provided up to seven hours of power supply to energise the pump sets, is likely to taper off with the khariff season coming to an end, providing the flexibility to reduce power cuts.

How To Make Your Office More Productive For Introvertsreddit
If you encounter an individual who considers the prospect of working on a team to be a form of long-acting torture -- you just might find they would describe themselves as an "introvert." To an introvert, teaming can become a bit of a workplace nightmare -- in direct opposition to how they would normally approach their work . The essence of teaming experiences, including vying for airtime to present ideas, can put off an otherwise satisfied employee. Ultimately, the often "on-demand" nature of team participation, doesn't always align with all personalities or work styles.
But, introverts, those who tend to "focus inward," can still excel in the realm of teams. For a significant percentage of the US that describe themselves as an "introvert", team membership shouldn't boil down to becoming louder to be heard. As expressed by Laura Richardson, VP at of The Innovation Games Company , "Introverts shouldn't be relegated to catching the team leader in the hallway, after the meeting to share their opinions comfortably".
Sophia Dembling, author of The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World , explains that teaming can be a positive experience for introverts, as long as they have the opportunity to process information in a manner in line with their work-style strengths. "Introverts don't mind meeting with a team," she says. "We know that's necessary for strategizing. But we prefer if our contribution to the larger project is something we can do by ourselves, then bring back to the team. We're most productive when we can focus quietly and independently on a task."
There is good reason to ensure that introverts participate fully in the team process. In fact, research has shown that the hesitancy to monopolize the conversation can actually make them powerful team members. Why? Introverts tend to listen to suggestions more openly, in comparison to their extroverted colleagues -- a tremendous advantage when developing solutions.
Here are some ideas to help team membership become more productive for introverts:
Build mutual respect. It can appear that introverts and extroverts are from different workplace planets. As a result, it is imperative that we understand, and respect, the differences in the way we each process information.
Utilize solitary ideation. Introverts are more sensitive to the stimulation that occurs while interacting with a team. Offer opportunities for introverts to start the idea generation process before a team meeting is held. Distribute information concerning the focus of the challenge, the anticipated obstacles and goals, before the first team meeting.
Build confidence in the process. One strategy to increase confidence in the team process can be borrowed from the theater. GameChangers , which utilizes improvisation to enhance communication skills, uses learning-based exercises to help all team members. "Improvisational game structure gives even the most introverted players on a team a point of focus that allows them to confront concerns regarding the social dynamics of collaborating," says Mike Bonifer, co-founder and CEO.
Take control. Encouraging broad participation in a group can require careful direction. First on the list -- controlling the mine fields that deter full participation. "Loud talkers" and "Interrupters" who squelch the input of other team members, must be addressed. Set guidelines for participation. If negative behavior persists, deal with the problem privately.
Use the 8 second rule. During team meetings, try not change topics or shift gears too abruptly. Pause and wait 8 seconds before moving on to the next topic. You may find that this brief pause, allows an introvert time to chime in and share an opinion.
Game it. Gaming applications offer an interesting alternative to effectively gather information from all types of team members. From the early phases of the ideation process -- to weighing options -- gaming can help collect potential solutions and visualize the entire decision process. An added plus: "loud talker" no longer dominates the conversation. ( See The Innovation Games website here. )
How do you help your introverted team members shine? Are you a "card carrying" introvert?

The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P energy index <.SPNY> tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude  fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. Leading the decline, shares of Exxon Mobil  fell 2.3 percent to $91.70 while shares of Chevron  dropped 3.7 percent to $106.80.
The energy index is now down 12.8 percent for the year and is the only major S&P sectors in negative territory for 2014. [O/R] The S&P 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far.
Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market.
Meanwhile several of the year's biggest gainers also sold off, possibly due to year-end profit-taking, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among them, Apple  was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro  shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65.
"This has been a monster market, and it's been eking out new records. So it's taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done," said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69.
The tumble follows gains Friday, which had pushed the S&P 500 to a record high close for the 49th time this year.
Volume picked up after midday, while the S&P 500 moved more than 21 points from its high for the day to its low, its largest high-to-low swing in more than a month.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 71 more stocks made 52-week lows compared with those making new highs, the largest gap skewed in favor of new lows since Oct. 16, the day after the market made its bottom in the recent pullback.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 919, for a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,048 issues fell and 699 advanced for a 2.93-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
McDonald's  shares shed 3.8 percent to $92.61 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a steeper-than-expected fall in global same-restaurant sales in November and said fourth-quarter results would be hurt by a supplier scandal in China and a stronger dollar.
About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Give preference to existing coal block allottees in auction: AssochamGive preference to existing coal block allottees in auction: Assocham

New Delhi, October 27:  
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) has suggested that the Government should give preference to companies that have an operational or soon to be operational end-use project but have had their coal blocks cancelled.
Assocham has written to the Prime Minister’s Office saying that coal blocks already allotted for end-use steel projects should be auctioned only for steel projects while those for power projects should be auctioned only for power projects.
“The reserve price and upfront payment should be based on the actual mineable resource and not on the basis of geological reserves,” said the industry chamber in a statement.
“Clearances accorded to the existing coal blocks should automatically get transferred to the new allottees. Obtaining these clearances again will lead to considerable delays in commencement of production from mines and adversely affect the end-use project,” the statement added.

IDBI Federal Life to step up focus on group insurance  online productsIDBI Federal Life to step up focus on group insurance, online products
G Naga Sridhar
Want to be a multi-channel company, says CEO
Hyderabad, October 27:  
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Company is entering the group insurance space and also planning to file for an online product soon, according to its Chief Executive Officer and whole-time director, Vighnesh Shahane.
“We want to be a multi-channel company and these are areas which are growing in the industry,” Shahane told BusinessLine.
The company, which is a joint venture between the IDBI Bank, Federal Bank and European insurance major Ageas, is also building up a team for promoting its group insurance products. IDBI Federal Life now has an over 11,000-strong agency, besides a direct sales force of 250.
On the positive sentiment in the industry , the CEO said: “This is driven by a positive regulatory regime at the moment, the buzz about increase in the Foreign Direct Investment limit to 49 per cent and a stable political situation.”
The life insurance industry might register single-digit growth in the current financial year, he added. However, Shahane also sees challenges for the industry in the form trust deficit and sustaining cost-rationalisation ratios.
Interest in ULIPs returning
The unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs), which witnessed a steep fall after the regulator had brought in new norms, including cap on commission for agents in 2010, are also staging a comeback. “We can’t exactly quantify this at the moment but there is greater awareness on ULIPs now than earlier among the customers,” he added.
Recently, the bank-allied company launched a unit-linked endowment product christened Wealthsurance Suvidha Growth Insurance Plan aimed at the first-time ULIP customer and two other plans that offer guaranteed returns.
On capitalisation plans, he said there was no immediate need for the capital as the solvency margin was 472 per cent for the company as against the regulatory requirement of 150 per cent.
Claims
IDBI Federal’s claims settlement ratio was 90 per cent last financial year. The repudiation ratio came to down to 5.47 per cent during the period as against 16 per cent in the previous year.
“We have also recently launched eight-day claim settlement guarantee. If a claim is not settled within this period, we will pay 8 per cent interest on death benefit,” Shahane said.
The guarantee is applicable if the policy has completed two years from the date of the policy inception to date of death of the life insurance and if the claim did not warrant any further investigation.

Indian Army celebrates 65th InfantryDayPrint
By: Express News Service | Udhampur | Posted: October 27, 2014 9:02 pm
To remember and honour all those members of the Infantry who made the supreme sacrifice fighting Pakistani Raiders in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947, the Indian Army celebrated 65th Infantry Day with traditional solemnity and gaiety all across the Northern Command on Monday.
Lt General HJS Sachdev, Chief of Staff of the Northern Command, laid wreath on the “Dhruva Shahid Smarak’’ in Udhampur, the defence ministry spokesman based at Udhampur based Northern Command Headquarters, Colonel S D Goswami said. Similar memorial services were held all over the state, he said, adding that the celebrations were marked by laying of wreath at war memoraisl, sainik sammelans and sainik bhojs.
October 27 is celebrated as Infantry Day by the Indian Army as it was on this day that an Infantry  Company of the First Battalion of the SIKH Regiment was airlifted from Delhi to Srinagar to liberate Kashmir from the invading tribals who were supported by Pakistan Army. This action was ordered by then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehry after Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession acceding Jammu Kashmir to India.
Another significance of October 27 is that it was on this day in 1947 that India as an independent nation was first time engaged in operations against an aggressor, the spokesman pointed out.
Giving details, the spokesman said that Pakistan Army had launched “Operation Gulmarg” in early October 1947 using tribals to annex Jammu Kashmir. Hostalities began when a tribal rebellion was instigated in Poonch in South-West Kashmir. By October 20, the Pakistan Army entered the conflict in support of tribal forces.
As nearly 5,000 tribals supported by Pakistan Army invaded Kashmir Valley from Abbottabad on October 22, Maharaja Hari Singh on October 26 signed the Instrument of Accession thus making the state an integral part of India making Nehru to order Indian Army evict the invaders. The entire campaign was predominantly Infantry centric and its commencement on October 27, 1947 is commemorated as Infantry day, the spokesman said.
In his message to the Infantry, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Northern Command and senior most Infantry officer in the region, Lt General D S Hooda, complimented all the infantrymen for the devotion to duty and indomitable spirit while working under trying and difficult conditions. He acknowledged their tremendous contribution in maintaining the sanctity of the nation’s borders and fighting terrorism in Jammu Kashmir.

In some cases in urban areas, family members were away on work when the bank representatives visited their houses. Another round of visit would be made to such houses, he said.
On October 25, banks conducted mega camps in 15 locations in the district to open accounts, he said.
Banks in the district, along with the Dakshina Kannada district administration, are planning to open accounts to all the households in the district by the first week of November. With that, the district would achieve the milestone of covering 100 per cent households under the scheme, he added.

Supreme Court panel slams Rajasthan govt  orders mining ban in areas nearSariskaWhile barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. (Source: PTI photo)
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: October 27, 2014 9:34 pm
The central empowered committee of the Supreme Court has asked the Rajasthan government to immediately stop mining activities allowed around Sariska in “blatant violation” of the court’s orders and name the officers responsible so that “appropriate action” can be taken against them.
The decision to allow mining activities within one kilometre of the Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was taken at a meeting chaired by then acting chief secretary of Rajasthan C S Rajan on December 4, three days after the Assembly polls. “I do not recall that file. I can’t comment as I am not privy to the developments in this issue since last year,” Rajan told The Indian Express.
According to the forest department, there are 84 mines within one kilometre of Sariska tiger reserve and Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary.
While barring mining around national parks and sanctuaries, the SC, in its August 2006 order, ruled that as an interim measure a one-kilometre radius be maintained as a safety zone. This April, the apex court’s order in the Goa mining case made it clear that the 2006 order “has not been varied subsequently nor any orders made regarding Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary” and that “the order passed by this court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometre safety zone around national park or wildlife sanctuary has to be enforced”.
Referring to the two rulings, the SC panel sent a letter to the Rajasthan government on October 21, pointing out that the state, in blatant violation of the apex court’s directions, permitted mining close to national parks and sanctuaries by reducing the safety zone limit from one kilometre to 100 metres and sought the names of the officials who gave the go-ahead. A copy of the letter has been accessed by The Indian Express.
The effort to sidestep the SC’s 2006 order began in 2008 when the Rajasthan mines department referred to a 2003 communication of the central empowered committee that had recommended resumption of mining only after the boundary of Jamua Ramgarh sanctuary was demarcated on the ground. Claiming that the demarcation was complete, the state permitted mining outside the periphery of 100 metres of the sanctuary.
In 2011, when Rajasthan prepared a draft notification for eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around its national parks and sanctuaries, it stuck to a 100-metre safety zone in the mining areas around Sariska. While the ESZ proposal has been under the SC’s consideration, the mining department, in January 2013, again referred to the 2003 CEC recommendation to justify allowing mining outside 100 metres of the sanctuary. continued…

Ever since Ebola first “arrived” in the U.S. from West Africa a few months ago via doctor Kent Brantly, an increasingly charged debate has engulfed its domestic containment policy, and now, one week ahead of the mid-term elections, a spat between federal and state governments over quarantine protocols threatens to politicise the issue further.
The latest turn of events came after Kaci Hickox, a Sierra Leone-returned nurse placed under mandatory 21-day quarantine in New Jersey despite testing negative twice for the deadly virus and not showing any symptoms, criticised the “knee-jerk reaction by politicians” to Ebola, saying, “to quarantine someone without a better plan in place, without more forethought, is just preposterous.”
Over the weekend Ms. Hickox’s lawyer said to media that she planned to file a federal lawsuit challenging her confinement as a violation of her civil rights, especially as it raised “serious constitutional and civil liberties issues… [and] the [quarantine] policy is overly broad when applied to her.”
On Monday morning, however, the New Jersey Department of Health issued a statement this morning that Ms. Hickox has been “symptom-free for the last 24 hours,” and that it decided to discharge her after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Her release appeared to be a reversal by the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who had earlier defended the quarantine order but said this week that “when she has time to reflect, she will understand” the quarantine.
Meanwhile in neighbouring New York State, Governor Andrew Cuomo revised the quarantine policy for returning health-care workers from West African nations after facing heightened pressure from the Obama administration to loosen the rules.
Explaining the protocols Mr. Cuomo said that healthcare workers who had been in contact with Ebola patients but did not show symptoms of the virus could return home but will be required to remain there while being monitored by state health officials for symptoms. They would, however, be allowed to interact with family and friends while being monitored, he added.
Meanwhile both parties appeared to be inserting the Ebola issue into their statements leading to the November 4 mid-term elections.
Republicans, who are fighting to gain control of the Senate and thus capture both houses of Congress, have focused on criticising the President Barack Obama’s response and blaming the White House for the confirmed Ebola cases on domestic soil.
Some Democrats have responded by claiming that Republican spending cuts have made the problem worse, and others accused conservatives of fear-mongering.
An poll by the Associated Press and GfK noted that Ebola was uppermost voters’ minds as Election Day approached, with 74 per cent considering it “very or extremely important, and 56 per cent expressing disapproval of the administration’s response.

Mumbai, October 27:  
The Shiv Sena has decided to bury the hatchet and team up with the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra. The change in mindset was reflected in a “soft” editorial published in Monday’s edition of Saamana, the Sena’s newspaper that is often considered its mouthpiece.
The daily is usually used as a platform to take positions on important social and political issues by the party’s bigwigs. Its tone reflects the thinking of the party leadership. It may be recalled that during the election and the results announcement, the Saamana, in its editorials, had repeatedly attacked the BJP leadership.
In Monday’s editorial, however, the Sena said that rather than the Congress and the NCP, it is better to have a BJP government.
Obliquely referring to the issue of a separate Vidarbha State, which has been supported by a few BJP leaders, the editorial stuck to its stand of not splitting Maharashtra. It said the new Chief Minister should put aside his political views and work for the unity of the State.
In the past, the Shiv Sena has vehemently opposed the formation of Vidarbha on the lines of Telangana. It had warned that such a move could lead to dissatisfaction among the people.
The editorial said that on Laxmi Pooja day (October 23), Maharashtra BJP president Devendra Fadnavis met Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and took his blessings. Later, Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings. All these blessings are important, the editorial said, adding that the support of the people is the most important.
It further said Gadkari has the requisite experience to become the CM, but the final decision would be taken by the high command in Delhi.
Although Fadnavis has no experience in governance, the editorial said, he has a good grip on legislative matters.
The editorial summarised that the Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who would take Maharashtra ahead.

Charges levelled Delhi Congress leaders coming out of the police headquarters after meeting the Police Commissioner on the Trilokpuri riot issue, in New Delhi on Monday. SHANKER CHAKRAVARTY
Accuses Centre of inaction, connivance
New Delhi, October 27:  
The Congress has demanded the resignation of Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Lieutenant General of Delhi Najeeb Jung over the recent violence in the Trilokpuri area of Delhi.
Trilokpuri witnessed riots and communal tension last week following a petty altercation between some Dalits and Muslims on Diwali evening.
The Congress alleged that Rajnath and Jung were inactive and soft towards the perpetuators of violence despite intelligence agencies giving prior information about possible violence in the area.
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said there was a pattern in the violence. “We are very sad but very forthright in asking why is this pattern, this repetition, this systemic pattern occurring before elections in so many parts of the country with monotonous regularity, especially in the last five months or so. We condemn this, we want to tell the nation that what is happening is a combination of subtle imagery of hidden symbolism, of innuendo, of insinuation, of provocation all this is made into a cocktail to create a surcharged atmosphere,” he said.
Singhvi further said the “violence” pattern used across the country is unmistakable. “It is deplorable, it is condemnable and it is especially condemnable because it is under the nose of the Central Government, the Home Minister and the Prime Minster. And Delhi, as you know, remains in suspended animation,” he said.
He questioned the role of former BJP MLA Sunil Kumar Vaidya in the incident. “At the minimum an impartial, independent enquiry by an unconnected third entity is necessary. What is the role of Sunil Kumar Vaidya needs to be answered.
“Why this blame game and back-forth transfer of allegations about advance information supposedly given by the Central Government to Delhi Police, and either not acted upon or not received, according to the letter?” he asked.
He added that the AAP MLAs from the area were silent about the happenings in Trilokpuri.

New Delhi, October 27:  
Determined to convert its electoral success into expanding the party’s mass base, the BJP is set to launch a new membership drive to add “recording-breaking” numbers to its current strength of 3.5 crore members.
To launch the drive, titled “Sashakt BJP, Sashakt Bharat”, on November 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s membership will be renewed by party president Amit Shah, who too will renew his primary membership.
Besides manually filling membership forms, the party will facilitate the drive by encouraging online/mobile registration. To inaugurate this service, Modi will send a text message to Shah and renew his membership.
“We have found a new strength and, in Narendra Modi, a true mass leader. People want to follow him and the BJP will make all efforts to convert this enthusiasm into a mass movement for a transformation in the national character.
“The party will find a new strength. We expect people to join en masse,” said BJP general secretary JP Nadda at a press conference here.
According to Nadda, the new members will be automatically located and linked to their respective polling booths to aid in the party’s efforts to strengthen its base from the primary electoral unit.
To hold workshops
The BJP is holding three separate workshops — the first to cover its southern and western units on November 29 in Bangalore, the second for northern and central units in Delhi on November 30, and the third in Kolkata to cover the eastern and north-eastern units.
However, the party does not seem to have a screening process for its new members.
“For the moment, the priority is to increase our strength. The process of filtering and screening new members gets automatically done when primary members become active members,” said Nadda.

Party retains tough stance against likely ally Shiv Sena
New Delhi/Mumbai, October 27:  
In the ongoing political brinkmanship in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena seemed more willing on Monday to cede ground to the BJP.
Giving nothing away, BJP leaders in Delhi maintained that the party is ready to run a minority government if the Sena is not willing to join the alliance unconditionally.
At present, the BJP holds all the cards for two main reasons — the outside support offered by Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and the fact that without the BJP’s support, the Sena cannot continue to rule the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) besides many other local bodies.
However, the tough posturing does not rule out the possibility of the Sena joining the State Government. After all, the BJP has not yet withdrawn support to the Sena in the BMC. Nor has it sacked Sena minister Anant Geete from the Union Cabinet.
These, and the fact that Sena MPs were invited to a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, indicate that the BJP is still open to the Sena joining the government in Maharashtra.
For the moment, the party is tight-lipped on how far negotiations with the Sena have progressed. “There is no negotiation. The Sena basically has no option. They will come around before the swearing-in,” said a BJP source.
The BJP’s central observers, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and party general secretary JP Nadda, will visit Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon.
The Maharashtra BJP legislature party is scheduled to meet at 4 pm on Tuesday, when it will elect its leader. In all likelihood, Devendra Fadnavis will be elected and his perceived rival Nitin Gadakari may propose his name, apparently to snuff factionalism in the party.
Following the meeting of the legislature party, the party will stake its claim to form the government. It may happen on Tuesday night or the next day, October 29. The Maharashtra government is expected to be sworn in by Friday.
Meanwhile, the Sena was clearly showing signs of recognising the BJP’s dominant role in the alliance. It admitted that the Chief Minister’s post belongs to the BJP.
“On the day of Laxmi Pooja, (Devendra) Fadnavis met (Nitin) Gadkari and took his blessings. Later Gadkari met the RSS chief and took his blessings.
“All these blessings are undoubtedly important, but the blessings of the people are the most important. Shiv Sena is ready to support anyone who will take Maharashtra ahead with the blessings of the people,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.
BJP MLA is dead
Even as the BJP was preparing for government formation, it received a setback in the sudden death of the party’s newly-elected MLA, Govind Rathod. He passed away late on Sunday evening following a massive heart attack, bringing down the strength of the BJP in the Maharashtra Assembly to 121.
Rathod was elected to Assembly from Mukhed, near Nanded city. He suffered a stroke while travelling on Devgiri Express to Mumbai. After the attack, he was admitted to a hospital in Jalna, central Maharashtra, but did not survive.
Fadnavis, along with other leaders, hurriedly cancelled all previous engagements and rushed to Mukhed on Monday.
Rathod’s sudden death led the party to reschedule the swearing in ceremony to Friday, party sources said.
It was earlier planned for Wednesday morning.

'Over the last three decades, people have become so aware of the connection between health and food.'
Back in 1995, CEO  Gary Hirshberg  told Inc. about a “friendly note” on every yogurt container Stonyfield Farm sold that encouraged customers to contact his company. Today, the channels of communication may have changed — along with nearly everything else in the U.S.  food and beverage  industry — but the importance of tapping into consumers' experiences and expectations hasn't. Inc. discussed these makeovers with the industry's veterans and newcomers.
In a conversation with  Bo Burlingham.
One study shows 90 percent of consumers are choosing local, at least occasionally. - Gary Hirshberg
WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT “THE FOOD REVOLUTION.” HAS THERE REALLY BEEN ONE AND, IF SO, HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT? 
Gary Hirshberg: No question there's been one. When we started selling organic yogurt in 1983, nobody knew what we were talking about. I often say, we had a wonderful business back then; we just had no supply and no demand. But the world has changed. People want a high-quality product, whether it's in a restaurant or by a processor or from a farm. They want it produced by somebody they trust. And they are demanding transparency. One study shows 90 percent of consumers are choosing local, at least occasionally. It's no longer just in the top foodie markets like New York and San Francisco. Now, it's everywhere.
Danny Meyer: I think one sign of the food revolution is that people like us chose to get into this business. None of our parents would have said, “My son, the future lawyer, should really open a restaurant, or a brewery, or a tea company.”
8
Myra Goodman: I look at it a little bit more from the consumer perspective. When my husband and I started Earthbound Farm in 1984, our choice to go organic really came from learning about the chemicals used in farming. We were just personally afraid to use these chemicals and eat food grown with them, and we didn't want to sell this food from our roadside stands to our consumers. People thought we were pretty crazy. But over the last three decades, people have become so aware of the connection between health and food. They realize you can really improve your health with your diet.
Ari Weinzweig: Yes, but remember, there are whole parts of the country that wouldn't know what we're talking about. Many of us live in a bubble. In our world, without question, people are much more interested in traditionally made foods and food that tastes better, and they don't mind spending money for it. The cheeses that were really high-end when we opened in 1982 are now supermarket offerings. The stuff we had back then that was pretty good, we wouldn't even carry anymore, because our market has evolved so much.
Steve Hindy: When I started selling Brooklyn Lager in New York City in 1988, a lot of people almost spit it out. They said, “My God! It's so dark and bitter. Why don't you make a beer like Heineken?” Today, Brooklyn Lager is considered a mainstream, entry-level craft beer.
0
Seth Goldman: I see people connecting the dots. They want to understand who's involved, all the way down to picking the tea leaves, and then all the way to the other side: What happens to the package? As Gary likes to say, “There's no such thing as ‘away.’” So where does it go once it's done? We're now owned by Coca-Cola, and they have really embraced this change. They have to, because it's going to happen with them or without them. I don't think Coca-Cola is intrinsically a company trying to create more demand for organic beverages, but they're supporting Honest Tea's distribution and growth. As a result of what we're doing, when we become larger, we are helping to create more demand for organic beverages.
Weinzweig: Yes, and you have companies like Chipotle coming into the middle of the market. For fast food, it is very high-end. That raises the bar as well, which is great. I think people will continue to eat better food because it tastes better, and you feel better. The challenge is that most people haven't really experienced it.
Meyer: And remember that McDonald's owned around 90 percent of Chipotle at one time. I'm not sure Chipotle would otherwise have had the fuel it needed to become the independent company that has, more than any other company, changed what America expects from fast food.
People will give you one shot. If it’s not yummy, they’re not coming back. - Danny Meyer
Matt Salzberg: Food is just more fun now. You look at the Food Network and the rise of celebrity chefs, and food is a lot more aspirational, from a consumer perspective, than it used to be. Our customers at Blue Apron are actually a part of our product. We deliver recipes and ingredients, and then they cook at home. A lot of what we sell is that experience of cooking and being closer to your food and having fun while doing it, trying new things, trying new recipes, trying new ingredients. People find that variety to be fun, and I think that's also what's driving a lot of the innovation in food products. There's just greater interest in food than ever before.
HOW HAS THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CHANGED?
Meyer: People are interested in customizing their experiences in life, whether it's on a mobile phone with their apps or what they ask for in a restaurant. It's almost like, “Yeah, I see your menu, but here's how I'm going to eat.” The whole experience has changed. It used to be that when someone reserved a table for four at 8 o'clock, you could expect four people. Today a table for four is really a table for eight: four people plus their cell phones, for taking photographs. It's almost unusual if people are not photographing their food and then sharing it in real time with someone else who is not physically present.
Hirshberg: I'm not sure how many people are photographing my yogurt, but there's no question that the consumer has shifted on us as well. People switch to eating more organic for two reasons: having children and having a health event, usually cancer, which is not a good thing but does work in the favor of organics. These shifts create opportunities. Look at Greek yogurt. It wasn't even here five or six years ago, and now it's 50 percent of the category. On the yogurt shelf and the tea shelf, we're seeing far more diversity, far more choice, and I think social media has had a lot to do with it. We producers are now able, without expensive market research, to get a sense of what our consumer wants, in real time.
Hindy: I agree that social media has had a huge impact. You can start a little brewery in the middle of nowhere today, and everyone you want to reach will know about it before it even opens.
8
Salzberg: Our business probably wouldn't have existed without social media. Blue Apron is an Internet business. We have a direct relationship with our customers every week. A huge percentage of our new customers come from referrals from friends, from photos on Facebook, from the constant communication that we have back and forth with our customers on our website. In the process, we're building up trust, which has been really important from a marketing perspective, because there's so much competition and so many choices. A lot of consumers now are looking for a curated experience, and that's one of the things that we built into our model. Every week we offer some choice and some preferences, taking into account people's dietary restrictions and the like. But for a lot of people, it's actually a liberating experience to say, “Hey, we trust your brand. We believe you will do a good job managing our refrigerator and helping plan our meals.” The constant communication is one of the things that really drives the emotional connection and the affinity that people have for our business.
0
Meyer: Let's not forget that discovery has always been a huge part of the joy of eating. In the old days, if I discovered a dish I had never heard about before, I had to work really hard — without the benefit of a GPS or a language translator — to find the recipe somewhere, bring it back, and figure out how to get the ingredients to cook it the right way. Today, it's harder and harder to discover something that the rest of the world has not already discovered and broadcast via social media. That's a challenge to the people who are bushwhackers in the field. They take all the initial wind in their face and establish a brand, and the thanks they get is 25 upstart competitors who actually benefit from being new.
IS IT HARDER OR EASIER TO START A FOOD BUSINESS TODAY?
Hirshberg: Much easier. Most of us were thought of as crazy people when we started. Now, people demand the kind of craftsmanship we're all bringing to the table. And with social media, you can get the word out much more easily.
Goodman: The opportunities are there with social media, with people looking for the discovery Danny's talking about. Also, small companies are so much more agile, and they can create custom products. There are the people who have allergies or are sensitive to gluten and don't want to eat certain grains. There are so many custom diets that food companies can respond to and develop a little niche in. You also have big companies looking for entrepreneurs to do their innovation.
Goldman: I guess it's easier, but in my industry it's all about distribution, which is really challenging to break into. It's not hard to start a company. Today there's money, a lot of ideas and opportunities, but it's hard to scale, because distribution is so consolidated and shelf space so limited. We see a lot of companies get up and running, but then can't figure out how to cross over into profitability and scale their supply chain.
Hindy: The beer industry is different, though. Today, big beer distributors from coast to coast are very aggressively pursuing craft brewers, and that's a sea change. We had to distribute our own beer and a lot of other craft beers here in New York City for 15 years, because the big distributors wouldn't give us the time of day.
Salzberg: Before starting Blue Apron, I was in the venture capital business, and I spent a lot of time looking at people starting companies. It's without a doubt easier today than it's been in the past. Capital is available, and you need less of it to get started. Food is actually a little more capital-intensive than the typical business, but capital costs are coming down. And there's more risk taking in the work force. In the past, it was difficult to attract people to an unknown young company. Today, it's often an advantage for early companies, because people are excited to join you if they care about your cause.
Meyer: When I first got into business, there was a statistic that two out of every three restaurants would fail in the first six months. Why? Because it took at least a year for people to figure out that you were there. Today, you could get photographed looking at a vacant store and read that night on some food blog that you're opening a restaurant. That leads to the opposite problem for us. When we launch a restaurant, we are not nearly as good as we will become. So it's easier to launch, but there is so much early attention that you're at risk of exposing yourself more quickly than you like. Because people will give you one shot. If it's not yummy, they're not coming back.
Hindy: Beer drinkers were very forgiving to the first wave of craft brewers, who didn't yet have it right. Today, people know what craft beer is, what it's supposed to taste like. If it doesn't, they're not going to buy it a second time. So the bar's a lot higher for quality, but people keep pouring into this business. What's interesting is the success rate. If you take all the production breweries from Day One, 70 percent of them are still in business, and 50 percent of the brewery-restaurants are still in business. There will definitely be a reckoning one of these days, but I think it's going to take a while.

Where the wildflowers areYumthang overrun by tube lousewort. Thingnam Girija
Lofty ideals: A stark corner of the Lachung Valley. Mahima Jain
In the sleepy valleys and villages of north Sikkim, the landscape may be cold, stark and imposing, but the people are quite the opposite
We are on the eastern range of the Himalayas in north Sikkim. Winding, potholed roads crisscross steep slopes, with our destination nowhere in sight. Waterfalls and brooks appear more frequently than roadside eateries and villages; one is even nicknamed the Amitabh Bachchan waterfall.
The tributaries of Teesta, and often the Teesta herself, are our silent companions, flowing at times along the road, and at others, gushing in the deep ravines below.
Nepali songs play in the background as villages, snow-capped peaks and Buddhist flags pass us by. We make a quick stop for momos and chai. And then it begins all over again. Lachung is a long way off.
Lachung, primarily an agricultural village, opened for tourists in the early ’90s. And what it offers is rather simple: a chance to go off the grid and explore nature’s contradictions.
There is no network coverage — save for some sporadic BSNL connectivity — making it a perfect hideaway for those who seek quiet.
Lachung, or small pass, is almost 110km from Gangtok, and the eight-hour journey requires a permit because of the village-town’s proximity to the China border. Locals, called Lachungpas, mostly Bhutias and Lepchas, say there are less than 2,500 people and around 400 houses in Lachung. At 8,200ft, resources are scarce and the military presence heavy.
It is evening by the time we make it to Lachung. The ‘hotel’ is small. After handing over the keys, the sole manager-cum-housekeeper warns, “Madam, if you look for luxury and comfort, this is hell, but if you look for nature and peace, this is jannat (heaven).” His former claim turns out to be too self-deprecatory. The place has a decent television set, running water and clean beds and towels, though there is no room heater, hot water or room service.
Next morning, we head to the Yumthang Valley (13,800ft), the Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary and Yumesamdong (Zero Point at 15,300ft). These destinations are only a couple of hours away and the drive is a visual treat, the scenery alternating between monochrome and technicolour.
The sanctuary and the Yumthang Valley are a riot of colours. Rhododendrons and Himalayan wildflowers, Buddhist prayer flags, and tiny huts made of wood and tin dot the grassy river banks and slopes. Local stalls offering Tibetan and Buddhist memorabilia, Maggi noodles, Old Monk, and winterwear for hire, slowly give way to sombre military outposts.
Yumesamdong is grave, black and white. A perpetual cover of clouds casts a shadow over the freezing upper course of the river that makes its way across a rocky plain with bare snow-capped mountains framing and feeding it. A gloomy path to nowhere lies ahead. The temperature in Lachung and its surrounding areas can be sub-zero in winter. But Yumesamdong is colder still. Often, snow and thick ice abruptly block the road leading to it.
No one lives near or beyond this region — often referred to as ‘no man’s land’ — so no one really bothers to clear the road either. The landscape is cold, stark and imposing, but the people are quite the opposite. It is perhaps, the warmth of the Lachungpas alone that keeps the place humane.
We leave Yumesamdong and descend to the more welcoming Yumthang Valley and the Shingba Sanctuary. There are various flower-trails here and a day is too short to explore everything. Over the years, these valleys and the Lachungpas have hosted many botany enthusiasts, who have visited the region to record and collect samples of plants.
The first such explorer to travel through Sikkim was Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, a Victorian botanist and former director of Britain’s Kew Gardens, who was also known for his collaborations with Charles Darwin and Sir James Clark Ross, who explored the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
The Joseph Hooker Correspondence Project, currently underway and supported by Kew, is now working towards digitising his letters and other works. A post by Virgina Mills, the project coordinator, explains that Hooker was in Sikkim between 1848 and 1849, looking for ‘plant treasure’ to send back to his father William Hooker, Kew’s first director. He discovered 25 new species of rhododendron that were added to the collection at Kew.
Joseph Hooker, an amateur artist who sketched the flowers and landscapes he saw and made Sikkim’s first map, is also believed to have started and fuelled the craze for rhododendrons in British gardens.
The fascination for rhododendrons and Himalayan flowers hasn’t diminished in the 21st century. Back home, I search for and find a modern-day Joseph Hooker. Tabish Qureshi, professor of physics at Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi and self-professed anthomaniac, visited Yumthang Valley and the Sanctuary in June 2011 to observe and document the flowers.
Rhododendrons bloom in April-May, Himalayan flowers in June. Qureshi, who is the founder of the website flowersofindia.net, says his companions and he spotted the rare Himalayan Yellow Poppy in full bloom. In one visit, lasting only a couple of hours, he noticed flowers such as white and blue avens, Griffith’s cobra lily, yellow buttercups and cinqefoils, pink geraniums and pedicularis (or louseworts), forget-me-nots, red Himalayan strawberries, Himalayan roses and Webb’s rose, to name a few.
Even if one needs a handbook to identify the flowers in the vast valley, the simple pleasure of walking down to the river, sitting on a boulder surrounded by blooms and watching the clouds playing hide-and-seek with the Himalayas is unparalleled.
Having spent more time admiring the Himalayan peaks, we are left with little time for the flower trails in Yumthang. Since these are largely deserted areas, it is mandatory to return by late noon. We are just beginning to appreciate the valley and the walk to the river, when we are ushered back to our car.
The next day, during the arduous journey back to Gangtok, I am reminded of how Hooker must have travelled more than a century ago, and the thought makes the bad roads appear less hostile. A few hours out of Lachung, the mobiles start buzzing, and the silence offered by the monochrome and technicolour landscapes is now far behind. It is time to switch on and stay connected.

PSU refiners ‘must strategise’ better to improve margins
Richa Mishra
Minister Of State (Independent Charge) Petroleum, Dharmendra Pradhan
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan says companies must diversify crude basket, upgrade plants for superior price realisation
With the contentious issue of gas pricing and diesel deregulation behind him, Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of State (Indepenédent Charge) Ministry for Petroleum & Natural Gas, is now focussed on coming out with a mechanism that will help PSU refiners source crude oil at better rates and enhance their gross refinery margin (GRM).
Clear that oil and gas sector will be dominated by public sector entities, Pradhan, in conversation with BusinessLine just before leaving for Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, said the Government is only a facilitator. Commercial decisions have to be taken by companies. As with other fuel prices, every six months gas rates will also be decided by the companies based on the formula set out by the Government, he said. Edited Excerpts:
With two critical issues sorted out, are you now turning to the PSU refiners’ crude oil sourcing mechanism?
The spot crude oil sourcing mechanism should be dynamic. When market dynamics are in play, they will have to strategise how to source crude oil cheap and improve their refinery margins. Any business entity has to look into the cost of production and raw materials. These are the two aspects where things can be reworked according to the market dynamics.
Earlier, there was a limitation on processing of crude varieties due to their refinery configurations. But there are new technologies that allow refineries to process different kinds of crude. The PSU refineries should be in a position to process crude from Latin America to Africa. They need to not only diversify their crude basket but also upgrade their refineries to make it possible for them to get a better price realisation.
But experts say some of the PSU refineries have outlived their life…
It is true that the refineries are old, but technology is available. Each refinery will have its own benefits no matter how old it is. When market dynamics are in play, the refiners have to see how they can deliver the product at competitive rates. The GRM of PSUs is low and they need to improve it. The efficiency needs to go up and the way to do that is to bring technology and a smart economically viable procurement model for crude.
Is the Government open to public-private tie-ups for fuel retailing?
The private sector is satisfied with diesel de-regulation and has renewed its interest in retailing. The Government will not interfere if PSU oil marketing companies enter into joint ventures for retailing. They are into joint ventures for refineries, aren’t they?
Are you reworking the subsidy mechanism? (The subsidy burden will be restricted to LPG and kerosene now. ONGC disinvestment will be impacted by the subsidy issue.)
How the delivery mechanism for LPG subsidy will come, we are in discussions with the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG is a technology to deliver the subsidy. Right now, the subsidy is going to the companies. We plan to give it to the consumer directly.  Both diesel decontrol and Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG will help reduce the subsidy burden. If the subsidy burden overall comes down, then ONGC will also benefit. Once the burden comes down, then the sharing arrangement can also be reworked.
When is the tenth edition of oil and gas exploration licensing rounds to be announced?
Going by the experience of the previous nine rounds, we want to come out with a better system now. We have realised that availability of strong seismic data, a clarity on fiscal regime — whether revenue share or production sharing besides some administrative issues need to be resolved before we launch NELP-X. This is no breaking news so I can’t give a timeline.

Nows the time to buy cheaper growth storiesAnand Shah, CIO, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund
The CIO of BNP Paribas Mutual Fund is upbeat on private sector banks, cement and telecom
Markets will take a price correction over the next one year, before the actual execution of the Government's plans sparks the next jump, according to Anand Shah, CIO, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund. He believes that now is the right time to buy cheaper growth stories than pay too much premium for a safer bet.
What do you make of market valuations and earnings now?
Today, even after such a sharp run-up, the one-year forward price-earnings multiple is much lower. The market is just coming back to its mean multiple; it has not run up beyond its normal zone.
Still, this surge has come much before the actual earnings growth. Either there may be a price correction for the next one year or consolidation around these levels.
We believe economic recovery will be slow and gradual. Over the next two years, we’ll move to a 5.6 to 6 per cent growth in GDP. Along with that, inflation will slow down a little and we will see the start of the interest rate cycle cut. Then, in the next 12 to 18 months, there will be some visibility of earnings growth going back to where it historically used to be.
There can be sectors where, along with the volume growth that can give margin expansion, utilisation will improve and there will be a lot of operating leverage. For these sectors, over the next few years, even if the topline growth is 14-15 per cent, earnings growth can actually be around 18 per cent.
Isn’t the market already factoring all this in?
The big driver of the market a year-and-a-half later would be the actual execution of the new Government. That will lead to visibility of GDP growth, investment cycle revival, in turn leading to quicker earnings growth. I agree that for the market to rerate further, we need earnings growth visibility. And that hinges on the execution — that is, if expectation of government policies is pushing the market now, the actual execution will be the trigger, going ahead.
And this is coming out of the stagnation we’ve seen in the past five years. Assuming, of course, that execution happens.
What is the future of beleaguered sectors such as mining?
Frankly, it’s a tough call. You have to be very select in these sectors. Not all companies will be able to come out of the trouble they are in. Only a select few which have worthwhile operational assets and capex stuck only because of regulations will see some recovery. In fact, it’s not a sector call at all, but very stock-specific.
So which are the sector calls?
The simplest story is private sector banks. In the last 15 years or so, they have grown faster than the banking industry. And banking itself grows faster than the nominal GDP.
Another sector where the worst is really behind is telecom. Over the last six quarters, there has been a lot of sanity in pricing, lower discounts, improvement in realisations, expansion in margins and a reduction in competitive intensity.
The third sector which we believe will look good, but with a lag of maybe a quarter or two, is cement. Here, with demand picking up, there will be utilisation increase and operating leverage to play on, especially after so many years when the supply growth was higher than demand.
A large part of cement demand comes from rural housing, as there is a shift to pucca houses. For FMCG, IT and pharma sectors, earnings growth will be along their long-term averages. So they are good long-term bets.
However, if growth is higher in other components of the market and available cheaper, then there may be a phase for a year or two when they underperform.
Right now, people are paying a premium for stability and surety of earnings growth. But we believe that now, it is the right time to buy cheaper growth stories than pay too much premium for a safer bet.
What is the strategy of your mid-cap and large-cap funds? They have been consistent, even with the extreme volatility in markets.
In both BNP Paribas Mid-cap and Equity, the key objective is to identify companies which will grow earnings at a rate superior to the index earnings growth rate and which is sustainable at the same time. Both have equal weight.
In our Mid-cap fund, we look at three factors.
One, the leaders in an emerging sector, where the sector is so nascent that the leader can grow much faster. The second is the challengers in a developed industry — companies which can challenge the leader and so grow much faster than the sector.
The third are consolidators. This is where an industry is very fragmented and because of that, there is no large player.
So, as and when the industry consolidates and the number of players reduces, the bigger ones benefit.
However, there are not many opportunities like this. Cement is one example. In BNP Paribas Equity, we have 75-80 per cent in large-caps.

Black money: govt. names industrialists

The Hindu
The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that it has no intention to withhold names of persons who have stashed black money abroad.
TOPICS
corporate crime
Every account held in a foreign country may not be illegal: Centre
The Centre on Monday disclosed in the Supreme Court that Pradip Burman of Dabur, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya and Goa-based mining baron Radha Satish Timblo of Timblo Private Ltd. were among those who had stashed black money abroad.
Other Directors of Timblo — Chetan S. Timblo, Rohan S. Timblo and Mrs. Mallika R. Timblo were also named in the affidavit, ahead of the hearing on Tuesday.
While disclosing these names, the Centre sought modification of the May 1 apex court order to disclose all names of foreign account holders and pleaded that only those names against whom investigations had been completed and prosecution launched, should be disclosed. The court must consider whether in directing the disclosure of all names, international standards had been violated, the Centre said.
Stating that the disclosed names were received from French tax authorities and prosecution had been launched against them under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Centre’s affidavit said, “The government is committed to disclose names of persons holding illegal money abroad. However, every account held by an Indian in a foreign country may not be illegal and the fundamental right of citizens to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be ignored.”
The Centre argued that under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, confidentiality had to be maintained.
What they said:
“I have no account in the Swiss bank. I have no foreign bank account. I came to know about this from media.... I am shocked. ”
Pankaj Lodhya
 
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” ”
Spokesperson, Dabur
 
“I have not seen the affidavit. I need to study it before commenting anything on it. ”
Radha Timblo
 
“The list of those with accounts in banks abroad has several Congress members. I must make it clear there are no names of BJP members in the list”
G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson
 
“The present administration has resiled from this position and now after over three years is praying for modification/ clarification of the judgement and order of July 4, 2011 in connection with the disclosure regarding Liechtenstein Bank accounts of Indians ”
Ram Jethmalani, expelled BJP leader
 
“All foreign bank accounts cannot be termed as illegal... We will disclose only those names against whom we have prosecutable evidence”
Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister
 
““The government can disclose all the names on the list to the court as per law.”
Salman Khurshid., Senior Congress leader
 
“Only three persons in the country have blackmoney?”
Nitish Kumar, Former Bihar Chief Minister
 
“Government has to answer a lot of questions as there is a reluctance on its part to give out all the names. This shows that the government lacks the political will and determination to fulfil its election promises”
D Raja, CPI National Secretary
 
“If there is a (Congress) name, the individual concerned will answer it and it is not proper to take names from the podium of party office.”
Abhishek Singhvi, Congress spokesperson
 
“Who is the government trying to protect in the black money scandal? Is it playing politics to blackmail the culprits? BJP ministers are not being transparent. ”
Trinamool Congress
 
“The full list of those having black money in foreign banks should be made public. We are sure there will be names of BJP and Congress leaders in it”

Nurse detained under New Jerseys Ebola quarantine to be releasedBy Abby Ohlheiser and Cecilia Kang October 27 Follow @abbyohlheiser Follow @ceciliakang

After a weekend of exchanging sharp barbs with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a nurse who was detained and placed in isolation in the state after returning from West Africa was released .
“Since testing negative for Ebola early Saturday morning, the patient being monitored in isolation has thankfully been symptom free for the last 24 hrs,” the New Jersey Department of Public Health said in a statement. “After being evaluated by CDC & her clinicians the patient is being discharged.”
Kaci Hickox was the first health-care worker to be quarantined under a new policy in New York and New Jersey, shortly after it was announced that another health care worker who recently returned from the region tested positive for Ebola in New York City. During her isolation, Hickox  criticized her treatment by New Jersey officials as “inhumane” and lashed out at Christie.
On Monday, at a campaign event in Florida  for Gov. Rick Scott, Christie said he “didn’t reverse my decision” in releasing the nurse, adding, “She hadn’t had any symptoms for 24 hours. And she tested negative for Ebola. So there was no reason to keep her. The reason she was put into the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic.”
Earlier on Monday, Christie said  Hickox will understand his quarantine decision “when she has time to reflect.”
Hickox returned last week from Sierra Leone after working with Doctors Without Borders on the front lines of the Ebola epidemic. She was held in isolation in a tent at a New Jersey hospital over the weekend, despite having no symptoms of Ebola.
Writing about her isolation for the Dallas Morning News , Hickox said that her treatment after arriving at Newark was disorganized and troubling. “No one seemed to be in charge,” she wrote. “No one would tell me what was going on or what would happen to me.”
She was specifically critical of Christie, who had told reporters Saturday that Hickox was “obviously ill.”
“First of all, I don’t think he’s a doctor,” Hickox told CNN on Sunday , in an interview from her isolation tent. “For the first 12 hours, I was in shock. Now I’m angry.”
That same day, she hired civil rights attorney  Norman Siegel, who told NBC News  that Hickox planned to sue for her release.
Hickox will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine order while she is in the state, the health department statement said. “After consulting with her, she has requested transport to Maine,” the health agency said, noting that New Jersey officials have arranged for Hickox to leave the state in “a private carrier not via mass transit or commercial aircraft. Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives.”
Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said in a statement : “Upon the healthcare workers’ return home, we will follow the guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for medical workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients. Additionally, we will work with the healthcare worker to establish an in-home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other Mainers until the period for potential infection has passed.” 
After a doctor in New York tested positive for Ebola , Christie and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) issued strict quarantine procedures for all health-care workers returning from Ebola-stricken regions of West Africa. The doctor, Craig Spencer, had also recently returned from the region after working with Doctors Without Borders.
On Sunday evening, Cuomo revised his state’s initial quarantine procedures to allow asymptomatic health-care workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients to return to their homes, as long as they remain in isolation there.
Christie defended his state’s quarantine on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I don’t believe when you’re dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system,” Christie said. “The government’s job is to protect [the] safety and health of our citizens. And so we’ve taken this action, and I absolutely have no second thoughts about it.”
In Florida on Monday, after health officials announced that Hickox would be discharged, Christie,  according  to CNN , told reporters: “I know she didn’t want to be there. No one ever wants to be in the hospital, I suspect, and so I understand that. But the fact is I have a much greater, bigger responsibility to the people and the public.”
The news of Hickox’s release came shortly after health officials in New York announced that a 5-year-old boy who recently traveled from Guinea is at Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital awaiting test results for Ebola. According to an e-mailed statement from the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the child developed a fever Monday morning while already under observation at Bellevue. The department expects preliminary results within the next 12 hours.

The controversy surrounding the venue of the 81st Akhil Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelan ended on Monday, with the central committee of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) withdrawing permission given to Haveri district to hold the annual convention.
Pundalik Halambi, president of KSP, told The Hindu that the venue for the next convention would be decided at a meeting to be held at Belur in Hassan shortly. The committee took the decision to change the venue in view of the differences between Haveri and Ranebennur taluks.
Following an appeal made by the Haveri district president of KSP to review the decision, a meeting was convened at Motebennur on Sunday, which also ended on a sour note. “In the meeting held here on Monday, it was decided to withdraw permission given to Haveri and finalise the venue in the next executive committee meeting,” Mr. Halambi said.

Pankaj Lodhiya: The man who went missingAfter Centre’s affidavit on black money, Rajkot bullion trader turns elusive
Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya
Ahmedabad, October 27:  
After the Centre came out with its first instalment of disclosure on black money accounts in foreign banks, Rajkot, a sleepy town in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, suddenly came under the spotlight.
Of the three names that were mentioned by the Centre in its affidavit in the Supreme Court on Monday, one was of a non-descript bullion trader-cum-realtor—Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya.
Lodhiya, hailing from the Soni (goldsmith) community in Saurashtra, suddenly became the most sought-after person by the national media. An interview he gave in the morning to a private news channel was enough to make him ‘popular’.
Within hours of the broadcast of the interview, Lodhiya turned untraceable.
Lodhiya’s company, Shreeji Trading Co, has been mentioned in the Centre’s affidavit. The company, operating in bullion trading, has branches spread across six cities, including New Delhi, Jaipur, Raipur, Indore and Bangalore, with its head office located in the crowded commercial area of Diwanpara in Rajkot.
Lodhiya, in his early 50s, also runs two other companies under the Shreeji Group— Shreeji Ornaments Pvt Ltd, a manufacturer and trader of diamond jewellery, gold ornaments and silver articles; and Shreeji Realty, the construction arm of the Group.
Since morning on Monday, the offices remained closed as no phone calls on the landlines were responded. Lodhiya did not respond to mobile calls or text messages and even the emailed queries remained unanswered.
Apparently, in the TV interview, Lodhiya had mentioned: “I do not have any Swiss account. I have declared all assets and I have not been served any notice.”
He had also clarified to the reporters that he had submitted the details of his financial transaction before the Income-Tax department during recent scrutiny. He said he will react to the department once he is officially communicated about the issue.
Being one of the leading bullion traders in the region, Lodhiya’s alleged Swiss-bank connections have sent cold shivers across the bullion trading community in the region.
A jeweller from Rajkot told Business Line on condition of anonymity: “Their (Lodhiya’s) business interests in real estate and bullions indicate a direct link to route black money from one source to the other. But there are many such jewellers in Rajkot who have similar business combination. So, it first has to be verified and established, only then we can comment on his black money income.”
According to Shreeji Company’s website, “Shreeji Group initially started its business operations in the realty sector and then began its adventurous journey into the bullion business.”
The Website described Pankaj Lodhiya as the chief promoter of the Group, while it also mentioned the support “from father Chimanlal Laljibhai Lodhiya and his brother Kaushik Chimanlal Lodhiya,” in running the different business verticals. The bullion business was started about 15 years ago, but the journey had been a roller-coaster ride for Lodhiya. Trade sources claimed that the group had faced an Income-Tax raid about one-two years ago at its showrooms and offices.
‘Good reputation’
Yet, traders and jewellers maintained that Lodhiya enjoyed good reputation as he was one of the biggest gold/silver suppliers to small and medium jewellers and goldsmiths.
“Lodhiyas have a good reputation in the market. They are one of the leading bullion suppliers in the Saurashtra region,” said a bullion trade expert in Ahmedabad, also on condition of anonymity.
According to his website, the group dealt with the “important good delivery members of London Bullion Merchants Association and other international and national suppliers of bullion.
A leading bullion importer in Ahmedabad maintained that Lodhiyas had earned good name with diversified business interests ranging from jewellery making and exports, bullion trading and real estate.
