Money transactions via Bitcoins not safeMoney transactions via Bitcoins not safe
IANS     London   Last Updated: November 26, 2014  | 14:03 IST
Researchers have shown that money transactions via Bitcoin network do not protect user's IP address and it can be linked to the user's transactions in real-time.
The team demonstrated that only a few computers and about 1,500 euros (Rs 1,15000) are required to reveal the IP address behind each transaction.
Bitcoin is the "new money" - minted and exchanged on internet.
Faster and cheaper than a bank, the service is attracting attention from all over the world.
"It is hard to predict the future, but some people think that Bitcoin could do to finance what the internet did to communications," said professor Alex Biryukov, who leads digital currency research at the University of Luxembourg.
The Bitcoin system is not managed by a central authority as it relies on a peer-to-peer network on the internet.
Anyone can join the network as a user or provide computing capacity to process the transactions.
In the network, the user's identity is hidden behind a cryptographic pseudonym, which can be changed as often as is wanted.
Transactions are signed with this pseudonym and broadcast to the public network to verify their authenticity and attribute the Bitcoins to the new owner.
New findings showed that Bitcoin entry nodes, to which the user's computer connects in order to make a transaction, form a unique identifier for the duration of user's session.
This unique pattern can be linked to a user's IP address.
Transactions made during one session, even those made via unrelated pseudonyms, can be linked together.
With this method, hackers can reveal up to 60 per cent of the IP addresses behind the transactions made over the Bitcoin network.
"This analysis combined with previous research on transaction flows shows that the level of anonymity in the Bitcoin network is quite low", Biryukov noted.
The paper was recently presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.

Six years after 26/11  Pakistan has not changed its waysThe sixth anniversary of 26/11 attacks
By ANI | ANI –  Tue 25 Nov, 2014

Washington, Nov.25 (ANI): On the sixth anniversary of 26/11 attacks, India faces primarily two kinds of jihadist terror threats. One, as a society, it is witnessing the birth of self-radicalizing Muslim youth who are attracted to the jihadist call of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) led by Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. This radicalization can be countered by India's vibrant democracy, pluralism and alert parents.
On November 22, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval told a conference in New Delhi that 5-6 youth recently showed "inclination" to join the ISIS but their parents were first to contact the security agencies in preventing them from doing so. Doval's optimism must be encouraged.
Second, as a state, India faces a very old-and-new jihadist threat from Pakistan. In September, Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri announced the establishment of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).
The nature of 26/11 and 9/11 attacks reveal interesting characteristics. Both appear to have been planned by a single person or organization. On 9/11, the jihadists launched airborne invasions of U.S. cities.
On 26/11, they launched seaborne invasion of Mumbai. They used GPS technology to guide planes and boats to reach their targets. This pattern was demonstrated for a third time on September 6 when the AQIS attempted to take over Pakistani frigate PNS Zulfiqar in order to use it to attack US and Indian warships on the high seas.
The three attacks - 9/11, 26/11 and September 6 - indeed reveal a deep connection between Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani military's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). On November 22, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, speaking a few hours before Ajit Doval, said in Delhi: "Terrorism in India is fully Pakistan-sponsored. Pakistan says non-state actors are involved. But is ISI non-state actor?"
Although led by Arab terrorists, Al-Qaeda is fundamentally a Pakistani organization; it was formed in Pakistan in 1988; it is from Pakistan that it spread to the Middle East. Al-Qaeda is practically a branch of the ISI, which views itself as the ideological guardian of the Islamic state of Pakistan: both Al-Qaeda and the ISI share the same ideological objective - establishment of the Islamic Caliphate, with the only difference being that ISI wants Pakistan to be the head of such an international caliphate.
Evidence in the public domain demonstrates that the ISI and Al-Qaeda function in close cooperation. The ISI protected Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and continues to protect Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, who is also the top-most Al-Qaeda leader, given that all Taliban factions and Al-Qaeda affiliates have expressed an oath of allegiance to him as Emir-ul-Momineen (Leader of the Ummah). Protecting bin Laden in Abbottabad was in tune with the ISI's established policy, as also demonstrated in its protection of jihadist groups' headquarters Muzaffarabad, Bahawalpur and Muridke.
While the Pakistan Army carries out the facade of military operations in the tribal region, the Haqqani Network militants are found in Rawalpindi, not in Waziristan. In 2011, US military's top officer Admiral Mike Mullen described the Haqqani Network as the ISI's "veritable arm."
In the late-1980s, as the US was winding up its mission Afghanistan and the Soviets were to about leave, the ISI planned its next jihad in Jammu and Kashmir that peaked through the 1990s. During the 2000s, it tried to take its jihad to India's heartland by using the Indian Mujahideen.
In 2014, as the US is winding up its mission in Afghanistan, the ISI appears to be mounting its next jihadist mission. The establishment of AQIS means that Al-Qaeda is being used to advance the ISI's post-2014 strategy.
Through its early days to the 1980s, Pakistan sought to expand its sphere of Islamic influence through Afghanistan to Central Asia and got Pakistani citizens recruited in the Afghan government institutions in the 1990s when the Taliban were power. Now, it is looking eastward through India to Bangladesh and Myanmar to establish an imaginary caliphate. The AQIS is a Pakistani brainchild, not a product of' Arab mind.
Former ISI chiefs continue to work for the secret agency in informal capacities. Lt. Gen. Zahirul Islam, who stepped down recently as ISI chief, is reportedly involved in the establishment of Bol television channel. Lt. Gen. Shuja Pasha, another former ISI chief, was involved in directing the recent protests led by Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri. Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, on whose watch Al-Qaeda was established in Peshawar in 1988, remains involved with the ISI. Many times, journalists who went to meet Gul were told that he had gone to the GHQ, the general headquarters of Pakistan Army.
The use of jihadists in the Kargil War and 26/11 was planned when General Pervez Musharraf was in command, who would later elevate the first ISI chief to the post of army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani.
To Indians, the ISI's involvement in the 26/11 attacks is clear. To the world, the 9/11 attacks are blamed on Al-Qaeda, as it is considered undiplomatic to accuse nation-states of such involvement without police-like evidence.
Even if you look before the 9/11 attacks, an ISI connection is evident. It was relatively a short period from 1988 when Al-Qaeda was formed to 1993, when the CIA headquarters at Langley and World Trade Center (WTC) were first attacked. Al-Qaeda wasn't at peak then, and the 1993 attacks could not have been carried out without some form of state support, especially since footprints led back to Islamabad.
An excessive focus on footmen involved in specific jihadist attacks helps the ISI to escape global attention for its role in 1993 attacks on WTC and Langley, or in 9/11 and 26/11 attacks. As India remembers the Mumbai attacks this Wednesday, the jihadist threats are multiplying.
The following recent developments appear to originate from a concerted strategy from the ISI. First, the AQIS was established to target India. Second, Punjabi Taliban chief Asmatullah Muawiya announced ceasefire against Pakistan, vowing to fight in Afghanistan. Third, Pakistani media reported that Muawiya joined hands with the Haqqani Network, which is part of the Afghan Taliban. Fourth, Pakistan's national security advisor Sartaj Aziz commented that terrorist groups that are not dangerous to Pakistan must not be targeted. Fifth, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif joined this ISI strategy when he announced that Pakistan will talk first with Kashmiri secessionists before any dialogue with India.
The year 2014 is effectively 1988 when Al-Qaeda was formed and ISI's control of Pakistan's foreign policy was total.

PE funds eye consumption-focussed sectors  says DeloittePrivate equity funds eye consumption-focussed sectors, says Deloitte

Consultancy firm Deloitte said on Wednesday private equity funds continue to be bullish on domestic consumption focused sectors like e-commerce.
During the first nine months of the year, the country saw many as 460 deals valued at $8 billion driven by the e-commerce sector, as against 410 deals worth $8.5 billion in the whole of last year, the firm's report said.
"The appetite of PE funds would continue to be directed towards companies that benefit from the strength of domestic consumption," it said.
E-commerce, small retail, agriculture, healthcare, financial services, education and media and entertainment would be potential beneficiaries of this trend, it said.
Limited Partners (LPs), who invest in private equity funds, also re-draw their strategies due to recent developments like the bull-run on stocks markets after the formation of a stable, pro-reform government, it said.
"Growing domestic consumption, results of the recently concluded general elections that gave stability at the Centre and declining global commodity prices has created a trifecta to position the country once again as one of the top investment destinations in the world," Deloitte India Senior Director Kalpana Jain said.
Once the government's policy measure starts reflecting on the ground, there would be larger investment in the infrastructure, education, healthcare and renewables sectors, it said.
Though policymakers have called revival of growth "uneven", because of the lack of a linear path, investors are betting strongly on India due to expectations of a strong revival, it said.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday kicked off the State’s largest industrial investment in recent times, inaugurating the first 300 MW unit of a power plant at Haldia in the State’s Purba Medinipur district.
The first unit will start operations by December followed by the second unit in February 2015. Entailing an investment of around Rs. 4600 crores, by the RP Sanjiv Goenka Group, the project boasts of a 236 metre high transmission tower across a 1.5 km wide river. The towers were necessary for evacuating the power generated by the project and is among the highest such towers in the world.
Launching the project, the Chief Minister said assured the gathering that land will not be an issue for industry in West Bengal and wherever some disputes arose the State government moved in to resolve issues.
“Most issues can be resolved through talks,” she said making references to NPTC’s upcoming power project at Katwa in Bardhaman and the airport city project in Andal in same district.
She also said that her State had a land bank and also surplus power. “Industrial growth was on good track,” she said.
Stressing on the need to build a bridge between the employer and the employee, Ms. Banerjee said that this could be a way to avert problems before they escalate. Jute and tea were two sectors which were facing some problems, Ms. Banerjee said that matters could be solved through discussions.

SC says Chennai Super Kings should be disqualifiedMore
Why can't CSK be disqualified, asks Supreme Court
The court also said that the 'dual role' of MS Dhoni as the captain of CSK and vice president of India Cements is a matter of 'concern.'

Take that Mr. Srinivasan.The Supreme Court has asked the BCCI counsel whether the Chennai Super Kings franchise should be disqualified in order to sort out the conflict of interest issues pertaining to the 2013 IPL corruption case. In the latest hearing of the case, on Thursday morning, the Supreme Court special bench of Justice T S Thakur and F M Kalifullah also told counsel appearing for the BCCI and N Srinivasan that the BCCI annual general meeting scheduled for December 17 should go ahead but by 'standing aside' the individual included in the investigation of the IPL corruption case.
The court said the difference between Srinivasan's duty as president of the BCCI and his interest as an owner of an IPL team is "obvious". The court asked, "If there are so many anomalies, why can't the BCCI act according its rules and disqualify CSK?" Justice Thakur asked, "What is more valuable to Mr Srinivasan? Is it his office or his team?" The court also said that the "dual role" of MS Dhoni as the captain of CSK and vice president of India Cements is a matter of "concern."
The court said that BCCI must put an end to all its controversies and move to conduct the election because "the life of the BCCI board is over", the court said. The Board taking any decision around the findings of the Mudgal probe, the court said, "must be a board which is legitimately in place and not a board which exists due to fortuitous circumstances."
Justice Thakur opened the hearings this morning, and said, that the distinction between Srinivasan and India Cements "is getting to a vanishing point." Srinivasan's counsel was asked several details about India Cements, the owners of CSK. The court wanted to know who the real owners of India Cements were, who formed its board and whose decision it was to invest Rs 400 crore (approximately $100 million at the time) in the CSK franchise as well as information about the shareholding pattern in both CSK and India Cements, with particular reference to Srinivasan and his members of his family.
The bench asked Srinivasan's counsel Kapil Sibal about whether it was India Cements who made decisions on the team's captain and coach. "Is the company selecting the team?... If Gurunath Meiyappan is not the real owner, then who is the ultimate controller [of India Cements and CSK] we wish to learn?"
The BCCI counsel C A Sundaram was asked by the court as to what would be done if the court asked to take a decision, at which point Sundaram replied that he would take instructions from the BCCI and hoped that a decision pertaining to the IPL case with regard to CSK and Meiyappan, within ten days. Thakur then said, it was only at that point that the court would, " know what is brewing within the BCCI."
The BCCI counsel then suggested to the court that the board could set up a disciplinary committee to hand out punishments to individuals found guilty in the Mudgal committee report. The bench said that for a disciplinary committee to be completely "above bias" and "legally valid," a new Board will have to be constituted following a fresh round of elections in which the parties involved in the IPL case would necessarily, not be able to contest.
For the first time since any legal proceedings began around the 2013 IPL corruption case, the BCCI accepted that Gurunath Meiyappan, son in law of Srinivasan, was a "team official" for CSK.
Counsel for Raj Kundra, co-owner of the Rajasthan Royals and one of four "non-playing" individual indicted by the Mudgal panel, informed the court that while he had been "suspended" by the BCCI in 2013, he is yet to receive a written notice of the same.
A court observation is not binding but it does indicate the court's line of thinking in a case. The observation gives the party in question a chance to take the steps being advised.
Following three and a half hours of discussion before the bench, Harish Salve, appearing for the litigant Cricket Association of Bihar concluded his arguments today. The next hearing in the case will be held on Monday, December 1.

Amazon in talks to buy Indian retailer Jabong for $1.2 bnAmazon in talks to buy Jabong for USD 1.2 billion: Reports
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 16:09 IST
E-commerce firm Amazon.com is reportedly set to acquire Indian fashion and lifestyle e-commerce portal Jabong for $1.1-1.2 billion, said a report published in VCCircle.
The first level of talks to seal the deal have been completed, sources told VCCircle.
Considering the heft of Amazon , the deal is likely to attract intense regulatory scrutiny in India.
Another source said that Amazon would treat Jabong as a separate property after the deal.
"It (deal) would be very much on the lines of Amazon's acquisition of Zappos in the US," the source told VCCircle.
Jabong's co-founder Praveen Sinha declined to comment on the story.  An email query sent to Amazon's India team, elicited no response.

Anant Goenka, MD, Ceat in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said the company has no further fund raising plans post the closing of qualified institutional placement (QIP) yesterday but would look at raising debt for their various projects going forward.
The debt for the company currently stands at Rs 700 crore and the debt-equity ratio is 0.5. However, post debt raising the debt to equity would rise to 1:1, said Goenka.
The company has raised Rs 400 crore via QIP and the promoter holding has been diluted from 57 percent to 51 percent now, he said and has no further plans of equity issuance.
Talking about their robust expansion plans, he said the company will invest Rs 420 crore in their new Nagpur plant that manufactures two and three wheeler tyres. It has already made investments of Rs 650 crore in brownfield expansions in its Halol plant, he added.

Spot gold slipped 0.1 percent to USD 1,195.90 an ounce by 0253 GMT, but trading is expected to be thin with the US markets closed for Thanksgiving.
The metal dipped 0.3 percent on Wednesday as bearish market sentiment offset a drop in the US dollar, reports Reuters.

India Inc wants reforms more than rate cutSuvashree Choudhury and Devidutta Tripathy     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 14:42 IST
(Photo: Associated Press)
Anticipating data out on Friday will show weakening economic growth, India's finance ministry will argue for an interest rate cut, but bankers and company executives say the key to recovery lies in how fast Prime Minister Narendra Modi acts on reforms.
India Inc is keenly waiting for reforms on rules related to land acquisition, labour, coal and power sector, and foreign direct investment in insurance sector.
Most of these are expected to be taken up in the current Winter Session of Parliament.
"Interest rates are also important, but more important is enabling policy directives from the government to resolve the issues affecting our sector," said K. Rajagopal, CEO of power producer Lanco Power.
The Lanco Infratech unit's biggest problem is a shortage of coal supplied by an inefficient state-run monopoly, Coal India.
A lack of reforms explains the dearth of capital investment that lies at the heart of India's anaemic growth. In the past two years Asia's third largest economy has grown at rates below 5 per cent, recording its slowest phase since the 1980s.
Promising to oversee a revival, Modi swept to power in May. His election generated euphoria in the stock markets. Some of the optimism probably also helped economic growth to speed up to 5.7 per cent in the April-June quarter.
But, with no major new legislation to encourage industry, growth is expected to have fallen back to 5.1 per cent in the July-September quarter, according to a Reuters poll.
In September, credit growth hit a 13-year low.
Two finance ministry officials told Reuters that the GDP figure could be as low as 5 per cent, saying Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would use the weak performance to ask the Reserve Bank of India for a rate cut as soon as next week.
With consumer inflation slowing to 5.2 per cent last month, markets are already pricing in a possible reduction in the repo rate from 8 per cent when the RBI reviews policy on Tuesday, though most analysts see the bank waiting until early 2015.
ANIMAL SPIRITS
To power the economy back to the 8 per cent growth needed to create enough jobs for India's fast growing population, analysts say the government needs to focus on construction and manufacturing - the same sectors that helped India recover from the global financial crisis of 2008.
Yet these capital-heavy sectors have plenty of spare capacity, and thus no urgent need to invest in new plant or machinery. Capacity utilisation fell to about 70 per cent in the June quarter from nearly 85 per cent three years earlier.
Executives say any pick-up in corporate demand for loans requires business confidence, which depends on Modi's government living up to its campaign promises.
They want to see progress in reforming land acquisition laws, a controversial issue in India, as well as improvements in areas such as coal supply and transport infrastructure.
"The government needs to make it easier to do business in this country. Clearances have got to be much easier. Land acquisition is still a big problem," said Isaac George, chief financial officer of GVK Power & Infrastructure, one of India's leading infrastructure builders.
RBI itself made clear the limits of monetary policy in a report on September 30 that noted a sustained government progress is needed to revive "the animal spirits" in corporate investment.
Many bankers agree.
"I don't think a 25 basis point cut is going to matter to corporates. More important than a rate cut is, I think, government policy changes. That will help the turnaround," said a senior executive at State Bank of India who declined to be identified.

US firm Ness Software wants to leverage India strengthsUS firm Ness Software wants to leverage India strengths
M Somasekhar
Paul Lombardo, Chief Executive Officer, Ness Software
Sees scope in digital economy, cloud, big data analytics
Hyderabad, November 27:  
US-based Ness Software Engineering Services will expand its India operations to tap emerging opportunities in the digital economy, cloud and big data analytics, said Chief Executive Officer Paul Lombardo.
With nearly 50 per cent of its software revenue coming from Indian operations and the pool of software engineers available, it makes sense for the company to consolidate and grow. In Hyderabad, where it has 500 engineers, the plan is to substantially increase the number, he told BusinessLine.
Ness has nearly 3,000 employees across Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad and a satellite centre in Chennai. Lombardo sees strong growth in India and Central and Eastern Europe, hence the continuous expansion in India and opening of a third development centre in Europe, in addition to Romania and Slovakia, is in the offing.
The CEO said Ness has always seen India as a place that can help it develop software products and innovate.
Investing in a large number of software engineers over the last decade is paying off as the company gears up to meet demands in new areas, he said. Lombardo was, however, unwilling to share financials.
‘Make in India’ products
On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’, he said the company has always been bullish on India and has leveraged its software strengths to produce products, innovations and intellectual property, which is giving it huge returns globally.
Quoting a Forrester survey that projects the market in the digital economy space to be around $90 billion by 2018, Lombardo said that many non-technology companies are already tapping into the digital economy.
“We will provide software support to the travel, payment, education, health service sectors to grow,” he added.
Having hived off its IT services business recently, Ness Software is fully focussed on product development engineering services. It gets expertise in defence, cyber security etc from its Israeli company TSG, which is also participating in Indian defence and aerospace projects.
Eyeing varsity tie-ups
The company is exploring a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, and some Universities in Romania to develop technology and similar initiatives that can be planned in India in future. At present Ness supports students in research.
Satyajit Bandyopadhyay, President, said Ness India has been growing at 15-20 per cent annually in the country. And though its attrition rate is better than the industry average, it is an area of concern.
The company is able to provide expert support in product development services along with software engineering as a competitive edge to clients.
“We are able to get competent and qualified software engineers with experience far easier now than 10 years ago,” he said.

Ministry also plans forensic lab to combat crime
New Delhi, November 27:  
To ensure passenger safety, especially women, the Railway Ministry is in favour of installing CCTVs in individual rail compartments, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu informed the Lok Sabha on Thursday. This is subject to consensus in the House over sensitivities and privacy concerns, he added.
Replying to a question by A Sampath of the CPI(M) on rising incidents of theft, molestation and robberies in trains, especially in Kerala, Prabhu said his Ministry is taking new initiatives, such as providing mobile phones to all personnel escorting trains to keep in touch with each other.
“They will also levy spot fines for incidents such as molestation,” he added.
The Minister said eight Mahila Vahinis (women squad members) have been sanctioned with a total strength of 1,056 personnel to ensure the safety of women passengers. Up to October, 245 cases related to women have been reported. In addition, the Railways is planning to create a forensic lab connected to the Home Ministry’s labs to nab criminals.
Prabhu said the main bottleneck is that the Government Railway Police (GRP) is under State Governments, whereas the Railways is paying 50 per cent of the amount spent on their salaries.
The Railways wants operational control over GRP to protect passengers as well as assets, he said.
“I am pursuing the matter with the States and have asked them to allow GRPs to function under the Railways. A note has already been circulated to all the States, 17 of which have opposed the idea,” he added.
Food for thought
On a question on licensed vendors being replaced by food plazas affecting poorer passengers, Prabhu said his Ministry would revisit the issue to find out the problem areas.
“We want to increase customer satisfaction and provide food as close to the compartment as possible,” the Minister added.

London: Brent crude oil plunged more than $6 a barrel on Thursday, the sharpest one-day fall since 2011, after OPEC decided not to cut production despite a huge oversupply in world markets.
Asked whether the oil producer group had decided not to reduce production, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters: "That is right."
Oil prices have fallen by more than a third since June as increasing production in North America from shale oil has overwhelmed demand at a time of sluggish global economic growth.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had been discussing at their meeting in Vienna whether to agree a production cut in an attempt to rebalance the global oil market.
Benchmark Brent futures were down by $4.75 a barrel at $73.00 by 1640 GMT, after hitting a four-year low of $71.25 a little earlier in the session. The contract was on track for its biggest monthly fall since 2008.
US crude was at $68.90, down $4.79, after hitting its lowest point since May 2010 at $67.75.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Saleh al-Omair said there would be "no change" to OPEC's existing oil production target following the meeting.
The cartel will meet again in June next year, said an OPEC delegate.
"Oil prices are now completely in the hands of the market," Dominic Chirichella, director of New York-based Energy Management Institute, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Oil analysts said the OPEC decision left the oil market vulnerable to much bigger falls as abundant supply of high quality, light crude oil flooded world markets, much of it from shale oil in North America.
"Saudi Arabia and OPEC will have to live with a prolonged period of low prices for any dent in US-shale or production levels to happen," said Harry Tchilinguirian, senior strategist at BNP Paribas in London.
Ehsan Ul-Haq, senior oil market consultant at KBC Energy Economics, in Vienna for the OPEC meeting, said he expected oil prices to stay under $80 a barrel for some time.
"The probability of oil prices going below $70 a barrel is 20 per cent, remaining in a range of $70-80 a barrel is 40 per cent," he said.
Oil companies were not spared the pain, with the sector's share index on the London stock market declining by more than 4 percent following the OPEC decision.

Chennai: The share price of cement major India Cements Ltd continued its fall to close on Thursday at Rs 94.60 at the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Trading at a price of around Rs 105 November 21, the Rs 10 face value script had a steep fall to Rs 95.35 on Tuesday and from then onwards the fall continued in a marginal way.

Trading at a price of around Rs 105 November 21, the Rs 10 face value script had a steep fall to Rs 95.35 on Tuesday and from then onwards the fall continued in a marginal way.
#csk #india cement #bse #supreme court
The slide in the scrip's rate is due to the Supreme Court raising the issue of conflict of interest - India Cements, headed by N Srinivasan, owns IPL team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) team and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) also earlier headed by Srinivasan.
According to reports, the apex court had asked Srinivasan to furnish details of shareholdings of India Cements and its board composition.
In September this year, India Cements' board had approved the demerger of CSK (a division) into a wholly owned subsidiary by transferring the assets at net cost.
The effective date of transfer will be January 1, 2015, subject to all approvals.
Company officials had earlier said the CSK had given its cement brands good exposure in various markets. The company earned around Rs 166 crore from CSK.
India Cements had successfully bid for the Chennai franchise in 2008 for $91 million. The amount will be paid over a ten year period.

Post your opinion here
 
Gold extended losses into a third session on Friday and was headed for a weekly drop on expectations that plunging oil prices could sap inflationary pressure, curbing the metal's appeal as a hedge.
FUNDAMENTALS
* Spot gold had fallen 0.3 percent to USD 1,187.40 an ounce by 0037 GMT. The metal has lost about 1 percent for the week, snapping a three-week rally.
* Oil hit four-year lows around USD 70 a barrel on Thursday, as OPEC resisted the temptation to cut back production following the more than 30 percent plunge in prices since June.
* Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation.
* Also weighing on gold was a firmer dollar, which made notable gains versus the Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown due to the slide in oil.
* Investor outflows resumed in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, on Wednesday after a week with holdings of the fund hitting a six-year low, reflecting weak market sentiment.
* Caution prevailed ahead of Sunday's Swiss vote on central bank gold reserves. The vote is aimed at preventing the Swiss National Bank from offloading its gold holdings and obliging it to hold at least 20 percent of its assets in gold, compared with 8 percent last month.
* The most-recent opinion poll showed support among Swiss voters for the initiative had slipped to 38 percent, weighing on prices.
* A surprise 'yes' vote, however, could prompt the Swiss central bank to buy about 1,500 tonnes of gold over the next few years, boosting bullion prices, analysts say.
* Deutsche Bank is winding down its physical precious metals trading business, moving to further scale back its exposure to commodities. The bank will retain some precious metals capability though its financial derivatives business.
MARKET NEWS
* Oil prices, oil-related shares and oil-linked currencies all tumbled in Asia on Friday, in the wake of OPEC's decision to refrain from cutting output despite a huge oversupply.

Jaitley for friendly taxes to discourage evasionFM Arun Jaitley for friendly taxes to discourage evasion
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 16:15 IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Photo: PTI)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said tax rates should be brought down to reasonable levels to get rid of rampant instances of evasion and to improve the environment for investments.
"Our tax system has to be friendly for tax payers and that is what we are trying to do step-by-step," Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on black money.
Advocating a tax structure which discourages evasion, he said there was a misconception that high tax rates lead to higher revenues.
"High tax rates do not necessarily mean more revenue collection... direct and indirect tax rates have to be brought to reasonable levels so that the basket increases and there is no incentive for tax evasion," Jaitley said. The minister added there was a time when India had very high tax rates, and the country's growth rate was mocked as 'Hindu rate of growth'.
Referring to steps being taken by the cen- tral government to unearth and bring black money stashed abroad, Jaitley said the government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list and efforts are on to complete tax assessment by March 31, 2015. He also said that prose- cution has already been launched in several cases while the cases would be filed every week, and names would be made public.
"When the media comes to know (names of black money holders), it will note that there are influential people in the list (of foreign account holders)," Jaitley said. Members of the Congress and the Trinamool Congress, however, were not sat- isfied with the finance minister's assur- ance and staged a walkout.
Asserting that the government would have to move carefully, he said that those pushing for immediate disclosure of names would be indirectly helping black money account holders as the latter would be alerted.
"Some account holders have already withdrawn money (from offshore illegal accounts)... We necessarily do not need to show bravado and adventurism," he told Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who wanted to know if money was still deposited in accounts abroad after reports of withdrawal of money from about 18 illegal accounts in Liechtenstein. Jaitley said,
"In the last few years, as an economy, we got a bad name from the world of investment for not being a tax- friendly regime." While giving an overview about treaties India has signed with various countries to deal with the black money, the finance minister hinted at changing laws as he accepted weaknesses in them. "I admit that there is a weak- ness in law. If the black money stashed abroad has to come, how will it come? Even the SIT is worried about this," Jaitley said, while answering a question on how soon could the black money be brought back.
Meanwhile in the Rajya Sabha, the government allayed apprehensions over continuance or dilution of MNREGA scheme launched by the previous UPA government, and said all necessary funds had already been released for the welfare scheme.
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said.

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank has allowed domestic search engine Just Dial Ltd to raise the foreign shareholding limit to a maximum of 75 per cent of its paid-up capital under the portfolio investment scheme (PIS).
"...foreign institutional investors (FIIs)/Registered Foreign Portfolios Investors (RFPIs) can now invest up to 75 per cent (revised from earlier limit of 49 per cent) of the paid-up capital of Just Dial Limited under PIS," RBI said in a notification.
The decision to raise such investment limit came after the company passed resolutions at its board of directors' level and a special resolution by shareholders, agreeing to enhance the limit of its equity shares and convertible debentures by FIIs.
FIIs held 26.64 per cent shares in the company as of September 30, 2014.
FIIs, NRIs and PIOs ( Persons of Indian Origins ) can invest in primary and secondary capital markets in India through PIS.
The RBI monitors the ceilings on FII/NRI/PIO investments in Indian companies on a daily basis and has fixed the cut-off points two percentage points lower than the actual ceiling.
Just Dial shares today closed at Rs 1,566.05 per share on the BSE, down 0.27 per cent from the previous close.

Rupee weakens 3 paise against dollar to end at 61.87
PTI
foreign exchange market
In dull trade, Indian rupee today snapped its two-day rise and fell back by three paise to end at 61.87 against the Greenback on month-end dollar demand from importers.
The rupee had fallen to 61.92 levels intra-day but positive cues from local equities and sustained capital inflows helped it to cut losses, Forex dealers said.
There was caution in the foreign exchange market ahead of quarterly GDP data release tomorrow and the RBI’s monetary policy review next week, they added.
At the Interbank Forex market, the domestic currency resumed better at 61.81 a dollar from last close of 61.84.
Later, it was trapped in a narrow range of 61.80 and 61.9225 before concluding at 61.87, a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent.
In the previous two days, it had risen by ten paise or 0.16 per cent while trading in a tight range.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday rose by 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $35.65 mln yesterday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was up by 0.20 per cent against its major six global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said: “Not much movement was seen in the USD/INR pair. The pair is likely to trade range bound as investors are trading cautiously and are waiting for the credit policy due next month, which will help them to gauge the markets.”
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.50 to 62.40, he added.
In the forward market, premia dropped on fresh receipts for exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April declined to 194.5-196.5 paise from 199.5-201.5 paise.
Forward contracts maturing in October, 2015, also tumbled to 411.5-413.5 paise from 422.75-424.75 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.8650 and for the Euro at 77.3746.
The rupee softened further against the pound to 97.48 from 97.32 yesterday and remained weak to end at 77.18 per euro from 76.95.
It slipped to 52.66 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.53.

Army uses tanks to search for hidden terrorists in Arnia sector  PM Modi to campaign in J&K todayMufti Islah , CNN-IBN | Nov 28, 2014 at  09:39am IST
Arnia: Hours after a fierce gunbattle between terrorists and security forces in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir, the Army is conducting search operations to flush out any remaining terrorists hidden in the area.
Four terrorists were killed while four civilians and three jawans also lost their lives in the gunbattle on Thursday. The terrorists had taken refuge in a makeshift bunker wearing combat uniform from where they attacked two Army bunkers leading to a gun battle with the security forces.
"3 civilians have lost their lives along with 3 army personnel, my condolences to the families. 4 militants have been neutralised in Arnia," Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted.
The attack comes just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Udhampur and Poonch on Friday to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections. The attack also coincided with the SAARC summit in Kathmandu attended by Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif.
Raising suspicion of the timing of the attack, Omar said, "The timing of the attack in Arnia can't be a coincidence. Some things will never change, SAARC summit is on, Ind & Pak PMs (sic) at the same venue and a fierce encounter breaks out in Jammu."
According to Omar, all police nakas along the National Highway in Jammu and other sensitive locations have been put on high alert and the situation is being closely monitored.
Army sources said that the terrorists occupied a vacant Army bunker in Pindi Khattar belt of Arnia border sector of Jammu district. "The bunker was of Army's 92 infantry brigade. A fierce encounter broke out. A soldier has been killed and two others are injured," they said.
A car has also been seized in the area which might have been used by the militants. During search operation, a suspected terrorist was apprehended and one AK-47 with 30 rounds, one Pakistan made pistol and Rs 8,100 Pakistan currency were seized from his possession. He was identified Adul Qayoomi alias Punjabi, he said.
The Army had on Wednesday said that terrorists were out to disturb the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir but the forces were alert to foil their designs.

Mumbai: In a major relief for home buyers, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Thursday passed a resolution to revoke permission to developers who discriminate amongst buyers.
The new proposal will invite revoking of occupation certificates of housing societies that discriminate buyers and prefer selling flats to only a particular community, caste or vegetarians.
The resolution was mooted by MNS Corporator Sandeep Deshpande. While it was supported by Shiv Senam, BJP opposed the move. However, the powers of implementation of this new proposal lie with the state government.

PM Modi has turned India into a magnet:McKinsey Chief(Global CEOs are putting…)
By Vinod Mahanta & Sachin Dave
MUMBAI: Dominic Barton , the CEO of the world's largest whiteshoe consulting firm, McKinsey, says that India is back on the priority list of CEOs after Narendra Modi's ascension to power. "People had given up on India. They felt India is too complicated and it was difficult to get anything done. It had dropped in the last five years on people's priority (list). I think it has gone right back up, people are interested, obviously people are going to want to see action but I think the feeling is they will, because this government seems serious," says Barton.
On his part, the McKinsey CEO is again advising his clients to bet big on India. "I was not (advising clients to come to India) two years ago because it was complicated... and companies and clients were deeply frustrated with the bureaucracy, no decisions getting made. Companies were saying... let us go to Africa, let us go to Nigeria, let us go to Indonesia, let us just go to the US, but that has changed. I think because if you look at the trends that are going on in the world, India is right in the centre," says Barton.
"Agriculture and food is going to be one of the biggest businesses in the world right here (along with) the healthcare boom, education boom, advanced analytics," adds Barton.
PM Narendra Modi's high profile, the outcome of addresses at New York's Madison Square Garden and Sydney's Allphones Arena has helped advance India's cause in global boardrooms. "I hear people say he seems very determined... We know it is unbelievably complicated but he is going to get it done. I see it in pharmaceuticals, industrial companies and the pension funds. The pension funds are interested and that is a big opportunity and so we are interested in getting more investment here too," says Barton.
With the world economy on a wobbly footing again - Japan receding into recession, a stalled Europe and China slowing down - India could find itself in a sweet spot providing stability and balance to the world economy.
"I think the people around the world look at this and say we need growth from India. It is also a bit of desperation for the world, 40% of the world's growth just last year came from China. We need more balance and India is the place that could do it. So if India unleashes, it is going to help not only India but the world," says Barton.
Besides, Barton is optimistic about the US, where he says the economy is recovering in spite of the government, and about China. The world's second-largest economy has plenty of headroom to grow, given that its urbanisation rate has just crossed the 50% mark.

Asia Is on the Brink of a Golden Era. Here s Why.reddit
SINGAPORE -- Asia will experience a new golden era of peace and prosperity over the next 10 years.
The export-led growth model of the past will no longer work for the major Asian economies. Hence, we are unlikely to see a return to double-digit growth.
If the major Asian economies, especially China, India and Indonesia, are able to maintain growth rates of around 7 percent a year, this will be a major achievement. Fortunately, this is within their reach. Three factors will drive this.
- The first factor is an almost unbelievable accident of history. It is truly remarkable that the three most populous Asian countries, namely China, India and Indonesia, have simultaneously put in place dynamic and reform-minded leaders who can be expected to transform their countries over the next decade.
- The second factor is the consolidation of the " Deng Xiaoping-Lee Kuan Yew consensus " on national development. We have just seen three remarkable back-to-back leaders' meetings in East Asia: APEC in Beijing, East Asia Summit in Naypyidaw and the Group of 20 in Brisbane.
An amazing number of new agreements were signed. There was also a historic (albeit unsmiling) handshake between President Xi Jinping of China and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, laying to rest fears of a China-Japan war.
What was the key underlying factor that explains the success of these meetings? The simple answer is that, North Korea excepted, there is a remarkably wide and deep consensus among regional leaders that they should focus on modernization and pragmatic development.
This explains why East Asia is functional while the Middle East remains dysfunctional. Our region has been infected by a silent, healthy virus of modernization. Because it is silent, the Western media has not noticed and continue to predict doom.
- The third factor is the explosion of the Asian middle-class population from 500 million in 2010 to 1.75 billion in 2020. Multinational corporations have spotted this trend.
Many of these MNCs are ahead of their governments and have stepped up their presence in the region. Singapore has the potential to be the biggest beneficiary of this big shift to Asia. Pessimistic Western consumers will not drive global demand. Instead, optimistic Asian consumers will gradually pick up global demand.
"The third factor is the explosion of the Asian middle-class population from 500 million in 2010 to 1.75 billion in 2020."
It would be foolish to pretend that all will be rosy in the region. Several geopolitical clouds will continue to affect the region. Five deserve mention.
BUT THERE ARE CLOUDS
The most important geopolitical relationship is always between the world's No. 1 power (now the U.S.) and the emerging No. 1, now China.
In theory, U.S.-China relations should hit a new peak of rivalry in the next decade, because, this year, China will surpass the U.S. and become the world's biggest economy in purchasing power parity terms. Curiously, the U.S.-China relationship is remarkably stable.
Indeed, there is even some sun showing through what should be the darkest geopolitical cloud, as demonstrated by the extraordinary climate change agreement reached between Mr. Xi and U.S. President Barack Obama.
The most dangerous relationship this year was that between China and Japan. Many feared that they would go to war. Instead, they shook hands.
If Mr. Abe can restrain his nationalistic tendencies and focus on firing economic arrows to jumpstart Japan's economic growth, this troubled relationship can remain under control. Several Chinese leaders may have also realized that China went overboard in browbeating Japan in recent years.
The most important future geopolitical relationship is between the world's next No. 1 and No. 2 economies, namely China and India. When Mr. Narendra Modi became prime minister of India, there was hope of a major breakthrough.
However, the border issue continues to bedevil this relationship. The world will look upon Mr. Modi and Mr Xi. to wisely overcome this nagging issue.
Logically, Russia should have been drifting closer to Europe and the West to balance a rising China. Instead, the opposite has happened. The accident in Ukraine disrupted geopolitical logic. If Western leaders were as pragmatic as Asian leaders, they would have found a compromise.
Instead, the West went back to its usual self-righteous tendencies and imposed sanctions on Russia. This geopolitical loss by the West has been a gain for Asia, as seen by the U.S. $400 billion (S$520 billion) Russia-China energy deal.
Finally, the Islamic State group emerged as a complete surprise. It would have been ignored if innocent Westerners had not been killed. The decapitations forced the West, especially the U.S., to react. However, ISIS does not pose a great global threat. It is an isolated tumor.
DON'T BELIEVE THE ANGLO-SAXON MEDIA
To understand how these five geopolitical clouds will affect Asia, please do not rely on the dominant Anglo-Saxon media. Some of their editors are trapped in a narrow and often ideological Anglo-Saxon mental universe.
For example, the Anglo-Saxon media has been predicting the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party for almost 25 years. I predict that they will continue to do so in the next 10 years. I also predict that the CCP will last the next 10 years.
There is a great global demand for an authoritative voice on Asia's resurgence.
When the British Empire reigned supreme, the Times of London served as the newspaper of record. When the American century began, the New York Times emerged as the newspaper of record. As the Asian century unfolds, The Straits Times is well poised to be the newspaper of record for the Asian century. Fortunately, The Straits Times already has a group of excellent Asian correspondents in place. It has the product. All that the ST has to do is to create a new package of news on Asia for the rest of the world.
ASEAN IS KEY
ASEAN will have to play a critical role in the coming decade. Few in the world have given ASEAN enough credit for the culture of musyawarah and mufakat ("consultation and consensus" in Bahasa Indonesia) developed in Southeast Asia.
More importantly, ASEAN has also infected the rest of East Asia and South Asia with a similar culture. This is why all the major regional powers, including the U.S. and Russia, "trust" ASEAN to provide a credible neutral platform to enable them to engage each other.
However, to play this leadership role credibly, ASEAN must retain its cohesion (and avoid incidents like the breakdown in the ASEAN consensus in Phnom Penh in July 2012) and ensure that the ASEAN Economic Community is a success after it is launched next year.
ASEAN countries must overcome their schizophrenic attitude towards ASEAN economic cooperation. The only way to overcome this attitude is to use the force of reason. Any rational economic analysis will show that no ASEAN market, not even Indonesia's, is big enough to compete with China and India if they take off.
ASEAN companies need a bigger playing field if they are to become competitive. Hence, next year, led by Malaysia, ASEAN leaders must bite the bullet and push economic cooperation to the next level.
In short, all the trends are pointing towards a new golden era for the region. To understand their own futures, the Asians must believe in themselves and develop new positive global narratives to supplement the dominant negative Western narratives.
This is an excerpt from a recent keynote address by Professor Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, at ST Global Outlook Forum.

India back on peoples priority list after Modi s ascension to power: BartonDominic Barton
("People had given up on India,…)
Despite running a hectic schedule that involves travelling 300 days a year, McKinsey CEO Dominic Barton tries to meet two CEOs a day in whichever country he happens to be in. And these meetings give Barton a unique insight into what's going on in the boardrooms of globocorps. So, when Barton says that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is creating a positive buzz about India among global CEOs, it has to be taken seriously. In a chat with ET's Vinod Mahanta, the chief executive of the world's top consulting firm talks about the Modi effect, the sweet spot India is in and the changing roles of strategists. Edited excerpts:
You meet CEOs across the world. Do you see the perception about India as an investment destination changing after PM Narendra Modi took charge in New Delhi?
Yes, I definitely think so. I travel about 300 nights in a year and I see two CEOs every day. There is optimism on India. People had given up on India, saying it was too complicated, could not get anything done. It had dropped from people's priority (list) in last five years. I think it has gone right back up; (now) people are interested. Obviously, people are going to want to see action, but I think the feeling is they will see action because this government seems serious. I met the minister of finance two nights ago. They (the government) know what needs to be done and they do not need a super-brain saying (what) we need to do. They know, and I think they want to get it done.
I think the people around the world look at this and we need it. It is also a bit of desperation for the world — 40% of the world's growth just last year came from China. We need more balance and India is the place that could do it. So, if India unleashes (itself), it is going to help not only India but the world. So, I think there is a lot of optimism, people are putting India back on the top of priority list to say, 'okay, let us pay attention and see what happens'. But that it is not going to happen overnight. There are things that have to change.
Do you get a sense from the American business community, one of the largest investors in India, that it is time to bet on India again?
Yes, I do. I mean, I was there actually when he (Modi) spoke at Madison Square Gardens. I did not go there but I was in Manhattan when he did, saw the newspapers. I hear people say he seems very determined, that is the kind of sense that people get — that this guy is determined. We know it is unbelievably complicated, but he is going to get it done. I see it in pharmaceuticals, industrial companies and pension funds. The pension funds are interested and that is a big opportunity and so we are interested in getting more investment here, too, because of infrastructure players, all those things that can be done. So there is a lot of interest because people are searching for growth.
Are you still advising clients that India is still the place to be vis-a-vis other BRIC nations?
Yes, especially now. I was not two years ago because it was complicated; it was very difficult and companies and clients were deeply frustrated with the bureaucracy; no decisions were getting made. Companies were like 'we do not have time for that, let us go to Africa, let us go to Nigeria, let us go to Indonesia, let us just go to the US', but that has changed. I think because if you look at the trends that are going on in the world, India is right at the centre; like ag-food is going to be one of the biggest businesses in the world right here, healthcare boom, education boom, advanced analytics.
McKinsey continues to bet big on India. McKinsey has three-and-a-half thousand people in India; this is the biggest proportion of McKinsey people in the world. What I am particularly excited about is what we call MCKC, which was invented by our office here, which is a lot of advanced analytics. So, a lot of global companies are getting some absolutely critical capabilities, risk management, market assessments done here in Delhi, Gurgaon and in Chennai. The talent pool here is phenomenal and we are going to make this more of a centre for advanced analytics.
McKinsey seems to be leveraging India's strengths to the core...
Yes, people ask me where the headquarters of McKinsey is. First of all, there is no one headquarter because we are partnership, but if you look at the concentration where our people are, again I would have to say it is India, because that is where the core is and then New York and then probably London and then Frankfurt. So, I think that this is a talent pool and leadership, even MLI. That is how we want to leverage that in other parts of the world. What these guys are doing in our MCKC, they have developed a capability, say, for example, a pen, so, you can break down the cost of this pen.

Phil Hughes passes away following head injuryPhil Hughes passes away following neck injury
The Australia cricketer, 25, never regained consciousness after a fatal blow to his neck on Tuesday.

RIP, Phillip Joel Hughes: November 30, 1988 - November 27, 2014
Profile | Reactions | The incident in image | The worst bouncer injuries | Tradition trumps safety | The loveable maverick  
Once compared to the great Donald Bradman, Australia Test cricketer Phillip Hughes passed away today in Sydney following a fatal injury he had incurred in a Sheffield Shield match on Tuesday. Hughes would have turned 26 on Sunday.
During this game for South Australia against New South Wales, Hughes was batting on 63 when he was struck on neck by a bouncer from pace bowler Sean Abbott . Hughes stood dazed for a few moments before falling face first to the pitch. He did not gain consciousness again.
"It is my sad duty to inform you that a short time ago Phillip Hughes passed away," Australian team doctor Peter Brukner said in a statement.
"He never regained consciousness following his injury on Tuesday," added Brukner. "He was not in pain before he passed and was surrounded by his family and close friends. As a cricket community we mourn his loss and extend our deepest sympathies to Phillip's family and friends at this incredibly sad time."
"Phillip took the blow at the side of the neck and as a result of that blow his vertebral artery, one of the main arteries leading to the brain, was compressed by the ball," Brukner said on Thursday. "That caused the artery to split and for bleeding to go up into the brain. He had a massive bleed into his brain. This is frequently fatal at the time.
ALSO READ: How Hughes died -- an extremely rare injury
Australia captain Michael Clarke , a friend to Hughes, read out a statement by Hughes' family. "We're devastated by the loss of our much-loved son and brother Phillip," Clarke said, struggling to control his emotions. "Cricket was Phillip's life, and we as a family shared that love of the game with him .... We love you."
The cricketing community had been hoping for Hughes to regain consciousness Earlier in the day, Australian radio broadcaster Alan Jones had revealed that Hughes' condition was extremely serious. Jones said, "Hughes is breathing only with the assistance of medical technology and his condition is much more serious than anyone had imagined after damaging a major artery in the back of his head."
BATTING PRODIGY
2009, Durban: The youngest to score two hundreds in a TestHughes, who played 26 Tests and 25 ODIs for Australia, grew up on a banana farm in Macksville, NSW, developing his own unique technique that helped him score tonnes of runs through the off-side and down the ground but left him suspect against the rising delivery – a weakness that would cost him his life.
ALSO SEE: A walk through Hughes' career
Hughes made his Test debut in 2009 against South Africa, making a duck and a match-winning 75 at the Wanderers. In the next game of that series, the left-hander would create history. Aged 20 years and 98 day, Hughes scored 115 and 160 in that game, becoming the youngest Test cricketer to score twin hundreds in a game.
Those who had seen his rise were not surprised. At the 40-game mark in his First Class career, Hughes’ tally of 3882 runs was second only to Donald Bradman’s 4922 in Australian cricket.
Hughes couldn’t hold on to his spot in the Australia team. In his last comeback, he had made 81 in the Ashes Test at Nottingham, leading a stunning Australia fightback in the company of the teenaged Ashton Agar who had scored 98 on debut. Their tenth-wicket partnership of 163 set a new Test record. But he followed up that score with 1, 1, and 0, and lost favour with the selectors.
His ODI career had begun in a similar style albeit over three years after his Test debut, in January 2013. He made 112 on debut against Sri Lanka. Twelve days later, he bettered that with an unbeaten 138 against the same team. But a string of small scores later, he lost his opening position. His last game for Australia was on October 5 this year when he made 5 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. He had earned that comeback on the basis of a performance in July when he had scored 202 in a one-day game for Australia A against South Africa A. He is the first Australian to score a one-day double.
Hughes was expected to earn a Test recall next week against India in Australia captain Michael Clarke 's place. Since his head injury, Clarke, a friend to Hughes, barely left his side at the hospital. 
QUESTIONS ABOUT AMBULANCE SERVICE RAISED
Aged 11, growing up on his banana farm in Macksville.Questions about the response time of ambulances dispatched to the stadium were also raised.
The head of New South Wales Ambulance was to be hauled before the state health minister Jillian Skinner on Thursday after the ambulance authority issued conflicting statements about their response times.
The arrival of the first ambulance took 15 minutes, NSW Ambulance clarified in a statement on Wednesday.
The state's median response time for the highest priority "life-threatening cases" was just under eight minutes in 2013-14, according the authority's statistics.
"Due to the conflicting information distributed today by NSW Ambulance regarding (Tuesday's) response to the Sydney Cricket Ground, I will be meeting with NSW Ambulance Commissioner Ray Creen tomorrow to discuss the circumstances surrounding the incident," Skinner said.
ABBOTT GETS COUNSELLING
Abbott, the 22-year-old NSW pacer, has been receiving plenty of support and counselling from colleagues, friends and family. Abbott, whose bouncer felled Hughes, was reportedly good friends with the deceased batsman. He was one of the first to rush to Hughes after the injury and cradled his head as he slipped into unconsciousness.
The CEO of the Australia Cricketers' Association, Alistair Nicholson said, "Abbott has got a lot of support around him from his team-mates and also the counselling services. He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him."
Abbott had visited the venue of the incident with Hughes, the Sydney Cricket Ground, on Wednesday along with his team-mates. All Shield games were abandoned following Hughes' injury. Australia are slated to host India in a four-Test series starting December 4. It is likely that Hughes' death will adversely impact those fixtures.

Gold prices were down 0.73 per cent to Rs 26,169 per 10 grams in futures trading on Thursday after participants offloaded partial positions amid weak cues from global markets.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December month contracts declined by Rs 193, or 0.73 per cent, to Rs 26,169 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 436 lots. Likewise, the metal for delivery in far-month February next year shed Rs 166, or 0.62 per cent, to Rs 26,636 per 10 grams in 152 lots.
Market analysts said trimming of positions by speculators tracking a weak trend in overseas markets mainly put pressure on the precious metal at futures trade here.
Globally, gold traded 0.40 per cent lower at $1,192.95 an ounce in Singapore on Thursday.

Anti-toll messages flood Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis  cellphoneWritten by Sandeep A Ashar | Mumbai |
Posted: November 27, 2014 2:14 pm
 
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis found himself fending off an unusual Gandhigiri-style protest on Wednesday — thousands of text messages from unknown numbers, all protesting the continued levy of toll charges.
His cellphone kept buzzing as he attended functions with President Pranab Mukherjee in Pune. His private secretary Sumit Wankhede was also in the firing line.
It emerged later that anti-toll activists from Kolhapur had resorted to protest against the Chief Minister’s U-turn on scrapping the levy. A panel of anti-toll activists from Ravivar Peth in Kolhapur had made CM’s personal mobile phone number public, urging sympathisers to flood him with text messages demanding a rollback of the levy. Even Wankhede’s mobile numbers, along with contact coordinates of CM’s office and Nagpur residence, were shared.
The anti-toll activists displayed hoardings with these numbers in prominent localities, setting a target of sending over one lakh anti-toll text messages to the CM.
Fadnavis’s woes were further compounded with a prominent Marathi daily publishing these numbers along with a story regarding the unique anti-toll protest. Not amused by the mode of protest, sources said the CM’s office made its displeasure known to the toll activists and the publishing house.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had also faced a similar protest following his decision to continue with the local body tax. Activists from Kolhapur were also involved then. However, the mobile number shared then was that of a senior official in the CMO and not Chavan’s.

SAARC leaders to push Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif to sign 3 key pactsWritten by Shubhajit Roy , Yubaraj Ghimire | Kathmandu |
Posted: November 27, 2014 4:52 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 10:11 am
Disappointed with Pakistan holding out the three agreements on rail, motor vehicles and power grid connectivity, SAARC leaders are expected to take up the matter with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday.
The leaders are expected to meet at a retreat near Dhulikhel, about 30 km from Kathmandu in a final attempt to salvage these pacts.
Pakistan has conveyed in the last two days that they cannot sign up for these agreements since their “internal processes” have not been completed.
While India is disappointed, it has also made it clear that it has bilateral arrangements through which it can develop linkages with its neighbours.
Infact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the 18th SAARC summit on Wednesday: “The bonds will grow through SAARC or outside it, among us all or some of us. We can all choose our paths to our destinations. But, when we join our hands and walk in step, the path becomes easier, the journey quicker and the destination closer.”
Ministry of External Affairs’ (MEA) official spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said that India was “disappointed” at the impasse over the agreements.
“This would not augur well if these three agreements are not signed…since in the last SAARC summit, about 7 to 9 agreements had been signed,” he said, adding that the the leaders would informally raise the issue at the retreat.
The spokesperson also said India is “keen” to have these three agreements signed during the summit.
Officials said while India already has bilateral arrangements with SAARC countries on all these fronts, these agreements, if signed, would provide a “framework” for all the countries to develop connectivity. Sources said Nepal is very keen that these agreements are signed, or else this summit could be perceived as unsuccessful.
India, however, did not officially endorse the view.
“SAARC does not stand or collapse on the signing of these agreements. We will be disappointed but can carry on,” the MEA spokesperson said.
These three pacts are Agreement for the Regulation of Passenger and Cargo Vehicular Traffic amongst Saarc Member States, Saarc Regional Agreement on Railways and Saarc Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity). They have been approved by all member states, excluding Pakistan. The electricity agreement aims to create a regional energy market aimed at enhancing cross-border electricity trade among the South Asian countries.
As per the Motor vehicles agreement, cargo vehicles, passenger vehicles and personal vehicles can move across the region upon fulfilling the specified criteria and in accordance with the customs laws of the member states concerned.
The railways agreement will enable transportation of passengers and goods through railways across the region on certain terms and conditions.

Google s latest: A spoon that steadies tremors by Indian-American Anupam PathakLava launches new smartphone Iris Fuel 60 priced at Rs 8,888
Google is throwing its money, brain power and technology at the humble spoon, courtesy Indian-American Anupam Pathak.
Of course these spoons (don’t call them spoogles) are a bit more than your basic utensil: Using hundreds of algorithms, they allow people with essential tremors and Parkinson’s Disease to eat without spilling.
The technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced. In clinical trials, the Liftware spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent.
”We want to help people in their daily lives today and hopefully increase understanding of disease in the long run,” said Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari.
Other adaptive devices have been developed to help people with tremors – rocker knives, weighted utensils, pen grips. But until now, experts say, technology has not been used in this way.
”It’s totally novel,” said UC San Francisco Medical Center neurologist Dr. Jill Ostrem who specializes in movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease and essential tremors.
She helped advise the inventors, and says the device has been a remarkable asset for some of her patients.
”I have some patients who couldn’t eat independently, they had to be fed, and now they can eat on their own,” she said. ”It doesn’t cure the disease, they still have tremor, but it’s a very positive change.”
Google got into the no-shake utensil business in September, acquiring a small, National of Institutes of Health-funded startup called Lift Labs for an undisclosed sum.
More than 10 million people worldwide, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s mother, have essential tremors or Parkinson’s disease. Brin has said he also has a mutation associated with higher rates of the Parkinson’s and has donated more than $50 million to research for a cure, although Jabbari said the Lift Labs acquisition was not related.
Lift Lab founder Anupam Pathak said moving from a small, four-person startup in San Francisco to the vast Google campus in Mountain View has freed him up to be more creative as he explores how to apply the technology even more broadly.
His team works at the search giant’s division called Google(x) Life Sciences, which is also developing a smart contact lens that measures glucose levels in tears for diabetics and is researching how nanoparticles in blood might help detect diseases.
Joining Google has been motivating, said Pathak, but his focus remains on people who are now able to eat independently with his device. ”If you build something with your hands and it has that sort of an impact, it’s the greatest feeling ever,” he said. ”As an engineer who likes to build things, that’s the most validating thing that can happen.”
Pathak said they also hope to add sensors to the spoons to help medical researchers and providers better understand, measure and alleviate tremors.
Shirin Vala, 65,, has had an essential tremor for about a decade. She was at her monthly Essential Tremor group at a San Ramon medical clinic earlier this year when researchers developing the device introduced the idea and asked if anyone was interested in helping them.
As it was refined, she tried it out and gave them feedback. And when they hit the market at $295 apiece, she bought one.
Without the spoon, Vala said eating was really a challenge because her hands trembled so hard food fell off the utensils before she could eat it.
”I was shaking and I had a hard time to keep the food on a spoon, especially soup or something like an olive or tomatoes or something. It is very embarrassing. It’s very frustrating,” she said.
The spoon definitely improved her situation. ”I was surprised that I held the food in there so much better. It makes eating much easier, especially if I’m out at a restaurant,” she said.

Ratings agency Moody's expects the country's GDP to grow at 5.3 percent in the July-September quarter of the current fiscal, better than 4.8 percent clocked in the year-ago period.
It said the general elections in May helped lift investor sentiment and business confidence, though it will take a while before this translates into better performance in the real economy.
"Our estimate that GDP grew 5.3 percent in the September quarter is in line with the steady cyclical upswing of recent quarters," Moody's Analytics said in a report. The official GDP data for the September quarter will be released on Friday.
Indian economy grew by 4.8 percent in the second quarter of the last fiscal, while the growth rate was 4.7 percent for the entire 2013-14 fiscal. In the April-June quarter of this year, GDP growth stood at 5.7 percent.

The growth rate touched sub-5 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
"The economy's growth reached a recent nadir around the middle 2013 but has been steadily improving since then," it said, adding that downside risks to growth diminished as the government shored up its fiscal position and external account.
Moody's Analytics further said the services sector would continue to expand strongly and drive GDP growth on the production side.
Investment will be key to second quarter performance as corporate spending appears to have expanded further and industrial production of capital goods was slower but still positive.

BSE Sensex up 53 pts in choppy trade ahead of GDP data  RBI policyBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: November 27, 2014 10:20 am | Updated: November 27, 2014 4:55 pm
In choppy trade, the benchmark Sensex today rose 53 points on the back of gains in shares of BHEL, Hindalco and Infosys ahead of quarterly GDP data release tomorrow and the RBI’s monetary policy review next week.
Besides, covering-up of short positions by speculators on expiry of monthly derivative contracts supported buying activity, brokers said.
The BSE Sensex after beginning higher at 28,397.80, struggled to maintain higher levels and slipped to intra-day low of 28,307.58. However, late buying by overseas funds and retail investors helped the index rebound and close with a gain of 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 28,438.91.
During the session, it touched a high of 28,498.30.
The gauge had gained 48.14 points yesterday.
Easing inflation and falling global crude oil prices, which plunged to four-year low as hopes for output cuts by OPEC faded, raised hopes of a rate cut by RBI at its December 2 monetary policy review, traders said.
Out of the 30-share index, stocks that closed with gains were led by BHEL, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Power, Hindalco, Infosys, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Cipla and Dr Reddy’s.
The 50-share NSE index Nifty, after reacting to alternate bouts of buying and selling, finally closed at 8,494.20, up 18.45 points, or 0.22 per cent over previous closing. Intra-day, it touched high 8,506.75 and low of 8,456.35.
Sectorwise, the BSE IT index gained the most by rising 1.08 per cent, followed by Power 0.78 per cent, Healthcare 0.64 per cent and Auto 0.35 per cent among others.
Buying activity also gathered momentum in midcap and smallcap stocks with both indices rising up to 0.55 per cent.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth net Rs 181.46 crore yesterday, as per provisional data from the stock exchanges.

24 Indian fishermen are currently under detention or arrest in Sri Lankan jails on the charge of alleged fishery related violation, the government said on Thursday. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Gen (retd) V K Singh gave this information.
“As on 22 November 2014, there are 24 Indian fishermen currently under detention or arrest in Sri Lankan jails on
charges of alleged fishery related violation,” Singh said. In reply to a separate question, Singh said the government as a result of its consistent efforts has managed to secure the release of 676 Indian fishermen in 2013 and 730 Indian fishermen (till 21 November 2014) from Sri Lanka.
Singh also said that on October 30, the High Court of Colombo had awarded death penalty to five Indian fishermen who were apprehended in Sri Lankan waters on November 28, 2011. He said that following the judgment, an appeal was filed against the sentence in the Sri Lankan Court of Appeal by the High Commission of India in Colombo on behalf of the five fishermen. He said the government also took up the matter at the highest level with the government of Sri Lanka.
“Following government’s intervention, the President of Sri Lanka granted full remission of the sentence and the five fishermen returned to India on 20 November 2014,” the Minister said.
He said that for dealing with issues relating to straying fishermen, work out prevention of use of force against them and the early release of confiscated boats, an India-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group (JWG) has been in existence since 2004 and government continues to remain engaged with the government of Sri Lanka to ensure that Indian fishermen continue to pursue their livelihood in a safe, secure and sustainable manner.

Trai advises over 15% rise in CDMA spectrum reserve price

Sectoral regulator Trai has recommended a reserve price of Rs 3,104 crore per megahertz for CDMA spectrum, which is 15 per cent more than the rate it had proposed in February.
The regulator had proposed a reserve price of Rs 2,685 crore per megahertz for 800 Mhz, used for CDMA services, in its February recommendations.
Trai had proposed a reserve price of around Rs 1,800 crore for 800 Mhz for the auction in March 2013 wherein Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL) was only bidder and it won radiowaves to operate in 8 circles for Rs 3,639 crore.
The new reserve price of Rs 3,104 crore is 72 per cent higher than the Rs 1,800 crore rate in 2013 auction. In a reply to Department of Telecom (DoT), Trai said, "In the light of current data trends and other relevant factors since the valuation exercise was carried out in February 2014, the Authority has decided to carry out fresh valuation of the spectrum in 800 Mhz band."
The DoT had sent back Trai's recommendations on 800 MHz band for reconsidering some points. The Department had also sent back Trai's proposals on 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz bands, on which the Authority had reiterated its earlier stand on all proposals.
Trai said regarding DoT's request for reviewing price, it is of the view "that since the reserve prices have been referred for reconsideration, it is obliged to take into account developments subsequent to its earlier Recommendations of February 2014 for the 800 MHz band.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said since it conducted a fresh valuation exercise for the 1800 MHz band spectrum recommendations released on October 15, the updated valuations would need to be incorporated into the valuation of the 800 MHz band in view of the DoT's present reference.
The Authority applies five approaches to calculate the valuation of 800 MHz which include 1.5 times or 2 times of value of 1800 Mhz band, producer surplus model, model based on revenue from data services and February auction determined price of 900 MHz (for three metro circles).
It then fixes the reserve price at 80 per cent of the average valuation arrived through the five approaches. "...in line with the viewpoint taken in October 2014 recommendations on valuation and reserve price of 1800 MHz spectrum, the valuation of 800 MHz spectrum has been recalculated," Trai said.
Apart from the reserve price, Trai has reiterated its other recommendations like putting the entire available spectrum with the DoT in 800 Mhz to auction.
The regulator also stood by its recommendation that entire CDMA spectrum held by  MTNL be put up for auction as it is underutilised and government should take back CDMA spectrum held by BSNL for auction except one block of frequency in Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and North-East service areas.
Trai has also reiterated that it should be mandatory for new entrants to win at least 5 Mhz of spectrum specially in the case of contiguous blocks.
MTNL stock price
On December 16, 2014, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam closed at Rs 25.25, down Rs 1.45, or 5.43 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 39.10 and the 52-week low was Rs 13.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 134.30 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 0.19. The latest book value of the company is Rs 80.01 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 0.32.

Taxman wants to challenge Bombay HCs Voda rulingDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Though attorney general Mukul Rohatgi has advised the government against appealing the Bombay High Court’s judgment in the Vodafone transfer pricing case, the income tax department wants to appeal the case at the Supreme Court.
A senior finance ministry official told FE that the Mumbai wing of the department handling the case has said this in response to Rohatgi’s advice. He added that the government will have to take a final call now on whether this case will be appealed in the Supreme Court or not based on the two views.
The attorney general has asked the income tax department to desist from filing an appeal against the Bombay High Court ruling in October that struck down its bid to add about Rs 5,000 crore to the taxable income of Vodafone in India for FY09 and FY10.
Though finance minister Arun Jaitley has said the government will not pursue tax cases mindlessly, more often than not, the government has toed the income tax department’s line in the past, and if he goes by the attorney general’s opinion, it will be a clear deviation from the past.
The Vodafone  transfer pricing case is significant in several ways, the government decision will impact the handling of similar cases including that of Shell India, in which too, the Bombay High Court’s verdict on November 18, has been against the taxman.
Other over two dozen other companies, including Essar Group firms and HSBC Securities and Capital Markets, that are fighting similar tax demands in various courts, are also keenly watching the government move.
What will help Jaitley in taking a call is the fact that even the officials dealing with the transfer pricing issues in the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) feel that the income tax department is on a weak footing in the Vodafone and Shell case.
The Vodafone case involves its issue of 5.6 lakh shares to Vodafone Tele-Services India Holding, Mauritius in two tranches — one on July 16, 2009, at R7,110 and another on January 24, 2010, at R6,447 each. Shell India’s case involves the issue of 4.78 crore shares to Shell Gas on December 24, 2009, at par value of R10/share.
In both the cases, the high court has ruled that these are not capital transactions so the question of taxing them doesn’t arise but the income tax department wants to tax them as per the transfer pricing norms.

(As part of its ambitious…)
NEW DELHI: ITC plans to invest about Rs 9,000 crore in the next three to four years to expand its hotel portfolio to 150 hotels, said Nakul Anand, executive director at the tobacco-to-hospitality conglomerate. ITC Hotels , one of the largest hotel chains in the country, currently operates 102 hotels.
As part of its ambitious expansion plan, on Thursday it opened the 104-suite resort ITC Grand Bharat near Delhi where it spentRs 2-2.5 crore per room.
"We will have a total of 150 hotels in the next three to four years, of which 33 hotels will be under the managed Fortune hotels brand," Anand said. "The My Fortune brand will have six fully-owned hotels across Coimbatore, Guntur (a major tobacco district), Bhubaneswar, Srinagar, Kathmandu and another undecided location."
He said ITC will launch five other hotels — in Mahabalipuram, Kolkata , Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Colombo — by 2018.
"Last week, we also did the ground breaking for our Colombo One hotel that will cost $300 million (Rs 1,855 crore) and will be ready by 2018," Anand said.
ITC's aggressive investment plan —which will be funded internally — comes despite slow profit growth in the business.
ITC's hospitality subsidiary reported a 5.44% increase in its net profits for the year ended March at Rs 139.7 crore.
ITC has reported a loss from hotels in the second quarter ended September at about Rs 9.6 crore, after absorbing a charge of Rs 13.4 crore towards additional depreciation.
"Indian hospitality has been in a bad shape and it's not just us. Having said that, I think the worst is over and there are good times ahead," Anand told ET.
"If (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi is a magnet, then it means there could be more FDIs and with that will be more business travel, which will have a three times multiplier effect," he said. ITC gets close to 50% of its revenues come from non-cigarette businesses.
The hotel industry continues to be impacted by a weak pricing scenario in the backdrop of sluggish economic conditions and the overhang of excessive room inventory in key domestic markets.
According to hospitality consultancy HVS, India has over one lakh branded hotel rooms and another 55,000 in the pipeline.

Government moving to online approval system for over 200 permits needed to start business

(This initiative could be…)
NEW DELHI: By April 2015, starting a new business in India would no longer require budding entrepreneurs to make multiple trips to myriad government offices, with the Narendra Modi government moving to an online approval system for more than 200 permits required by different industries from central and state government departments.
The new system for registering and seeking clearances for any business would allow entrepreneurs to apply for and track the status of all permits and licences online to start with, and eventually on mobile phones, in line with PM Modi's vision of bringing governance to people's fingertips.
This initiative could be highlighted when Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth meets India Inc on Friday with the commerce and industry secretaries to discuss measures to improve the ease of doing business. India is currently ranked 142nd on the World Bank's index for this and the government is committed to improve this to 50.
Promising to simplify business processes and regulations in six months, the PM had told US businesses in October: "Whatever may have been India's ranking on the ease of doing business index, I have now told officials that I don't want to be so low on this ranking."
PM Modi told US businesses in October that he had given officials "specific parameters to improve quickly".
While the Modi administration has stoked a revival in investor interest in India, foreign investors spooked by policy uncertainties and the country's notorious red tape are still looking for tangible signs of change in the business environment. This initiative could be a key enabler in changing the narrative, feel experts.
"The cabinet secretariat is prodding all ministries and state governments to complete the exercise by March 2015, so that anyone setting up a new venture in any sector or state can apply for the requisite permits and even pay fees online," said a senior government official aware of the development.
The proposed national portal for registrations and clearances would also free up entrepreneurs from the guesswork associated with seeking clearances in India's cumbersome and uncertain bureaucratic landscape, a system that spawns brokers and agents who charge for helping out aspiring businessmen.
"There will be a start-up matrix on the portal that will tell applicants what permissions are needed for which sectors. So if you are about to set up a pharma unit in Gujarat, it will tell you what are the permits needed from the health ministry and the state government," the official explained.
As of now, 81 state-level clearances, including those relating to acquiring land, setting up a factory and associated nods such as registering a boiler and operating a diesel genset are being digitised.
Another 133 clearances granted by different central ministries and departments, including tricky security nods from the home and defence ministries, will also be put online. More than 50 of these central clearances pertain to the railway ministry alone.
"Moving to an online system for granting clearances is a good start, after years of creating multiple single windows for investors that only sent them to other official windows," said former Boston Consulting Group chairman and Planning Commission member Arun Maira. "But it's equally important to re-engineer the processes involved in the clearances and create an intelligent back end. If people using the new system have a bad first experience and throw their hands up saying even this doesn't work, it could backfire," he told ET, stressing the importance of doing things in the right order.
  Under the new system, entrepreneurs would be able to track their applications digitally and would be informed any time there is an inter-departmental consultation on their file, through the portal being developed by the cabinet secretariat with the National Informatics Centre.
In pharmaceuticals, for instance, the health ministry's different approvals for new drugs and clinical trials, import and export of drugs and pricing approvals for generic drugs would be accessible online.
While a similar initiative was launched by the industry ministry with software company Infosys Technologies five years ago, it has so far digitised only two permissions granted by its own department — industrial licences and industrial entrepreneur memoranda.
The Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion grants three other licences — for using explosives, gas cylinders and import and storage of petroleum products. These are now being put online at the behest of the cabinet secretariat, which has been mapping the multiple clearances required for different sectors with the help of industry groupings such as Ficci in recent months.

E-commerce players gear up for Google s online shopping bonanzaBlack Friday
(Sites that offer price comparisons, couponing and…)
BENGALURU: Many online sites are gearing up for a surge in business with a fortnight of discounts during the ongoing Google-led online shopping festival followed by Black Friday and Cyber Monday next week. The affiliate sites are creating 'howto' guides for best deals in different categories, anticipating a four-fold rise in traffic and a similar jump in revenue.
Sites that offer price comparisons, couponing and best deals may come up on top by creating 'how-to' guides during the GOSF (Google Online Shopping Festival). Smaller e-commerce merchants also gain from the rising traffic, given that they offer niche products and comparable discounts.
Typically, GOSF aims to tap firsttime shoppers, which constituted a large chunk — nearly 30% — during the 2013 festival. "This year, we have five times the number of merchants against when we started GOSF in 2012. Though there are 250 million internet users, only 35 to 40 million users shop online. Our idea is to get more and more first-time shoppers to experience this," says Nitin Bawankule , industry director for e-commerce, local and classifieds at Google India .
"While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are not Indian phenomenon, we have created a GOSF section specifically on Desidime to help shoppers. Diwali and GOSF make up nearly 30% of our annual revenues and last year the traffic went up by 120% during GOSF. We will be adding 20 additional servers this year in anticipation of the volumes," says Mehul Jobanputra , CEO and co-founder of Desidime.
Given that 14 days of pre-GOSF which would showcase 14 different e-commerce players offering their best deals, affiliates will turn a channel for product discovery and collating updated deals. "Price wars are likely on key days and it is a big question whether the featured e-commerce players offer their best deals on the day they are featured or on days when their competitors are featured,leading to never-seenbefore discounts.
Given the technical interruptions last year and earlier this year for the shopping festivals, there is a better amount of preparedness," says Swati Bhargava, co-founder of cashback and coupon site Cash-Karo, which is expecting four times the traffic and three times the revenues during the GOSF days. The smaller e-commerce players reach out to a larger audience, expecting to benefit from the rising traffic. Last year, smaller players registered twice the traffic during GOSF.
"GOSF is a good platform for the smaller players who do not have the marketing muscle. The listing will be random and will rotate so as not to have any specific merchant's name on top. However, greater the number of categories the merchant offers, better the presence," says Bawankule.
Many smaller e-commerce players register a repeat customer base of up to 50% due to the exposure during the event. "During GOSF, there is a bump which remains. Many of our partners reported a 50% rise in repeat customers' post-GOSF and the festival benefits everyone in the ecosystem. The overall sales go up nearly three times.
The idea to launch a microsite is to help people search for best deals which are catalogued based on the brand or categories," says Sameer Parwani, CEO and founder of Coupondunia . The affiliate site started its dedicated microsite for GOSF on Monday. Incorporated in 2010, the couponing website was acquired by Times Internet earlier this year.
Digital media network Komli Media, which ran a series of deals and coupons ahead of the GOSF pre-party between November 17 and November 23, indicated better results for smaller players, given that the top e-commerce players will be holding on to their deals in anticipation of GOSF.
"The increase in transactions for the bigger players has gone up by 20 to 30% while smaller e-tailers have seen a jump of nearly four times the usual transactions over a period of two days," says Sandeep Balani, director, publisher development at Komli Media, which incentivised affiliates as part of its offer.

Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel mark the beginning of data tariff war

(Anil Ambani-led telco unveils…)
KOLKATA: Anil Ambani-headed Reliance Communications has unveiled, what it calls, a disruptive data plan which promises data usage at a monthly rental of Rs 999 with no download quantity caps whatsoever, a move which comes barely 24 hours after Bharti Airtel said it would offer 4G services at or below 3G rates.
The back-to-back moves could mark the beginning of a bruising data tariff war as telcos move to garner as many higherpaying data subscribers as they can in the run-up to Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm's expected 4G services launch next year. The Sunil Mittal-founded Bharti Airtel, India's No. 1 carrier, had said on Wednesday it would offer 10 GBs of data on 4G at Rs 999, which is 33% cheaper than its 10 GB data variant on 3G, priced at Rs 1,499.
RCom's unlimited data offer, launched on Thursday, directly takes on rival CDMA operator Sistema Shyam Teleservices' identical Rs 999 data plan, which has 40GB and 20GB limits for postpaid and prepaid customers, respectively.
Gurdeep Singh, chief executive (consumer business) at RCom, told ET that the move is aimed at grabbing potential data customers from rival networks who are "dissatisfied with their current data speeds or the quality of indoor coverage".
The company's unlimited data plan at unbridled data speeds up to 14.7 Mbps would initially go live in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune and eventually be extended to other key cities including Delhi and Mumbai.
Singh stressed that the plan "was truly unlimited", in that, a customer opting for it could safely go ahead and download, say, "100 GBs for Rs 999 without fear of a bill shock at the end of the month".
The offer "was not a promotional offer in disguise to grab data customers in key markets. We are here for the long haul and plan to extend this offer nationally in all key markets," he added. RCom will be in direct competition in Bengaluru and Pune where Bharti Airtel operates 4G services, while it would be sparring with the Indian unit of Russia's Sistema JSFC in Chennai and Bengaluru.
Till the time of filing report, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Sistema Shyam declined to reply to ET's queries on whether they would also slash 3G data rates or go unlimited.
Lately, India's top mobile operators have been cherry-picking lucrative data customers amid surging demand for data services and also in anticipation of fierce competition on the 4G front from Jio which is widely expected to launch its own 4G services by March next year. Higher margin data services are expected to drive revenue growth at India's mobile phone operators in the coming years.
At the end of September, non-voice revenue, including from data, made up over 24% of RCom's telecom revenue, and over 20% of Bharti Airtel's mobile services revenue. Both Bharti Airtel and RCom had over 15 million 3G customers as on September 30.
Industry experts, however, are sceptical about RCom's offer, arguing that it is "technically impossible" to offer unlimited data downloads at the promised speeds over a long term to a large customer base as it would choke up the network and disrupt mobile coverage.
"Since a data pipe's capacity is finite, a large group of customers collectively opting for such an unlimited offer are bound to experience a serious loss of speed at some point, especially since DoT allows operators to downgrade data download speeds as part of its fair usage and trade policy once a customer is seen to be abusing a data plan," a top executive of one of India's biggest telcos told ET on condition of anonymity.

OPEC does little as Brent drops under $75/bbl

(Oil tumbled into a bear market…)
MOSCOW/LONDON: OPEC took no action to ease a global oil-supply glut, resisting calls from Venezuela that the group needs to stem the rout in prices. Futures slumped to the lowest level since 2010. The group maintained its collective production ceiling of 30 million barrels a day, Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said today after the 12 nations met in Vienna. Brent crude fell below $75 a barrel in London after the decision, extending this year's drop to 33%.
Oil tumbled into a bear market this year as the US pumped the most in more than three decades and conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine failed to disrupt supply. While OPEC's 30- million-barrel limit has been in place since 2012, the group actually produced almost 1 million barrels more last month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
"OPEC has chosen to abdicate its role as a swing producer, leaving it to the market to decide what the oil price should be," Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets at BNP Paribas SA in London, said today by phone. "It wouldn't be surprising if Brent starts testing $70."
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet again June 5, according to a delegate, who asked not to be identified in line with policy. The decision not to change the production ceiling was anticipated by 58% of respondents in a Bloomberg Intelligence survey this week.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told reporters after the meeting that he was "not angry" about the decision, but it was "not in line with what we wanted." Venezuela, whose currency reserves are close to the lowest in 11 years, planned to push for a production cut, Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela's OPEC representative, said before the meeting started.
"Everybody has to make some sacrifice," Ramirez said, estimating the global oversupply at 2 million barrels a day. Kuwait put the glut at 1.8 million barrels. Ministers from Kuwait, the UAE and Angola said they were concerned about the surplus in the market as they arrived at the group's headquarters. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, dropped 28% this year. Futures declined $2.78 to $70.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri will retain his position until the end of 2015, according to the delegate.
OPEC's output exceeded the ceiling in October for a fifth consecutive month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group's 12 members produced 30.97 million barrels a day in October. It estimates the world will need 29.2 million barrels a day of its crude next year, according to a report on November 12.

Argentina charges HSBC with aiding tax evasion via Swiss accountsArgentina charges HSBC with aiding tax evasion via Swiss accounts
Reuters | Buenos Aires Nov 28, 2014 03:39 AM IST
Argentina has charged HSBC with aiding more than 4,000 clients to evade taxes by stashing their money in secret Swiss bank accounts, the country's AFIP tax authority said on Thursday.
AFIP said it received the information on the secret accounts from France, which last week placed HSBC's Swiss private banking arm under formal investigation for possibly aiding tax evasion.
"We denounce the existence of an illegal platform created by three banking entities (of HSBC) that are operating in Argentina," Ricardo Echegaray, the head of Argentina's AFIP tax agency, told a news conference.
"Its managers have intervened actively with the sole aim of helping Argentine citizens avoid paying their taxes."
HSBC Argentina rejected the charges in an emailed statement to Reuters, saying it respected Argentine law.
"HSBC Argentina emphatically rejects (the charge) of its participation in any illicit association, including any organisation that would allow the transfer of capital in order to evade taxes," the bank said.
Argentina's move comes as part of a global crackdown on undeclared funds held in offshore havens, after the global financial crisis strained government budgets and made the need to maximize tax receipts more pressing.
Switzerland has become the world's biggest offshore financial center thanks to strict banking secrecy laws in the Alpine country.
Belgium last week charged HSBC Private Bank with tax fraud and money laundering. Stolen personal details of HSBC clients in Switzerland were passed on to Belgian and French authorities in 2010.
Earlier this month, AFIP accused Procter & Gamble, the world's No. 1 household products maker, of tax fraud and said it suspended its operations in the South American country.
AFIP did not say on Thursday it had suspended HSBC's operations.

(The UPA government…)
NEW DELHI: After it was in cold storage for nearly three years, the Home Ministry has fast-tracked the setting up a National Security Guards hub in Gujarat to tackle terror, including the threat to the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar.
The UPA government had set up additional NSG hubs in Mumbai, Kolkata , Hyderabad and Chennai after the 26/11 attacks. While Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had demanded an NSG hub in Gujarat citing the terror threat to the state and its long coastline. The UPA gave an "in-principle" approval to Gujarat's proposal on March 18, 2011, but nothing much moved on the same till the new government came to power.
The threat of a terror attack on important coastal installations in Gujarat was, however, not lost. NSG has conducted several drills by flying commandoes from its Mumbai hub to Jamnagar in a specially-hired civilian aircraft to check the swiftness with which the NSG commandoes could reach there in the event of a terror attack. The Jamnagar refinery was also granted a CISF security cover after the 26/11 attacks to guard it better from any terror threat from the coast.
Over two months after the Modi government assumed office, a joint team of officers from NSG, Central Armed Police Forces and Home Ministry paid a visit to the state and assessed a piece of land offered by Gujarat near Gandhinagar to find it suitable for a NSG hub.
Moving fast, a team of NSG engineers have carried out a joint survey along with officials of the Gujarat government of the same piece of land on August 20-21 and a report was submitted to the Home Ministry. On September 25, the Home Ministry wrote to the Gujarat government to execute certain development works prior to handing over the land to NSG for construction. "The hub will be up by the end of 2015," a ministry official said.

In 3 years  Robert Vadra firms reaped up to 600 per cent profit in landdealsWritten by Jay Mazoomdaar |
Posted: November 28, 2014 4:28 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 3:34 pm
Three companies owned by Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, made profits up to 600 per cent within three years of investment in real estate in Rajasthan.
Official records accessed by The Indian Express also show that even as Vadra’s firms were selling land in 2012 at  three to seven times the price they bought it for in 2009-10, they were buying land in the same areas at, roughly, the 2009-10 rates.
In all, Vadra’s Sky Light Realty, Sky Light Hospitality and Blue Breeze Trading executed 58 land deeds in Bikaner’s Kolayat tehsil between 2009 and 2013.
A scrutiny of these deeds reveals that Vadra’s firms bought 197 hectares in 2009-10 at a price that ranged from Rs 44,000 per hectare to 1 lakh per hectare. Almost all this land was sold off in 2012 at prices ranging from Rs 2.47 lakh per hectare to Rs 7.4 lakh per hectare.
Within two months of the last sale in 2012, Vadra’s firms again bought 214 hectares at prices ranging from Rs 80,000 per hectare to Rs 1.21 lakh per hectare.
Those who bought this land included nephews of a former Rajasthan finance minister and two individuals who were witness to land deals of the companies.
Details of the transactions of the three Vadra firms, as per records:

In 2010, Sky Light Realty Pvt Ltd bought 60.153 hectares in eight deals for Rs 46 lakh — at an average of Rs 76,000 per hectare. Between March and May 2012, the company sold the land in 10 deals for Rs 2.96 crore — at an average of Rs 4.7 lakh per hectare, over six times the price it paid in 2010. It made a huge profit when it sold 29.36 hectares, bought for Rs 28 lakh in March 2010, to Fonroche Saaras Energy Pvt Ltd for Rs 199.56 lakh in May 2012.
Incidentally, Sky Light Realty sold the first lot of land in eight deals in March-April 2012 at the price of Rs 2.47 lakh per hectare. Within days, the price jumped to Rs 6.79 lakh per hectare when the company sold 3.25 hectares to one Rushipal of Haryana in May 2012. The same month, Mumbai-based Fonroche bought 29.36 hectares from Sky Light Realty, and 3.25 hectare from Rushipal, at the rate of Rs 6.79 lakh per hectare.
While Sky Light Realty sold land for an average of Rs 4.72 lakh per hectare between March and May 2012, it purchased another 71.47 hectares from village residents in four deals during June-July 2012 at an average price of Rs 82,000 per hectare. The company still holds this land, marginally above the land ceiling.
Sky Light Hospitality
In January 2010, Sky Light Hospitality Pvt Ltd bought 69.55 hectares in two deals for Rs 72 lakh — at a little over Rs 1 lakh per hectare. In January 2012, it sold the land in two separate deals to Delhi’s Allegeny Finlease Pvt Ltd for Rs 5 crore — at Rs 7.41 lakh per hectare, seven times the price paid two years ago.
In four deals in June 2012, Sky Light Hospitality purchased nearly 70 hectares at an average of Rs 80,000 per hectare — less than what it paid in 2009. Barring land sold for Rs 6 lakh to one Meetu Agarwal of Bikaner in January 2013, ostensibly to bring down the company’s holding below the ceiling limit, land purchased in 2012 is still with Sky Light Hospitality.
Blue Breeze Trading
In June 2009, Blue Breeze Trading Pvt Ltd purchased 50 hectares in four deals in Kolayat for Rs 40 lakh at an average price of Rs 80,000 per hectare. The company picked up another 17.40 hectare in April 2010 for Rs 7.70 lakh at Rs 44,000 per hectare.
In April 2012, Blue Breeze Trading sold 41.39 hectare to VCB Trading Pvt Ltd, New Delhi, in three lots for a little over Rs 1 crore — at an average of Rs 2.47 lakh per hectare. Next month, it sold the remaining 26 hectares to Fonroche in two deals for Rs 1.77 crore at an average of Rs 6.79 lakh per hectare. In all, Blue Breeze made Rs 2.79 crore after investing Rs 47.7 lakh — the return almost 600 per cent in less than three years.
In June that year, Blue Breeze Trading purchased another 71.96 hectares in Kolayat for Rs 87.50 lakh — at an average of Rs 1.21 lakh per hectare. The entire holding was sold to nine individuals — eight in Bikaner and one in Faridabad — through 11 deals made in January and May 2013.

(Nifty rose as much as 97 points…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex rallied over 300 points in trade on Friday to touch its fresh record high of 28765.52, led by gains in ICICI Bank , HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank and ITC.
Falling global crude oil prices and ease in inflation headline number has fuelled hopes of a rate cut by RBI at its December 2 monetary policy review.
Brent crude oil prices posted its steepest one-day falls since 2011, as OPEC decided against cutting output despite a huge oversupply in world markets.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index rose as much as 97 points to hit its lifetime high of 8591.40, supported by gains in auto, banks, pharma, metal and oil & gas stocks.
On the macro front, investors will keep a close eye on GDP data for the July-September quarter which is likely to contract from the previous quarter.
According to an ET Now Poll, India's economic growth probably slowed to 5 per cent in the July-September quarter, down from 5.7 per cent recorded in the previous quarter.
At 09:25 a.m.; the 30-share index was at 28,724.77, up 285 points or 1 per cent. It touched a high of 28,765.52 and a low of 28,483.99 in trade today.

Mumbai, Nov 28:  
The rupee breached the 62 per dollar mark and was trading weak at 62.05 at 4.35 pm local time on sustained demand for greenback from importers.

After opening marginally weak at 61.90 against the previous close of 61.87, the rupee hovered in the range of 61.87 and 62.10 in the evening trade.
Forex dealers said that apart from heavy dollar demand from importers, the dollar's gains against other currencies overseas dampened the rupee sentiment.
The rupee had lost 3 paise to end at 61.87 against the greenback in yesterday’s trade on month-end dollar demand from importers.
Meanwhile, the BSE benchmark Sensex surged 255.08 points to 28,693.99 at the closing trade.

Brent crude falls near 4-year low as OPEC refrains from output cutsBrent crude plunges to 4-year low of $72.50 as OPEC refrains from output cuts
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Nov 28:  
Brent crude held above $72 a barrel on Friday, close to a four-year low touched in the previous session after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for output reductions, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 9 cents at $72.49 a barrel at 0446 GMT, after plummeting $5.17 in the previous session to close at $72.58. Earlier on Thursday, it touched its weakest since July 2010 at $71.25 a barrel.
Brent is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, said.
US crude
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.78 from Wednesday's to $68.91 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75. U.S. markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Oil may fall to $60
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

Oil struggles in Asia after OPEC maintains outputOil struggles in Asia after OPEC maintains output
AFP/PTI | Singapore Nov 28, 2014 09:30 AM IST
Oil prices struggled in Asian trade today after the OPEC cartel refused to cut production despite a global glut that has sent prices slumping to four-year lows, with analysts warning of further falls by the end of the year.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for January delivery was at $69.04 a barrel in late-morning trade, down one cent from its settle price in electronic trading in New York on Thursday. US floor trading was closed due to the Thanksgiving holiday.
Brent crude for January turned higher, rising one cent to 72.59.
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps out one-third of the world's oil, opted to stick by its output target, even after prices have plunged by 35% since June.
The 12-nation cartel 'decided to maintain the production level of 30 million barrels per day' where it has stood for three years, it said in a communique after a meeting Thursday at its headquarters in Vienna.
Oil prices were routed after the decision was announced, with WTI tanking to $67.75, a level last seen since May 2010, while Brent also plunged to a four-year low of $71.25.
"OPEC's decision to keep output is the main reason for prices to drop quite rapidly," said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.
"Prices are likely to be going down for the rest of the year," he told AFP.
Ang, who closely tracks the oil market, said he expects WTI to end 2014 in the 'low 60s' and Brent in the 'mid-60s'.
At yesterday's OPEC meeting, the cartel came under pressure from its poorer members, including Venezuela and Ecuador, to trim production as tumbling prices were eating into revenues and raising fears over their economies.
But OPEC's powerful Gulf members led by kingpin Saudi Arabia resisted the calls to turn down the taps unless they are guaranteed market share, particularly in the United States, where cheap shale gas has contributed to the global supply glut.

Jaitley hints at changing tax laws to discourage evasionFM Arun Jaitley for friendly taxes to discourage evasion
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 16:15 IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Photo: PTI)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said tax rates should be brought down to reasonable levels to get rid of rampant instances of evasion and to improve the environment for investments.
"Our tax system has to be friendly for tax payers and that is what we are trying to do step-by-step," Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on black money.
Advocating a tax structure which discourages evasion, he said there was a misconception that high tax rates lead to higher revenues.
"High tax rates do not necessarily mean more revenue collection... direct and indirect tax rates have to be brought to reasonable levels so that the basket increases and there is no incentive for tax evasion," Jaitley said. The minister added there was a time when India had very high tax rates, and the country's growth rate was mocked as 'Hindu rate of growth'.
Referring to steps being taken by the cen- tral government to unearth and bring black money stashed abroad, Jaitley said the government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list and efforts are on to complete tax assessment by March 31, 2015. He also said that prose- cution has already been launched in several cases while the cases would be filed every week, and names would be made public.
"When the media comes to know (names of black money holders), it will note that there are influential people in the list (of foreign account holders)," Jaitley said. Members of the Congress and the Trinamool Congress, however, were not sat- isfied with the finance minister's assur- ance and staged a walkout.
Asserting that the government would have to move carefully, he said that those pushing for immediate disclosure of names would be indirectly helping black money account holders as the latter would be alerted.
"Some account holders have already withdrawn money (from offshore illegal accounts)... We necessarily do not need to show bravado and adventurism," he told Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who wanted to know if money was still deposited in accounts abroad after reports of withdrawal of money from about 18 illegal accounts in Liechtenstein. Jaitley said,
"In the last few years, as an economy, we got a bad name from the world of investment for not being a tax- friendly regime." While giving an overview about treaties India has signed with various countries to deal with the black money, the finance minister hinted at changing laws as he accepted weaknesses in them. "I admit that there is a weak- ness in law. If the black money stashed abroad has to come, how will it come? Even the SIT is worried about this," Jaitley said, while answering a question on how soon could the black money be brought back.
Meanwhile in the Rajya Sabha, the government allayed apprehensions over continuance or dilution of MNREGA scheme launched by the previous UPA government, and said all necessary funds had already been released for the welfare scheme.
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said.

How you can make your returns more tax efficientHere's how you can make your returns more tax efficient
Hemant Rustagi        Last Updated: November 24, 2014  | 11:35 IST
Hemant Rustagi, ceo of Wiseinvest Advisors
While paying taxes when necessary is understandable, paying more taxes than necessary is not! Therefore, ensuring that your portfolio has the utmost tax efficiency is one of the key factors that can help you in improving your portfolio returns. While it is true that tax efficiency alone cannot guarantee investment success, a tax-aware investment strategy can make a substantial difference to your portfolio's ultimate size.  
Remember, tax efficiency is important for both short-term as well as long-term investing. However, it is common to see investors keeping large sums of monies in low-yielding savings bank account for months, especially when they are not sure when they will need this money. Of course, the fact that they feel safe putting money in the bank is another reason why they prefer traditional investment option over market-linked products offered by mutual funds.
Although mutual funds are perceived to be riskier than traditional options like bank deposits, the fact remains that they offer a variety of funds for different time horizons and if one makes the right selection, it can make a huge difference to the returns i.e. both gross as well as post tax and that too without compromising on safety and liquidity. For example, there are funds like liquid, ultra short term and short-term income funds that are ideal for short-term parking of funds. Since these funds invest primarily in money-market instruments and short-term debt instruments, they can be considered as a safe investment option. Moreover, being open-ended funds one can withdraw money at a day's notice. However, it is important to choose the right option i.e. growth or dividend reinvestment/payout to improve tax efficiency of returns.  
mut
Considering that short-term capital gains from a debt fund i.e. any gains on investments redeemed within three years is taxed at one's applicable tax rates, those investors who belong to tax bracket of 10 or 20 per cent should opt for "growth" option. Although the tax rates applicable on interest from FD and short-term capital gains on a debt based fund are the same, these funds have the potential to deliver higher returns than traditional investment options. As for investors liable to pay tax at 30 per cent, dividend re-investment option would be a better bet as the applicable Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) to be paid by the fund is 28.325 per cent. Since dividend is tax free in the hands of investors, the tax outgo will be lower.  
For investors belonging to the highest tax slab of 30 per cent looking to invest for short term, there is another option in the form of arbitrage funds. An arbitrage fund is an equity-oriented scheme which seeks to generate income through arbitrage opportunities emerging out of mis-pricing between the cash market and the derivates market. In other words, arbitrage funds capture the "interest" element in the equity market and offer an opportunity for investors to earn higher returns, without taking an equity market exposure. Although arbitrage funds fall in the category of equity funds, they are not risky as they invest in stocks and their futures simultaneously. This eliminates the risk of volatility normally associated with equity funds.
For tax purposes, arbitrage funds are considered as equity funds and hence any short term capital gains i.e. any gains on investments redeemed within 12 months is considered as short term capital and is taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent and long-term capital gains i.e. gains on units redeemed after 12 months is tax free. However, investors can make their return almost tax free by opting for monthly dividend payout offered by most of these funds. Since arbitrage funds are treated as equity funds for tax purposes, the fund is not required to pay any DDT. Therefore, even investors belonging to lower tax brackets of 10 and 20 per cent can also improve their post tax returns.
Evidently, arbitrage funds can be a good alternative for investors for their short term investment needs. These funds have the potential to provide healthy returns during the volatile market conditions and that too with a reasonable degree of safety and in a tax efficient manner. Of course, there are pitfalls too. A depressed stock market may not provide enough opportunities for an arbitrage fund. Besides, it is not necessary that on the day of expiry the price of the stock and its future contract will coincide.
Mutual funds also offer a variety of income funds for medium and long-term term investments such as income funds, gilt funds and fixed maturity plans. Since, every fund that has an exposure of less than 65 per cent in equity is considered as a debt fund for tax purposes, hybrid funds with varying degree of exposure to equities within this limit are also considered as debt funds. If one invests in these funds with a time horizon of three years or more, not only the returns can be much higher than traditional options like deposits and bonds but also the tax efficiency can improve post tax returns considerably. For such funds, any gain on units redeemed after three years is considered as long-term capital gains and is taxed at the rate of 20 per cent after taking inflation indexation into account. Considering that in a country like ours, inflation generally remains at persistently high levels, one would barely pay any capital gains tax.
For investment to be made with a time horizon of more than one year and less than three years, equity savings schemes, a recent addition to the basket of funds offered by mutual funds , can be an ideal option. The schemes invest in a combination of debt, arbitrage and equity in such a manner that exposure to equity is capped at around 20-25 per cent and the aggregate of arbitrage and equity is more than 65 per cent, which qualifies them to be an equity fund for tax purposes.
For investors who want to build a hybrid portfolio investing pre-dominantly in equities for a particular goal, there is an option of either investing in equity and debt fund separately or in an equity oriented balanced fund.  If the fund is chosen well, a balanced fund can be a better option as the entire long-term capital gains becomes tax free after one year. Moreover, in a balanced fund, the fund manager keeps rebalancing the asset allocation in keeping with the fund's objectives, without any tax implications on investors. However, if the intent is to build a hybrid portfolio with a bias towards debt instruments, investing separately in debt and equity funds would be a better option. By doing so, capital gains on equity portion can be made tax free after a year and one would have the flexibility to realign the portfolio, if need be.
Similarly, while investing for long-term, it is important to invest in an asset class that has the potential to beat inflation as well as provide tax efficient returns. Equity, as an asset class, fits the bill as it has a proven long-term track record of delivering higher post tax return than other asset classes. However, it is important to minimize portfolio turnover to improve tax efficiency of returns.
To do so, one must follow the right strategy. First, by assessing the tax consequences before making abrupt changes in the portfolio and resisting the temptations to sell investments for reasons other than poor performance and changes in one's personal circumstances, one can reduce the tax burden. Second, one must try to make the right selection of investment options to minimize the need to make changes in the portfolio in the short term.  Third, by honouring one's time commitment, one can avoid making haphazard decisions. This also helps in tackling the market volatility from time to time. Last but not the least, by following the strategy of portfolio rebalancing once a year, one can not only book profits during market upturns but also invest in it when the chips are down. Needless to say, a tax aware investment strategy has the potential to ensure that one gets to keep more in the end.

Government moves to ban sale of loose cigarettesGovernment moves to ban sale of loose cigarettes

(Sale of loose cigarettes…)
NEW DELHI: The government has accepted the recommendation of an expert panel to ban the sale of loose cigarettes and moved a Cabinet note to amend the anti-tobacco law, Union Health Minister JP Nadda informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, sending tobacco stocks tumbling with the country's largest cigarette maker ITC closing 5% down.
Nadda made the statement in a written reply to a question by NCP leader Majeed Memon. The news came amid speculation over the recent change of guard at the health ministry and whether Nadda would adopt the strong anti-tobacco stance taken by predecessor Harsh Vardhan.
The expert panel, constituted by Vardhan and headed by former Delhi principal secretary Ramesh Chandra, had also recommended a ban on advertising and promotion of tobacco products at the point of sale, increasing the minimum legal age of consumption from 18 years to 21 years and escalating the fine for smoking in public.
ET was the first to report the recommendations of the expert panel on September 10. According to government sources, each of the above suggestions figure in the Cabinet note circulated for feedback.
The proposal hasn't yet been sent to the Cabinet as the health ministry is awaiting the comments of other ministries. This process normally takes two to three weeks. The move to ban the sale of loose cigarettes is expected to hit manufacturers hard as 70% of the retail trade takes place in this form. Any decline in sales, however, will cut both ways as the cigarette industry generates more thanRs 25,000 crore in tax revenue.
According to analysts, the impact on volumes could be anywhere between 10% and 20% as only some consumers will be able to afford the shift to packets.
Tobacco stocks fell sharply after the news broke on Tuesday. ITC ended atRs 355.70 on the BSE, down Rs 18.70. Godfrey Phillips India plunged 8.9% toRs 2,965.95 and Golden Tobacco slumped 7.61% to Rs 37.05. The Sensex ended 0.6% down at 28,338.05 points. An ITC spokesperson refused to comment.

market and exchange
The rupee strengthened by five paise to 61.81 against the dollar in early trade on Wednesday on the Interbank Foreign Exchange on increased selling of the US currency by exporters and banks.
Forex dealers said besides increased selling of the American currency, the dollar’s weakness against other currencies overseas also supported the rupee but a lower opening in the domestic equity market, limited the rise.
The domestic currency had gained eight paise to close at 61.86 against the dollar in yesterday’s trade on account of suspected RBI intervention through state—owned banks.

NEW DELHI: The government today launched the 'Swachh Bharat Kosh', a fund that will be utilised to build toilets in schools, rural and urban areas to achieve the objective of cleanliness across the country.
The fund would seek "channelisation of philanthropic contributions and Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) funds", according to the guidelines issued by the government.
"The Kosh will be used to achieve the objective of improving cleanliness levels in rural and urban areas, including in schools. It may also be enabled to bring out innovative/unique projects and girl toilets will be the priority area to start with," the guidelines said.
It said the Prime Minister himself will acknowledge contributions of over Rs 1 crore made by individuals and of over Rs 20 crore by corporates.
The Kosh will be set up by the Ministry of Finance and will be managed by a Governing Council headed by Expenditure Secretary. Its functioning will be monitored on quarterly basis by the Finance Minister and by the Prime Minister from time-to-time.
The implementation of the projects/activities would be carried out by the existing institutions at the state, district, and sub district level and no new institutions would be created.
On October 2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the country's biggest-ever cleanliness drive that is expected to cost over Rs 62,000 crore. The objective of the drive is to achieve a Clean India by the year 2019, the 150th year of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi .
The guidelines said specific suggestions regarding creation of assets, coming from donors making contributions of more than Rs 10 crore, may also be considered by the ministries.

United States says European Union s Google case should not be politicisedAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
The United States voiced concern on Tuesday over a draft plan by two European Union (EU) lawmakers to break up Google Inc, saying politicians should not influence the European Union’s (EU’s) antitrust inquiry into the world’s most popular Internet search engine.
The U.S. Mission to the European Union (EU) said in an email it “noted with concern” the call for competition regulators to consider splitting search engines from other Internet services.
“It is important that the process of identifying competitive harms and potential remedies be based on objective and impartial findings and not be politicised,” it said.
A spokeswoman for Guenther Oettinger, European commissioner for digital affairs, confirmed his opposition to breaking up Google, adding that he believed the neutrality of a search engine toward competing services could be assured under existing European Union (EU) competition law.
Oettinger was quoted on Tuesday by German business journalist Roland Tichy as saying there would be “no break-up and no expropriation”, saying these were not appropriate tools for a free market economy. The remarks were carried by a German online newsletter.
The European Commission has been investigating Google for four years following complaints by rivals and has yet to come to a conclusion. Antitrust commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has sole authority to punish breaches of competition laws.
The comments by the U.S. Mission came a week after Andreas Schwab, a German conservative, and Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish liberal in the European Parliament, unveiled a draft of their resolution saying that separating search engines from other commercial services could ensure a level playing field.
Parliament has no power to break up Google but the proposal underlines widespread concerns among some European Union (EU) politicians and companies about American dominance of the Internet, and could put pressure on the bloc’s antitrust regulators to take a stronger line against Google.
Andrus Ansip, the Commission’s vice president for digital markets, said on Monday he was concerned that some tech companies might be abusing their dominant positions but added that antitrust investigations must not be rushed.

Markets Pricing in Rate Cut  Despite Wary RBIYou are here: Home Market
Markets Pricing in Rate Cut, Despite Wary RBI
Reuters | Updated On: November 26, 2014 15:22 (IST)
Fund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
Mumbai: Investors in India's markets are betting that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will persuade a more hawkish central bank to reduce benchmark interest rates as early as next week.
Finance ministry sources have told Reuters that Jaitley will urge Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to cut rates at the December 2 policy review, fearing that economic growth may have slowed again by dropping to 5 per cent in the three months to September.
"The market is hoping Jaitley wins. A rate cut is partially priced in by the debt market and to some extent in the longer-end fowards," said Vikas Babu Chittiprolu, a senior foreign exchange dealer with state-run Andhra Bank.
"But there is apprehension about Rajan actually cutting rates. There is a 50-50 view in the market on the rate cut."
Dr Rajan has resisted calls to cut the RBI's 8 per cent repo rate for fear inflationary pressures might emerge again, even though consumer inflation has dipped below the central bank's targeted levels.
Retail inflation slowed to 5.52 per cent in October, well below the RBI's target of 8 per cent by January, and even below a target of 6 per cent by January 2016.
The bond and swap markets are pricing in a reduction of at least 25 basis points in the repo rate at Tuesday's policy review.
Yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds have declined 25 basis points (bps) since mid-October, when data showed inflationary pressures receding. Yields on corporate bonds have dropped even more, with those on one-year bonds down nearly 50 bps in the same period.
In the derivatives space, swaps referenced to overnight money market rates have likewise fallen sharply. The one-year overnight indexed swap (OIS) is down more than 45 bps since mid-October, with 20 bps of that move occuring over the last two weeks as investors saw greater chance of a cut.
Traders said that while a rate cut is almost fully priced in at current market levels, there will be a further rally in bonds if Dr Rajan not only reduces rates but also sounds dovish.
Domestic shares are also expected to rally which could spur further foreign fund inflows into the market and aid the rupee. Fund flows into the debt market will however be subdued due to debt investment limits being nearly exhausted.
"We expect a reduction at the coming meeting and therefore we are bullish the rupee and recommend receiving positions in rupee OIS rates," economists at Credit Agricole said in a note on Wednesday.
The upcoming RBI policy review comes less than two weeks after China unexpectedly cut interest rates to fight deflationary pressures and a little over a month after Japan aggressively expanded its monetary stimulus.
Economists remain divided on the prospects of easing in India though, given Dr Rajan's dogged focus on inflation expectations. The RBI said after its September 30 policy meeting that it expects inflation to pick up by year-end as the base effect wanes.
"I think Rajan would have his way and we will not see a rate cut on Tuesday. But yes, market has priced in a rate cut to some extent," said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign exchange trading at HDFC Bank.

Barack Obama heckled in Chicago on immigration reformUS President Barack Obama was heckled several times while delivering a speech on immigration reform and his recent executive actions related to it in his home town of Chicago.
At least four hecklers started disrupting the President’s speech when he was midway through it.
The President himself tried to calm down the situation and respond to the allegations from hecklers.
“It’s good to be back in Chicago,” Obama said amidst laughter and applause from the audience as one of the hecklers tried to disrupt his speech yesterday.
“Because everybody has got something to say. But I’m not going to be able to have a conversation with each of you separately,” he said amidst another round of laughter.
“So there are other ways of engaging. Just sit down. I went off script for a pretty long time. I don’t mind. I know people are passionate about this. But be respectful of everybody who’s here,” he said urging hecklers to calm down.
It all started when he was speaking on undocumented workers who break law, and are in a small minority.
“Undocumented workers who broke our immigration laws should be held accountable. There’s a particular category, and that’s those who may be dangerous. It’s a small minority, but it’s a significant one. And that’s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 per cent,” he said.
Obama said the US will keep focusing its limited enforcement resources on those who actually pose a threat to its security.
“Felons, not families. Gangs, not some mom or dad who are working hard just trying to make a better life for their kids,” Obama said as one of the heckler interrupted his speech.
“Mr President, that has been a lie. You have been deporting every –,” the heckler said as he was booed by the audience.
“All right. Okay. All right.
That’s fine. All right,” Obama said.
“Not one more!Stop deportations!” the heckler demanded.
Nothing much was audible as heckler continued.
“Here, can I just say this? All right, I’ve listened to you. I heard you. I heard you. I heard you. All right? Now, I’ve been respectful. I let you holler. All right? Nobody is removing you. I’ve heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too,” Obama said as he tried to calm down the situation.
“All right? And I understand you may disagree.I understand you may disagree. But we’ve got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right?” he said.
“Now, you’re absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That’s true. But what you’re not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law,” Obama said amidst applause from the audience.
“Though I understand why you might have yelled at me a month ago – … although I disagree with some of your characterisations, it doesn’t make much sense to yell at me right now … – when we’re making changes,” he said.
Obama announced the most sweeping immigration reform in a generation on November 21 that will protect 5 million of the nation’s more than 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and may benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian techies seeking legal permanent status.
The plan would let parents of US citizens and legal permanent residents remain in the country temporarily, without the threat of deportation. The measure would apply to those who have been in the US for last five years.

Expert Report on ONGC-RIL Gas Dispute by June: Oil MinisterSpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
New Delhi: International expert D&M will by June next year submit its report on claims of gas by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) from its KG basin find seeping into the neighbouring gas field operated by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.
ONGC had in May filed an extraordinary writ petition in the Delhi High Court alleging that "RIL has extracted gas running into approximately 18 billion cubic meters, resulting in loss of several thousand crores of rupees, from its block KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari block (G-4) located in Krishna Godavari Basin", he said.
The state-owned firm feels gas discoveries in its nomination block G4 and Block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) extends into RIL's KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block.
In a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Mr Pradhan said ONGC had requested the court to appoint an independent agency under its supervision to establish the continuity of reservoirs and to estimate the volume of gas.
"Subsequently, ONGC and RIL, under the supervision of DGH, have appointed a third party international expert agency DeGolyer & MacNaughton, Dallas, USA to establish the continuity of reservoirs across the ONGC and RIL offshore deep water blocks/areas in KG Basin," he said.
D&M started its work on September 25.
"The report (of D&M) is likely to be submitted in June 2015," the minister added.
ONGC says at least three wells drilled by RIL on the boundary of KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal are within "few hundred meters" of its gas fields. It fears the fields are connected and RIL may be drawing out its gas.
RIL disputes the ONGC theory. The two firms have shared data to collaborate on their claims.
ONGC feels RIL's wells - D6-A5, D6-A9 and D6-B8 in KG-D6 block - may be drawing gas from its gas pools called G4-2, G4-3 and D-1 as the wells have been drilled close to or on block boundary.
Incidentally, wells D6-A5, D6-A9 and D6-B8 are among the handful of wells that have remained in production since the KG-D6 block was put on production in April 2009.
Half of the wells on Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field and MA oil and gas field in the KG-D6 block have shut down due to water and sand ingress, resulting in output plummeting to about 13 million standard cubic meters per day.

Idea Lets Airtel, Vodafone Use its Airwaves Till January 15
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 26, 2014 22:44 (IST)
SpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
New Delhi: As Bharti Airtel and Vodafone prepare to shift their network to newly allotted spectrum, rival Idea Cellular has agreed to let them use its airwaves in 900 MHz band for a period up to January 15.
The arrangement, which has no financial implication, is for only 45 days. Through this understanding, Airtel and Vodafone will get some time to deploy their networks in their newly allotted frequencies and their services will not disrupted during this period.
"For the convenience of customers, we have agreed to let Airtel and Vodafone use the spectrum up to January 15. The decision was taken in cognizance with the Department of Telecom," an Idea Cellular official said.
Idea will be allotted 5 Mhz block in 900 MHz spectrum won by it in the last auction held in February, on November 30. At present, it holds no airwaves in this band. Airtel and Vodafone at present hold 8 Mhz spectrum each in premium 900 Mhz band in Delhi, but they have to vacate them and shift to their newly acquired frequencies in 900 Mhz band.
In the auction, Airtel could win back only 6 Mhz and Vodafone 5 Mhz of spectrum in the same band.
The licences of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone in Delhi will expire on November 29.
The two companies also bought some spectrum in 1800 Mhz band to make up for spectrum they lost in 900 Mhz band. Mobile signals transmitted in 900 Mhz band cover almost double area compared to signals transmitted in 1800 Mhz band.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had earlier warned that telecom services in national capital may be disrupted partially from December due to delays by the Department of Telecom (DoT) in fresh spectrum allocation to Airtel and Vodafone. 
These operators have about 20 million mobile subscribers on their networks in Delhi or in other words 45 per cent of the total subscriber base here.
Telecom regulator TRAI had earlier recommended that operators be assigned spectrum 18 months before expiry of their licences so that they can make necessary changes in their network without compromising on quality of service.

CEOs like debt MFs despite higher taxesSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Corporate India continues to remain invested in debt-oriented mutual funds (MFs), including fixed maturity plans (FMPs). That’s despite the fact that companies willl need to pay a higher tax rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess for short- term investments of less than three years. Companies’ exposure to fixed-income schemes fell just 3.65% in the September quarter, but it nevertheless constitutes close to 56% of the overall debt AUM (assets under management).
Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Mutual Fund, says there has been absolutely no move by companies to pull out money or redeem fixed-income investments, including FMPs.
“Given the changes in inflation and interest rates, companies need to be invested in fixed income even if it means paying slightly higher taxes. Although MF schemes are now taxed on a par with other debt products, if the holding period is three years, the tax outgo would be much lower considering the indexation benefits,” Choudhary explained.
In the union budget for 2014-15, the finance minister had raised the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) rate for debt mutual funds from 10% to 20% with indexation benefit. Moreover, the government extended the definition of long-term for debt funds to three years from one year, removing the tax advantage that debt funds with a holding period of over a year used to enjoy. Any debt fund investment redeemed by a company before three years now attracts tax at 30% plus surcharge and cess, similar to what the interest on FDs is.
Companies typically park surplus cash in debt- oriented products through their treasury operations, and these form part of their shorter-term current and medium-term investments.
Sesa Sterlite’s investments in debt MFs, for instance, at the end of the September quarter stood at R32,727 crore, out of total cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments of R47,107 crore it had.
The exposure remains more or less the same as it was prior to the June 2014 budget, when it was R32,524 crore.
Bharti Infratel’s non-current investments in debt MFs across liquid, liquid plus and income funds stood at R3,500 crore, nearly same as at the end of March 2014, according to its latest quarter’s earnings call.
FMPs, a type of closed-ended debt scheme with tenures ranging from a month to 36 months, have seen some outflows, but not as much as feared. The category has seen a net outflow of R18,346 crore in the last four months, leading to a 7.5% fall in AUM to R1.61 lakh crore at the end of October 2014.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, says that while one- year FMPs have seen less demand in recent months due to lower short-term rates and adverse taxation, there has been been no major impact on the industry. Kevin P D’sa, president finance at Bajaj Auto, said during the company’s quarterly earnings call that of the R8,000-crore surplus, nearly R5,000 crore was invested in FMPs.
Experts say that unlike retail investors and high net-worth individuals,who have rolled over their schemes to three years, companies have not done so and are paying higher tax. Maruti Suzuki, during its earnings call, stated it had not yet rolled over the FMPs and was assessing its investment strategy.

Bond yield slips to 15-month lowSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
With just a week to go for the RBI to lay down its monetary policy, bond traders are already driving down yields in anticipation that the sharp fall in oil prices and the not-so-subtle call for rate cuts from the finance minister would force the RBI to act.
The 10-year benchmark government bond yield touched a new 15-month low of 8.14% on Wednesday after slipping 30 bps over the last two months. The RBI announcement of bond sale through the open market operations could temporarily put a break to the fall in yields. However, yields are poised to fall more, feels Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer at BofA-M L. Mehta predicts the 10-year yield could ease to 8% before March end.
Crude prices have dropped a staggering $30 per barrel since June and could fall more. Citing weak economic growth and the favourable fall in the crude prices, finance minister Arun Jaitley has called for a rate cut several times now.
With retail inflation falling to 5.52% in October, it is a given the RBI would be able to achieve its January 2015 target of 8% inflation. The 6% peg for January 2016 also looks easier to achieve now even if the price pressures flare during the next year.
With every data point favouring a cut, bond yields could fall further if RBI’s policy tone is dovish. Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch believes the 10-year yield could ease to 8% before end of March.
Adding to this string of positives is the fall in the US bond yields as well. The yield on the 10-year US treasury note has slipped 10 bps over the last one month. This keeps the interest rate differential between India and the US wide and, thereby, the attractiveness of Indian paper for foreign investors.

Nippon to up Reliance MF stake to 49%; 657 cr for first 9%Comments
Japanese financial services giant Nippon will hike its stake in India's top fund house Reliance Mutual Fund from 26% to 49%, while investing Rs. 657 crore for the first tranche of 9%.
The first tranche values Reliance Capital Asset Management Company (RCAM), which runs Reliance MF, at Rs. 7,300 crore, as per the deal announced on Wednesday.
Nippon would eventually up its stake to 49% in multiple tranches at prices to be determined on the basis of future prevailing assets and profitability of the company that are expected to be higher than the current levels.
Nippon already holds 26% stake in RCAM, which it had acquired for Rs. 1,450 crore in 2012 while valuing the company at Rs. 5,600 crore at that time.
Nippon Life manages over US $500 billion (Rs 30 lakh crore) in assets, highest in the world for any life insurer, while RCAM is part of Reliance Capital, the financial services arm of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group.
RCAM is the largest asset manager in India, in terms of Asset Under Management, managing Rs. 2,18,338 crore (US $36 billion) as on September 30, 2014, across mutual funds, pension funds, managed accounts and offshore funds.
"Nippon Life will be increasing its stake in Reliance Capital Asset Management from the existing 26% to 49% in two or more tranches," the two companies said in a joint statement.
"The Japanese company will be investing an aggregate value of Rs. 657 crore (US $108 million) to acquire an additional stake of 9% in RCAM in the first tranche, to reach a 35% stake.
"The transaction pegs RCAM's valuation at Rs. 7,300 crore (US $1.2 billion), the highest valuation till date for any asset management company in India. This transaction is expected to be completed within the current financial year, subject to regulatory approvals," the statement said.
Subsequently, Nippon Life Insurance will have an option to increase its stake further by an additional 14%, to reach 49%, in tranches, it added.
"We welcome Nippon's decision to further strengthen this partnership and acquire an additional stake in our asset management company. We strongly believe their expanded role in the Company will accelerate our growth, reach and performance," Reliance Capital CEO Sam Ghosh said.
Nippon Life also holds 26% stake in Reliance Life Insurance Company, which it had bought for Rs. 3,062 crore. This deal was completed in October 2011 and it had valued the Indian insurer at over Rs. 11,500 crore at that time.
Recently, Nippon gave indication that it was willing to hike its stake in Reliance Life as well once the regulations permit so.
The Indian government has now proposed to hike FDI cap in insurance sector from 26% to 49%. The proposal has been cleared by the Union Cabinet, but needs to be passed by Parliament.
"Our partnership with Reliance Group is an exemplary example of successful collaboration between two big Corporations and countries. We look forward to strengthening this relationship and using the collective experience of the two corporations to the advantage of the two global economies," Nippon Life Insurance President Yoshinobu Tsutsui said.
Reliance Capital shares were trading nearly 2% higher at Rs. 490.5 on the BSE in early afternoon trade.
Reliance Life, which is part of Anil Ambani-led business conglomerate Reliance Group's financial services arm Reliance Capital, has expanded its partnership with Nippon Life even further and also adopted certain business models of Japanese insurance giant in its practices.
Besides, Nippon Life has also reiterated its commitment to partner the Indian group in its proposed 'Reliance Bank' venture once the banking licence is granted by the RBI.
Reliance Life Insurance (RLI) is amongst the leading private sector life insurance companies in terms of new business premium with a market share of 10 per cent of the private sector life insurance industry.
Nippon Life Insurance is already the biggest foreign direct investor in Indian asset management and life insurance sector till date.
As part of its strategy to enhance investments outside of Japan, Nippon has already been investing substantially in the Indian equity and bond funds through RCAM.
Financial services major Reliance Capital earlier this month reported a 20% rise in its second quarter net profit at Rs. 217 crore, helped by robust growth in mutual fund, commercial finance and general insurance businesses.
The total income rose by 12% to Rs. 2,084 crore for the quarter ended September 30. In asset management business, the profit before tax rose by 71% to Rs. 114 crore, while average assets under management grew to Rs. 1,22,068 crore.
Reliance Life Insurance's net profit touched Rs. 53 crore in the September quarter. During the same period, the net profit of Reliance General Insurance stood at Rs. 25 crore.

Pay per puff E-cigarette boom sparks race for new patentsRaja, DMK MP Kanimozhi, DMK leader M Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, STPL promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka and 14 others, including nine firms, are facing trial in the case.

Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Electronic cigarette makers are racing to design and buy variations of a technology that has lit a billion-dollar boom, created a new vocabulary, and prompted a backlash from health officials worried about the impact of the new smokeless devices .
Research by Thomson Reuters shows that China - with over 300 million smokers - is the front runner in the manufacture and development of so-called e-cigarette technology, while new versions being patented include a "pay as you go" computer-assisted device and others that can deliver caffeine instead.
In 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in published patents. By 2012 the figure had jumped to 220 and by last year there were over 500 inventions, according to an analysis by the IP & Science business of Thomson Reuters. So far this year the total has reached 650. (A single invention may be covered by several patents.)
The original technology, involving battery-powered heating systems that vaporise nicotine-laced liquid, is credited to Hon Lik, a Chinese medical researcher with a 20-a-day habit, in 2003.
His invention has since become so popular that the market is now estimated to be worth $3.5 billion. Both big tobacco firms and small entrepreneurs are falling over themselves to find new ways to "vape" - a verb suddenly so mainstream the Oxford English Dictionary named it 2014's Word of the Year.
Imperial Tobacco last year snapped up the patents owned by the company Hon co-founded in a deal worth $75 million, and is suing rivals for a range of alleged patent infringements.
Part of the rush to create new devices can be explained by the prospect of stiffer regulation on existing ones after the World Health Organization said it wanted to see this, along with bans on indoor use, advertising and sales to minors.
While proponents see e-cigarettes as important tools for harm reduction, critics fear the devices may instead fuel a new wave of nicotine addiction and cite a lack of long-term scientific evidence to support their safety.
Pay as you go
Of more than 2,000 e-cigarette inventions tracked by Thomson Reuters, 64 percent originate in China, where over half of men smoke. In second place is the United States, with 14 percent, followed by South Korea with 9 percent.
Some patented suggestions target smokers looking to regulate their nicotine intake and their spending. While offerings already on the market include thousands of e-liquid flavours from menthol to marshmallow, and even a smartphone app to show how much you are using, new patents go a step further.
Tobacco giant Philip Morris International describes an e-cigarette that would allow users to "pay as you go" by buying a certain number of doses via computer application connected to their e-cigarette. Customers could also programme the device to shut off after a certain number of puffs per use to help limit intake.
Other smaller players aim to deliver doses of caffeine and other additives instead of nicotine.
A unit of mCig Inc sells VitaCigs containing vitamins and supplements such as valerian and collagen, while a company called Energy Shisha sells a caffeinated vaping stick. Patents filed by others, including Fuma International, mention tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis.
In general, e-cigarette patents relate to systems for heating and vaporising liquids, as well as for charging the electronic systems, whether in a "cigalike" device or a larger "tank" system, which doesn't resemble a cigarette but gives a better "vaping" experience.
China's domination of the market reflects not only its huge number of smokers but also a wider drive by the Chinese government to forge a knowledge economy. By maximising patents it hopes to replace the ubiquitous "Made in China" label by "Designed in China."
Since 2011, China has been the world's top patent filer for all inventions, according to the World Intellectual Property Office. Its scientists and companies now lay claim to intellectual property rights on everything from telecoms to medicine.
"Patenting globally is rising significantly year on year, driven by Chinese patenting generally," said Bob Stembridge, senior patent analyst at Thomson Reuters IP & Science.
"But I would say the e-cigarette field is growing faster than the general trend, and the bias toward China is greater than in global patenting."

J&K polls: Only three potential winners among women candidatesJ&K Polls
(Firdous is contesting from…)
SRINAGAR: Only three women candidates in Jammu & Kashmir are believed to have a fighting chance to make it to the 87-member state assembly following the ongoing polls. All three - Sakina Itoo and Shamima Firdous fielded by the National Conference and the PDP's Asiya Naqash - are locked in tough contests, though, and if they lose the representation of women in the assembly could dwindle further to just two members that the government traditionally nominates in every term.
Firdous is contesting from Habakadal in the centre of Srinagar where migrant Kashmiri Pandits have 16,271 registered voters, the highest in a single constituency.
However, the Pandits have rarely turned up to vote since they migrated, leading to a situation where candidates polled just a few hundred votes and won. In 1996 elections, NC's heavyweight Pyare Lal Handoo got 5,984 of the 10,002 polled votes (16.86% of the electorate) and served as law minister in the Farooq Abdullah government. Six years later, his son-in-law Raman Mattoo polled 587 of the 2,062 polled votes and became a minister. Firdous got 286 votes at the time. In 2008 polls, Firdous made it to assembly after polling 2,374 of 5,769 votes and became a minister of state. In all three elections, the BJP was the runner-up.
With party president Amit Shah in command, the BJP is keen to win the seat. The party has mobilised the migrant vote and if they vote in bulk, the BJP candidate stands a good chance of winning. Shamima's best bet lies in ensuring participation of more resident voters to offset the impact of Pandits backing the BJP.
Ittoo is in a different situation. Daughter of slain assembly speaker Wali Mohammad, she was encouraged by Farooq Abdullah to leave her medical graduation midway and contest in 1996. She made it to the assembly in heavily polled Noorabad and became a minister. In 2002, when she was pitted against PDP, she was immobilised by a series of assassination bids by militants and lost. But she got re-elected with a huge margin and was the only woman in Omar Abdullah's cabinet. Now, however, she is facing massive anti-incumbency.
Naqash, sister-in-law of PDP heavyweight and MP Tariq Hameed Karra, entered politics in 2002 and lost to Farooq Abdullah from Hazratbal. Now she is contesting again from the same constituency but this time she faces NC's Syed Akhnoon. The contest is getting very difficult for her, according to local people.
Although political parties have been fielding women candidates routinely, very few women make it to the assembly. In 1996, for instance, only 14 women contested, of which only two won while the rest lost and 10 even forfeited their security deposits. The situation improved in 2002, when there were 30 women contestants among 709, but the result was much the same. In 2008, there were 68 women among 1,354 candidates and three of them won - Mehbooba Mufti, Sakina Ittoo and Shamima Firdous - while 57 lost their deposits.
This time, too, every party has fielded women candidates but most of them are likely to lose. Mehbooba Mufti is an exception, having been member of assembly thrice and twice of Lok Sabha since 1996. "It is not easy for women to come forward, fight an election and win," Mufti said, . "In 2008, we fielded maximum number of women but not many won."
Women face a lot of problems if they join politics, Mufti said. "We got Nayeema Mehjoor (a former BBC broadcaster) into the party and she was forced to shut her Facebook account," she said, adding that her party had introduced 33% reservation for women in local bodies but even that did not help much.

Chhattisgarh
(Rajnath Singh has rejected…)
NEW DELHI: Now that his party was in power, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh expected the Union Home Ministry to positively respond to his state's demand that the Centre meet the expenses to fight Maoists. However, he was disappointed as the Narendra Modi-led BJP government gave the same response as its predecessor.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh has rejected a request of Raman Singh to waive off nearly Rs 2,400 crore bill, pending since 2007, for deployment of CRPF and other paramilitary forces to fight Maoists in the state. The message was conveyed to the CM vide a Home Ministry letter on November 19. Raman Singh had resubmitted the request to the Union Home Minister after the BJP came to power at the Centre. He asked for exemption of cost of deployment charges of CRPF for nine years, with effect from July 1, 2007, but the Home Ministry waved the same rule book to turn down Raman's request.
A senior Home Ministry official said the CM had impressed upon Rajnath Singh that the Centre should bear the full expenditure for CRPF fighting Maoists as it was a national responsibility and not a local law-and-order problem.
He pointed out to Rajnath Singh that the special category states like those in the northeast, J&K and Himachal Pradesh bear only 10% of the cost of deployment of central forces while all other states have to cough up the whole cost. The chief minister also said his state with a total budget of Rs 54,000 crore was in no position to pay the outstanding bill of Rs 2,400 crore to the Centre.
The chief minister also requested for 26 more central battalions in Bastar, in addition to 48 battalions already in the state. The Centre, however, told Raman Singh additional forces would be provided only by 2016 and the state will have to cough up the entire cost. The Union Home Ministry told Raman Singh that there was no provision to waive off deployment expenditure in Maoist-affected states. Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar owe the Centre nearly Rs 5,000 crore on account of CRPF deployment.

India bright-spot in Asia-Pacific  reforms pace up: S&PASEAN-4
(In the more trade-dependent…)
NEW DELHI: Asia-Pacific economies are losing momentum as they approach the finish line in 2014, but India is bucking the trend, global rating firm S&P said in a note.
"China's economy continues to slow, and trend growth is below the authorities' target. Japan is now in a technical recession," said the note.
In the more trade-dependent economies, the hoped-for pick-up in external demand is yet to materialize and 2014 looks like yet another sub-par year. But, only India has been able to buck this trend, affirms S&P in a note.
China's economy, which has been the stalwart of Asia-Pacific (and global) growth, has been sputtering of late, at least by Chinese standards. In the third quarter, Japan entered a technical recession for the fourth time since 2008, with GDP falling by 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis.
However, the rating agency sees year 2015 and 2016 as more better, especially if we look beyond the headline numbers and factor in a higher quality of GDP growth , more external demand, and hopefully less credit expansion.
India has been the bright spot in Asia-Pacific, say S&P in a note released on Wednesday. After a cautious start, the Modi government has picked up the pace of reform, they say.
In a dramatic move, the government deregulated diesel prices in October (when the subsidy was close to zero owing to the drop in energy prices). It also announced some liberalization for foreign investment into financial services and a 10 per cent cut in discretionary spending in the current fiscal year.
This was on top of earlier measures to streamline the bureaucracy and increase financial inclusion. S&P is of the view that the economy has started to improve, with confidence rising and growth momentum now at about 7 per cent.
Elsewhere, the region's trade-dependent economies are struggling. Unlike China and Japan, their troubles are mainly not of their own making.
The incipient recovery in the US economy is yet to spur a rise in global trade growth and higher external demand for Asia-Pacific, the S&P note say.
While this is less of an issue for the larger, more domestic-driven economies, it directly affects the more open ones with smaller domestic markets of the newly industrialized group (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) rather than the ASEAN-4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand).

Credit Rating
(Rating agency Moody's Investors…)
MUMBAI: Rating agency Moody's Investors Service today said the sovereign outlook for the country remains stable at Baa3, but future rating trends depend on the reform measures taken by the government.
"Sovereign credit rating trends in 2015 will depend on the extent to which the government addresses high fiscal expenditures, recurrent food price inflation, and wide infrastructure deficit," Moody's said in a report.
All the three big international rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch have BBB ratings on the country's sovereign with a stable outlook. The current rating is closest to junk status or below investment grade.
The report says the government's ability and willingness to undertake structural reforms will have a bearing on the credit rating outlook of the country.
"The government's recent policy measures, such as diesel price deregulation, a greater focus on local manufacturing, as well as the Reserve Bank's efforts to contain inflationary pressures and raise banking system efficiency, could increase savings, investment and productivity in the economy," Moody's said.
The report further said the recent steps are augmented with additional steps next year to address infrastructure gaps and attract foreign direct investment inflows, government policies can support the sovereign credit profile through higher medium term GDP growth.
The economy, after growing at over 9 per cent for three successive years has lost the steam and grew at sub-5 per cent in the past two fiscals due to policy paralysis under the past government. In the first quarter of this fiscal the GDP clipped at an unexpected 5.7 per cent, while the Q2 GDP print is slated to be much lower at 5-5.3 per cent. The government will release the Q2 GDP numbers later this week.
The report said the possibility of confidence shocks from the expected rise in US interest rates , especially in the case of a disorderly market reaction may have an impact on the country's credit quality.
The report believes that although inflation and the current account deficit have declined over the last year, a tightening in US monetary policy could still result in some volatility in capital inflows and the exchange rate.
Moreover, elevated government debt and the risk of recurrent inflation limit room for the authorities to stimulate the economy in the event of a shock from significantly lower-than-anticipated global growth, it added.
The rating agency also said the global sovereign outlook for 2015 is stable as a gradual global recovery supports sovereign credit quality.
"However, GDP growth rates for sovereigns globally are likely to remain lower than the levels seen before the global financial crisis in 2008-09," the report said.

BSF plans laser walls to stop infiltration from PakBSF plans laser walls to stop infiltration from Pakistan

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Laser walls may soon be used to stop infiltration from Pakistan. This is one solution BSF is exploring to implement more effective border checks.
The laser wall will ensure that anyone approaching the border or breaking the beam in an unfenced zone sets off an alarm.
Other than laser walls in unfenced areas, the force is considering anti-tunnel ground sensors and thermal sensors in the fenced stretches. Such technologies, sources said, are already in use in countries such as Israel.
"We're constantly modernizing our weaponry and upgrading defences according to the new challenges facing us. We have looked at some of these technologies and have found them suitable," BSF director general DK Pathak said.
Sources in the force said laser beams would form a wall in places such as the riverine parts of Jammu where fencing isn't possible. The system will be connected to an alarm which would go off at any breach. At present about 15% of the Indo-Pak border and about 35% of the Indo-Bangla frontier is unfenced.
Given that terrorists often use tunnels to sneak in, BSF is acquiring seismic sensors which would be planted underground along the border.
These would record vibrations resulting from tunnelling and alert the control room. This is largely being installed on the Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Punjab, which see maximum tunnelling attempts by infiltrators.
BSF is also setting up a "smart fencing system" where thermal sensors would be installed on fences which would alert control rooms of any living being approaching the fence. "This would work as an advance alert system where one would have time to reach the area where infiltrators might be attempting cut a fence and enter. Or a smuggler may be trying to pass on a contraband packet," said a BSF officer.
The force is acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles and other surveillance equipment to bolster its border defence. The move comes even though BSF maintains that there is no infiltration from Pakistan on the borders it guards. "In the past three years we have found no evidence of infiltration on international border with Pakistan," Pathak said.
However, there have been several terror attacks in border areas of Jammu, such as Hiranagar in Kathua, where militants have been suspected to have entered crossing the international border guarded by BSF. However, no agency has as yet found any evidence.

No talks with Pakistan when bullets are flying: MoS Defence  Inderjit SinghInderjit Singh
(India cannot have talks…)
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: India cannot have talks with Pakistan when bullets are flying around, Minister of State for Defence and Planning Rao Inderjit Singh said today.
India's attitue toward Pakistan has been made clear by the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister, he said, apparently referring to the issue of repeated ceasefire violations on the Line of Control.
"You cannot have talks in an atmosphere when bullets and mortar shells are being fired," Singh told a press conference held on the sidelines of the 44th All India Sainik Schools Pincipals' Conference at Sainik School, Kazhakootam near here.
Talks with Pakistan were called off when they held talks with separatists, he said, adding, "Fundamental remains the same... We cannot have talks when bullets are flying around. We will have to wait and watch."
To a question on one-rank, one pension for defence personnel, he said the NDA Government has declared unequivocally that it would implement it. Provisions were made in the last budget for that.
"A final annoucement on the matter will be made either in Parliamnet during the (current) session or after that," he added.
On the expanson of Sainik schools in the country, Singh said six more schools would be opned - three in Uttar Pradesh, two in Rajasthan and one in Uthrakand. With this, the number of Sainik schools in the country would go up to 31.
The objective of the government was to make the Sainik schools the backbone that provides young officers to Army, he pointed out.
There was a shortage of Army officers to an extent of 9,000 to 10,000, he said, adding strengthening Sainik schools was one way to address the issue.

Border Security
(At present about 15 per cent…)
NEW DELHI: In order to plug loopholes in the porous and unfenced borders along Pakistan and Bangladesh, India will soon set up a 'smart fence' mechanism as part of an over Rs 4,500-crore modernisation plan being implemented by BSF.
The country's largest border guarding force, with over 2.5 lakh personnel under its command, has recently begun the trial of these sophisticated and technical smart fencing systems in a four-km stretch in Jammu and Punjab sectors where fencing with barbed wires is not possible due to difficult topography or inclement weather.
The Border Security Force, in a maiden initiative, is also undertaking an ambitious upgradation of its surveillance equipment, guns and artillery to effectively secure over 7,000-km border on the western and eastern flanks of the country.
"We need to upgrade and modernise everything... Right from our weaponry and communication devices to infrastructure. We have a modernisation plan and budget of over Rs 4,500 crore which will run for a five-year period," BSF Director General D K Pathak told reporters ahead of the forces' 49th Raising Day on December 1.
He said BSF is looking for "technical solutions where fencing is not possible" which includes testing of foreign- made gadgets. "We had floated global tenders (to procure these items)... We have identified some of them (equipment) and we will implement some of them soon," Pathak said.
The BSF chief, whose force guards the Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangla borders with varied patches of riverine, marshy and desert area, said the force is aiming to "increase its capabilities and procure Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and surveillance equipments" for aiding its border guarding task.
At present about 15 per cent of the Indo-Pak border and about 35 per cent of the Indo-Bangladesh frontier is unfenced.
Officials said the force is procuring a smart 'motion sensor alarm' which blips and alerts border guards in case there is a movement along the unfenced stretch of the frontier which is located in difficult terrain. A similar laser-guided gadget is being put to test to detect hidden tunnels in border areas and undulating land.

Analyst Corner: Sale of Africa tower positive for BhartiSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Maintain ‘outperform’ on Bharti Airtel with price target of R464 per share. The company announced the third tranche of its tower sale in Nigeria at $1.05 billion for 4,800 towers. The deal is likely to be in the form of a lease, with Bharti as an anchor tenant in all its towers.
While the deals would be positive for EV as it leads to net debt reduction of c.$2 billion, the estimated cash flow impact is c.$275 million on account of lease payments. We estimate net negative EV on account of cash outflow of c.$1.4 billion. The assigned multiple of 5x lease outflow is higher than the 3x EV/ebitda multiple derived from the DCF for Bharti’s Africa operations. Our calculations indicate a net positive value accretion of R11 per share for Bharti on completed tower sales. Extrapolating similar economics for the entire 15,000 towers would imply an upside of R15 per share.
Bharti announced the sale of its 4,800 towers in Nigeria to American Tower Corporation for $1.05 billion, i.e. at a total cost of $2.20 lakh per tower. This follows two Africa tower sales of 3,500 towers and 3,100 towers to Helios partners and Eaton towers, estimated at $1.5-1.6 lakh, in line with the replacement cost in respective countries. The total sale of 11,400 towers constitutes the bulk of Bharti’s 15,000 tower portfolio in Africa. We estimate the total consideration of the three tower deals at $2.1 billion.
We estimate that the Africa tower sale would be close to its replacement cost. In terms of reported numbers, the deals should not impact Bharti’s reported ebitda, as the lease payments will be below ebitda.

OnePlus to hit Indian shores on Dec 2  partners AmazonAfter Xiaomi and Oppo, another Chinese handset maker OnePlus is now gearing up to launch its product in India on December 2.
OnePlus has partnered eCommerce firm Amazon to launch its ‘One’ in the country.
Though the pricing is yet to be divulged, the handset would be priced aggressively in the mid-range, between Rs 15,000-25,000.
The company has also put in place a local team, led by OnePlus India General Manager Vikas Agarwal. India is the first country outside of its headquarters to have a physical presence.
This will also be the first region in which a localised service infrastructure is established, offering phone and walk-in support to users around the country.
“Our company focuses first on our users and our product. We want to provide the best possible experience for our Indian users who have been so supportive of our vision,” OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said.
To do that, OnePlus is investing heavily in Indian operations and partnering e-commerce company, Amazon.in, he added.
Keeping in line with the global invite system, users in India will receive India-specific invites through OnePlus and Amazon.in.
Starting Wednesday, users interested in buying the handset can log onto the company’s website to register for receiving an invite. After receiving the invite, they can buy the device on Amazon.in starting December 2.
India, which is one of the fastest growing smartphone markets globally, is also one of the most lucrative opportunities that handset makers are vying for.
In the last few months, new players like Xiaomi, Oppo and Jolla have entered the Indian market to challenge established players like Samsung, Micromax and Nokia (now Microsoft Devices).
According to IDC, about 44 million smartphones were sold last year. For 2014, it expects the number to cross 80.57 million units.

Assembly elections
(“Higher vote for the BJP…)
MUMBAI: Bookies, it seems, are expecting hung assemblies in Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand , the two states where elections are happening in the current round. But if the trend in the illegal Satta Bazzar is anything to go by, the BJP is set to make major inroads in the Himalayan state and im-prove its tally in the east.
Bookies in Mumbai and Delhi have predicted the outcome of the April-May national elections with accuracy. They have been accurate on last month's Maharashtra polls, too.
The odds of the BJP winning 25 seats in the J&K assembly are 0.58:1 - that means, bookies are willing to pay 58 paise for each rupee bet on the BJP winning 25 seats, two members from sepa-rate betting syndicates in Delhi said. They will pay 70 paise on accurate bets of the party winning 20 seats and Rs 1.10 if it gets 30. If the bet is for 35 berths in the 87-member assembly, and that turns out to be the outcome, one rupee will earn Rs 2.25 for those who predicted it accurately. As the returns increase, the chances of winning reduce.
Based on the odds, the People's Democratic Party will likely emerge as main opponent for the BJP. For each rupee, bookies offer 20 paise for the party winning 20 seats. Those betting for the party winning 40 seats will get Rs 6 if the outcome matches. Based on current odds, the mostly likely scenario for the ruling National Conference is five seats, compared with 28 last time. The Congress, which has 17 MLAs now, may even return blank.
For the BJP, which has 11 members in the outgoing assembly, even getting 25 seats will be a big again, though that won't take anywhere near meeting its 44+ target. Its aim is to win most of seats in Jammu and Ladakh regions, which together send 41 MLAs to the assembly. Some bookies expect the Narendra Modi wave to help the party win some seats in the Kashmir valley too.
"Higher vote for the BJP in Hindu dominated Jammu is a given, but surprisingly for the first time, even Muslim youths in the valley are attracted to BJP," said a bookie.

Homes-Book-Tidying Up: From Japan  the joy of minimalism at homeLava launches new smartphone Iris Fuel 60 priced at Rs 8,888
If you haven’t communed with your socks lately, thanked your shoes for their hard work or bowed (at least mentally) to your home in appreciation, maybe it’s time to consider it.
”It is very natural for me to say thank you to the goods that support us,” says Marie Kondo, whose method of lovingly connecting with belongings that ”spark joy” and bidding a fond but firm farewell to the rest is popular in Japan and now catching on elsewhere.
Kondo’s book, ”The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,” is a best-seller in Japan, Germany and Britain and has recently been published in the United States. Kondo has been the subject of a movie in Japan, and the waiting list for her services, once three months long, is now so extensive that she has temporarily stopped accepting more clients.
Her ”KonMarie Method,” as she calls it in the diminutive and illustration-free volume, encourages a rapid, dramatic and transformative one-time organizing event – completed methodically and lovingly in no more than six months. It’s not an ongoing battle against clutter.
Kondo sees ”tidying” as a cheerful conversation in which anything that doesn’t ”spark joy” is to be touched, thanked and ceremonially sent on its way toward a better life elsewhere, where it can discover a more appreciative owner.
The result can be life-changing, she says. Clients suddenly find themselves surrounded entirely by things that provide clarity, unencumbered by belongings that carry past baggage (unwanted gifts, clothes that no longer fit) or anxieties about the future (does anyone need more cotton swabs than there are days of the year?). Even her book, she says, should be quickly discarded when it’s no longer needed.
Part of what makes her method unusually speedy is that instead of de-cluttering room by room, she tackles a household by subject, starting with what’s easiest to part with. So, all the clothes, then all the books, then documents, then miscellany and, last and most difficult, photos and mementos.
Instead of deciding what to discard, she says, the focus should be on what to keep: which few things spark sufficient joy or are truly necessary.
How to contend with family members unready to join in the celebratory purge?
If possible, carry the bags out of the house yourself. ”There’s no need to let your family know the details of what you throw out or donate,” she writes, although she advises against secretly disposing of other people’s things. ”You can leave communal spaces to the end. The first step is to confront your own stuff.”
After joyfully relegating mountains of unneeded or unloved belongings to the trash or charity, she then turns to organizing what’s left.
The key, she says, is storing things mostly in drawers, arranged so that everything can be seen at a glance and nothing is stacked, a practice decidedly unkind to items at the bottom.
So T-shirts and socks (the ones you’ve kept because they make you happy) are rolled – no painfully balled-up socks with moaning elastic here – and beautifully arranged like sushi in a bento box.
Closets are meticulously arranged to fit everything from electric fans (at the bottom) and spare blankets (on top) to carefully arranged clear drawers of beloved belongings and a shelf or two with a few joy-sparking books.
Papers and documents – there won’t be many since few are truly necessary and they generally hold so little joy – are likewise filed and not stacked.
Kondo says she has been obsessed with ”tidying” since she was 5, opting to arrange shoes and pencils in school when other kids played in the playground. She began communing with her belongings in high school and, after years of work at a Shinto shrine, realized her calling as a professional consultant on attaining the joy of minimalism.
”The inside of a house or apartment after de-cluttering has much in common with a Shinto shrine … a place where there are no unnecessary things, and our thoughts become clear. It is the place where we appreciate all the things that support us,” she says. ”It is where we review and rethink about ourselves.”

Fund raising via QIP surges to Rs 30 000 cr so far in 2014Fund raising via QIP surges to Rs 30,000 crore so far in 2014
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 15:01 IST
Picture for representation purpose only. (Source: Reuters)
Domestic firms have garnered about Rs 30,000 crore through the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) route in the first ten months of this year, much higher than Rs 12,634 crore raked up in the entire 2013.
Moreover, market experts believe that the fund raising through this route is likely to go up further as many companies have lined up with their plans.
According to latest update available with the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), companies have mopped up Rs 29,582 crore through 33 QIP issues during January-October period of 2014.
There was a large gap between the capital raised through QIPs and funds garnered via other routes.
A total of Rs 4,733 crore was raked up through rights issue, while Rs 1,522 crore mopped up via initial public offerings (IPOs) during January-October period of the year.
Market experts said that return of investor confidence in the equity markets has encouraged some of the large firms to mop up funds through the QIP route.
Interestingly, most of the funds were raised through QIP issuances after the election verdict was announced in May, thus clearly showcasing the revival of investor sentiment, backed by a strong secondary market, experts said.
Among the firms which garnered funds via QIP segment this year included SBI, Yes Bank, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications.
Most of the funds were raised for expansion purpose and to support working capital requirements.
The fund raising was in line with the soaring markets where the benchmark Sensex gained around 32 per cent in the first ten months of the year.

New Delhi: Facebook, which invited users to comment on its new privacy policy until November 20 , is now ready with the final version that will go into effect January 1, 2015. The company has already started sending out notifications informing users of the updated terms, data policy, and cookies policy they will be agreeing to after January 1 next year.
"By using our services after January 1, 2015, you agree to our updated terms, data policy, and cookies policy and to seeing improved ads based on apps and sites you use," states the social network in a notification pushed to users on mobile and desktop.
Introducing the updated privacy policy, Facebook has made it easier for people to understand and control how their information is used at the leading social network while expanding its quest to better target ads.
Facebook has already started sending out notifications informing users of the updated terms, data policy, and cookies policy they will be agreeing to after January 1 next year.
#facebook #data policy #new privacy policy #social networks
Now, with Privacy Basics , you will get tips and a how-to guide for taking charge of your experience on Facebook. The company has also updated its terms , data policy and cookies policy to reflect new features it has been working on and to make them easy to understand.
It has also introduced improvements to ads based on the apps and sites you use off Facebook (online behavioral advertising) and giving you control.
Over the years, the company has faced concerns from users and from government regulators and privacy advocates that its policies are too complicated. Two years ago, it settled with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it exposed details about their users' lives without getting the required legal consent. Last year, an independent audit that was part of the settlement found its privacy practices sufficient.
Despite criticisms, Facebook is rare among Internet companies in that it seeks user input on its privacy policy and tries to put it in plain English. But it also has a vast trove of data about its users that it uses to show ads and measure how well they work, among other things.

New York: A study involving 1,70,000 internet users across 32 countries has found that more and more teenagers are spending more time on instant messaging apps than on Facebook.
Nearly 66 per cent of teenagers (aged 16-19) in the US and Britain said they were using Facebook less frequently.
While the teenagers are not off the social networking site completely, the interactions have dropped and the group is more passive about the site as a whole, revealed the new "Social Summary for Q3 2014" from market research firm GlobalWebIndex (GWI).
Nearly 30 per cent of teenagers says they are not on Facebook as often because their friends have gone on Instagram and instant messaging apps.
#facebook #whatsapp #instagram #messaging apps
"Even though Facebook has more users, activity such as photo sharing and messaging has fallen off by 20 percentage points in the last two years," the findings showed.
Nearly 30 per cent of teenagers said they are not on Facebook as often because their friends have gone on Instagram and other messaging apps, StreetInsider.com reported.
The report found that although Facebook has a drop in active users, its Messanger is not very popular among teenagers, even leaving WhatsApp behind as the most used messaging app.
Snapchat turns out to be the real winner among teenagers.
"Snapchat has the youngest audience of any social app and usage ranges from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of all online teenagers in key markets such as the US, Britain and Canada," the report added.

Sebi rejigs supervision model; stricter checks on high-risk cosGold, silver dip on sluggish demand, weak global cues
To help it better regulate the marketplace and strengthen its surveillance system, regulator Sebi has decided to adopt a supervision model based on risk levels for various market entities including brokers and mutual funds.
Under the new model, various market entities would be divided into four groups — very low risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk — and the quantum of surveillance and number of inspections would increase as per the risk level.
This new supervision regime has been put in in place as per recommendations of an independent global consultant and the subsequent suggestions made by an internal Task Force at Sebi, while taking into account practices followed by many overseas regulators, a senior official said.
The move would help the existing surveillance system take care of most of the smaller offences, so that the investigation resources are utilised more effectively to tackle serious violations in the market place.
The new model would follow four distinct steps — assessing the risk posed by a market entity, assigning ‘risk and impact rating’ to it, determine the supervisory risk rating score and then adopt a suitable supervisory approach.
The overall risk profile of an entity would be computed as a function of two components — business or activity specific risk and the impact risk arising out of default or failure.
The supervisory approach based on risk levels is being implemented in a phased manner, the official said, while adding that the first step towards its implementation has been achieved with finalisation of a report in this regard that provides necessary guidance to the supervisory divisions to formulate policies for supervision and inspections in future.
Earlier in September, Chairman U K Sinha had said that Sebi was working on this risk-based supervision model while becoming the first financial sector regulator in the country to have done a study of its own regulatory impact.
The Sebi chief had further said that specific metrics would be put in place to determine the risk that every firm poses to the system and based on which enforcement actions can also be initiated.
While the existing supervision model followed by Sebi has been very effective, it was found that the approach was ‘loosely risk based’, where no formal risk ratings were assigned to regulated intermediaries and the current resource allocation approach did not allow for an assessment of risk concentration across all regulated intermediaries.
The new supervisory approach is based upon overall risk assessment of the intermediary rather than on individual factors such as turnover, complaints, penalties, etc.
“The total number of inspections per intermediary will increase and the new approach would involve a combination of comprehensive, thematic and off-site monitoring for inclusive supervision of the intermediaries,” the official said.
As supervision is an ongoing process and based on the experience gained, the concerned supervisory divisions can gradually scale up the risk elements as well as the supervisory actions, the official said.
The new model provides for a combination of onsite and offsite monitoring of the intermediaries by Sebi and its front-line regulators.
“The entities falling in high risk group will be subjected to stricter monitoring (offsite) and comprehensive inspection.
“Thematic inspections, as a supervisory tool, will be utilised for specific purposes, such as, verifying compliance with recently issued regulatory requirements, on references received from departments within Sebi and other regulatory bodies, or where a focused review of assessing compliance in a particular area of operations is needed,” he added.
“The supervisory risk rating scores for all intermediaries within the same class or type will be arranged in a descending order and divided into four distinct groups — high risk, medium risk, low risk and very low risk.
“Alternately, the grouping may also be done separately on risk rating scores and impact rating scores. Further, the entities may be divided into four groups equally or based on predetermined thresholds,” as per the proposed norms.
The new guidelines would also provide the procedure for determining the supervisory risk rating score for conglomerates and group companies that carry out multiple lines of regulated businesses.
The overall risk score for them would take into account factors like significance of their businesses in capital markets and the sub-score for each type of business activity carried out by the entity.
The system would identify specific risks posed by different business of an entity, such as credit risk, market risk and operational risk. These ‘risk parameters’ will be accompanied by the corresponding risk mitigating measures, termed as ‘control parameters’, which are mainly systems or procedures put in place to minimise risk.
Similarly, the impact parameters will be identified to reflect risks associated with impact of default or failure of an intermediary on the basis of size of operations of the intermediary, number of active clients, turnover, market share, etc.
The credit risk would take into account loans to group entities or related parties, debt levels, margins-related defaults and other issues.
The risk assessment templates have been developed for various market intermediaries, such as stock brokers, depository participants, mutual funds, custodians, merchant bankers, portfolio managers, registrars and transfer agents, credit rating agencies and investment advisers.
Risk and impact ratings would be assigned to each entity on a scale of 0-4, with zero rating being for those with completed absence of any risk parameters, and a score of four would indicate “Very high risk/ Very low compliance”.

Rupee falls three paise  snaps two-day riseFOREX UPDATE: Rupee falls three paise, snaps two-day rise

In dull trade, Indian rupee on Thursday snapped its two-day rise and fell back by three paise to end at 61.87 against the Greenback on month-end dollar demand from importers.
The rupee had fallen to 61.92 levels intra-day but positive cues from local equities and sustained capital inflows helped it to cut losses, forex dealers said.
There was caution in the foreign exchange market ahead of quarterly GDP data release on Friday and the RBI's monetary policy review next week, they added.
At the Interbank Forex market, the domestic currency resumed better at 61.81 a dollar from last close of 61.84.
Later, it was trapped in a narrow range of 61.80 and 61.9225 before concluding at 61.87, a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent. In the previous two days, it had risen by ten paise or 0.16 per cent while trading in a tight range.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Friday rose by 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $35.65 mn on Thursday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was up by 0.20 per cent against its major six global rivals. Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said: Not much movement was seen in the USD/INR pair.
The pair is likely to trade range bound as investors are trading cautiously and are waiting for the credit policy due next month, which will help them to gauge the markets. The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.50 to 62.40, he added.

RBI releases norms for payment  small finance banksSuvashree Dey Choudhury, Devidutta Tripathy and Neha Dasgupta        Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 18:53 IST
Reserve Bank of India issued on Thursday final guidelines for companies seeking to set up so-called payments banks and small finance banks in a bid to expand banking services to more people and small businesses.
Payments banks can accept deposits and remittances but cannot provide loans. Small finance banks are aimed at lending to "unserved and underserved sections including small business units", the RBI said.
Large state-run entities and business houses will not be allowed to set up small finance banks, which will have to comply with statutory reserve requirements.
Companies will have to apply by January 16 next year for licences in both categories, and the central bank said it would consider more applications at a later stage.

A new attempt at financial inclusionBetting big on payment banks
We should move towards a mobile payment platform with collective effort from banks, the govt and RBI
Reliance MediaWorks sells Big Cinemas to Carnival Films

Many bankers are justifiably concerned about introduction of payment banks in the country. The threat to bank’s low-cost current and savings account balances is real. It is now well established that the primary driver of balances in these accounts is the number of electronic or cheque payments made by the customers from these accounts (without withdrawing cash from ATM). If the new-generation payment banks introduce technology to make payments convenient for customers, some of the precious float in low-cost current and savings deposits of the banks could move to them.
Much of the threat could disappear if they could come together to create a mobile-to-mobile payment platform that could allow funds transfer to anybody by just knowing the recipient’s mobile phone number. Imagine a world where you can pay your maid her salary, the plumber his repair charges, the taxi its fare, the schools their fee, bills of various kinds, recharge of mobile and pay TV, and monthly transfer to mom knowing just their mobile numbers. The money goes from your account to their account in 15 seconds and a confirmation is received. You will not need to go to an ATM to withdraw cash. More importantly, by default, you would not imagine you would need an account with a payment bank to help you make payment.
This is not a utopian digital dream from a science-fiction movie. It is now a proven model in some countries. In UK a scheme like this, called Paym, was launched in April. Within three months a million customers signed up. A fast growing segment which uses this service prolifically is small merchants. Small roadside shops do not have size and scale to set up infrastructure to accept payments using cards. This is a big boon to them. It takes 15 seconds to secure an end-to-end transfer of funds and get confirmation. This has been on the table in India also but banks have baulked at taking it to its logical end point. We have today a platform called National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP) that has been created by National Payment Corp. of India (NPCI). By dialling *99#, from any phone on any network, one can connect to this service irrespective of your bank and carry out transactions.
However, it is quite cumbersome when it comes to transferring money to someone else. You need to know the recipient’s account number, IFSC code, or another long code called MMID. With slightly bolder thinking and innovation, we can make this platform seamless and achieve the objective of instant mobile-to-mobile funds transfer knowing just the recipient’s mobile number.
India needs this service more desperately than countries such as the UK. Developed markets such as the UK are almost fully carded, which means almost all customers have debit cards and most merchant establishments have a card-reading devices. Almost all payments at shops and merchants can be made using cards. What remains for the mobile-to-mobile transfer is small person-to-person (P2P) transfer or payment for petty errands. In India, this would be a revolution. Small shops which cannot afford a point of sale (POS) card-reading device would go for this option to receive payments. And this includes 95% of the shops in the country.
As a matter of fact, India has to bet on mobile-to-mobile payment as primary platform for customer purchases. Our banks, our government and the Reserve Bank of India are content betting on cards to be primary platform for retail payments. Even if we distribute plastic debit cards to all customers for free, small merchants in small towns are not going to have POS devices in the foreseeable future. The economics does not work out for card acceptance technology. We seem to be betting on cards, which is a 30-year-old technology developed for the West that suited its cause at a particular time. We need to bet on mobile instead and back it with a high energy collective effort from banks, the government and the regulator.
Interestingly, as this service goes live in the UK, many observers are predicting a wiping out of P2P service providers—a shutdown of UK’s version of domestic payment banks. In India, we seem to need payment banks to threaten banks into action. No one is arguing that there is no risk. The right approach is to apply full power of technology to find a way to beat the risk and not be beaten by it into inaction. Our banks have so far decided not to come together to fully harness the opportunity. They do so at their own peril.

Never said would bring black money in 100 daysNever talked about bringing back black money in 100 days: Govt
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 22:12 IST
The government on Thursday insisted in Lok Sabha that it had never claimed that all the black money stashed abroad would be brought back within 100 days even as the Opposition continued to target it over the issue.
Contesting the opposition charge in this regard, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu cited BJP's Lok Sabha election manifesto which said a task force would be set up to deal with the problem of black money .
"We are not so immature to say we will bring back entire black money in 100 days," Naidu said while intervening in a debate on black money.
His comment came in response to attack by Opposition which said BJP leaders had promised to bring back black money within 100 days of coming to power and questioned why it did not happen as six months had elapsed.
Naidu said the BJP election manifesto stated that if voted to power, the government will minimise the scope for corruption and set up a task force for tracking down or bringing back black money.
The process of bringing back black money will be put in motion, he said.
Listing out the measures taken by the BJP government to deal with the black money menace, Naidu said whenever 100 days is said, it means action will be initiated within 100 days.
He claimed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had first talked about 100 days with respect to unearthing of black money when he made a statement in Parliament in July 2009.
Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said people had trusted the BJP's election campaign of bringing back the money stashed abroad and hence the government should give an assurance in the House when the money would be brought back. Youth of the country thought they will get Rs 15 lakh. You sold lies to people. The government has to inform Parliament when they will bring the money back, Yadav said.

Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia today told the Supreme Court that he was not connected with the day-to-day affairs of accused company Sterling Cellular Ltd and the special court wrongly summoned him as an accused in a corruption case related to allocation of additional spectrum during the NDA regime in 2002.
Besides Ruia,  Bharti Cellular Ltd CMD Sunil Bharti Mittal, whose name did not figure in CBI's charge sheet as accused, was summoned on March 19 last year by the special CBI court saying there was "enough material" to proceed against them in the case.
Ruia was neither named in the charge sheet nor probed by the CBI in the case, senior advocate K V Vishwanathan told a bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu.
The lawyer also said that there was no material on record regarding alleged misconduct by Ruia. However, senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for CBI, told the bench that there was "substantial circumstantial evidence" to prove misconduct against them.
Venugopal further said that recalling the lower court order to summon them will have enormous repercussions. The court has now fixed the case for further hearing on December 3.
Earlier, Bharti Cellular Ltd CMD Mittal had assailed the lower court order summoning him as accused in the case. "It is a curious case," senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Mittal and Ruia, had said, adding that the alleged culpability of a company cannot be fastened on its director or an employee if there is no prima facie evidence to support the allegation.
Besides Mittal and Ruia, the lower court had also summoned Asim Ghosh, the then Managing Director of accused firm Hutchison Max Telecom Pvt Ltd. Ghosh was also not named as accused in the charge sheet. The trial court had said that Mittal, Ghosh and Ruia used to chair board meetings and "were/are prima facie in control of affairs of the respective companies" and "they are/were 'alter-ego' of their respective companies".

BJP adamant on holding Amit Shah Kolkata rally

Kolkata: Notwithstanding the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the fire department denying permissions, the BJP on Thursday said it will go ahead with the proposed on November 30 city rally of its national president Amit Shah.
Claiming that West Bengal Chief Minister was "afraid" of rise of the party, Bharatiya Janata Party national secretary Siddarth Nath Singh said they would approach the Calcutta High Court once again, seeking justice.
"Mamata Banerjee doesn't believe in a democratic and peaceful political fight as her approach is anarchist, therefore her government has denied permission to hold a peaceful rally," said Singh after the KMC and the fire department during the day refused permission for the rally.
The BJP on Thursday said it will go ahead with the proposed on November 30 city rally of its national president Amit Shah.
#amit shah #bjp #kolkata municipal corporation #victoria house
Denied permission to hold the rally at Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool Congress usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally, the BJP state unit had moved the bench of Justice Debangshu Basak alleging discrimination by the city police.
After a court ordered meeting between BJP representatives and city Police Commissioner Surajit Kar Purkayastha failed to solve the impasse, Justice Basak subsequently had directed the KMC and the fire department to inform the BJP about its decision on granting permission for the rally by Thursday.
Claiming that the reasons given by the KMC and the fire department were "frivolous", Singh said the "BJP will exercise their rightful and legal option by moving the court again on Friday".
"The growth of BJP in Bengal has shaken the Trinamool leadership and the movement of Banerjee's core voters the minorities to BJP has taken her sleep away. The desperate move of stopping a democratic right of holding a rally will boomerang on Trinamool and particularly on Banerjee," said Singh, also the party's observer for the state.
Singh as well as party's state unit chief Rahul Sinha asserted the rally will be held as scheduled and the "Trinamool government responsible for the consequences".

Seeking to take benefits from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ campaign, Swedish furniture giant IKEA is all set to have fresh tie-ups with small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which will help the company double the merchandise it sources in India by 2020.
“IKEA Group is positive to all government initiatives that help in simplifying and making it easier to produce and export products in India,” said Sandeep Sanan, head of sourcing, IKEA India, told HT. “We are actively looking for new suppliers and to increase the categories sourced in India. We don’t talk about ‘Make in India’ for India, but ‘Make in India’ for IKEA worldwide.”
A senior official from the Department of Industry Policy and Promotion (DIPP) said: “IKEA by inking a deal with SMEs will be manufacturing products not only for its outlets in other countries but will also create products especially for its Indian outlets, through the Make in India initiatives for manufacturing.”
IKEA, which enjoys the benefit of being one of the first companies in India to be allowed to bring in 100% foreign direct investment in single brand retail business, has been sourcing from India for the last 27 years for its stores around the world. At present, IKEA Group sources about 315 million euros of products in India.
IKEA is also said to have Indianised products, which would on consumer response then be exported to other global stores under specific categories.
“IKEA’s products are produced in several countries. The sourcing that we have today in India and the planned doubling of sourcing will be for global IKEA, of course including our Indian future stores. This gives the current and future suppliers in India a much bigger market to aspire for. Apart from our core range, we also work with social entrepreneurs in UP, Rajasthan and Karnataka, producing limited collections for IKEA,” Sanan added.
IKEA plans to open its first store in Telangana, with an investment of around Rs. 500-600 crore.
“We have been working with several SMEs in India and they have grown with us over the years. We would want to work with more SMEs that can align with our values,” Sanan said.

The government is set to use the services of over 250,000 banking correspondents of public sector banks to spread the message of the ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign, kickstarted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the hinterland.
The banking correspondents, who are currently engaged in opening zero-balance accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) scheme, would also be asked to participate in the Swachh Bharat campaign.
The issue was also taken up  last week when PSB chiefs met finance minister Arun Jaitley.
“Swachh Bharat is one of the most important (schemes) and banks, which have a presence in the remotest areas, would play a crucial role in spreading the message. Banking correspondents are in the best position to do a direct marketing exercise of the same as they are meeting people every day to expand the PMJDY,” a chairman of a bank who was present in the meeting but did not want to be identified told HT.
The government banks, with mammoth branch network, may also be asked to adopt villages in order to improve the level of sanitation there by providing toilets and drinking water facilities, sources said.
Several celebrities including film personalities have already endorsed this campaign and are actively promoting it.

New Delhi, November 27:  
As Opposition members raised concerns over the continuation of MGNREGA under the Narendra Modi government, Union Minister for Rural Development Birender Singh assured the Rajya Sabha that the rural job guarantee scheme will not be diluted. He said the “demand driven” scheme will continue as a flagship programme of the new government, too.
Replying to a calling attention motion initiated by CPI leader D Raja, Singh said the criticism that MGNREGA is hampering agricultural activities is emanating from “big landlords.” The Centre has no intention to downsize the scheme, he added.
Earlier, Raja accused the Centre of trying to limit the scheme to just 2,500 blocks from the present 6,500 blocks across the country. Singh assured the House that the scheme will remain operational in all the 6,500 blocks and not restricted to 2,500. He also said the wage-material ratio will remain at 60:40. Singh said 18 States have asked the Centre to converge existing schemes with MGNREGA.

Geneva, November 27:  
The World Trade Organization adopted the first worldwide trade reform in its history on Thursday, after years of stalemate, months of deadlock and a final day’s delay following an eleventh-hour objection.
The agreement means the WTO will introduce new standards for Customs checks and border procedures. Proponents say that will streamline the flow of trade around the world, adding as much as $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the world economy.
“It’s all agreed,” a WTO official said outside the closed-door WTO meeting in Geneva, after trade diplomats applauded the end of their 19-year wait for a deal.

Britannia bites digital pie to push cookieBritannia bites digital pie to push cookie
Mahesh Kulkarni | Bengaluru Nov 28, 2014 12:48 AM IST
After colas and burgers, biscuits are the latest in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) category to consider a test launch on e-commerce platforms, ahead of their entry into physical stores.
Britannia Industries, the bakery and dairy major, has tied up with e-tailer Amazon India for a pilot launch of Good Day Chunkies, a new chocolate chip cookie, for 15 days. The offer is currently on and closes on December 5, after which the product goes to offline (normal retail) stores.
Britannia is the first biscuit company in the country to leverage e-commerce for brand promotions, ahead of competitors such as Parle Products and Mondelez.
Speaking to Business Standard, the company’s marketing director, Ali Harris Shere, said: “Digital is emerging as a big platform and we want to be the first one to explore it, rather than being a follower.”
This launch comes on the heels of another one, Nutrichoice Heavens, also a super-premium offering, earlier this month by the company. The current product is Britannia’s third cookie launch in three months. In September, the company had marked its entry into the mass cookie space with Tiger Butter Krunch.
Shere said Amazon had positioned the new product in its gourmet and speciality foods store. “They have also displayed it on the landing page of their website,” he said, pointing to the mileage the product would derive from this. He declined to indicate how much the company had garnered in sales since launch of the exclusive offer.
It is this mileage and buzz that is prompting marketers to consider e-commerce for an exclusive test launch. This September, beverage maker Coca-Cola had a limited period offer on Amazon for Coke Zero, its low-calorie drink, before its retail launch in the country. The exclusive offer was billed as a success, with sales crossing 100,000 cans in 13 days. American retailer Burger King was the next to go down this road, giving consumers the option to pre-order its ‘Whopper Burger’ before its Delhi and Mumbai store launches this month. The tie-up was with eBay. Such was the success that the opening weekend between November 22 and 23 in Mumbai, for instance, saw a crowd of over 10,000 people queuing from 9 am onwards for a bite of the burger, persons in the know said.
Arvind Singhal, chairman, Technopak, says: “Online as a medium works well for those products where there is a high level of involvement and interest, like mobile phones or books. When it comes to staples, the involvement of consumers is not too high. What we are seeing now in terms of exclusive deals in colas, burgers or biscuits are largely marketing initiatives, which helps in creating the necessary buzz around the brand.”

RIL partner Hardy Oil reviews D3 gas block operationsRIL partner Hardy Oil reviews D3 gas block operations
BS Reporter | Mumbai Nov 28, 2014 12:47 AM IST
Hardy Oil, a partner of Reliance Industries (RIL) in the D3 block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin, said on Thursday that it would review its investment in India in the light of unattractive pricing and uncertainty surrounding long-term price outlook for natural gas sales.
In a statement on its half-yearly results, Hardy Oil said the joint venture (JV) partners might have to relinquish portion of the block owing to Indian defence ministry's new policy on access restriction. It said India's Defence Research and Development Organisation has classified one-third of the D3 block as 'impact zone' and has imposed certain access restrictions to that area.
Hardy has a 10 per cent stake in the block; RIL has 60 per cent, while BP holds 30 per cent. Reliance is the operator of the block.
"The new GoI (Government of India) pricing policy implies a significantly lower price than the previously-notified Rangarajan Committee formula. There remains some uncertainty surrounding a pricing premium for deep-water discoveries and the development of our D3 discoveries is dependent on the future long-term price outlook for gas sales. The JV is currently reviewing the appropriate way forward, taking into account policies recently announced by the Indian government and the overall prospectivity of the block," said Ian MacKenzie, chief executive officer, Hardy.
Situated in the KG basin on the east coast, the D3 exploration licence encompasses an area of 3,288 km, in water depths of 400 metres to 2,200 metres, and is located approximately 45 km offshore.
It said four gas discoveries have been made via the Dhirubhai 39, 41, 44 and 52 (KGV-D3-A1, B1, R1 and W1) exploration wells. The joint venture has acquired 3,250 km of 3D seismic data over the block.

Environment regulator to be set up without penal powersEnvironment regulator to be set up without penal powers
Somesh Jha | New Delhi Nov 28, 2014 12:48 AM IST
The Union government has finally agreed to set up an environment regulator that will have powers to appraise industrial projects. But it will not have powers to penalise violators of green laws.
This development follows inter-ministerial and inter-state consultations over the months after a Supreme Court order to set up an autonomous body for appraising projects and authorising the body to penalise offenders.
"The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had inter-ministerial consultations and consultations with states for setting up of a regulator/authority under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986," said Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar in a written reply in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
THE MANDATES OF THE NEW REGULATOR
The regulator will have powers to appraise industrial projects for environment clearance  
It would oversee the process of accreditation of environment impact assessment (EIA)
It would ensure enforcment of the conditions stated in the environment clearances
The announcement is in contrast to the recommendations of the high-level committee constituted by the Union environment ministry under former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramanian to review environment laws
The committee had suggested an independent National Environment Management Authority and State Environment Management Authority to take the powers of the existing pollution control boards
Javadekar added the regulator would oversee the process of accreditation of environment impact assessment (EIA) consultants, improve the quality of EIA reports and appraisal, appraise projects for environment clearance, enforce conditions of project proponents seeking green nod and implementing the National Forest Policy (NFP).
However, Javadekar was silent on the proposed authority's penal powers. At present, only courts have the authority to impose penalty on the basis of complaints filed by authorised officers, a winding process that has hardly ever led to action. Handing over powers to officers of the government instead of the courts would require an amendment to the law.
It was not also clear whether the role of the state pollution control board (SPCB) and various regional offices of the ministry would be subsumed in the environment regulator or whether these would become an arm of the body. At the moment, the state pollution control boards and the regional offices of the ministry, which are severely short-staffed, oversee compliance. Javadekar's reply in the Lok Sabha said the regulator would be "enforcing the conditions stated in the environment clearances."
The announcement from Javadekar also stood in contrast to the recommendations of the high-level committee constituted by the Union environment ministry under former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramanian to review environment laws.
It had suggested a new law under which an independent National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and State Environment Management Authority (SEMA) at the Centre and state level would take the powers of the existing pollution control boards. Though the panel, too, had recommended that power should lie with the government to overrule the regulator.
Experts said without the power to prosecute offenders, the regulator will have no significance. "This will be a toothless body. Although this regulator may grant approvals it will fall short of taking authoritative action," said Ritwick Dutta, an environment lawyer.
Dutta said setting up a regulator could be done through a separate law. "Because that would mean that the EIA notification goes. The Centre can still do that by passing a new Act or new notifications under the Environment Protection Act not necessarily through Parliamentary legislation. However, to ensure that the body has the power to prosecute, it has to take the Parliament route," said Dutta.
Preparing an EIA report is a mandatory exercise to be conducted by highly polluting industries to examine the possible environmental impact of a project. The report also categorically states mitigation measures. For this, most industry players hire accredited consultants to prepare the report and this becomes a basis of the environmental clearance. At present, the Centre has formed expert appraisal committees (EACs) for various categories of projects to appraise environment clearance and stipulate conditions on project proponents while granting a green nod.
The Supreme Court had, on January 6, directed the government to appoint a national regulator under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court had suggested an independent body be set up for appraising projects, enforcing environmental clearance conditions and imposing penalties.
However, in April, the Union environment ministry had conveyed to the apex court that the regulator to be set up under the EPA could not be authorised to impose penalties without further legislation.
The Union Cabinet had formed an inter-ministerial panel in September to look into the feasibility of setting up a national green regulator based on the Supreme Court order. The members of the panel were Javadekar, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar and Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal. The four-member panel will suggest the structure of the regulator and look into other measures. The idea of setting up an autonomous body for appraising projects was mooted by the United Progressive Alliance government in 2010.
The apex court ordered setting up such a body in a case related to stage-I forest clearance for the project of Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Ltd on July 6, 2011.

Arun Jaitleys budget short Rs 20k cr  for no fault of hisDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Finance minister Arun Jaitley’s budget is short Rs 20,000 crore, and he has his predecessor to thank for this.
Each year, on April 30, banks remit the tax deducted at source by them for the previous fiscal to the finance ministry. The government shows the sum in its accounts for the current fiscal. For instance, the sum paid to the government on April 30, 2014, will form a part of receipts for the year 2014-15.
But as receipts fell short for the year 2013-14, making it difficult to keep the estimates close to budget projections, finance ministry officials asked the banks to book the sum a month ahead, that is, on March 31, 2014.
“In effect the finance ministry earned the TDS from the banks twice over in 2013-14. The first was in the ordinary course on April 30, 2013, and then again in March, 2014,” says former secretary, economic affairs, R Gopalan. Gopalan retired in 2012.
The exercise was done in the vote-on-accounts that the incoming NDA government tabled in Parliament in June this year. The calculations were kept intact in the subsequent full Budget that Jaitley tabled in July too. The finance ministry team that executed the manoeuvre has been largely replaced.
The change was made possible since the Centre still uses cash instead of accrual accounting. But the jugglery has created a headache for the current team, as they have to dig deeper to find money to replace this gap.

Vodafone tax verdict: Much revenue forgone if attorney-general advice takenVodafone tax verdict: Much revenue forgone if attorney-general advice taken
Vrishti Beniwal | New Delhi Nov 28, 2014 12:48 AM IST
The government might take a hit of at least Rs 10,000 crore if it decides to accept the Bombay High Court's verdict in the transfer pricing dispute with Vodafone and give the same treatment to similar cases.
On Wednesday, Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi asked the income tax (I-T) department to desist from an appeal against the ruling and the finance ministry is likely to accept the advice. The same approach is likely to be taken in the case of Shell and others facing similar demands.
The tax department had made an addition of Rs 17,920 crore and Rs 4,831 crore to the taxable income of Shell and Vodafone, respectively. At a tax rate of 30 per cent, this could have given revenue of about Rs 7,000 crore for the two financial years for which showcause notices were served.
Another Rs 2,100 crore could come from five Essar group companies and Rs 300 crore from HSBC Securities & Capital Markets, as an addition of Rs 7,000 crore and Rs 935 crore to their income, respectively, had the tax department's orders to treat infusion of share capital as taxable income was sustained. Several other companies face similar demands.
In 2012-13 alone, 27 cases of undervaluation of share sale by Indian companies to their associated enterprises were detected and subjected to transfer pricing adjustments. In the previous years, too, the department had made such additions to the income of Indian arms of multinational companies. According to experts, the tax demand in most of these cases would not be more than Rs 100 crore in a particular year but the total revenue forgone could be substantial as demands are for multiple years.
"It (tax forgone by the government by not appealing) could be pretty huge," said Vijay Iyer, partner, EY.
The government, however, doesn't feel the pressure of refunding any amount, since most of the companies moved court after the issue of showcause notice or draft assessment order. Only after the final order is passed is the assessee required to pay the tax in 30 days. Last month, the Bombay HC had struck down the tax department's demand on Shell India, about a month after it decided in favour of Vodafone in a similar case involving transfer of shares between associated companies. It said cross-border share transactions couldn't lead to income. The government contention was that the companies had undervalued shares and got deemed capital gains.
"I have asked the department to accept the judgment," Rohatgi had said.
It was learnt that tax department officials wanted to file an appeal to get clarity on the issue at an all-India level and avoid future questions from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
On January 27, Vodafone moved the Bombay HC challenging the I-T order and contended its transaction on transfer of shares was not taxable under Indian law. The HC verdict had said there was no taxable income on the share premium received on issue of shares.

IT firms engage with staff to get innovative...Cognizant
(“A lot of cool stuff is…)
BENGALURU: Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka's initiative to engage with over 160,000 employees and shortlist 10 ideas through a crowdsourcing exercise, murmuration, is just the sort of thing that experts say helps technology companies not only source the next big idea from within the organisation idea but also boost the morale of employees.
The new CEO's objective was twofold, said a senior executive of Bengaluru-based Infosys, India's second largest software exporter. "First, to boost employees' morale by reaching out and engaging with them, and the second, to get feedback from people who work with our customers and implement what they think the company should be doing," said the executive, who did not wish to be identified.
Sikka first connected with over 160,000 engineers on July 15, asking them to share with him the key areas of innovation that they believed the clients were focusing on. From the initial 2,700 ideas by employees, the company came up with a longlist of about 70 solutions, before finally narrowing down to 10 such ideas which it believed could be backed. A few can be used to develop IP (internet protocol) or offer a new service, said the executive cited earlier, without disclosing details.
From Nasdaq-listed Cognizant, which claims to be the early mover in getting its employees to suggest the next big idea, to Noidabased HCL Technologies , which launched a similar exercise four years ago, technology companies are reaping benefits of engaging with employees in this manner.
"We have a well-defined structure and have already brought 15 such products to the market," Gordon Coburn, president, Cognizant told ET in an interview last month. Cloud360, a Cognizant BusinessCloud, which provides a single pane of glass to analyse cloud applications is one such product offering which came from the internal search process for innovative ideas .
"We have been ahead of the curve as we ask employees to come up with ideas...solutions which are product-related nonlinear ideas. They come to us, we give seed funding to develop just the way a venture capitalist will work," said Coburn, whose firm has close to 200,000 employees.
At HCL, two young executives came up with MAD JAM (Make a Difference Jamboree) initiative five years ago, under which the company backs some of the product-led ideas which can be used for its customers. "A lot of cool stuff is going through this internal process," said Krishnan Chatterjee, head of strategic marketing at HCL Technologies.
Employees say such initiatives help them gain recognition. "I've arrived," said a software engineer at Infosys' electronic city campus. "How else can I show my contribution to my company which has so many people and offices?" Although the engineer's idea was not shortlisted this time, he is hoping to do better next year.
In 2011-12, HCL awarded My-Cloud solution as the winner of its annual "American Idol Hunt", as Chatterjee calls it. MyCloud, which helps in cloud management, is now used by over 120 customers, making it HCL's "most successful employee-led proposition".
"So it cannot be any crackpot idea. You have to have done it for any one client before submitting it," said Chatterjee. The company has gone a step further by considering participation in this exercise at the yearly appraisal. "It makes a staffer at a large organisation feel important," said Dave Gardner, founder of Gardner &Associates Consulting.

Petrol and diesel prices may fall as crude slumps to 4-year lowPetrol and diesel prices may fall after crude hits low

Petrol and diesel are likely to turn cheaper in India as global oil prices slumped to four-year lows of around $70 a barrel on Thursday after OPEC — a  group of major oil supplying countries — decided against cutting back production.

India imports nearly two-thirds of its crude oil requirement. The sharp fall in global crude prices will cut companies’ import bills,  enabling them to reduce retail prices of petrol and diesel.
Domestic oil industry sources said petrol prices could fall below Rs. 60 a litre in the coming weeks, if the slide in global crude prices continues to follow the current pattern.
Lower fuel costs will aid the government’s efforts to keep inflation low and stable.
India’s retail inflation fell to a three-year low of 5.52% in October while the wholesale inflation rate plunged to a five-year low of 1.77%, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.
Lower inflation, in turn, could prompt the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates and nudge banks to lower home loan EMIs.
“If the slide in oil prices continues, we can expect petrol prices to drop below Rs. 60 a litre from around Rs. 65 presently (in Delhi),” said the chairman of a leading oil company seeking anonymity.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel of 12 oil producing nations that controls 40% of the world’s oil output, in a five-hour meeting in Vienna decided not to reduce production, despite a 30% fall in oil prices since June.
Since August, petrol has turned cheaper by Rs. 9.36 a litre in six price cuts, while diesel prices have been cut by Rs. 5.62 a litre since October.
Petrol now cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 71.91 in Mumbai. Diesel, India’s most consumed fuel, costs Rs. 53.35 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 61.04 in Mumbai. Prices vary between states due to local levies.
Softer crude prices will also bolster the government’s plans to tame inflation and curtail fuel subsidies. A lower subsidy bill will help contain fiscal deficit — a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Being the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, India imports around 190 million tonnes of crude oil a year at $145 billion, or more than a third of its total import bill. With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore.

DDA goes for image makeover with luxury houses in west DelhiDDA goes for image makeover with luxury houses in west Delhi

Known for its utilitarian and shabby flats, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is all set to give top private builders of Delhi-NCR a run for their money.
The DDA is going to build its first luxury housing project in the Capital that promises all high-end amenities that one sees in housing complexes of reputed private builders. While offering top-notch facilities, DDA promises to keep the price affordable for the middle-class buyers. The project, to be completed in about two years, will have only two-bedroom flats priced at approximately Rs. 60 lakh — almost half of the market price.
The project will come up in Pocket E of Lok Nayak Puram, an urban extension of west Delhi near Paschim Vihar. The multi-storied residential complex will have 820 high-end flats, each having a carpet area of 700 square feet.
For the first time, a DDA housing project will boast of a clubhouse, spa, tennis court, swimming pool, amphitheatre, gymnasium and shopping centres. Round the clock security and CCTV camera surveillance are other high points.
Starting from the 1960s, the land development agency has built nearly 3.5 lakh residential units constructed on a ‘no profit no loss’ basis. With social housing on its mind, DDA has always provided only basic amenities at its flat with not too expensive fixtures so that pricing could be kept affordable.
At the Lok Nayak Puram project, DDA will deviate from the pattern for the first time.
“We found out that the difference in cost after providing better facilities was in tune of only four per cent and if merely with that increase in cost we can make available high-end infrastructure, there is no harm in it,” said DDA vice-chairman Balvinder Kumar.
“People can easily pay this difference if they want better services,” he said.
Kumar said that while venturing into luxury apartments, DDA’s work on making affordable housing would continue simultaneously. “Even in one-room flats, we will introduce high-end infrastructure,” he said.
He said the DDA was keen to change its image of providing shabby flats and after Lok Nayak Puram, similar projects in other locations would be taken up.

Nursery admissions: HC to give verdict todayNursery relief at last, HC gives schools more say

Holding out hope that nursery admissions this time round won’t be the mess they were last year, the Delhi high court on Friday empowered private unaided schools in the Capital to fix their own criteria, quashing last year’s government-mandated points-based system.
The court also restored the 20% management quota followed by schools before it was scrapped last year. With admission season just around the corner, the verdict effectively gives private schools “maximum autonomy in day-to-day administration, including right to admit students”.
The Delhi government plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, leading to apprehension of protracted litigation and, thereby, of a repeat of last year’s chaos.
In 2013, schools had reluctantly followed lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung’s points-based system that earmarked a massive 70 points for neighbourhood, 20 for siblings and 5 for alumni while doing away with the management quota. Five points for inter-state transfer cases was later scrapped by the government after parents went to court against it.
Various schools and parents had challenged the L-G’s guidelines in court, triggering a messy fight with more than 15 petitions filed. The admission season, which starts in January and concludes by March 31, had dragged on till May-end and the academic year had started from July instead of April. The L-G had defended his decision then, calling it an effort to end “commercialisation of education”.
However, the high court on Friday said Jung’s actions were “neither procedurally proper nor rational”. In his verdict, Justice Manmohan pointed out that the government did not submit any document or material to show schools were indulging in any malpractice.
The court also said that by awarding 70 out of 95 points for neighbourhood, the L-G’s guidelines had placed “undue emphasis on location of residence of a child over which she/he has no control”.
“This court is unable to appreciate that a student’s educational fate can be relegated to his position on a map,” the judgment read.
It added that by awarding five points for siblings studying in the same school, the guidelines placed an only child at a disadvantage.
The court said that the power to choose a school has to rest primarily with the parents and not the administration, and opined that “by increasing parental choice and granting schools the autonomy to admit students, the accountability of private schools can be ensured”.
For now, private schools can go back to the ‘flexible’ pre-2013 system of admission. This means they can fix their own criteria and the quantum of points to go with them. A school can choose to retain or omit the neighbourhood criteria, for instance.
Watch: Delhi schools will decide on nursery admission guidelines: HC verdict

Bank Nifty at record high levels on rate cut hopesPSU banks take Bank Nifty to record high on rate cut hopes

(India’s 10-year yield…)
MUMBAI: The Bank Nifty has hit a fresh record high in early trade led by PSU banks on optimism of sooner than expected interest rate cut announcement by the Reserve Bank of India.

India's 10-year yield hit 8.11 per cent, lowest since 01 August, 2013, on hopes of rate cut as crude oil prices are expected to remain low in the near future.
India will be benefiting from lower crude oil prices as it lowers import bill and also helps in bringing inflation lower.
The October CPI inflation came in at 5.52 per cent vs 6.46 per cent and the WPI inflation eased to 1.77 per cent vs 2.38 per cent in September.
There are reports that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is expected to meet RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan to push for interest rate cut at the earliest.

BJP in war of words with AMU over Raja Mahendra Pratap s birth anniversary celebrationsNov 28, 2014 at  11:29am IST
Don't play politics at an educational institution, AMU VC to Centre against BJP's proposed event

Aligarh: A fresh controversy is brewing in the Aligarh Muslim University where the varsity authorities and Bharatiya Janata Party have got into a war of words over a piece of land.
BJP has asked the university to celebrate the birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap, a freedom fighter, who according to them had donated land to AMU. A meeting between the MU Vice Chancellor Zameeruddin Shah and the leaders of BJP and student wing ABVP took place on Thursday in this concern.
The AMU has rejected the claims made by BJP and has approached the Union HRD Ministry to prevent politics from trickling into the matter. "From last several days, BJP elements are threatening that they will celebrate Raja Ji's birthday at AMU gate that has potential to create communal tension in the university and I don't want student to suffer. The said land was on land deed and it was not gifted, but we recognized Raja Ji's contributions. I have written to HRD Minister on this issue. We don't want tension; maintaining law and order is my priority," the VC said.
#aligarh muslim university #amu #vc #bjp
"We do not have any records of the king donating land to the university. He gave some land to a school which after the Supreme Court verdict came down to us," added AMU professor Mohammad Abrar.
Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani, however, said that she was yet to receive a letter from the varsity. "As of last night I have not received any such letter," she said.
Meanwhile, the BJP is not in a mood to accept AMU's stand. It is adamant on celebrating the Raja Mahendra Pratap's birth anniversary in the university campus. "If the VC celebrates the anniversary of the king, we welcome it. Otherwise, our party will celebrate the anniversary inside the AMU campus. AMU must celebrate anniversary of the person who donate it land," BJP leader Satish Gautam said.

MCOCA invoked against Ravi Pujari gang members for plot to attack Mahesh BhattNov 28, 2014 at 09:23am IST
MCOCA invoked against Ravi Pujari gang members for plot to attack Mahesh Bhatt

Mumbai: Mumbai Police on Thursday invoked stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against 11 alleged members of fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari, who were held in connection with a plot to attack veteran film producer-brothers Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt.
The eleven accused are among the 14 Pujari gangmen, who were held between November 15 and 21. Following the arrest of the Pujari gang members, city police recently claimed to have thwarted a plot to kill the Bhatt brothers and cracked the case of firing in the air outside the residence of Karim Morani, producer of blockbuster movie 'Chennai Express'.
"The ten of the eleven accused, who have been charged with the stringent provisions of the law, were today produced before the special MCOCA court which extended their police custody till December 6," said Deputy Police Commissioner Dhananjay Kulkarni. They were produced before the special court as their police custody ended on Thursday.
Pujari wanted to trigger a fear in the Bollywood industry so that he could extort money from the celebrities without much effort, police said.
#mumbai police #maharashtra control of organised crime act #mcoca #ravi pujari
The eleven accused now facing the MCOCA charge are Mohammed Anees Merchant, Ishrat Shaikh, Mohammed Hakikulla Khan, Azim Khan, Ashfaq Abdul Rashid, Asif Sattar Khan, Shahatwal Shaik, Feroz Sayyed, Shabbir Shaikh, Rahim Khan and Ravi Singh. Accused Ravi Singh could not be produced before the special court as he is presently in judicial custody.
The other three accused - Sufiyan SK, Faise SK and Armaan Siddique - are behind bars in connection with Morani firing case reported in the city on August 23. Mumbai Police had on November 15 laid trap outside the Bhatt's office in suburban Khar following information that a group of men would gather there with firearms.
Spotting seven men with suspicious behaviour, police nabbed them with firearms. They were later identified as Ishrat Shaikh, Mohammed Hakikulla Khan, Azim Khan, Ashfaq Abdul Rashid, Asif Sattar Khan, Shahatwal Shaik and Feroz Sayyed, police said.
The interrogation revealed that they gathered to bump off Mahesh Bhatt, his brother Mukesh or son Rahul at the instructions of Pujari, police said. Pujari wanted to trigger a fear in the Bollywood industry so that he could extort money from the celebrities without much effort, police said.
Further questioning of the seven accused threw up the names of six of their associates, who were subsequently arrested in the next two days of operation. The six were identified as Mohammed Anees Merchant, Shabbir Shaikh, Rahim Khan, Sufiyan SK, Faise SK and Armaan Siddique, police said. Last accused Ravi Singh was held on November 21, police said.
According to police, the MCOCA can be applied, if at least two members of the organised crime gang have at least two charge sheets registered against them. In Bhatt's case, wanted accused Ravi Pujari and arrested accused Mohammed Anees Merchant already have two charge sheets against them.

Hits and misses: Modi government s report card on completing 6 months at the Centre22
0
New Delhi: In its six months in power, the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre has taken a series of administrative measures including opening up Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Railways, deregulating fuel and announcing mega missions like 'Make in India'. But perhaps the most talked about achievement is on the foreign policy front.
Reviewing his term so far, his ministers claimed that they been successful in clearing the past logjams. "In power sector, several reforms have been carried out. The coal sector too is all set to see an increase in activity," Power Minister Piyush Goyal said.
Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, too, said that his ministry has worked its best to remove complacency. "In my ministry, which was known as the road block ministry, we have done away with all the road blocks," he said.
Reviewing his term so far, his ministers claimed that they have done their best to clear the past logjams.
#narendra modi #tracking the modi government #bjp #nda
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Cabinet colleagues listed out achievements of the past 6 months, the opposition expectedly said that the government is all talk and no action.
"We have given the government time but they have done completed any of the poll promises that they made," Congess MP Rajeev Shukla said.
Leaders also criticised Modi for back to back trips abroad. "PM has broken all records of foreign visits. On the ground, nothing has happened," Samajwadi Party's National General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav said.
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Majeed Memon also said that the PM has been more outside India than in India.
However, Modi's Cabinet colleagues defended the series of high profile visits to Japan, Australia and the United States saying that this is not a simple achievement.
"This is not a simple achievement. Dealing with a hegemonistic nation like US or counties like Pakistan which create nuisance is a big task. Even President Barack Obama greets the PM in Gujarati," Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.
Former ally in Maharastra, the Shiv Sena may have hit out against the PM in the state but took a more measured stance in Delhi. "We have a stable government and a PM who takes decisions on his own and implement them on his own," Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.
While the PM's style of centralizing power has come in for both praise and criticism, investors and citizens believe the "Modi sarkar" is on the right path
"Challenge is to unveil economic architecture and restructure the government," Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar opined.
Though it is yet to early to determine how his tenure at the Centre will pan out to be, it is to be seen if Prime Minister Modi is able to steer the government in his unique style for the entire term.

Modi  Sharif bonhomie gives fresh boost to SAARCModi, Sharif bonhomie gives fresh boost to SAARC
By Anil Giri | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Thu 27 Nov, 2014

Kathmandu, Nov 27 (IANS) In a final ice-breaking moment that gave a huge boost to Saarc and floundering regional cooperation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shook hands with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, laughed and even patted him on the arm at the closing ceremony of the bloc's 18th summit here Thursday, to resounding applause from a relieved audience comprising leaders, diplomats and officials from the eight South Asian countries.
In a photo-op that appeared to belie the recent animosity between the two neighbours, Modi and Sharif kept their handshake for several seconds and chatted, smiling all the while, as Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, the host of the summit, looked on happily.
Modi and Sharif had shaken hands and interacted briefly during the retreat at Dhulikhel outside Kathmandu earlier in the day.
The two had otherwise studiously ignored each other during the summit Wednesday, the sixth anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that India has blamed on Pakistani elements.
"India is for peaceful and cooperative relations with Pakistan. If this shake hand leads to that we will welcome it. However, emphasis is on meaningful dialogue," external affairs ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said later to reporters.
To a question, he said he was unaware of what Modi and Sharif spoke about during the Dhulikhel retreat as "there was no one else. Nobody else knows what they talked of. They spoke of Saarc matters, but what specifically they discussed, no one is privy".
During the concluding ceremony, as soon as Koirala declared the session closed, Modi turned to the immediate neighbour to his right, Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, and shook hands and chatted.
He then shook hands with Maldives President Abdulla Yameen, and with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and was joined by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Sharif was away from the group, talking to a Nepali minister, while Koirala was looking awkwardly on, standing in the midst of the two rival prime ministers.
Just when the question was on everyone's mind - will they, won't they - Modi finished chatting with his group of Saarc leaders, turned around and spoke to the Nepali prime minister, and stepped ahead to shake hands with Sharif.
Modi and Sharif smiled warmly at each other, and kept their hands clasped all the while as they chatted like old friends.
As the audience erupted into loud applause, Modi cracked what appeared like a joke, laughed and slapped Sharif gently on his arm - as the two kept their handshake on.
Both the leaders then turned towards the audience, comprising diplomats and senior officials of all the eight countries, as they continued to shake hands.
A relieved Koirala, who is credited with mediating between them, looked smilingly on.
The Himalayan Times was prompt in putting up the news on its website.
Titled "Smiling Modi, Sharif shake hands at Summit closure", it wrote: "At the closing ceremony of the 18th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif shook hands with smiling faces."
"The heads of governments of two historic rivals posed for photographs during the handshake for nearly a minute. The duo were seen talking to each other," it said.
Earlier in the day, away from the glare of cameras, Modi and Sharif held informal talks at the Dhulikhel retreat, those present said.
The effect of the informal talks was immediately reflected in the proposed agreements.
The heads of state and government agreed to sign the Saarc Framework Agreement on Energy Cooperation on electricity trade, and decided to sign two other pacts -- motor vehicle and railway agreements -- within three months, a big face-saver for Summit host Nepal in particular and the region as a whole.
Dinesh Bhattarai, foreign relations advisor to Koriala, who was present in the retreat, confirmed to IANS that both the leaders held informal talks after meeting each other along with other heads of state and government.
Prime Minster Koirala pushed the two leaders to sit for talks, at least informally now, and break the logjam in the bilateral relations as other Saarc countries feel that the India-Pakistan dispute was impeding progress on greater South Asian cooperation and understanding.
During his talks with Modi, Koirala asked the Indian prime minister to reach out to Pakistan, given the former's stature as Saarc leader, and its size, population and economy.
"While watching the Himalayas and taking herbal and organic food, Modi and Sharif were seen more open and close," a diplomat said.
"The focus was on how to carry on the Saarc process and how to strengthening the bilateral ties."
The Saarc leaders, including Modi, Sharif and Koriala, cracked jokes, planted trees and shared their personal matters with each other.
After the retreat, the leaders agreed to sign the Saarc Framework Agreement on Energy Cooperation which was announced in the Kathmandu Declaration in the evening.
Because of the deadlock between India and Pakistan, the three proposed agreements related to motor vehicle, railway and energy, all pushed by New Delhi, were uncertain until Thursday.
After the retreat and unofficial talks among the leaders, the Saarc leaders agreed to sign the energy deal and agreed to complete the other two agreements within three months, Bhattarai said.
The 33 food items served to the leaders were totally vegetarian, perhaps in deference to the diet preferences of the Indian prime minister who is a strict vegetarian. Gujarati basundi with jalebi was served to Modi as dessert.

Brent near 4 year low after OPEC decides against output cut

(Brent crude had fallen 13…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude held above $72 a barrel on Friday after hitting a new four year low earlier in the day after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for output reductions, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 38 cents at $72.20 a barrel at 0806 GMT, after plummeting $5.17 to close at $72.58 on Thursday. It earlier fell $1.46 in trading on Friday to touch $71.12, its weakest since July 2010.
Brent is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, of Thursday's fall.
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.79 from Wednesday's closing to $68.90 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75. US markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

'Nifty to hit 8750 soon; advise 60% exposure in cyclicals'
“If a rate cut is not announced on December 2nd, then the market could see a mild negative reaction,” Vibhav Kapoor of IL&FS said.
Post your opinion here
 
Indian equities have been in the grip of Bulls ever since the new reform-led government took charge in May this year. This grip got tighter, adding more strength to the market and fueling optimism among investors backed by government’s initial steps to turnaround the Indian economy. And now, steep fall in global crude oil prices is cherry on the cake for Indian equities, whose stellar Bull Run continues.  
Equity benchmarks started of December series on a strong note with the Sensex and Nifty hitting an all-time high. Vibhav Kapoor of IL&FS is bullish on the Indian market and sees the Nifty rising to 8,750 this month. In an interview to CNBC-TV18 he said that medium term base for the Nifty has moved up to 8,000 levels.
Sharing views on the much-waited December 2 monetary policy, he said that the current trend of falling crude oil price open up possibility of an earlier than anticipated rate cut. He is hoping RBI governor Rajan to slash rates in the upcoming policy. “If rate cut is not announced on December 2nd, then the market could see a mild negative reaction,” he added.
On specific sectors, structural issues on public sector lenders with respect to asset quality still remain. But private sector banks remain a ‘buy & hold’ case over the 12-24 month time frame. Those investors looking to bet on this theme can allocate almost 25 percent of their equity portfolio towards banks or NBFCs.
While others can allocate 60 percent of their portfolio exposure skewed towards cyclicals and 30 percent in quality IT & FMCG stocks, he said.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Vibhav Kapoor’s interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: We have seen huge opening to the market today. What is the sense you are getting about how the year end will shape up. Do you see a fresh leg of this rally purely because of how crude has shaped up?
A: I think that is definitely a big positive. It also means that not only today oil prices have fallen but I think they are going to stay pretty low and the downtrend is going to continue for quite some time to come and that is a big positive for an economy like India. This is definitely going to give some new fillip to the market which we can see today.
Also, this probably opens up little chance of a rate cut sooner than we had been talking about earlier because the RBI should now be looking at the fact that inflation is not going to go up so quickly at least the oil related inflation and the secondary benefits that it will have and that could lead to rate cut sooner than what the market had been expecting and that would be a big positive.
Latha: What is your own expectation from the policy on December 2nd and how is the market poised, will a lack of a rate cut be seen as a negative because it perhaps just postpones it by one more policy?
A: To be honest, previously we had not been expecting before April. My view was that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would like to see the Budget; it would like to see how inflation is behaving for the next two to three months and then take a call in the April policy. However, with this development happening overnight as I said rate cut could come earlier and there are at least some chances now that you could see a rate cut on the December 2nd.
If the rate cut doesn’t happen I don’t think it is going to be a big negative. Probably you might see a very mild reaction in the market but the hope is always now going to be there that you are going to have a series of rate cut sooner than we had expected earlier. So, I don’t think it is going to cause panic in the market.
Sonia: We are expecting a big boost in the macros both in the form of inflation and the lower import bill. How much do you think the range of this market will now move higher to factor in the positive macro trends?
A: In the immediate term say for December we would be looking at a possibility of something like 8750 on the upper side and then one would have to look at how things develop later on as the Budget approaches. One of the bigger advantages which today the market has is not only the Indian situation which is benefitting from this but the fact that the global markets are conducive for equity.

Mkt to perfom well in December series: Anand Tandon08:00 am
Market expert Anand Tandon expects Indian equities to perform well in December.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18 he said, given that there is positive trigger in the form of steep fall in global crude prices, the market will do well in the December series. However, the issue of divestment of public sector units continues to remain an overhang on the market, he added.
The Nifty ended November series derivative contracts a tad below the 8500-mark

How single people can save on food expenses2
Andrea Woroch, a savings expert with a site at andreaworoch.com , suggests splitting a warehouse club membership with a friend or family member. "There are certain items that you can save money on and make it convenient to stock up on so you don't have to regularly replace them, like batteries, toilet paper and toiletries," she said.
The warning is to avoid buying too much perishable food in bulk that will just be thrown away, which greatly increases the unit cost of the food you actually ate.
"As a single person, you may have more social commitments throughout the week or be willing to make last-minute plans to meet a friend for dinner," Woroch said. "If you plan a week of meals and buy perishable items ahead, you may wind up wasting expired food."
The freezer is your friend. For some perishables, you can divide and conquer. For example, $3 per pound is a fine price on ground beef, but you won't often find it in 1-pound packages. Go ahead and buy the 5-pound pack and divide into 1-pound portions and freeze them, Cataldo said.
More broadly and perhaps most importantly, use your freezer for batch cooking. "When ingredients for favorite meals are on sale but you can't eat the recipe that serves 12, make it and divide into individual portions and freeze," Nelson suggests.
That serves a dual purpose. First, you can buy in larger quantities for a lower unit price. Second, you have ready-made meals that are only microwave minutes away the next time you arrive home late and hungry, perhaps reducing the urge to order pricier take-out food. "You will be glad to have pre-made meals," Nelson said.
It also means you can vary your meals, rather than cooking a big batch and eating the same leftovers three nights in a row.
Buy fish in individually frozen pieces in a large bag to pay the lowest price, Nelson said. She said frozen fish is actually fresher because it is frozen right after being caught, preserving its freshness. "Take one piece out to thaw 24 hours before you need it," she said.
Coupons still work. Couponing, via coupons in the newspaper, printed from online sources or stored electronically, can still work for single people. They are most effective when you apply a coupon to an item already on sale.
"In some ways, it's easier to coupon as a single — you can get by with just one newspaper per week because stocking up doesn't equate to buying a whole bunch of stuff," said Cataldo, who often advocates that families buy multiple Sunday newspapers to take advantage of coupon deals.
Nelson suggests paying attention to high-value coupons for non-food items too. "You generally do not have to buy multiple quantities, and coupons for personal-care products can be $5 or more," she said.
Communal dining. If you're especially social with a tight group of friends, consider taking turns cooking. "One day a week, each of you cook for the entire group, with any leftovers divided among those attending," said Jeff Yeager, author of four books on frugal living, including his most recent. "How to Retire the Cheapskate Way."
"That way, you can shop for and cook in larger quantities, but only for a single dinner each week."
Lunch. Many people have intentions of bringing lunch to work to cut food costs, but it can be a difficult habit to form. When Yeager worked in an office, he would instead take a bag of groceries to work every Monday and make lunches on the spot, rather than keeping groceries at home and "having the hassle of packing an individual lunch every day."

Insider trading: Sebi must knock few heads to drive message
The new rules in itself are unlikely improve the conviction rate when it comes to insider trading. That is because Sebi’s problem so far has not been in proving that the accused was an insider.
Post your opinion here
Santosh Nair
moneycontrol.com
The Securities and Exchange Board of India on Wednesday tweaked its rules on insider trading by widening the definition of the term ‘insider’. Under the new rules, persons who are connected on the basis of being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship will be treated as insiders. Immediate relatives will be presumed to be connected persons in the new guidelines.
This will help the regulator, but only to a limited extent. The new rules in itself are unlikely to improve the conviction rate when it comes to insider trading. That is because Sebi’s problem so far has not been in proving that the accused was an insider. Rather it has been in proving that the accused knowingly used the unpublished price-sensitive information to his or her advantage.
Then there are a lot of cases of insider trading which go unnoticed.
Ask brokers on Dalal Street and they will tell you that it is mostly promoters who make the maximum profits from insider trading. But they are smart enough not to trade in their own name. They hold shares in benaami accounts controlled by them. Ahead of important announcements, the shares are often bought and sold through these accounts. And so far, there has been only one high profile case—Bank of Rajasthan—where it was proved that the promoters were holding shares through benaami accounts, and that their stake was much higher than what was officially disclosed to the stock exchange. But even in that case, there were no specific charges relating to insider trading.
The secondary sources of leakage of price-sensitive information when it comes to corporate deals are investment bankers, lawyers, management consultancies, in no particular order. This group of market players now comes under the ambit of connected persons and those looking to trade on unpublished information will have to be a bit more careful.
Sebi and the stock exchanges have sophisticated surveillance systems that flag unusual trading activity in a stock before major developments. But the tricky part is to prove the charges. That is why Sebi will have to rely more on call records to establish the connection of the insider with the broker who puts through the trades.
Recently Sebi has been given the powers to ask for call records of even those people not directly connected to the securities market, while investigating cases of market manipulation. But that may not be adequate. Having voice records of conversations will help investigators pin charges faster where rules have been violated.
Four years back, the regulator had been able to make a watertight case against a dealer at HDFC Mutual Fund for front running because it had access to the records of calls made from the dealing room, in addition to other evidence.
Sebi’s does not have the power to tap phones; that was denied by the government on grounds of it being liable to misuse. But it was wiretapping that helped the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) get clinching evidence against fund manager Raj Rajaratnam and former Mckinsey executive Rajat Gupta in the insider trading probe against them.
There were over 18,000 wiretapped conversations spread over 16 months, intercepted by the investigators. So far this year, SEC has investigated 21 cases of insider trading, and in many instances, the accused have settled through fines in excess of what they made from the illicit trade. This shows that despite strict laws and a higher enforcement rate, insider trading thrives in developed market like the US.
 
In India, over the last few years, there have been quite instances of what seemed like brazen insider trading, but it is not clear if Sebi has charged those entities yet.
In April this year, the Sun Pharma’s acquisition of Ranbaxy attracted some controversy with market players alleging insider trading ahead of the deal announcement.
Ranbaxy shares surged 30 percent in less than two weeks before the announcement of the deal. In the trading session prior to it, the ratio of the closing prices of Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma were exactly 0.8:1, the same ratio in which the shares were to be swapped under the merger agreement.
Back home, Sebi has now been pursuing insider trading cases since 17 years. In 1997, it slapped charges on Hindustan Lever (now Hindustan Unilever) and five of its key officials for the purchase of a large block of Brooke Bond India (BBIL) shares from Unit Trust of India, weeks before BBIL was to be merged with HLL.
Others who have been accused of a similar offence include ABS Industries managing director Rakesh Agarwal (buying his stock just before the company’smerger with Bayer), fund manager Samir Arora (for selling Digital Globalsoft shares ahead of its merger with HP), Tata Finance MD Dilip Pendse (for selling shares before the company reported a huge quarterly loss), and former chief financial officer of Wockhardt, Rajiv Gandhi (for selling shares based on unpublished information about the company’s financials), and former Ranbaxy independent director VK Kaul and his wife (for buying shares of Orchid Chemicals ahead of a Ranbaxy arm picking stake in the coming).
The results have been been mixed. The Securities Appellate Tribunal overruled Sebi’s verdict in the cases against HLL, Samir Arora and Dilip Pendse. Agarwal and Gandhi settled through consent orders, forking out Rs 34 lakh and Rs 5 lakh. Kaul and wife had to pay a total of Rs 60 lakh as fine, and the Sebi order was upheld by SAT.
Insider trading charges were slapped on Polaris founder Arun Jain, JP Associates chairman Manoj Gaur, his wife and brother, and on Suzlon, founder Tulsi Tanti and four senior executives. Suzlon and its executives settled through consent, while the charges against Arun Jain and Manoj Gaur & family were set aside by the SAT.

This article was reported by DealNews , a site that scours the web for the best retail deals.
Now that the Black Friday ads are leaking at a steady pace, we're finally getting a clear picture of the 2014 Black Friday landscape. We've examined the advertised deals from stores like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart, and we're ready to pick some early winners. Keep in mind though that new ads will continue to trickle in, but in the meantime, here's our roundup of the top Black Friday ads so far.
The Best Black Friday Ads So Far
Panasonic 50" 1080p LED LCD HDTV for $199.99 at Best Buy
If you want to make a statement, offering a brand-name HDTV as your show-stealing doorbuster is a heck of a way to do it. This Panasonic 50" set comes in at an astonishing $99 below our Black Friday prediction for the 46" to 47" class TVs. In fact, this deal will be tied as the best price we've seen for any 50" HDTV by about $100 — including refurbs. (We've only seen a 50" TV drop this low once before, on Thanksgiving last year.) Best of all, this price outshines the leaked Black Friday prices for every other TV in this size range, including Target's incredible $235 48" set . The only drawback to this doorbuster is that you'll have to go to the store to grab it.
Asus Intel Laptop for $100 at Staples
We admit, this ad is as vague as you can get, but even without specifics it's safe to assume this laptop is housing a low-cost Intel Atom or Celeron processor. Nevertheless, as far as budget systems are concerned, this deal is poised to blow all other deals out of the water. Not only does it beat our laptop prediction for budget machines by $78, but when this deal comes to fruition, it will set a new benchmark for cheap laptops — and become the cheapest laptop in DealNews history.
Element 40" 1080p LED LCD HDTV for $119 at Target
Just when we thought 40" to 42" TV deals had plateaued, Target went and slashed the price of this 40" Element to $119. Not only does that destroy our Black Friday TV prediction for this size category by $59, but it's just $9 away from tying last year's best Black Friday price for a 32" TV. Without a doubt, this is the star of Target's Black Friday ad and easily snags a spot in our Top 10.
Vizio 65" 1080p Smart LED LCD HDTV for $648 at Walmart
Even if you don't consider Vizio to be a brand-name manufacturer, this 65" Smart TV doorbuster is spectacular. Starting at 6 pm local time, in-store shoppers can grab this set for $648, which is a whopping $102 less than the best price we've ever seen for any 65" HDTV, even refurbs. Better yet, this deal easily blows Best Buy's $800 LG TV out of the water.
Samsung 55" 4K 2160p Smart LED LCD Ultra HDTV for $899.99 at Best Buy
Remember when we said you shouldn't buy a name-brand smart TV on Black Friday ? Here's the glaring exception to that rule. You don't even have to brave the in-store crowds to score this incredible Samsung 55" 4K Smart TV deal; according to the ad, this doorbuster will be available online. At $900, this set beats our August mention of a refurb, becoming the cheapest Samsung 55" 4K TV we've seen by $315.
Apple MacBook Air Haswell Core i5 11.6" Laptop for $779.99 at Best Buy
If you're shopping for a current-gen MacBook Air on Black Friday, this is definitely the deal to beat. That $780 price point not only shatters our Black Friday prediction by $19, but it blows past our previous all-time low by $70. Best of all, it knocks a delightful $120 off Apple's price.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7" 8GB Android Tablet with $20 in SYWR points for $150 at Kmart
This is an incredible deal, bar none. First off, Kmart's ad price beats the best deal we've ever seen for this tablet by $6. Plus, the Shop Your Way Rewards credit brings this popular 7" slate to $20 below our Black Friday prediction for a small, mainstream Android tablet. Coincidentally, the credit also helps Kmart beat Sam's Club's leaked Black Friday price for this tablet.
Amazon Fire HD 6 6" 8GB WiFi Tablet with a $20 Meijer Custom Coupon for $79 at Meijer
Here's an ad that blows our Black Friday tablet predictions right out of the water. Against all odds, here's the Fire HD 6 (the bottom-tier tablet in Amazon's recently refreshed lineup), marked down by $20 with an extra $20 credit tacked on for good measure. Assuming you'll use the credit, that'll be 40% off and the very first discount we've seen on this tablet. Furthermore, Meijer's leaked price beats Kmart's by $11 once all credits are taken into account.
Apple iPhone 6 16GB Smartphone for $99 at Sam's Club
Although iPhone 6 deals have been mediocre since Apple's launch, this deal may be the one to open the floodgates. Outside of an early Walmart preorder, the 16GB iPhone 6 has not dropped below $179. This Sam's Club deal cuts the list price by 50% to just $99 (with a 2-year contract renewal), which is right on par with our iPhone prediction . Better yet, this price beats Target's iPhone 6 ad by $51. All of the Sam's Club Black Friday iPhone deals go live on November 15, so proceed with caution because other retailers may swoop in and undercut them.
Samsung Galaxy S5 16GB Android Phone for 1 cent at Target
We haven't seen a decent discount on a subsidized Samsung Galaxy S5 since August, and that one cost $100. Flash forward to Black Friday, when Target will drop this in-demand Android to just one penny (with the activation of a 2-year contract). Unless we start seeing for-profit deals, this is as good as smartphone ads get — it even beats Sam's Club's deal by about a buck.
Xbox One Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle with a $30 Walmart Gift Card for $329
We've seen quite a few noteworthy Xbox One bundle ads, but this one is our top pick. Although Target is offering the Assassin's Creed Unity version of this bundle paired with a $50 gift card , shoppers might think twice about dropping so much cash on a game that one critic called " my least favorite major Assassin's Creed since the 2007 original. " On the other hand, this 6 pm doorbuster comes with four Halo games (as opposed to the other bundle's two), access to a beta, and more. The $30 gift card can even be used to further bulk up your Xbox One collection; Walmart will also have select Xbox One titles on sale from $20 during Black Friday.
However, if you are interested in the Target bundle, know that the heftier gift card means it's effectively $70 below our Black Friday prediction for a Kinect-less Xbox One.

Mandate of PFRDA Act is to ensure minimum cost: RV VermaStory
Looking to widen net
Dipak Mondal caught up with R V Verma, member, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), to know the rationale behind recent changes in the NPS
Dipak Mondal        Edition: November 2014
RV Verma, member, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority
Money Today's Dipak Mondal caught up with R V Verma, member, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), to know the rationale behind recent changes in the National Pension System (NPS).
Q- Of late, there have been lot of changes in the NPS. Are more changes coming?
A- The PFRDA Act was notified in February this year. Now the regulations have to be framed under the Act. As many as 12 regulations have already been framed. They have been put on the PFRDA website for stakeholders' views. We have received good suggestions. These would be placed before the Pension Advisory Committee. Based on the PAC's suggestions and views, it will come back to PFRDA Board for finalisation and the entire process will be completed by December 15 this year.
Q- What is the rationale behind such a low fund-management charge (0.01%)?
A- The mandate of the Act is to ensure minimum cost. The new fee is decided based on a transparent bidding process. So, we expect all the pension fund managers (PFMs), who are part of this system to be able manage funds at the cost which they agreed on. As we go along, there would be some learning as to how this is motivating stakeholders and how it is affecting subscribers' interest. We would see if the fund managers are able to do their business sustainably and profitably.
Q- So, there is a scope of upward revision of PFMs fee...
A- No, I cannot say that; certainly, not in the current scheme of things. But we will assess the impact of different fees on the viability and profitability of the PFMs business.
The monthly accretion in NPS today is about Rs 2,500 crore. That's the incremental flow every month but we certainly need to increase it. We are expanding the scope of PFMs to increase the return by deploying the money in newer instruments. We do not want fund managers to involve in marketing of the scheme. We want them to focus on maximising returns.
Q- Who will market the NPS then?
A- PFRDA itself is engaged in marketing and selling the scheme. We have our own strategy and it involves publicity, reaching out to corporate, state governments and the unorganised sector. We are doing so through PoPs and aggregators and also reaching out to the corporates. We have tied up with FICCI and CII for marketing of the scheme to their members. Though the present taxation rule, which is EET (exempt, exempt, tax), is proving to be an issue with corporate sector. Most employees there are tax payers, and as per present rule the gain at times of redemption is taxable at the hand of the beneficiaries.
Q- Earlier, it was proposed that with the implementation Direct Tax Code (DTC), NPS would become an EEE
instrument. What is the status now?
A- The government wants to promote the scheme as this is a defined contribution scheme (wherein an individual contributes himself towards his pension saving) and it saves a lot of money for the government. The defined benefit (where the employer would bear all the cost of employee's pension) scheme earlier would result in a lot of expense for the government. To that extent, government would not mind losing some money on the fiscal side by making NPS an EEE scheme.
Q- You said PFRDA is expanding the scope of PFMs to increase the yield by deploying the money in newer instruments. What are these new instruments?
A- It's an ongoing process. We recently allowed PFMs to invest in additional tier 1 bonds issued by banks. We are on the process of allowing them to invest in asset-backed securities and covered bonds. We are also planning to allow them to invest in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as and when we get more clarity on it.

China says it wants to  elevate  partnership with SAARCChina says it wants to 'elevate' partnership with SAARC

(China said it wants to "elevate…)
BEIJING: On the eve of the SAARC summit in Nepal, China today said it wants to "elevate its partnership" with the South Asian bloc amid a debate in the official media here on enhancing China's role in the eight member grouping from an observer to that of an active member.
"We value the role played by SAARC and stand ready to elevate our partnership with it so that together we can play a greater role and contribute constructively to the region", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying told a media briefing here.
She was answering a question about the official media reports about calls for elevating China's status from an Observer to that of a Member and whether Beijing looks to step up its role in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
SAARC is comprised of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Currently, Australia, China, the European Union, Iran, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mauritius, Myanmar and the US are observers to SAARC.
As it expanded its influence in the South Asian region firming up ties with countries in the region specially Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives with billions of dollars worth of aid and project assistance, China was vocal about upgrading its status as a member.
China's state run news agency had stirred up a debate about whether the country should elevate its role in the eight-member group by quoting different politicians from Nepal.
SAARC's economic and political organisation now needs to redefine the nine observers' role and to expand in the future, a Xinhua report on the grouping said.
Hua said China has always attached great importance to developing sound relations with SAARC and sent 14 delegation at attend the SAARC summits since it got the Observer status.
A Chinese delegation headed by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin would attend the two day SAARC summit in Nepal to be held on November 26-27.
Wishing the summit a success, Hua said "we keep deepening our cooperation in various fields. We will continue to cooperate with SAARC countries on the basis of peace, stability and prosperity".

Viewpoint: Chinas role will be keenly watchedNovember 26, 2014, 1:42 am IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | India | ET

By Srikanth Kondapalli
While the 18th SAARC summit meeting at Kathmandu on November 26-27 is focused on regional integration and counter-terrorism, China’s behind-the-scenes role will be keenly watched by the South Asian countries.
China had become an observer at the Dacca summit meeting in 2005 pushed through by Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh but resisted by India, Bhutan, Afghanistan and Maldives.
Several Chinese have cited geographical contiguity, trade and political interactions, historical links to the region as the basis for the membership desire in the SAARC. It attended four summits so far. While China raised this issue in 2008 and 2010 summit meetings, the 2011 Addu Summit insisted that “institutionalisation process” and firming up of the SAARC identity should first take place before the membership is opened further.
China had proposed the SAARC+1 (China) initiative much in the format of the ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and South Korea). China’s ancient strategy of hexiao kongda [cooperate with the small countries to counter the big] had been implemented in South Asia to counter India. With the Silk Road initiative, while China had been suggesting to its economic/commercial nature, apprehensions still remain in New Delhi about China’s meddling in the region.
China had sent its foreign minister to attend the 14th summit meeting at New Delhi in 2007. For the rest of the other summit meetings, it had sent only a junior minister. China’s officials steered away from controversy, however, by raising soft issues such as poverty alleviation, disaster relief, training programmes in human resources development, infrastructure and energy, and hosting seminars.
China today is the largest trading partners for many a South Asian country. It has a free trade arrangement with its “all-weather” friend Pakistan and about to conclude similar treaty with Sri Lanka. China’s trade with South Asia has increased substantially from $5.7 billion in 2000 to $93 billion in 2012, with China’s imports from the region increasing from $ 1.9 billion in 2000 to $ 22.6 billion in 2012. However, more than half of China’s trade with SAARC countries is with India – in 2013 reaching to $66 billion.
To promote trade with SAARC, China is showcasing Yunnan rather than restive Xinjiang. The China-South Asia Business Forum was established in 2004 with the initial meeting focusing on “Communication, Cooperation, Development and Mutual Benefits” in December that year at Kunming.
Two years later, China-South Asia Business Council was established as a link between nearly 40 Chinese companies and SAARC chambers of commerce and industry. In June 2013, another initiative – China-South Asia Exposition began at Kunming with Bangladesh as the theme country for that year.
However, China’s investments in the region are paltry – cumulatively about $4billion in SAARC countries, although last week it announced an investment of $45.6 billion for economic corridor with Pakistan. Also, China’s financial contribution to the SAARC process is negligible, with $300,000 for the SAARC Development Fund, although China has over $4 trillion in foreign earnings, including from SAARC countries.

Chinese mobile firm OnePlus to enter India on Dec 2Chinese mobile firm OnePlus to enter India on Dec 2
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 26, 2014  | 21:03 IST
After Xiaomi and Oppo, another Chinese handset maker OnePlus is now gearing up to launch its product in India on December 2.
OnePlus has partnered eCommerce firm Amazon to launch its 'One' in the country. Though the pricing is yet to be divulged, the handset would be priced aggressively in the mid-range, between Rs 15,000-25,000.
The company has also put in place a local team, led by OnePlus India General Manager Vikas Agarwal. India is the first country outside of its headquarters to have a physical presence.
This will also be the first region in which a localised service infrastructure is established, offering phone and walk-in support to users around the country.
"Our company focuses first on our users and our product. We want to provide the best possible experience for our Indian users who have been so supportive of our vision," OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said.
To do that, OnePlus is investing heavily in Indian operations and partnering e-commerce company, Amazon.in, he added.
Keeping in line with the global invite system, users in India will receive India-specific invites through OnePlus and Amazon.in. Starting today, users interested in buying the handset can log onto the company's website to register for receiving an invite.
After receiving the invite, they can buy the device on Amazon.in starting December 2. India, which is one of the fastest growing smartphone markets globally, is also one of the most lucrative opportunities that handset makers are vying for.
In the last few months, new players like Xiaomi, Oppo and Jolla have entered the Indian market to challenge established players like Samsung, Micromax and Nokia (now Microsoft Devices). According to IDC, about 44 million smartphones were sold last year. For 2014, it expects the number to cross 80.57 million units.

OPEC meeting keeps world on the edgeUpdated: November 26, 2014 23:39 IST
OPEC meeting keeps world on the edge
Lalatendu Mishra
oil and gas - downstream activities
As oil ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meet in Vienna on Thursday to press for a one million barrels a day production cut to support falling Brent crude oil prices, speculation is rife that Brent crude prices may stabilise at the current level or may plunge further to $75 a barrel due to lack of consensus among members.
As some major oil producers have hinted at continuing their production to retain the market share, some analysts have predicted that the prices may plunge to $60 a barrel level, which seems unlikely.
The price of Brent crude oil peaked this year at $115.15 a barrel on June 19. Since then, prices are down 31per cent to below $79 a barrel.
“Most of the oil price declines occurred after Saudi Aramco started a price war on October 1 for all its exports, reducing those bound for Asia to the lowest level since 2008. The move suggests that the biggest member of the OPEC is prepared to let prices fall rather than cede market share by paring output to clear a supply surplus,” said Aviral Gupta, Founder & Investment Strategist, Mynte Advisors.
“Saudi Arabia would need to reduce output about 500,000 barrels a day to eliminate the supply glut now stemming from the highest U.S. output in three decades. It is expected that crude oil prices could plunge to $60 a barrel if OPEC does not agree on a significant output cut when it meets in Vienna,” he added.
However, this level would be unsustainable and might not be achieved, said experts.
“To my mind, the price may not go down that much. The price has come down is due to the additional production coming from the U.S. from the shale reserves.
Now there is a cost involved in producing such fuel and in case the price goes below $70, it may not be sustainable and there could be an automatic correction in prices,” said Rajesh Mokashi, Deputy Managing Director, CARE Ratings Ltd.
He said as prices fall, the OPEC nations would be forced to increase production to maintain their incomes and hence would not let it go below $70 a barrel. Therefore, a level of $60 will be difficult to sustain.
A further correction in Brent crude prices may bring down the prices of petrol and diesel. Apart from this, the softening of the crude prices will have many positives for the Indian economy.
“The import bill will come down substantially and given that oil accounts for around 32-35 per cent of total imports, there will be a major gain in the import bill which will get reflected in a lower current account deficit (CAD). A lower CAD will also ensure that the exchange rate remains stable in the present range of Rs.61-62 per dollar,” said Mr. Mokashi.
According to analysts, the lower crude oil price will help lower the subsidy bill on kerosene and LPG. Inflation, which is a major concern, will benefit as products such as naphtha and ATF will come at lower prices.
This will further lower other costs for companies using these fuels which in turn will bring about a secondary decline in prices of final products.

CEOs like debt MFs despite highertaxesSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Corporate India continues to remain invested in debt-oriented mutual funds (MFs), including fixed maturity plans (FMPs). That’s despite the fact that companies willl need to pay a higher tax rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess for short- term investments of less than three years. Companies’ exposure to fixed-income schemes fell just 3.65% in the September quarter, but it nevertheless constitutes close to 56% of the overall debt AUM (assets under management).
Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Mutual Fund, says there has been absolutely no move by companies to pull out money or redeem fixed-income investments, including FMPs.
“Given the changes in inflation and interest rates, companies need to be invested in fixed income even if it means paying slightly higher taxes. Although MF schemes are now taxed on a par with other debt products, if the holding period is three years, the tax outgo would be much lower considering the indexation benefits,” Choudhary explained.
In the union budget for 2014-15, the finance minister had raised the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) rate for debt mutual funds from 10% to 20% with indexation benefit. Moreover, the government extended the definition of long-term for debt funds to three years from one year, removing the tax advantage that debt funds with a holding period of over a year used to enjoy. Any debt fund investment redeemed by a company before three years now attracts tax at 30% plus surcharge and cess, similar to what the interest on FDs is.
Companies typically park surplus cash in debt- oriented products through their treasury operations, and these form part of their shorter-term current and medium-term investments.
Sesa Sterlite’s investments in debt MFs, for instance, at the end of the September quarter stood at R32,727 crore, out of total cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments of R47,107 crore it had.
The exposure remains more or less the same as it was prior to the June 2014 budget, when it was R32,524 crore.
Bharti Infratel’s non-current investments in debt MFs across liquid, liquid plus and income funds stood at R3,500 crore, nearly same as at the end of March 2014, according to its latest quarter’s earnings call.
FMPs, a type of closed-ended debt scheme with tenures ranging from a month to 36 months, have seen some outflows, but not as much as feared. The category has seen a net outflow of R18,346 crore in the last four months, leading to a 7.5% fall in AUM to R1.61 lakh crore at the end of October 2014.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, says that while one- year FMPs have seen less demand in recent months due to lower short-term rates and adverse taxation, there has been been no major impact on the industry. Kevin P D’sa, president finance at Bajaj Auto, said during the company’s quarterly earnings call that of the R8,000-crore surplus, nearly R5,000 crore was invested in FMPs.
Experts say that unlike retail investors and high net-worth individuals,who have rolled over their schemes to three years, companies have not done so and are paying higher tax. Maruti Suzuki, during its earnings call, stated it had not yet rolled over the FMPs and was assessing its investment strategy.

Cotton arrivals rise  not much damage tocropGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
The all India kapas arrivals have picked up to approximately 1 lakh bales per day and there is not much of damage to the standing cotton crop due to rains, after weakening of the cyclone over Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, Indian Cotton Federation (ICF) said on Wednesday.
In the northern region of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the kapas arrivals have started picking up. Punjab J-34 r/g is priced at R3,410 per maund spot while Haryana J-34 r/g priced at R3,310 per maund spot. Rajasthan J-34 r/g was quoted at R3,320 per maund spot.
However, cotton yield may be very less in Telangana, in areas surrounding Adilabad and Vidarbha due to lack of rains. This situation may lead to a drop in the overall cotton crop of India to below 400 lakh bales. Cotton output would be affected in states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, ICF said.

Analyst Corner: Sale of Africa tower positive forBhartiSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Maintain ‘outperform’ on Bharti Airtel with price target of R464 per share. The company announced the third tranche of its tower sale in Nigeria at $1.05 billion for 4,800 towers. The deal is likely to be in the form of a lease, with Bharti as an anchor tenant in all its towers.
While the deals would be positive for EV as it leads to net debt reduction of c.$2 billion, the estimated cash flow impact is c.$275 million on account of lease payments. We estimate net negative EV on account of cash outflow of c.$1.4 billion. The assigned multiple of 5x lease outflow is higher than the 3x EV/ebitda multiple derived from the DCF for Bharti’s Africa operations. Our calculations indicate a net positive value accretion of R11 per share for Bharti on completed tower sales. Extrapolating similar economics for the entire 15,000 towers would imply an upside of R15 per share.
Bharti announced the sale of its 4,800 towers in Nigeria to American Tower Corporation for $1.05 billion, i.e. at a total cost of $2.20 lakh per tower. This follows two Africa tower sales of 3,500 towers and 3,100 towers to Helios partners and Eaton towers, estimated at $1.5-1.6 lakh, in line with the replacement cost in respective countries. The total sale of 11,400 towers constitutes the bulk of Bharti’s 15,000 tower portfolio in Africa. We estimate the total consideration of the three tower deals at $2.1 billion.
We estimate that the Africa tower sale would be close to its replacement cost. In terms of reported numbers, the deals should not impact Bharti’s reported ebitda, as the lease payments will be below ebitda.

Editorial: A few big shotsrequiredGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
Thanks to a large measure of good luck on global oil and commodity prices, the most immediate fears relating to the government—on the fiscal and current account deficits as well as overall inflation—appear to have been dealt with; indeed, with much of the global economy in bad shape, save the US which is roaring, India looks like a hot property for investors. With the Modi government in place for six months now, the question is whether it has made the most of its luck, and mandate. On petroleum, there is little doubt bolder steps—on raising LPG prices regularly—could have been taken, but capping the LPG subsidy and starting direct benefit transfers (DBT) in pilot districts is a good start and needs to be maintained. While a committee has been set up to suggest the way forward on agriculture, keeping MSP hikes to a minimum and restricting procurement in certain states is a good idea—indeed, if along with the greater use of DBT for food subsidies, the MSP-driven farm incentive system is replaced by an incomes policy, that will be a great reform. Getting the GST Bill through the current session of Parliament looks like a long haul, but with a 27% revenue-neutral-rate, GST is pretty much a non-starter anyway. Progress on getting the land acquisition Act fixed appears poor, and is an area the Modi government would have done well to put more muscle behind. The moves on getting labour reforms done—basically the Rajasthan route—have worked out well; getting the Coal India unions to back off is a great coup and suggests it is just a matter of time before commercial mining is allowed, and can prove to be the kind of game-changer private sector involvement in petroleum has been. Getting the US to back India’s food-subsidy proposal at WTO was a coup that took place not because of Modi’s personal charm, but because the US feels Modi will deliver its business deals—the speed at which defence contracts are being cleared, and allowing 49% FDI in defence, is an example of this; that it will help make-in-India is an added bonus.
If, despite this, there is a feeling of discomfort, it is because several of Modi’s policies—on reducing subsidies through DBT and substituting MSP with an incomes policy—are in the pipeline and could just as easily get derailed. There is, fortunately, some clarity now on reining in the taxman. The Attorney General has opined that the Bombay High Court judgment in Vodafone India transfer pricing case will not be appealed. But in the petroleum sector, junking the Rangarajan formula for a much lower gas price, with no clarity on how the deep-water premium is to be calculated, has been a disappointment, as has been the delay in clearing extensions for oil fields; and it is inexplicable that the government should make the kind of heavy weather it is on telecom. It’s too early to say, but judging by the goings-on in Parliament, getting critical Bills through isn’t quite the pushover most thought it would be. A sobering reality, but a promising first six months.

How taxi services are giving women a drive to financial independenceHow taxi services are giving women a drive to financial independence

(The biggest challenge that…)
BENGALURU: Five years ago, Mumbai native Rupa Swali became separated from her abusive husband.
With little education and without a job, she didn't have any income - until she joined Viira Cabs as a taxi driver. Since then, she has been able to send her daughter Mili to complete medical school, and is using her income to provide for three struggling households as well. "I started with absolutely nothing. Now I'm very happy, and there's nothing that I want any more," said the 52-year-old, whose taxi is on call 24 hours a day.
Her story mirrors many such instances where female drivers have been hired by all-female taxi companies that were established over the past few years, giving these women a taste of financial freedom. In Bangalore, there's a Rotary Club-sponsored Angel City Cabs, which is being backed by Canara Bank in its bid to expand to 25 drivers in the coming months. Four months ago, the Duchess Club of Chennai set up the Penn Taxi initiative, which has provided three female drivers with vehicles under their own names.
Political activist Susiieben Shah started Priyadarshini Taxi in Mumbai six years ago to empower women to earn their own livelihoods. Today, the company has over 25 cabs, and they have just been awarded 200 cab permits by the Government of Maharashtra, which they hope to fill by the end of next year.
"If men can do it, women can do it better," said Shah. "The comfort factor for the driver is that it's an all-women enterprise." Transportation has always been a male territory, with Ola and Uber, two feuding competitors in the taxi space, each having only a handful of female drivers. "For a woman, it's tough to get family support for this profession. I took this job as a challenge," said UberBlack driver Bharathi Veerath, who migrated from Warangal in 2005 to Bangalore with her mother and brother in search of a livelihood. Veerath drives about 12 hours a day and calls driving her 'passion'.

Veerath drives about 12 hours a day and calls driving her 'passion'.
"The truth is women are safer drivers anywhere in the world. Women are less involved in accidents," said Preeti Sharma, managing director of seven-year-old Viira Cabs, also in Mumbai. "You'd have so much more safety on the road."
"The drive to be an independent woman keeps me motivated," agreed Reshma Banu, a former housewife who now runs a car rental business that is tied up with eight aggregators, including Ola Cabs. She now owns a fleet of 16 cars and makes Rs 1 lakh a month from Ola Cabs alone.
  The biggest challenge these ventures have faced is sky-high attrition rates, disabling them from scaling up and providing city-wide coverage. Out of the 207 women that were trained by Viira Cabs, only 17 are currently with the company; and just three lady drivers still work for Angel City Cabs, from over 20 who received training.
Priyadarshini sees a 50% retention rate. "It's always family reasons," explained Sharma, whose Viira Cabs is running up losses every month. "A woman has to have consent from everyone involved in her family because she is not a decision maker. If anything happens at home, hers is the first job that goes out the window. The ones who have stayed with us are women who are primary earners in the family."
For all startups we spoke to, women drivers handle two to five bookings a day, and take home a monthly sum of around Rs 15,000.
While these taxi services were intended to be for women passengers only, this has proven to be an unsustainable business model since safety in male-operated cabs is not a major issue. These startups have transitioned to taking bookings from families and couples as well. "Taxi fulfillment has to be on the spot, so unless the number of such cabs reaches a critical mass, they would not be reliable as a service," said Vineet Toshniwal, managing director of investment bank Equirus Capital.

Apple Watch: India will be a priority marketApple Watch may be unveiled in India in February

Apple is bullish about the success of the Apple Watch in India since it already has a base of more than 4 million iPhone and iPad users who are initially the potential target.

KOLKATA: India will be a priority market for Apple's first wearable device, the Apple Watch, which is expected to hit the domestic market by early February.
The bullishness of the Cupertinobased company comes from initial market studies that show the Apple Watch has the potential to become a bestseller in India, after iPhones and iPads.
Apple also proposes to engage Indian developers to create apps for the device and is firming up the launch, according to two senior executives aware of the company's plans for India.
"Apple is bullish about the success of the Apple Watch in India since it already has a base of more than 4 million iPhone and iPad users who are initially the potential target," said one of the executives.
An Apple spokesman said the Apple Watch will be launched globally in early 2015 and there is no further update. As per estimates, the price of the Apple Watch will be about Rs 28,000-35,000, which will be more than the cost of wearable products sold by rivals Samsung and Sony. The device will be compatible with the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, which run the latest operating system.
"At such a price point and limited reach only to latest iPhone users, the volume uptake will surely be small, but the Apple Watch launch will boost the awareness of smart wearables as a product category and make it a buzzword in India like Apple iPad did to tablets as a product category four years ago," said Counterpoint Research senior analyst (devices and ecosystem) Tarun Pathak.
According to Counterpoint Research, the wearable market in India is still very small, at 1 lakh units this calendar year, but Apple Watch is expected to give it a boost next year, when it is expected to grow five times. The researcher expects several new vendors will launch affordable smart wearable products next year. PlanetM Retail chief executive officer Sanjay Karwa expects the Apple Watch to give a boost to the market, which has become subdued after Diwali.
"A new gadget like Apple Watch will get traction by virtue of its loyal customer base which is now a sizeable number in India," he said. Apple last week rolled out the software that will help developers to come up with new apps for the Apple Watch. The company is hopeful the Indian base of developers will roll out local apps to expand the appeal of the device in the domestic market.

SANAA, Yemen (AP) — U.S operation forces took part in a rescue mission that freed eight hostages in a remote corner of Yemen, but a Yemeni official said Wednesday that it did not liberate five others, including an American journalist and a Briton who were moved elsewhere by their al-Qaida captors days before the raid.
Eight hostages — including a Saudi— were liberated in the joint U.S.-Yemeni operation, a rare instance of American forces intervening on the ground in Yemen. A member of the Yemeni anti-terrorism forces was quoted on a website connected to Yemen's Defense Ministry, saying that the mission searched for a group of hostages from several nations in an eastern province, but when the commandos arrived at the cave where al-Qaida militants had chained and covered the hostages in blankets, the American and four others were already gone.
A senior U.S. official had earlier confirmed U.S. involvement and said no American was rescued, without elaborating whether the operation had intended to free one.
The mission was carried out in a vast desert area dotted with dunes called Hagr al-Saiaar, an al-Qaida safe haven where local tribes offer them protection near the Saudi border.
The operations come as U.S. drone strikes target militants amid a Shiite rebel power grab in the politically unstable, impoverished nation and fierce battles between al-Qaida and Shiite rebels.
Yemenis initially gave no mention of American involvement in the operation and said its special forces and anti-terrorism units carried out the raid alone.
However, a Yemen Special Forces member identified only as Abu Marouf gave a detailed account of the operation to the semi-official Yemen Defense Ministry online portal, named Sept. 26.
He said that his unit received intelligence information about al-Qaida militants moving hostages chained in shackles and covered with blankets in pickup trucks to Hagr al-Saiaar where they kept them in caves. He added some 30 troops, including snipers, were deployed in the early hours Tuesday some seven kilometers (four miles) from the caves, which he described as 10 meters deep and 30 meters wide.
Divided into four groups, he said he was among the main group that stormed the entrance of the cave then engaged in a shootout that ended with the killing of all seven kidnappers.
"We found the eight hostages chained. We found al-Qaida cellphones and documents," he said, adding that the hostages said five of their companions had been moved out to an unknown location. He listed nationalities of the other hostages as an American journalist, one Briton, one South African, a Yemeni and a fifth believed to be Turkish. He did not identify them.
Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is considered by the U.S. to be the world's most dangerous branch of the terror network and has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland. Yemen has seen both foreigners and Yemenis targeted in kidnap attempts, either for ransom, political reasons or over suspicions that victims worked as spies helping Americans carry out the drone strikes.
The strikes targeting suspected militant gatherings are increasingly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties, legitimizing for many the attacks on American interests. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa has been closed several times recently over militant threats.
The site shed light on the riskiness surrounding the operation. Other Yemeni officials said that one of the main tribes in the area is led by the well-off Waqash al-Saiaari, who gave shelter to the militants. They say al-Qaida set up large training camps in the area.
Members of al-Qaida affiliates from this area were recently arrested while trying to flee the country after alleged involvement in the beheading of 16 Yemeni soldiers in August.
Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Companies take to cloud-based solutions from startupsBiocon
(EnCloudEn, which provides…)
BENGALURU: For a long time, Indian startups that offer their software solutions for enterprises on the cloud have had to look overseas to find customers. Not anymore.
The need to stay on top of the game and a greater trust on cloud-based products are making reticent Indian firms turn to startups. Earlier this year, for example, Bengaluru-based EnCloudEn, which provides private cloud infrastructure software developed with open source tools, got biotech major Biocon as its customer.
"People are slowly realising that it is in their advantage to be taking solution from startups," said Abinash Saikia, 28, who cofounded EnCloudEn in 2012 with his IIT Madras college mate Satya Kishore. The firm targets $1 million in revenue next year. En-CloudEn's deal with Biocon — which Saikia claimed was the largest in the private cloud infrastructure space in the country so far — reflects an increasing trend among Indian companies to go for purpose-built cloudbased enterprise products from startups instead of solutions of large companies.
Experts see this trend of big companies going for cloud-based solutions to speed up in the coming days. "I see it happening much rapidly. The scale is bigger, the pace of migration much faster," said analyst Jayant Kolla of research firm Convergence Catalyst.
Sharad Sharma, founding member of software product think-tank iSpirt, said large companies have always resisted cloud-based products, under the premise that their data might be compromised, if hosted on thirdparty servers. "That resistance is coming down every year," he said. "A lot more proofof-concepts/demos are happening."
According to Virender Aggarwal, CEO at Ramco Systems, one reason for this change is the depleting power of the chief information officer as heads of different divisions like sales, human resources, marketing, directly take a call on what product they need. That is a practice Ramco, a two-decade old software maker listed on the National Stock Exchange, follows.
"Going forward, IT will be consumed like water and electricity, on a pay as you go basis," Aggarwal said.
Ramco, which has a suite of products for human resources, has partnered with startups to offer specialised offering to clients such as Dabur.
Video conferencing solution provider 1Click, which once called India a graveyard for enterprise startups, too, has seen a shift. "Something has changed. I don't know what," said Hrishikesh Kulkarni, founder of 1Click.
"We used to handle 1,000 video calls a month, now we handle 10,000 calls." Kulkarni, a former employee of Bell Labs, targets $1.5 million in sales next fiscal. According to market research firm IDC, the cloud computing market in India is expected to reach $3.5 billion, or about Rs 21,617 crore, by 2016, up from $688 million (approx Rs 4,250 crore) in 2012. Experts say small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are leading large firms in going for cloud-based products.
Traditionally, intra-office communications, emails and other processes were not designed to be supported on mobile. Now, there are many mobile-first products from startups.
"SMEs are adopting these products on the cloud much faster than large enterprises," said Shekar Kirani, partner at Accel Partners and looks at mobile, cloud and enterprise technologies. "So it becomes imperative for large companies to keep up with the technology," he said.
A case in point is Agaze Technologies, which sells supply chain management software for SMEs in the ecommerce space. "We are taking full advantage of this cloud movement," said Vipin Velayudhan, cofounder of the year-old company.

Infosys veteran & Finacle creator Mangipudi Haragopal launches financial services startup FinUNO

Finacle
(“It’s about giving…)
BENGALURU: Mangipudi Haragopal , the man credited with making Infosys' core banking solution Finacle a globally recognised product, has founded a startup that promises "next generation" banking solutions.
Haragopal, who quit Infosys last month after a stint of more than two decades, is currently busy setting up a team of up to eight executives for his US-based startup, FinUNO, which will act as a virtual relationship manager for financial services institutions.
"It's about giving a simple yet fulfilling experience to the consumers of banking and financial services," Haragopal told ET in his first interview after leaving Infosys.
This will be done by leveraging disruptive technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing and big data analytics, he said.
"A dedicated VRM (virtual relationship manager) transcends financial transactions in meeting the social and commerce needs as well of a consumer," said Haragopal. He expects the first offering from his startup by summer next year.
The move comes at a time when Infosys' new CEO Vishal Sikka has tasked his former SAP colleague Michael Reh to help revive the fortunes of Finacle.
Haragopal, 52, has got FinUNO incorporated in the US, where he is in talks with venture capitalists for seed money. He declined to share the quantum of funds he is looking to raise. A person familiar with the matter said he is eyeing seed money of up to $5 million. Haragopal said he is keen to get FinUNO registered in India too.
Of late, Indian information technology companies' core banking platforms, including Finacle, seem to have hit a saturation point due to banks' reluctance to invest in next generation core banking solutions amidst a slowdown and the firms' inability to tap into the large US market.
While Infosys does not share revenues generated from its core banking product, advisory firm NelsonHall estimates that revenues from Finacle have dipped to $297 million by the end of March 2014 from $314 million in 2012. Some experts expect Reh to "reengineer" Finacle by adopting a partnerships model, increasing presence in the mobile banking space and adding insurance domain technology.
"Infosys may aim for a strong ecosystem of partners who can effectively implement Finacle in collaboration," said Mallikarjuna Reddy, principal consultant at JMR Infotech, a Bangalore-based core banking solution provider.
Rachael Stormonth, senior vice president at NelsonHall, said Infosys may also expand Finacle brand to include insurance, something which Mumbaibased TCS has done with its core banking product BaNCS.
Sikka has already told analysts that among other things, he plans to double investments in Finacle, without sharing details. With FinUNO, Haragopal joins a long list of Infosys veterans associated with startups. Fresh from passing on the baton at Infosys, cofounders SD Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan came together again earlier this month to set up an incubator, Axilor Ventures, to mentor and back early-stage ventures with an aim to invest up to $1 million in each startup they pick.
Infosys' former finance heads Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan have also teamed up to set up a technology investment fund, Exfinity Fund, which raised .`125 crore in August. According to trade body Nasscom, about 800 startups are set up in the country every year.

Venture capital funds with deep pockets set off alarm bells for angel investorsVenture capital funds with deep pockets set off alarm bells for India’s angel investors

(These funds are now launching…)
NEW DELHI: Venture capital funds armed with deep pockets are muscling into the territory of angel investors as they pick up stakes in very young startups to gain a lead in India's fast growing entrepreneurial sector .
These funds, which typically do not invest in companies that have neither a product or revenue, are now launching angel investment programmes and writing small cheques based on just an idea. This has set off alarm bells in India's angel investment community that is struggling to keep pace with these cash rich competitors.
"It's a cause of concern for angel funds like us as a competitive offer from a venture fund comes up in review meetings every two weeks," said Karthik Reddy, chief executive officer of Blume Ventures which has backed startups such as mobile technology maker Apalya and hiring portal Babajobs. Blume typically invests up to $300,000 in a startup, termed as seed capital and works closely with the company for further fund raising.
Investors like Blume have to now compete with several marquee funds including SAIF Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, all of which have opened seed gel investing programs to net fledgling startups.
So far this year over $1 billion of venture capital has been invested in Indian startups according to consultancy EY. "Seed investing by VC firms is a new phenomenon. They have realised they will lose out on 'good' deals and valuations if they are not present in the game early on," said Manish Singhal, angel investor in startups such as AdPushup and advisor to firms such as ApartmentAdda.
Singhal was formerly associated with Lets Venture, which chose to take venture money of about Rs 4 crore from Accel Partners led by a syndicate of angels. For entrepreneurs this growing trend is throwing up a problem of plenty.
A Mumbai based founder and CEO was looking to raise money for his startup, a couple of months ago and had offers from both seed funds and larger venture investors.
This month, he decided to take an Rs 5 crore cheque from angels and politely asked venture funds to wait and invest in a later round. "The problem of plenty is good to have but a startup can be badly stuck if it fails to raise next round from his own venture fund," said the CEO on condition of anonymity.
"It's a double edged sword. If you are confident of doing well and scaling up - global VCs can make important connects overseas for which angels might not have the bandwidth," said Kushal Dugar, CEO of Teabox which was seed-funded this year with $1 million by Accel Partners, one of the earliest investors in Flipkart. Dugar is now looking to raise another round in which Accel Partners will participate.
But when a venture fund does not provide follow-on funding for a startup it has backed at the seed stage, it can lead to a fund crunch for the company. "Startups require a lot of hand holding and mentoring in early months. Venture fund (do not have) a dedicated arm for that," said Harshad Lahoti, founding partner of ah! Ventures, a dealmaking platform for early stage startups.
However VCs have realised that its best to co-investing with angels as that can improve their funnel for long term. "We are collaborating closely with our companies from day one, which makes us a recommendable partner for angel investors," said Rehan Yar Khan, earlier an angel and now founder of VC firm Orios Venture Partners. "VC firms at seed stage and angel investors both fulfill different needs of the entrepreneurs," said Khan, an investor in startups such as Druva, OlaCabs and Unbxd.

Barack Obama s immigration move disappoints businessesLava launches new smartphone Iris Fuel 60 priced at Rs 8,888
President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration left out some of the business community’s top priorities, disappointing business leaders who might have stepped up to defend his policies in the face of Republican attacks.
Months of lobbying by high-tech businesses failed to persuade the administration to make allotted but unused green cards granting permanent residency status available for foreign workers – probably the top item on the executive action agenda for business.
And the administration only partially answered pleas to increase the length of time foreign students can stay in the U.S. before or after graduating to work in their fields. The administration announced plans to expand the program at some point in the future, but it offered no details on timing or scope.
Business lobbyists contended that these and other ”asks” were fairly modest to begin with, since all acknowledged that the big-ticket items on their agenda – such as increasing the number of high-tech visas available for foreign workers – could only be done by Congress. Even so, they were deflated to find their priorities overlooked as Barack Obama announced plans to curb deportations for 4.5 million people in the country illegally and make them eligible for work permits.
”We didn’t ask for the moon to begin with. There’s just not an opportunity for the administration to deliver the moon for us – that’s a congressional action,” said Scott Corley, executive director of Compete America, which represents high-tech companies including Google, Intel and Microsoft. ”But we asked for some terrestrial things, things within reach, and we didn’t see the detail we hoped for.”
A White House spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who represents the Silicon Valley, said Obama was constrained by the legal advice he received.
”There’s what you want, and what’s possible to do, and people do understand that what you might want him to do is constrained by the law,” Lofgren said. Lofgren had been among those saying Barack Obama could take executive action to allow businesses to ”recapture” permanent resident green cards that had been authorized by Congress but never issued. Barack Obama can’t issue green cards on his own, but business officials say that more than 200,000 that have already been authorized by Congress never have been distributed, and the administration could redistribute them.
The administration did not take that step. Instead, Obama directed the secretaries of the State and Homeland Security departments to come up with recommendations within 120 days to ensure that all the green card visas allotted by Congress get used.
With congressional Republicans vowing to try to overturn Obama’s executive actions, full-throated backing from the business community could have provided some insulation for the administration. But instead, a number of business leaders were lukewarm in their public remarks. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue said in a statement that ”executive actions cannot adequately fix our broken immigration system, and they raise important legal and constitutional questions.”
Among the other business-specific changes the administration made:
-Directed expanded use of a ”national interest waiver” that allows green cards to foreigners with exceptional abilities.
-Announced a new program to allow inventors, researchers and startup founders to stay in the U.S. in a provisional ”parole” status.
-Announced plans to make it easier for people in the U.S. on high-tech work visas to change jobs.
-Renewed previously announced promises to allow work authorization to spouses of high-tech visa holders.
In some cases, such as the planned expansion of a program allowing foreign students and graduates to work in the U.S. for a year or more, business buy-in will depend on the details of what the administration ends up announcing.
”It’s still not at a fully baked stage so I can’t say they delivered for business, but they still could,” said Bob Sakaniwa, associate director for advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Tamir Rice: Police shot after encountering himBy: Associated Press | Cleveland |
Posted: November 27, 2014 11:01 am | Updated: November 27, 2014 7:24 pm
The police officer who fatally shot a 12-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun fired within one to two seconds of pulling up in his cruiser, police said Wednesday. During those few moments, he ordered the youngster three times to put up his hands, they said. The city released a surveillance video that shows the shooting of Tamir Rice, who was carrying an air-soft gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets.
Much of the footage shows what appears to be a bored kid alone in a park on an unseasonably warm November afternoon. Tamir is seen pacing, occasionally extending his right arm with what appears to be a gun in his hand, talking on a cellphone and sitting a picnic table with his head resting on his arms.
The gun wasn’t real, and lacked the bright orange tip that is usually put on such weapons to indicate they’re not real. Tamir’s family said it has seen the video of his shooting. “It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us,” the family said in a statement released by attorneys. “The video shows one thing distinctly: the police officers reacted quickly.”
The Ohio shooting came as protesters across the United States decried a grand jury’s decision not to indict a white police officer who killed an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
The patrol officer who shot Tamir was identified Wednesday as Timothy Loehmann, a 26-year-old rookie who began his career in Cleveland in March. He previously spent five months in 2012 with a department in a Cleveland suburb, but four of those months were in that city’s police academy.
Loehmann’s partner that day was identified as Frank Garmback, 46. He has been with the department since 2008. Both are on paid administrative leave pending a decision by the prosecutor’s office on whether to pursue criminal charges.
What is striking about the video police showed Wednesday is the speed at which the shooting occurred. At one moment, Tamir is sitting at a picnic table. He stands and a police car zooms into the frame from the right and stops near Tamir. The passenger door opens and Loehmann shoots Tamir before Garmback can get out the driver’s side door.
It’s unclear how far Tamir was from Loehmann when the officer shot him, but Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said Wednesday that it was less than 10 feet (3 meters). The low-resolution video shows Tamir reaching to his waistband and then bending over after being shot. His body is mostly obscured by the patrol car when he falls to the ground. Garmback can be seen walking around the car and kicking what is said to be the airsoft gun away from Tamir.
Tomba told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that an FBI agent who was continued…

Cab startups
(The mobile wallet also does…)
BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Customers are more likely to hail a cab of a particular firm if its app is already active on their mobile phones and loaded with cash in virtual wallets, companies such as Olacabs, Meru, TaxiForSure and Uber are finding out as they compete for a larger pie of India's $9-billion (about Rs 56,000 crore) taxi market.
"About 25% of all our bookings in October were made by wallet users. Regular users who use the Ola Money wallet now book 30% more cabs than before," said Olacabs' CEO Bhavish Aggarwal. Olacabs started doubling Ola money recharge on its wallet, so users recharging with Rs 100 got Rs 200 to spend, which led to an upsurge in usage.
With a war chest at its command, having raised $210 million (about Rs 1,300 crore) led by Japan's Softbank, Olacabs is this week offering a 50% discount to its customers who book taxis through its wallets. The company is managing its wallet integration and technology in-house. Ola Mini ride costs as little as Rs 2.5 per km just for its wallet customers.
Mobile wallet company Paytm, which is the official Uber wallet partner, is also offering a free ride of up to Rs 500 to its customers, who shop each time for an equivalent amount with its wallet. The mobile wallet also does away with the possibility of arguments over getting the balance amount back from the cab driver.
"The whole problem of not enough cash or change available is being eliminated by wallets, enabling us to offer better experience," said Siddhartha Pahwa, CEO of Meru Cabs, which is also incentivising its wallet users with 30% cash-back offer.
A ride on Meru's low-cost brand Genie now costs Rs 7 per km. Meru, which was the first to launch the wallet feature, said it has seen customers increasing at 20% every successive week since launch. Meru's wallet is integrated with CitrusPay.
"Companies are looking to ensure that users download their application and link it to wallet to keep balance in their account. This is the good way of building customer loyalty and ensure that drivers use their application as first choice," said Jaspal Singh, co-founder of Valoriser Consultants, which provides market research services for transportation companies.
"The brand recall and the loyalty of a customer becomes very high when he stores money into a wallet. It's just a matter of time when he or she is bound to use the cab start-up's services," said Amit Lakhotia, vicepresident (business) at Paytm.
With about 18 million customers in India, Paytm is also a marketing platform for startups. "We have been seeing great traction with Uber within a week of launch," said Lakhotia about the semiclosed wallet being used by Uber, without disclosing numbers.
While Uber declined to comment on the story, a Paytm official said on condition of anonymity that the taxi app is likely to move all its customers to a semi-closed wallet to comply with the Reserve Bank of India's rule of two-factor authentication. To encourage wallet usage, Uber is offering a Rs 400 free ride to first-time users who install and pay by the Paytm wallet.
"If your ride amount exceeds your wallet balance, you will be prompted to clear your balance before taking your next ride," Uber India said in its blog last week. Bangalore-based TaxiForSure has launched a closed wallet. "It's aproven statistic that the usage of your company's service becomes higher when a customer sees the brand on his mobile phone every day," said Aprameya Radhakrishnan, CEO of TaxiForSure.
However, experts say that users are more likely to use a semiclosed wallet than a closed one. Cash stored in a closed wallet can't be used for any other service. "In real world, you carry cash in wallet whether it is for buying groceries or cereals. Taxi start-ups will also switch over to semi-closed wallets sooner than later," said Bangalore-based Pratyush Prasanna, founder of PlusTxt and now vice president at One97 Communications.

Gujarat tops with 100 crore e-governance transactionAccording to eTaal, public distribution system, land revenue and utility and bill payments are the top three services which record the maximum use.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a call on Independence Day this year for turning the country into 'digital India' where governance would not be opaque to people. In less than two years, Gujarat on Wednesday set a standard for other states when it crossed 100 crore e-transactions for public services — a first for the country insofar as use of technology for registration of births and deaths, land, and other such activities are concerned.
According to 'eTaal' — electronic transaction aggregation and analysis layer — a Central government portal that disseminates e-transaction statistics, Gujarat accounts for 27% of the total 373 crore e-transactions recorded in the services provided by all state government services in the past two years. The portal, set up by the IT department, receives transaction statistics from web-based applications on near real-time basis.
Gujarat has recorded 100.3 crore e-transactions between January 1, 2013 and November 26, 2014 in standard services provided under state government projects. In this year alone, over 58 crore e-transactions have been recorded in the state.Gujarat has set a standard for other states after it crossed 100 crore e-transactions for public services - a first for the country insofar as use of technology for registration of births and deaths, land, and other such activities are concerned.
From land record registration to registering a new birth to getting an affidavit for income, Gujaratis do it all the e-way. According to eTaal , public distribution system, land revenue and utility and bill payments are the top three services which record the maximum use, comprising of more than 63% of e-transactions in Gujarat.
In the case of PDS, introduction of biometric system has led to a record 40 crore e-transactions and over 7 crore election related e-transactions during the Lok Sabha elections helped push the numbers further this year.
Gujarat is next to only the Central government in terms of use of e-services for governance — Central government projects recorded 185 crore e-transactions since January 2013. Agriculture (92 crore), common service centres (17 crore), judiciary (13 crore) and health (10 crore) contribute the maximum to central government e-transactions.
"Over 500 services are available through e-governance in the state. The government has also begun implementing 'mobile governance' across the state as an extended arm of e-governance," said S J Haider, secretary, department of science and technology, Gujarat.

PMO using Big Data techniques on mygov.in to translate popular mood into government action

(Modi PMO is employing Big…)
NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Office is using Big Data techniques to process ideas thrown up by citizens on its crowdsourcing platform mygov. in, place them in context of the popular mood as reflected in trends on social media, and generate actionable reports for ministries and departments to consider and implement.
The Modi government has roped in global consulting firm PwC to assist in the data mining exercise, and now wants to elevate Mygov.in platform from a one-way flow of citizens' ideas to a dialogue where the government keeps them abreast of some of the actions that emerge from their brainstorming.
"There is a large professional data analytics team working behind the scenes to process and filter key points emerging from debates on mygov.in, gauge popular mood about particular issues from social media sites like Twitter and Facebook ," said a senior official aware of the development, adding that these are collated into special reports about possible action points that are shared with the PMO and line ministries. Ministries are being asked to revert with an action taken report on these ideas and policy suggestions currently being generated on 19 different policy challenges such as expenditure reforms, job creation, energy conservation, skill development and government initiatives such as Clean India, Digital India and Clean Ganga.
With the PM inviting Indian communities in America and Australia to join the online platform, which he has termed a 'mass movement towards Surajya', the traffic handling capacity of mygov.in is being scaled up consistently, the official said.
PwC executive director Neel Ratan said that the firm is 'helping the government' process the citizen inputs coming through on Mygov. in in.
"There is a science and art behind it. We have people constantly looking at all ideas coming up, filtering them and after a lot of analysis, correlating it to sentiments coming through on the rest of social media," he said, stressing this is throwing up interesting trends and action points, being relayed to ministries. "It's turning out to be fairly action-oriented. I think it is distinctly possible that 30-50 million people would be actively contributing to Mygov.in over the next year and a half, given its current pace of growth," Ratan said.
PwC's global leader in government and public services Jan Sturesson told ET the participative governance model being adopted through mygov.in could become a model for the developed world.
"The biggest issue for governments today is how to be relevant. If all citizens are treated with dignity and invited to collaborate, it can be easier for administrations to have a direct finger on the pulse of the nation rather than lose it in transmission through multiple layers of bureaucracy," he said, not ruling out the possibility of using the mygov.in for quick referendums on contemporary policy dilemmas in a couple of years.
"The problem in the West has been that the US, Australia and UK follow a public management philosophy that treats citizens as consumers. That's ridiculous, because a consumer pays the bill and complains, while a citizen engages differently and takes responsibility," said Sturesson.
Within the 19 broad citizen engagement themes on mygov.in, there are multiple discussion groups focused on specific subsectors and themes. When it was launched in July, the site enabled brainstorming among its registered users around seven policy challenges. Users are allowed to sign up for four discussion groups in areas of interest apart from a group dealing with issues in their immediate vicinity.

Nilekanis No. 2 man Ram Sewak Sharma spearheading Digital India initiativeNandan Nilekani’s No. 2 man Ram Sewak Sharma now spearheading policies for Digital India initiative

( “He can write code as…)
BENGALURU: He can chalk out eloquent policies to make better use of technology in governance, reel programming jargon like a techie or even hunker down and code through the night. Among bureaucrats in Delhi, Ram Sewak Sharma is an exception. "He can write code as well as the best software folks I know," said Infosys cofounder Nandan Nilekani , who led the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) where Sharma was his top hand. At UIDAI, Sharma was employee number two and Nilekani was the first employee. The two men worked side by side for nearly four years to bring Aadhaar, the world's largest biometric database, to life in record time.
As the secretary of information technology, Sharma now spearheads key policies that are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India initiative."Coding is my hobby," said Sharma, who has been programming since the mideighties when he got his first computer.
Nilekani, who not so long ago at Infosys had some of the country's top IT leaders reporting to him, calls Sharma "extremely dynamic," and "a quick decision-maker willing to take risks." Indeed, unlike many top bureaucrats who take a mid-career break to learn public policy in the United States, Sharma studied Masters in Computer Science at UC Riverside with classmates half his age in 2000. At the time, Sharma was 45 years old.
"All my kids were studying, and I was also studying," jokes Sharma, who has four children.
While at Aadhaar, Nilekani dealt with the external world and Sharma toiled within the organisation that was created to give a unique identification number to over a billion people.
Sharma even wrote the first version of a client software that was used to enrol people into the Aadhaar database.
"He was truly the Aadhaar of Aadhaar," said Nilekani.
There isn't much time to code these days. But his coding prowess and understanding of systems help him implement solutions better. A few months ago, the IT department rolled out a biometric attendance management system which caught much attention from the press.
The Aadhaar-based solution, built by a team of three working under Sharma, can monitor and report staff attendance in real time.
Last week, the BJP government said that it will roll out the attendance system across all central government offices in the country by the next Republic Day.
"In a world where officers keep moving on, he hangs in and builds on projects," said Srikanth Nadhamuni, the chief executive officer of Khosla Labs.
Nadhamuni, who has worked on the UIDAI project, says that Sharma is a combination of somebody who "understands real world problems and can deliver a solution at India scale".
The big plan now is to bring Narendra Modi government's Digital India vision to fruition.
"It's a government-wide initiative to re-engineer business processes," said Sharma, who has a reputation of turning up promptly at 9:00 am for work.
The focus is on better citizen service delivery using technology and the department of information technology is the co-ordinating agency for the Digital India plan.
"He spends time and effort on understanding technology and not just managing it," said Lalitesh Katragadda, former country head of products at Google India . "One thing that makes Google successful is that the leadership understands technology. And that's the culture Sharmaji is bringing to the game," he said.
The career bureaucrat did not grow up wanting to be a government official. Inspired by renowned physicist Meghnad Saha's career, young Sharma wanted to become a scientist.
He was born in a family of well-to-do farmers, close to Faridabad in a backward village where there was no primary school until a few years ago.
"I had to cycle 10 kilometres everyday to school," recalls Sharmawho went on to study at the Allahabad University where Saha was once a professor. "That changed my life.If I was in Faridabad, things would have been different," said Sharma, who grew up with three brothers and four sisters.
Worried that he would marry someone outside his caste, his family didn't allow him to go abroad for studies and Sharma ended up at the IIT Kanpur to do his masters in Mathematics in 1976.
The next year, he decided to join the civil services and has worked in various capacities in the government.
From his days at IIT and early career as a bureaucrat in what has now come to be known as the licence Raj, much has changed.
India has over 900 million mobile phone connections, millions of Internet users, ecommerce is reaching smaller towns and investors are betting big on the country's growing startups.
The new government is now talking about a massive plan to make use of technology to deliver citizen services.
One of the first steps to make the Digital India initiative successful is to develop policy frameworks and Sharma is already at work on these.
The government has readied a policy that encourages the use of open source software, Sharma told ET earlier this month.

iPhone maker Apple breaks through $700-billion markApple
(Shares of Apple rose 0.8%…)
NEW YORK: Apple, already the world's largest company by market capitalisation, hit a new record value: $700 billion. Shares of the iPhone maker rose 0.8% to $119.59 at 9:35 am in New York on Monday, giving it avaluation of more than $701 billion, a milestone that no other US company has ever reached.
That puts Apple at 1.7 times the capitalisation of the world's second-biggest company, Exxon Mobil. Exxon, which has lost about $43 billion during the five-month oil rout, has a capitalisation of $405 billion.
Confidence in Apple has been growing since the company unveiled larger-screened iPhones in September, followed by slimmer and faster iPads in October. CEO Tim Cook is updating Apple's core products while also pushing users deeper into the company's digital world.
"Given Apple's significant portfolio refresh over the past three months, the lack of innovation from competitors and a constructive spending backdrop in the US market, we believe Apple has opportunity to shine bright this holiday season," Brian White , an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald , said November 24 in a note to investors. Apple is up 48% this year, heading for its sixth straight annual gain.

Apple teams with (RED) campaign to fight AIDSApple launched a version of its App Store featuring exclusive (RED)-branded content, with all money from sales to be donated to the Global Fund to fight AIDS.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Monday teamed with the (RED) campaign founded by U2 singer Bono to raise money to fight AIDS.
The move came as the California-based maker of iPhones , iPads , iPods and Macintosh computers shows deeper support for social and environmental causes under the leadership of chief executive Tim Cook.
It also comes as Silicon Valley technology titans use their smarts, resources and cash to help tackle global woes including Ebola, climate change and overfishing of the seas.
Apple launched a version of its App Store featuring exclusive (RED)-branded content, with all money from sales to be donated to the Global Fund to fight AIDS.
The (RED) App Store will be open through December 7. "Apple is a proud supporter of (RED) because we believe that the gift of life is the most important gift anyone can give," Cook said in a release.
"For eight years, our customers have been helping fight AIDS in Africa by funding life-saving treatments which are having a profoundly positive impact."
Applications in the (RED) App Store include versions of games Angry Birds, Clash of Clans, Farmville, FIFA 15 and Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
Apple also said that on World AIDS Day, held on December 1, the company will donate a portion of every sale at its real-world and online shops to the Global Fund.
On Friday, the company will begin rewarding some purchasers of its products in the United States with special edition (RED) gift cards, with money donated to the Global Fund for each card distributed.
This is the biggest push yet by Apple to raise money for the cause, according to Cook.
"Apple isn't just in the fight to end AIDS," said Bono, who started the Product (RED) campaign in 2006 to raise money to battle HIV/AIDS.
"They are setting a new bar for business, giving $75 million and counting to the Global Fund as part of their partnership with (RED). I couldn't be prouder to work with them."

Lava may buy Nokia’s Chennai unit, will create jobs for thousands

(If a deal is struck, that…)
By Danish Khan & Gulveen Aulakh
NEW DELHI: Fast-growing smartphone maker Lava is said to be in talks to buy Nokia's Chennai handset factory, once the world's biggest but now non-operational. If a deal is struck, that could raise the possibility of thousands of former workers getting a chance at re-employment at the plant that had been regarded as a showpiece of India's manufacturing capabilities.
The two companies have signed a nondisclosure agreement, people familiar with discussions told ET. "Lava's manufacturing team has already visited the plant and has done the assessment. It will make a proposal to Nokia mid-December after taking all aspects into consideration," one of the people said. "The tax issue needs to be sorted out before a final deal is sealed though."
He was referring to the tax dispute between Nokia and the government, which had prevented the Finnish company from transferring the factory to Microsoft as part of a global $7.2-billion deal to sell its devices business to the US company. The tax row is in court and the factory is silent after Microsoft decided to stop using it from November 1 as a contract manufacturer for its devices, putting thousands out of work.
Another person said a top executive of Nokia Finland's M&A team was recently in India to discuss the sale with Lava, which has moved up to the No. 3 spot among smartphone vendors in the July-September quarter from No. 4 in the second quarter, according to IDC. The Noida-based company, headed by co-founder and Chairman & Managing Director Hari Om Rai, was set up in 2009 and sells devices under the Lava and Xolo brand names.
"Nokia has already communicated to Lava that the ongoing tax and lease-related issues are being discussed with the authorities concerned," said the person cited above. "It has asked Lava to continue with the assessment since there are high chances that these issues would get resolved soon."
A Nokia spokesperson said in an email: "With production at Chennai suspended, we would like to see the asset freeze imposed by the tax authorities lifted. This will allow us to explore potential opportunities for sale to a suitable buyer."
Nokia and Lava declined comment on any talks they might be having. While there are no valuation estimates available, the Indian tax department had pegged Nokia's fixed assets including the factory and a few sales offices at Rs 586 crore in the Delhi High Court last December.
"The valuation would have gone down by 10-12% considering depreciation," said the second person quoted above. At its peak, the factory was the world's largest mobile phone manufacturing plant with 8,000 permanent employees working three shifts producing more than 15 million phones a month. ET recently reported that Nokia will renew the factory's licence by the end of November so the machines run occasionally and are kept in working condition, allowing the company to sell it off as a functional unit without too much of a cut in valuation.
A third person said Nokia is also open to leasing out the plant to contract manufacturers. "The plant's machinery can also be used for making other electronic equipment such as tablets or personal computers after some tweaking," he said. Nokia had approached Celkon Mobiles for a possible lease arrangement, said Executive Director Murali Retineni. "We've not given it serious thought," said the Celkon executive.
The person cited above said Celkon may not need the kind of big capacity that the factory offers, given its volumes. Buying the plant, however, makes sense for Lava, among the fastest-growing phone makers in India. It aims to start domestic manufacturing next year due to the rapidly increasing cost of labour in China. Lava has already said it plans to spend Rs 500 crore on local manufacturing operations over three years.
The company was earlier in talks with Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Vivo for setting up a manufacturing unit, but this fell through. The company is hoping the Nokia deal works out but will otherwise set up its own plant, land for which has already been earmarked, people said.
"Being one of the fastest-growing handset vendors, Lava has witnessed growth in both their brands — Lava and Xolo," IDC said in its latest market report on India released on Wednesday.
Lava is set to cross $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) revenue by the end of the current financial year, sharply higher than the Rs 2,909 crore it posted last year. It was the first Indian phone vendor to introduce its own user interface or skin, Hive, riding on the Android OS. Convergence Catalyst's founder analyst Jayanth Kolla said this is a "strong product differentiator" for Lava devices in India.

MS launches first Lumia phone without the Nokia branding at Rs 9 199Microsoft launches first Lumia phone without the Nokia branding at Rs 9,199

“You have to build a brand, something that consumers can identify and like, and want to have that in every single phone they buy,” Microsoft India chairman Bhaskar Pramanik told ET.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Microsoft India chairman Bhaskar Pramanik brushed aside the success of China's Xiaomi and Motorola in India's smartphone market using the exclusive online sale model as unsustainable in the long run, and said it takes a lot more to build a brand and business. "You have to build a brand, something that consumers can identify and like, and want to have that in every single phone they buy," Pramanik told ET. "It's not opportunistic, for a particular price at a particular moment. That's really been the value of the Nokia brand and that's what we want to continue with the Lumia brand."
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, the world's third-largest, and Lenovo-controlled Motorola sell smartphones only through e-commerce site Flipkart.com in India, and this approach has seen them scale the market share charts rapidly. While Xiaomi has sold more than 800,000 units with only two models out in the market, Motorola has sold over two million units from three models and has grabbed a 5% share of the Indian smartphone market in September, according to research firm IDC.
Microsoft, which acquired Nokia's phone business earlier this year, doesn't find a place among the top five smartphone vendors on IDC's list. The company is now looking to revitalise the business, take it all the way down to the grassroots level and make it sustainable over long periods of time. The aim is to create a complete ecosystem which requires distribution, applications and offers a "unique value proposition", Pramanik said.
Talking to ET after the launch of Microsoft's first Lumia-branded Windows smartphone, Pramanik said he wanted it to be "as loved as" the erstwhile Nokia, while stressing that Microsoft is among the most trusted and recognised brands in the world. The US major is in the process of rebranding all Nokia properties, including digital and devices, as Microsoft, but will continue to use the Nokia branding for featurephones.
According to Pramanik, the mobile phone is not just becoming the first device for millions of Indians to access the Internet or conduct transactions, but the only device to do so, making the devices business a perfect fit in the company's 'Mobile First' global strategy.
Having become the new owner of Nokia's handset business, Microsoft's India revenues are split halfway between devices and software & services, with both businesses growing equally fast.
Outlining Microsoft Devices' growth strategy, the division's India managing director, Ajey Mehta, said handsets from Microsoft — including smartphones and Nokiabranded featurephones — will be present across all retail sales channels including online, large-format and smaller stores offline.
"Going forward, possibly we would see a lot more of people who have purely online focusing on general trade, like Xiaomi has launched in the general trade in the last few days," Mehta added.
The software-to-devices company intends to build the Microsoft Lumia brand alongside the Windows Phone ecosystem, as it pushes price points lower in the smartphone space. It launched Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone with a 5-inch screen, 5MP wide-lens camera with five services, including Office Suite, One Drive, Skype and Xbox console titles, inbuilt. It is priced at Rs 9,199.
"We will play the price game, bring products in the affordable segment that are also profitable for us," Mehta said and added that the company will continue to push smartphone prices lower towards the Rs 3,000 levels to regain its market share. It also plans to bring a slew of new and 'powerful' devices in the coming year. According to IDC numbers, Nokia, now under Microsoft, has an 11% share of the overall mobile phone market but has long lost its place among the top five smartphone players led by Samsung and Micromax, with 24% and 20% shares, respectively.

Infosys veteran & Finacle creator Mangipudi Haragopal launches financial services startup FinUNO

Finacle
(“It’s about giving…)
BENGALURU: Mangipudi Haragopal , the man credited with making Infosys' core banking solution Finacle a globally recognised product, has founded a startup that promises "next generation" banking solutions.
Haragopal, who quit Infosys last month after a stint of more than two decades, is currently busy setting up a team of up to eight executives for his US-based startup, FinUNO, which will act as a virtual relationship manager for financial services institutions.
"It's about giving a simple yet fulfilling experience to the consumers of banking and financial services," Haragopal told ET in his first interview after leaving Infosys.
This will be done by leveraging disruptive technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing and big data analytics, he said.
"A dedicated VRM (virtual relationship manager) transcends financial transactions in meeting the social and commerce needs as well of a consumer," said Haragopal. He expects the first offering from his startup by summer next year.
The move comes at a time when Infosys' new CEO Vishal Sikka has tasked his former SAP colleague Michael Reh to help revive the fortunes of Finacle.
Haragopal, 52, has got FinUNO incorporated in the US, where he is in talks with venture capitalists for seed money. He declined to share the quantum of funds he is looking to raise. A person familiar with the matter said he is eyeing seed money of up to $5 million. Haragopal said he is keen to get FinUNO registered in India too.
Of late, Indian information technology companies' core banking platforms, including Finacle, seem to have hit a saturation point due to banks' reluctance to invest in next generation core banking solutions amidst a slowdown and the firms' inability to tap into the large US market.
While Infosys does not share revenues generated from its core banking product, advisory firm NelsonHall estimates that revenues from Finacle have dipped to $297 million by the end of March 2014 from $314 million in 2012. Some experts expect Reh to "reengineer" Finacle by adopting a partnerships model, increasing presence in the mobile banking space and adding insurance domain technology.
"Infosys may aim for a strong ecosystem of partners who can effectively implement Finacle in collaboration," said Mallikarjuna Reddy, principal consultant at JMR Infotech, a Bangalore-based core banking solution provider.
Rachael Stormonth, senior vice president at NelsonHall, said Infosys may also expand Finacle brand to include insurance, something which Mumbaibased TCS has done with its core banking product BaNCS.
Sikka has already told analysts that among other things, he plans to double investments in Finacle, without sharing details. With FinUNO, Haragopal joins a long list of Infosys veterans associated with startups. Fresh from passing on the baton at Infosys, cofounders SD Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan came together again earlier this month to set up an incubator, Axilor Ventures, to mentor and back early-stage ventures with an aim to invest up to $1 million in each startup they pick.
Infosys' former finance heads Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan have also teamed up to set up a technology investment fund, Exfinity Fund, which raised .`125 crore in August. According to trade body Nasscom, about 800 startups are set up in the country every year.

PM favours 3-5 yr biz visas to citizens of member nations26/11
(PM Narendra Modi also called…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to reach out to India's South Asian neighbours, while at the same time marking the anniversary of the November 2008 terrorist attack that allegedly originated from militant groups based in Pakistan.
"Today, as we remember the horror of the terror attack in Mumbai in 2008, we feel the endless pain of lost lives. Let us work together to fulfil the pledge we have taken to combat terrorism and trans-national crimes," Modi said at the inaugural session of the 18th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit in Kathmandu on Wednesday, addressing fellow leaders, including Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif. He suggested that all states should be sensitive to each other's security for stability in the region.
Modi unveiled his vision for a barrier-free South Asia, including three-five year business visas to citizens of member nations. He also called for better connectivity and infrastructure, more trade, relaxed visa regimes and the use of space technology for mutual benefit as the leader of the dominant power in the region. The move on business visas could have far-reaching impact, if adopted. "Let's make it even easier for our businesses through a Saarc Business Traveller Card," he said.
Pakistani government officials, however, appeared sceptical about the business visa proposal. "While this is a noble idea, the Indian government has not been honouring past visa agreements with Pakistan, making it difficult for our businessmen and pilgrims to visit this country. Past agreements should be honoured," a Pakistani official told ET, indicating that reciprocity may not be in the offing in the near future.
Modi's remarks at the inauguration came after Sharif said his country preferred a dispute-free South Asia. He also said, "We must jointly fight poverty, malnutrition" rather than each other."
Sharif's speech was seen as an effort to send a message to India, which had cancelled foreign secretary level dialogue after Pakistani diplomats met with the Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat Conference grouping. A Sharif-Modi meeting may take place after the Pakistani premier put the ball in India's court and Delhi responded by saying meaningful dialogue was only possible on specific issues.
"Samay ki maang hai ke hum pass pass bhi hain, lekin saath saath bhi ho (The need of the hour is that we don't just remain near each other, but be together as well)," Modi said in a brief shift to Hindi during his 24-minute speech in English.

BMW launches 5th Gen M3 sedan  new M4 coupe in IndiaBMW launches 5th Gen M3 sedan, new M4 coupe in India
PTI     Greater Noida   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 13:53 IST
The M3 sedan is the fifth generation model and priced at Rs 1.19 crore
BMW has launched the next generation M3 sedan and all new M4 Coupe in India, priced at Rs 1.19 crore and Rs 1.21 crore, respectively (ex- showroom Delhi).
Both the models would be available across the country as completely built up units, the German luxury car maker said on Thursday. While the M3 is the fifth generation model, M4 Coupe is a brand new car.
"A new chapter in the fascinating history of high performance sports cars from BMW M GmbH is beginning," BMW Group India President Philipp von Sahr told reporters at the launch event.
The cars deliver superior performance with a newly developed six cylinder engine and light weight design, he added.
The company, which slipped behind German rivals Audi and Mercedes in the Indian market last year, is looking to recover ground by investing in the brand and new launches.
BMW India, which is wholly-owned subsidiary of the Germany's BMW Group, currently produces various vehicles at its Chennai facility including the 1 Series, 3 Series, X1 and X3.
Earlier this week, the company had launched an updated version of its M5 sedan in India, priced at Rs 1.35 crore (ex -showroom Delhi). Taking a further step in sustainable mobility, BMW India also plans to introduce hybrid car i8 in 2014.
Besides, it is also looking to expand dealer network in the country by 2015-end by taking the overall number to 50 from 37 currently.

Rehman Malik claims to have proof of ISIS presence in PakistanBy: Press Trust of India | Islamabad |
Posted: November 27, 2014 2:22 pm | Updated: November 27, 2014 2:32 pm
Pakistan’s former interior minister Rehman Malik has claimed that he had documentary evidence about the presence of the dreaded Islamic State terror group in the country. He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should sensitise the world community about the rapid penetration of IS into several countries and use the forum of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) for setting up of an international desk for sharing information about the group’s activities.
“I have solid proofs that Daish (or IS) has established its contacts with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and it is quite possible that one of Taliban leaders will soon be named as its chief in Pakistan,” Malik was quoted as saying by a newspaper. When asked about documents he possessed, the Pakistan People’s Party leader said: “I will brief the nation about documentary proofs and will make them public in a couple of days.”
He expressed disappointment over the PML-N government’s response to the threat and said it was paying no heed to track down the IS terrorists in the country. “Instead of remaining in a state of denial, the government should take serious action before Daish spreads like Talibanisation did and pushes the country into another phase of terrorism,” he said.
Malik said the country had already suffered a lot as thousands of children, men, women and troops had lost their lives in terrorist attacks. He called upon the government to take the nation into confidence on actions it had taken after reports about presence of IS flags and banners in several Pakistani cities. He asked Prime Minister Sharif to set up a task force to prevent IS from taking root in the country.
In recent weeks, some Taliban rebels and a few militant groups have pledged allegiance to the IS. However, Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan said that there was no threat of IS in Pakistan. IS or ISIS is an al-Qaeda splinter group and it has seized hundreds of square miles in Iraq and Syria. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group, declared himself as Caliph renamed the ISIS as Islamic State. Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from the group, chiding it for its lack of teamwork in its aggressive, brutal expansion.

Ferguson riots: Streets quiet after two nights of racial unrestBy: Reuters | Ferguson |
Posted: November 27, 2014 9:59 am | Updated: November 27, 2014 2:51 pm
The streets of Ferguson, Missouri, were mostly quiet on Wednesday after two nights of racially charged unrest following a U.S. grand jury decision to clear a white policeman over the killing of an unarmed black teenager.
A couple of dozen protesters huddled in the falling snow outside police headquarters in the St. Louis suburb, in sharp contrast to the hundreds who took the streets on Monday in a night of arson, looting, sporadic gunfire and clashes with police that ended in more than 60 arrests.
Another 45 protesters were taken into custody in smaller, more isolated bursts of lawlessness that erupted after dark on Tuesday. The decision of the St. Louis County grand jury to clear officer Darren Wilson of criminal charges in the August 9 slaying of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked a wave of demonstrations across the country, culminating in more than 400 arrests.
The case has exposed long-running strains in Ferguson between its predominantly black residents and a white-dominated political and law enforcement establishment while renewing a debate about race relations in the United States as a whole. Still, with freezing weather hitting much of the nation on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, demonstrations around the country dwindled on Wednesday in size and intensity.
Nowhere were waning passions in the street more pronounced than in and around Ferguson itself, where some 2,200 National Guard troops called out by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon were backing up local police. “The ramped-up presence and action of the Missouri National Guard has been helpful,” Nixon said on Wednesday after facing criticism for not deploying enough troops in the immediate hours after the grand jury’s decision was announced Monday evening.
About a half-dozen members of the clergy, wearing orange vests, also milled about on Wednesday night among the protesters, most of whom stood quietly in the snow, as passing motorists occasionally honked their horns in support.
RACIAL TENSIONS EXPOSED
Tensions between police and black Americans have simmered for decades, with many blacks feeling the U.S. legal system and law enforcement authorities do not treat them fairly.
In Washington, President Barack Obama has tried to keep a lid on the anger. He remained cautious in his comments in the immediate aftermath of the Ferguson shooting, but has been more expansive in recent days including remarks at the White House after the grand jury’s decision. On Monday he said deep distrust exists between police and minorities and that “communities of color aren’t just making these problems up.”
St. Louis police said three people were arrested at a protest near City Hall on Wednesday in which activists continued…

Gold  silver prices fall on weak global cuesGold, silver prices fall on weak global cues

Extending losses for the third straight session, gold prices on Thursday fell by Rs 100 to Rs 26,780 per ten gram at the bullion market in the national capital on sustained selling by stockists, influenced by a weakening global trend.
Silver also eased by Rs 450 to Rs 36,750 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial users and coin makers.
Marketmen said stockists selling in line with a weakening global trend, where gold fell to the lowest level in a week, mainly pulled down gold prices .
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by one per cent to $1,185.82 an ounce and silver by 2.1 per cent to $16.16 an ounce, the biggest since November 14.
Besides, sluggish domestic demand at current levels and a weak trend at futures market also dampened the sentiment.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity were down by Rs 100 each to Rs 26,780 and Rs 26,580 per ten gram, respectively, while sovereign held steady at Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram in scattered deals.
In line with gold, silver ready dropped by Rs 450 to Rs 36,750 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 560 to Rs 36,060 per kg. Silver coins also plunged by Rs 1,000 to Rs 62,000 for buying and Rs 63,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

India Inc lauds AG view on not filing appeal in Vodafone caseIndia Inc lauds AG view on not filing appeal in Vodafone case
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 16:26 IST
The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has welcomed Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi's advice to the Income Tax (I-T) department not to file an appeal against the Bombay High Court judgment in the Vodafone tax case.
"FICCI welcomes the decision of the government not to appeal against the judgment relating to the transfer pricing tax issue involving Vodafone," FICCI president Sidharth Birla said in a statement on Thursday.
"The well-considered decision of the government of not contesting the judgment will have a far reaching positive impact and support actualization of investment plans for India," he added.
"India has the largest number of transfer pricing disputes globally and quick resolutions are critical to building investor confidence. Fair taxation principles and administration, and clear dispute resolution when necessary, soothe a key anxiety amongst all investors," FICCI said.
Attorney General Rohatgi on Wednesday said that he has asked the I-T department not to appeal against the high court ruling that Vodafone is not liable to pay an income tax demand of Rs 3,200 crore in a case relating to transfer-pricing.
Transfer-pricing describes the practice of arm's length pricing for transactions between group companies based in different countries to ensure that a fair price is levied.
The government's highest law official also said he was in agreement with the view taken by the chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in the matter.
"I have concurred with the view of the CBDT chairman," Rohatgi said.
Last month, the court had ruled in favour of the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone Group in two cases of transfer-pricing adjustments of over Rs 4,500 crore made by the income tax department.
Last week, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of the Indian arm of Royal Dutch Shell on two transfer-pricing adjustments made by the income tax department-of Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 3,000 crore for 2007-08 and 2008-09, respectively-to the taxable income of Shell India Markets Pvt Ltd (SIMPL).
The tax orders passed against Shell and Vodafone relate to alleged undervaluing of shares issued by the Indian subsidiaries to their parent companies.

Hong Kong student leader banned from cleared protest siteBy: Agence-France Presse | Hong Kong |
Posted: November 27, 2014 3:58 pm | Updated: November 27, 2014 5:37 pm
Hong Kong protest leader Joshua Wong was on Thursday banned from a flashpoint protest site where he was arrested this week during clashes when authorities moved in to clear the pro-democracy camp. Some 150 protesters were taken into custody when authorities tore down barricades and tents in Mongkok district, in a major blow to the movement that has paralysed part of the city for nearly two months.
Wong, aged just 18 but a key figure in the movement calling for free elections for the city’s leadership, said he has been banned from the area- one of three protest sites- for two months as part of his bail conditions. He has been charged with obstructing the work of police officers. “I can’t go to the Mongkok area before January 14. I feel mystified,” he told reporters outside the city’s Kowloon City Magistrates’ Court.
His lawyer Michael Vidler told the court that the “motivation for this prosecution is political”. Both he and Wong were pelted with eggs as they left the courthouse, as tensions run high in the southern Chinese city over the future of the struggling pro-democracy movement.
Protesters have been calling for full democratic reforms that would allow them to choose who to run for the city’s top post. Beijing says all candidates to become Chief Executive must be vetted by a loyalist committee. The protests on a few occasions drew tens of thousands of people onto the streets.
But the crowds have dwindled markedly in recent weeks as the movement has struggled to maintain momentum and commuters have grown weary of transport disruptions. A main road in Mongkok was reopened Wednesday following a two-day operation that saw chaotic scuffles between police and protesters.
Mongkok, a major shopping district on the Kowloon peninsula, has been the scene of some of the most violent clashes since the sit-ins began at three separate intersections in the city on September 28.

Another Kim takes centerstage: N Korean leader s sister now a senior official in the ruling Workers  partyBy: Associated Press | South Korea |
Posted: November 27, 2014 3:35 pm | Updated: November 28, 2014 12:49 pm
North Korea has revealed that leader Kim Jong Un’s younger sister is a senior official in the ruling Workers’ Party, strengthening analysts’ views that she is an increasingly important part of the family dynasty that runs the country.
State media on Thursday referred to Kim Yo Jong as a departmental vice director within the party’s Central Committee.
Analysts say the mention could signal her growing role in supporting her brother’s authoritarian rule. The siblings’ late father, former leader Kim Jong Il, was seen as relying on his own sister during his 17-year rule.
Outsiders closely study North Korea’s opaque ruling power dynamics for clues about a secretive country that pursues nuclear weapons and threatens its neighbors with war.
The Korean Central News Agency first referred to Kim Yo Jong as a senior official in the Central Committee in March, but this is the first time state media have specified her role.
Yang Moo-jin, a North Korea expert at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said a departmental vice director is roughly equivalent to a vice Cabinet minister. The announcement of Kim Yo Jong’s role shows that the government is now confident enough to introduce her as an important part of its leadership, Yang said.
Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute, said Kim Yo Jong is likely to have greater influence than other departmental vice directors because she is a member of the Kim family. In establishing his sister in a senior role in the ruling party, Kim Jong Un is further strengthening his control of North Korea’s power elite, Cheong said.
Since taking over North Korea’s leadership following the death of his father in 2011, Kim Jong Un has removed key members of the old guard. The process was highlighted by the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, the husband of Kim Jong Il’s influential sister. Jang, who was once considered the second most powerful man in North Korea, was accused of treason.
Kim Jong Un’s most influential advisers now appear to be Choe Ryong Hae, the secretary of the party’s Central Committee who recently visited Russia as a special envoy, and Hwang Pyong So, vice marshal of the Korean People’s Army.

In the broader space, Crompton Greaves fell more than 6 percent as large deals of 5.3 crore shares or 8.48 percent equity traded on the exchanges at Rs 192.15-197 apiece in early trade. Avantha Holdings says this is a onetime transaction by the holding company to reduce debt.

Atul Auto  zoomed 16 percent to Rs 528, making a fresh all-time high, a day after Goldman Sachs Asset Management Company bought 2.83 lakh shares in the firm.
Atul is a manufacturer of three-wheelers of a number of makes: pick-ups, passenger rickshaws, cargo carriers, delivery vans, etc, and has been on investors’ radar for sometime after clocking superior sales growth.
Between fiscal years 2009 and 2014, the company’s volumes have grown at 40 percent compounded growth while the overall three-wheeler segment has grown at 7 percent, on the back of an expanding dealership network, increasing geographical presence across the country, and a few very successful models, according to an ICICI Direct report.
This has resulted in its market share in the three-wheeler segment, long dominated by the likes of Bajaj, increase to 7.7 percent from 2 percent five years ago.
In September, the company was in the news after it said it had identified about 70 acres of land near Ahmedabad in Gujarat for expansion purposes and had acquired 34 acres.
The company is working on launching a new petrol engine to power its vehicles, and expects volumes to grow by 20 percent, its VP Finance Jitendra Adhia told CNBC-TV18 in an interview today .
In fiscal year 2014, Atul posted profits of Rs 29.79 crore on sales of Rs 431.79 crore. In 2009, this stood at Rs 0.49 crore and Rs 125 crore.
On the back of the increase in sales and volumes, the stock has risen 26-fold since November 2009, when it stood at Rs 17.45.

Why online grocery shopping is the next big thing in Indian e-commerce26
5
Mumbai: Put off by snarled city traffic and a shortage of parking, more Indians are shopping for groceries online, helping e-tailers like Bigbasket.com and Localbanya.com turn in profits while supermarkets are struggling.
The online grocers benefit from low overheads, as they store goods in warehouses outside big cities where commercial rents are sky-high. Some like Bigbasket.com can also charge more for certain items than traditional supermarkets, which means even more profits in a country where all food retailers enjoy margins as high as 20 per cent on rice and other staples.
Bigbasket.com director Ganesh Krishnan said the company would turn a profit this year, just three years after it was set up. By contrast, analysts say supermarkets like More, owned by the Aditya Birla Group, and Reliance Industries Ltd's Reliance Fresh are struggling to attract enough customers to make a profit as they compete with the small neighbourhood stores where most people buy food. Both conglomerates declined to give figures for their supermarket operations.
Put off by snarled city traffic and a shortage of parking, more Indians are shopping for groceries online.
#online grocery shopping #internet #e commerce
"You can go shop at a Walmart or Tesco in the US and UK and they have parking. You can take the shopping carts right up to your car, so it's smooth," Krishnan told Reuters. "In India, none of this exists."
Densely populated cities have proved attractive for web grocers in Asia. Analysts estimate online sales of fresh produce in China could quadruple to 40 billion yuan ($6.5 billion) in five years from about 11.5 billion yuan in 2013.
Overall, e-commerce is rapidly growing in India, fuelled by an expanding middle class and better web access, and the potential for online grocers in particular is huge.
Most food shopping in India is done in cramped groceries that offer limited variety. Urbanites also frequent supermarkets, but e-grocers are becoming more popular as more shoppers are willing to pay extra for the convenience of not dealing with traffic and parking problems.
Sales of food and groceries currently account for more than two-thirds of all retail sales, consultants Technopak say, and the value of these sales is expected to nearly double to $686 billion by 2020.
Investors are taking note. In September, Helion Ventures and Zodius Capital led a funding round that raised 2 billion rupees ($32.6 million) for Bigbasket.com. Rival Localbanya is also looking to raise a similar amount to expand nationwide, its co-founder Amit Bhartiya said.
By running their own delivery networks, and warehousing outside the city, e-grocers are better able to control costs: analysts say the operating costs of traditional supermarkets are higher when you factor in rent and utility bills, for example.
Bigbasket.com, which started out in December 2011, currently has about 2,20,000 active customers Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. It plans to launch in Pune, Delhi and Chennai in the next three months, highlighting just how quickly online grocers can grow compared to traditional supermarket chains.
"Where brick and mortar grocery in India fails to muster scale, online can do it very, very quickly just by the sheer opportunity of reaching a number of people with much less investment," said Harminder Sahni, managing director of consultants Wazir Advisors.

Sensex rises 53 pts ahead of GDP data  RBI policySensex rises 53 pts ahead of GDP data, RBI policy
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 16:58 IST

In choppy trade, the benchmark Sensex on Thursday rose 53 points on the back of gains in shares of BHEL, Hindalco and Infosys ahead of quarterly GDP data release on Friday and the RBI's monetary policy review next week.
Besides, covering-up of short positions by speculators on expiry of monthly derivative contracts supported buying activity, brokers said.
The BSE Sensex after beginning higher at 28,397.80, struggled to maintain higher levels and slipped to intra-day low of 28,307.58. However, late buying by overseas funds and retail investors helped the index rebound and close with a gain of 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 28,438.91. During the session, it touched a high of 28,498.30.
The gauge had gained 48.14 points on Wednesday.
Easing inflation and falling global crude oil prices, which plunged to four-year low as hopes for output cuts by OPEC faded, raised hopes of a rate cut by RBI at its December 2 monetary policy review, traders said.
Out of the 30-share index, stocks that closed with gains were led by BHEL, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Power, Hindalco, Infosys, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Cipla and Dr Reddy's.
The 50-share NSE index Nifty, after reacting to alternate bouts of buying and selling, finally closed at 8,494.20, up 18.45 points, or 0.22 per cent over previous closing.
Intra-day, it touched high 8,506.75 and low of 8,456.35.
Sectorwise, the BSE IT index gained the most by rising 1.08 per cent, followed by Power 0.78 per cent, Healthcare 0.64 per cent and Auto 0.35 per cent among others.
Buying activity also gathered momentum in midcap and smallcap stocks with both indices rising up to 0.55 per cent.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth net Rs 181.46 crore on Wednesday, as per provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Affordable homes: Bank can lend Rs 10 lakh against infrastructure bondsDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Reserve Bank of India  allowed banks to extend loans up to Rs 10 lakh to individuals against long-term infrastructure bonds issued by them, thus easing loan norms for low-cost housing.
“In order to provide liquidity to retail investors in such bonds, it has been decided that banks can extend loans to individuals against long-term bonds issued by them,” Reserve Bank of India  said in a notification.
Such loans, the Reserve Bank of India said should be subject to “a ceiling, say, Rs 10 lakh per borrower, and tenure of loan should be within the maturity period of the bonds”.
However, banks are not permitted to lend against such bonds issued by other banks.
Earlier, Reserve Bank of India  had exempted long term bonds raised by banks from mandatory regulatory norms like CRR and SLR if the money raised is used for funding of such projects.
The Reserve Bank of India  , in its communication addressed to the banks, said boards of the banks should lay down a policy in this regard prescribing suitable margins, purpose of the loan and other safeguards.
In the Union Budget 2014-15 presented on July 10 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, government had said that “banks will be encouraged to extend long term loans to infrastructure sector with flexible structuring to absorb potential adverse contingencies, sometimes known as the 5/25 structure”.
In July, Reserve Bank of India  had said that affordable housing is a segment of the economy which both require long term funding and is of critical importance and said it will ease the way for banks to raise long term resources.
“This will help promote both growth and stability, as well as improve the supply side,” Reserve Bank of India had said.

Sebi Rejigs Supervision; Stricter Checks on Risk Companies
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 27, 2014 18:43 (IST)
Banks Asked to Cover Jan Dhan Accounts, RuPay Cards Gap
New Delhi: To help it better regulate the marketplace and strengthen its surveillance system, regulator Sebi has decided to adopt a supervision model based on risk levels for various market entities including brokers and mutual funds.
Under the new model, various market entities would be divided into four groups -- very low risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk -- and the quantum of surveillance and number of inspections would increase as per the risk level.
This new supervision regime has been put in in place as per recommendations of an independent global consultant and the subsequent suggestions made by an internal task force at Sebi, while taking into account practices followed by many overseas regulators, a senior official said.
The move would help the existing surveillance system take care of most of the smaller offences, so that the investigation resources are utilised more effectively to tackle serious violations in the market place.
The new model would follow four distinct steps -- assessing the risk posed by a market entity, assigning 'risk and impact rating' to it, determine the supervisory risk rating score and then adopt a suitable supervisory approach.
The overall risk profile of an entity would be computed as a function of two components -- business or activity specific risk and the impact risk arising out of default or failure.
The supervisory approach based on risk levels is being implemented in a phased manner, the official said, while adding that the first step towards its implementation has been achieved with finalisation of a report in this regard that provides necessary guidance to the supervisory divisions to formulate policies for supervision and inspections in future.
Earlier in September, Chairman U K Sinha had told PTI that Sebi was working on this risk-based supervision model while becoming the first financial sector regulator in the country to have done a study of its own regulatory impact.
The Sebi chief had further said that specific metrics would be put in place to determine the risk that every firm poses to the system and based on which enforcement actions can also be initiated.
While the existing supervision model followed by Sebi has been very effective, it was found that the approach was 'loosely risk based', where no formal risk ratings were assigned to regulated intermediaries and the current resource allocation approach did not allow for an assessment of risk concentration across all regulated intermediaries.
The new supervisory approach is based upon overall risk assessment of the intermediary rather than on individual factors such as turnover, complaints, penalties, etc.
"The total number of inspections per intermediary will increase and the new approach would involve a combination of comprehensive, thematic and off-site monitoring for inclusive supervision of the intermediaries," the official said.

British mystery novelist PD James dies aged 94British mystery novelist PD James dies aged 94

Mystery writer PD James, who brought realistic modern characters to the classical British detective story, has died, her publisher said. She was 94.
Publisher Faber and Faber said James died Thursday at her home in Oxford, southern England.
James' books, many featuring sensitive sleuth Adam Dalgliesh, sold millions around the world, and most were just as popular when adapted for television.
Faber, James' publisher for more than 50 years, said in a statement that she had been "so very remarkable in every aspect of her life, an inspiration and great friend to us all. It is a privilege to publish her extraordinary books. Working with her was always the best of times, full of joy. We will miss her hugely."
Because of the quality and careful structure of her writing - and her elegant, intellectual detective Dalgliesh - she was at first seen as a natural successor to writers like Dorothy L Sayers, creator of Lord Peter Wimsey in the between-the-wars "Golden Age" of the mystery novel.
But James' books were strong on character, avoided stereotype and touched on distinctly modern problems including drugs, child abuse and nuclear contamination.
"She has pushed, as a modernist must, against the boundaries of the classical detective story," critic Julian Symons once wrote.
"The greatest mystery of all is the human heart," James said in a 1997 interview, "and that is the mystery with which all good novelists, I think, are concerned. I'm always interested in what makes people the sort of people they are."
Although there was nothing remotely "genteel" about PD James' writing, she was criticized by some younger writers of gritty urban crime novels.
They accused her of snobbery because she said she liked to write about middle-class murderers, preferably intelligent and well-educated, who agonize over right and wrong and spend time planning and justifying their crimes. Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard, hero of more than a dozen of James' novels, is a decidedly gentlemanly detective, who writes poetry, loves jazz and drives a Jaguar.
Phyllis Dorothy James was born in Oxford on August 3, 1920. Her father was a tax collector and there was not enough money for her to go to college, a fact she always regretted.
Even as a child, she said, she had been interested in death. As a little girl, when someone read "Humpty Dumpty" to her, she asked, "Did he fall or was he pushed?"
But she did not start producing her mysteries until she was nearly 40, and then wrote only early in the morning before going to the civil service job with which she supported her family. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, had returned from the war mentally broken and remained so until his death in 1964.
"It was a late beginning for someone who knew from early childhood that she wanted to be a novelist, and, looking back, I can't help regret what I now see as some wasted years," James wrote in a 1999 autobiography, "Time to Be Earnest."
Phyllis White's career took her from the National Health Service to the Home Office, where she worked in the forensic science department and then the criminal law department.
Her first novel, "Cover Her Face," was published in 1962 under her maiden name and was an immediate critical success, but she continued to work in the Home Office until 1979.
In 1980, with the publication of her eighth book, "Innocent Blood," her small but loyal following exploded into mass, international popularity.
"Monday, I was ticking along as usual, and by Friday I was a millionaire," she once said.
The Crime Writers' Association gave PD James its Diamond Dagger award in 1987 for lifetime achievement, and in 2005 the National Arts Club honored James with its Medal of Honor for Literature.
Her work was not confined to the mystery genre. Her 1992 science fiction novel "The Children of Men," about a dystopian future in which humanity has become infertile, was turned into a critically praised 2006 movie by Alfonso Cuaron. In 2013 she published "Death Comes to Pemberley," introducing a murder mystery into Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice."
Queen Elizabeth II made her Baroness James of Holland Park in 1991, in recognition of her work as a governor of the BBC, a position she held from 1988 to 1993.
James was a member of the Church of England's Liturgical Commission and expressed doubts about the modernized Book of Common Prayer, the 16th- and 17th-century Anglican service book famous for the beauty of its language.
"Something vital is lost, surely, when 'Let not your heart be troubled' is translated as 'Do not be worried and upset,'" she said.
James was often spoken of as an heir to Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, icons of the classic British mystery, but her admirers thought she transcended both.
"Doyle and Christie are genre writers - clever, yes, but one must suspend considerable disbelief right from the get-go when reading their works," said author Anita Shreve. "No such acrobatics are necessary with a James novel."

However, banks are not permitted to lend against such bonds issued by other banks. Earlier, RBI had exempted long term bonds raised by banks from mandatory regulatory norms like CRR and SLR if the money raised is used for funding of such projects.
The RBI, in its communication addressed to the banks, said boards of the banks should lay down a policy in this regard prescribing suitable margins, purpose of the loan and other safeguards.
In the Union Budget 2014-15 presented on July 10 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, government had said that "banks will be encouraged to extend long term loans to infrastructure sector with flexible structuring to absorb potential adverse contingencies, sometimes known as the 5/25 structure".
In July, RBI had said that affordable housing is a segment of the economy which both require long term funding and is of critical importance and said it will ease the way for banks to raise long term resources.
"This will help promote both growth and stability, as well as improve the supply side," RBI had said.

No dilution of MNREGA scheme: Govt
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said in Rajya Sabha.

The government today allayed apprehensions over continuance or dilution of MNREGA scheme launched during the previous UPA rule and said all necessary funds have been released.
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said in Rajya Sabha. He was replying to a Calling Attention motion on the reported move of the government to bring about changes in the MGNREGS by restricting the area of work and reducing the wage component of the fund allocation.
Several members including former Rural Development Jairam Ramesh had sought a categorical reply from the Minister on whether the NDA government proposes to amend the Act and referred to a reported circular, which said the programme would be restricted to 2,500 blocks. Singh clarified that the programme would rather be "intensified" in the 2,500 blocks and would continue in rest of the country.
He said that in this fiscal alone the Centre has already made a payment of Rs 23,000 crore as against the demand of Rs 34,000 crore. During the last financial year, the demand was Rs 33,000 crore. The Minister also refuted allegations of some states being denied funds under the programme, saying funds are released only after audit reports are received from the states. In this regard, he said that funds to Odisha would be released in two days since his ministry received relevant documents only two days back.
Singh said that reports from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are still awaited. Acknowledging that loopholes must be plugged, he emphasised on proper execution of the scheme to eliminate corruption. Citing Tripura, he said that the state excelled well in implementing the programme, Singh said few other states have also performed well in this regard. He also assured that the 60:40 ratio on labour and material for the programme would not be diluted.
Targeting the government over its reported move to bring changes in MNREGA, opposition members said it seems to be trying to wind up the ambitious rural job guarantee scheme launched by the UPA. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) enacted in 2005 aims to provide 100 days of work to unskilled poor people living in rural areas.

Narendra Modi govt says never promised to bring black money back in 100 daysDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
The Narendra Modi government today insisted in Lok Sabha that it had never claimed that all the black money stashed abroad would be brought back within 100 days even as opposition continued to target it over the issue.
Contesting the opposition charge in this regard, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu cited Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Lok Sabha election manifesto which said a task force would be set up to deal with the problem of black money.
“We are not so immature to say we will bring back entire black money in 100 days,” Naidu said while intervening in a debate on black money.
His comment came in response to attack by opposition which said BJP leaders had promised to bring back black money within 100 days of coming to power and questioned why it did not happen as six months had elapsed.
Naidu said the BJP election manifesto stated that if voted to power, the government will minimise the scope for corruption and set up a task force for tracking down or bringing back black money. “The process of bringing back black money will be put in motion,” he said.
Listing out the measures taken by the BJP government to deal with the black money menace, Naidu said whenever 100 days is said, it means “action will be initiated within 100 days”.
He claimed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had first talked about 100 days with respect to unearthing of black money when he made a statement in Parliament in July 2009.
Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said people had trusted the BJP’s election campaign of bringing back the money stashed abroad and hence the government should give an assurance in the House when the money would be brought back.
“Youth of the country thought they will get Rs 15 lakh. You sold lies to people. The government has to inform Parliament when they will bring the money back,” Yadav said.
Yadav said that funds should be brought back as soon as possible since the account holders are withdrawing money.
He demanded that the government say it in the House how long it will take to disclose the full list of account holders and how much money is stashed abroad.
Naidu said it was “painful” for him to hear from the opposition slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and outlined that even the Finance Minister of the previous UPA government did not disclose the name of account holders in foreign banks.
He invited the opposition to come out with better ideas as to how to deal with the black money menace.
“We should take quickest possible action,” he said while seeking opposition support for government action.
Lashing out at opposition, Naidu said the Supreme Court had directed the then UPA government in 2011 to take steps to deal with funds stashed abroad, but no steps were taken.

RBI allows JustDial to raise foreign shareholding to 75%RBI allows JustDial to raise foreign shareholding to 75%
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 20:53 IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed domestic search engine Just Dial to raise the foreign shareholding limit to a maximum of 75 per cent of its paid-up capital under the portfolio investment scheme (PIS).
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs)/Registered Foreign Portfolios Investors (RFPIs) can now invest up to 75 per cent (revised from earlier limit of 49 per cent) of the paid-up capital of Just Dial Limited under PIS, RBI said in a notification.
The decision to raise such investment limit came after the company passed resolutions at its board of directors' level and a special resolution by shareholders, agreeing to enhance the limit of its equity shares and convertible debentures by FIIs. FIIs held 26.64 per cent shares in the company as of September 30, 2014.
FIIs, NRIs and PIOs (Persons of Indian Origins) can invest in primary and secondary capital markets in India through PIS.
The RBI monitors the ceilings on FII/NRI/PIO investments in Indian companies on a daily basis and has fixed the cut-off points two percentage points lower than the actual ceiling. Just Dial shares on Thursday closed at Rs 1,566.05 per share on the BSE, down 0.27 per cent from the previous close.

Finance Ministry is believed to have suggested to some ministries a reduction of up to 15 percent in their annual budgets for the current financial year.
The move is aimed at cutting the fiscal deficit, which the government wants to contain at 4.1 per cent of GDP, according to government sources. Fiscal deficit during the last financial year was 4.5 percent.
Social sector ministries, which have the largest social spending on schemes like MNREGA, are uncomfortable with this move and a discussion is being held with Finance Ministry, a source said.
The proposal is in line with a practice started two years ago when P Chidambaram was the Finance Minster, the official said. At that time, the cuts were effected to the tune of 20 percent.
Social activists have criticised the government's move to cut allocations for social sector ministries like Ministry of Rural Development, Drinking Water and Sanitation and Panchayati Raj.
They said this will severely affect the implementation of rural job scheme--MNREGA.
"Proposing budget cuts at a time when people are complaining of getting no work or wages and state governments are speaking for fund releases in different parts of the country is illegal, unconstitutional and inhumane," social activist Nikhil Dey said.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) enacted in 2005 aims to provide 100 days of work to unskilled poor people living in rural areas. Rural Development Ministry was allocated a budget of Rs 34,000 crore during the 2014-15 fiscal for the scheme.

Suitors line up for small finance and payment banksSuitors line up for small finance and payment banks
PTI     Mumbai/New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 21:20 IST
With the RBI issuing final licensing norms for small finance and payment banks, a host of potential suitors including Shriram Capital and Muthoot Finance on Thursday evinced initial interest in setting up such niche entities.
However, they will take a final call on applying to RBI for such licences after going through the fineprints of the guidelines, which were released in the evening.
Those having expressed their interest in seeking payment bank license included payment solutions providers Itzcash and Oxigen, business correspondent company Fino, while Muthoot Finance and Shriram Capital may apply for small finance banking licence.
"We will definitely apply for payment banks licence. It is a good beginning. There have been very positive changes in the guidelines but in some we need more clarity," Oxigen Indian Private Limited Founder and Managing Director Pramod Saxena told PTI.
Itzcash Card's Managing director Naveen Surya said,"We are keen on applying for Payment Bank. We could deliver more products and this will also help in improving our portfolio."
Fino's COO and ED Rishi Gupta said the business correspondent company is keen to enter the payment bank fray and is encouraged by the clarity in the final guidelines on factors such as listing and selling of third party products.
NBFC lender Shriram Capital is much more keen on the Small Finance Bank and will be studying the fine print before making an application, its group director G S Sundararajan said.
Gold loans provider Muthoot Finance's director Thomas George Muthoot said the company is interested in applying for small finance banks and will be studying the guidelines.
The SFB is an experiment around the community banking in US and may need time to stabilise, said Ashvin Parekh, who runs an advisory firm, said. He, however, added that one needs to wait and watch regarding the efficacy because of the not so successful experience with the LAB (Local Area Banks).
Parekh expressed concerns over the viability of the Payment Banks which have to depend on fees alone for their revenues, but said companies like those in telecom may be interested.
Ushering in a new era of differentiated banks, the Reserve Bank on Thursday issued final guidelines for licensing of Small Finance Banks (SFB) to serve the marginalised, and Payments Banks (PB) to garner savings and help in remitttances.
The minimum capital requirement for both the sets of banks, introduced to deepen financial inclusion, has been kept at Rs 100 crore and the RBI has allowed a diverse set of promoters to enter the fray.
The SFB will be miniature versions of the currently operational universal banks and will be undertaking all the activities like accepting deposits and lending, but with a focus on the under served people.
The PBs will not be able to lend and have been structured to primarily tap the savings of people and help in the remittances.
Both these two categories of banks trace their roots to an August 2013 discussion paper on banking in the country, which broached the idea of differentiated banks where licenses will be available on tap, rather than the current piece where RBI has issued new licenses for the universal banks once every decade.
At present, apart from the universal banks, we have local area banks and cooperative banks which are operational in the country. Apart from that, there are non bank financial companies (NBFCs) and micro lenders.
In both the types of banks, the RBI has laid thrust on extensive use of technology saying it will help in the ultimate goal of financial inclusion sought to being achieved through the new banks.
The RBI had issued draft guidelines for both the banks on July 17 and then invited comments on the same. A majority of analysts said the RBI has accomodated the views of the industry in the final guidelines, pointing to moves like allowing cross border remittances for PBs.
India Ratings' senior director Ananda Bhoumik said the NBFCs will be keen to enter the SFB business, getting attracted by the liabilities side, while different players like telecom companies and business correspondents will be keen to enter PBs.
The SFBs, which can be promoted by non bank lenders, MFIs and LABs, will serve underserved or unserved population and also small businesses. The PBs will garner the savings and have been given an upper cap of Rs 1 lakh per account. They will also help in remittances across channels like internet banking, mobile banking etc.
The SFB will have to set aside money for CRR and SLR at par with a commercial bank, while the priority sector lending (PSL) piece has been set at 50 per cent. The PBs will have to invest 75 per cent of their deposits in government securities and the remaining will have to be parked with commercial banks for liquidity functions, the RBI said.

Maruti Alto 800 tops quality among entry level cars: StudyMaruti Alto 800 tops quality among entry level cars: Study
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 21:27 IST
Maruti's entry level model Alto 800 ranks highest in the entry compact segment for initial quality, while rival Hyundai's i10 gets the top slot in the compact segment, said a study on Thursday.
According to JD Power 2014 India Initial Quality Study rankings, Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 ranks highest in the entry compact segment with 97 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100), while the company's Swift ranks highest in the premium compact segment with 78 PP100.
In the compact segment, Hyundai i10 ranks highest with 84 PP100, and the Hyundai Xcent ranks highest in entry midsize segment with 86 PP100.
Besides, Honda Brio ranks highest in the upper compact segment, the Ford Ecosport in SUV segment, the Skoda Rapid in the midsize segment and and the Toyota Innova in the MUV/ MPV segment.
The 2014 India Initial Quality Study (IQS) is based on evaluations from 8,429 vehicle owners who purchased a new vehicle between November 2013 and July 2014. The study includes 73 vehicle models from 17 makes. The study was fielded from May 2014 to September 2014 in 30 cities across India.
All problems are summarised as the number of problems per 100 vehicles (PP100). Lower PP100 scores indicate a lower rate of problem incidence and higher initial quality.
According to the study, diesel powered vehicles have become better in terms of quality in India as the number of problems new-vehicle owners are reporting with their diesel vehicles have decreased significantly.
Diesel vehicle sales in India have increased by 16 per cent in 2014, compared with 2010, while initial quality has improved as the number of problems with diesel vehicles have decreased to 96 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100) in 2014 from 148 PP100 in 2010, it added.
Overall, the industry has made significant strides on improving the quality of diesel vehicles, especially on core vehicle systems, JD Power Asia Pacific, Singapore executive director Mohit Arora said.
However, with the development of public transportation in India, coupled with an increase in carpooling, owners are driving fewer kilometers, helping to reduce the number of overall problems with diesel vehicles, he added.
The study, now in its 18th year, measured problems owners experience with their new vehicle during the first two to six months of ownership and examines more than 200 problem symptoms covering eight vehicle categories.
The categories covered in the study being: engine and transmission; vehicle exterior; driving experience; HVAC; features, controls and displays; vehicle interior; seats; and audio, entertainment and navigation.

Modi, who gave a forceful maiden speech at the summit on the need for seamless connectivity, met held one-to-one talks with every Saarc leader except Sharif.

New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday hinted in Lok Sabha at the government considering amending the anti-money laundering and Income Tax laws to get back the black money stashed abroad, admitting that there are weaknesses in them.
While making it clear that there was a need for tax-friendly regime with reasonable taxes, he said there was also need to put the fear of law into the offenders.
This could be done by providing for criminal prosecution and seizing of assets in India of those whose money is stashed abroad illegally so that the money comes back, he said.
While making it clear that there was a need for tax-friendly regime with reasonable taxes, he said there was also need to put the fear of law into the offenders.

Dissatisfied with the Minister's reply to the two-day debate on the black money issue, opposition Congress and TMC members walked out saying the government has failed to fulfil its promise of bringing back the black money in 100 days.
"I admit that there are weaknesses in our law... When the money is caught, we need to bring it back. I know that even SIT is worried about it. The I-T Act has no jurisdiction over those outside (India)," Jaitley said.
He said there was need for power to confiscate the assets in India of those who have been found to be in possession of black money abroad.
"This can be done through changes either in the I-T Act or money laundering act... I have studied the (prevention of) money laundering act. There are weaknesses in that also. Probably we have to change that," he said.
The Minister said the UN Convention has such a provision. "We have to strike fear of criminal prosecution in them so that their money is brought back.. We can continue the political debate on time line for bringing back the black money, but we must understand the procedures involved in it," he told members.
During the debate, Jaitley also said India was moving towards a tax-friendly regime to correct the "bad" image among investors.  In the past few years, India got a bad name from the world of investment that "you are not a tax-friendly regime".
"Our tax system has to be friendly to tax payers, both procedurally and otherwise.  And that is exactly what step by step we are trying to do. The taxation should be reasonable so that the government expenses are met, tax base widened and tax evaders don't have incentive.
"Those who have to pay taxes must pay taxes.  We cannot allow either evasion or avoidance and those who are not liable to pay taxes, by merely raising demand, we cannot generate more taxes.  Such taxes then get stuck up in courts.

NBFCs  MFIs & telcos ready to set up banksDespite benign rates, CP issuances taper off in Nov
The guidelines for small banks put out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday attracted positive response from several non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) who said they would look at setting up small banks.
The response to the guidelines for payment banks was less enthusiastic with potential players indicating the number and value of transactions would need to be very high for the business to make money. “With lending activity out of the purview of payment banks, the viability of the business would be endangered,” Ashvin Parekh, adviser, Ernst and Young, observed.
However, the concept of allowing telecom companies and banks to form joint ventures for payment banks — which would give telcos access to the customer base of banks — was welcomed.
“It can be a win-win situation,” Sanjay Kapoor, former CEO Bharti Airtel, told FE, pointing out that the biggest challenge would be to make it viable. “Transaction charges would have to be increased from the current level of between 1.5% and 2%,” Kapoor said.

Historic trade facilitation deal struck at WTO after consensus on food securityDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
The stage was set on Thursday in Geneva for a multilateral boost to the stagnant global trade. The World Trade Organisation removed, by a special general council resolution, the perceived ambiguity over the permanency of a peace clause for the benefit of developing countries breaching limits set on product-specific support to agriculture. It also approved a protocol on the trade facilitation agreement (TFA), meant to add $1 trillion to the global economy by easing customs rules.
Commerce secretary Rajeev Kher confirmed to FE that the WTO general council at Geneva approved the deal late on Thursday. Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman will make a statement in Parliament soon, he added.
This is the first major deal for trade reform in the WTO’s 19-year chequered history, and was supported by all its 160-member countries.
A July 31, 2014, deadline for finalising the TFA protocol could not be met as India, with support from a tiny group of developing countries, insisting that their concerns on public stockholding for the food security purpose be addressed with the same seriousness as TFA, for the world body’s December 2013 Bali package to be implemented.
What enabled Thursday’s resolution is an agreement between the US and India in the run-up to the G-20 summit at Brisbane in Australia, underlining the perpetual nature of the peace clause till a lasting solution to the vexed issue is found. The ice was broken during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with US President Barack Obama in Washington in late September.
The peace clause ensures that WTO members will not challenge developing countries’ food security programmes at the WTO dispute settlement body until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed on and adopted.
Earlier, there were different interpretations over whether the relevant Bali package provision is of perpetual validity or available only till the WTO’s 11th ministerial conference slated for December 2017. On Thursday,  the general council also agreed to a proposal to fast-track the completion of work on a permanent solution well before the 10th ministerial conference in December 2015, sources here said.
However, to benefit from the ‘peace clause’, India and other developing countries will have to meet many stringent conditions including submission of detailed reports in case of violation or likely violation of the stipulated  domestic support to farm sector.  As per the reporting system, developing countries have to submit on an annual basis details of their aggregate measurement of support (AMS), including the number of beneficiaries of the public stock-holding programme for food security, the relevant laws and rules, the number of crops covered, volume and accumulation of stocks, purchase and release prices, measures aimed at minimising trade distortion, and the amount of food grains distributed.
As per WTO norms for developing countries, ‘trade distorting’ domestic support of items (such as rice and wheat) cannot be higher than 10% of the value of their production. India running a massive food support programme for its millions of poor and implementing a food security law is concerned about this cap. It is also challenging the calculation of domestic support at 1986-88 reference prices citing inflation and currency fluctuation since then, and therefore wants the base year to be changed from 1986-88 to reflect current market realities and inflation adjustment. These will be part of negotiations on the ‘permanent solution’ while an abiding peace clause in force.
Without adjusting for inflation, India’s product-specific supports for rice and wheat in 2010-11 was much higher than the WTO-mandated cap of 10% of the , at 26% and 17.9% of the total output value, respectively, as per a study by Icrier experts Anwarul Hoda and Ashok Gulati.
However, these supports for rice, as per the study, stood at minus 2.87% and that for wheat at minus 10.22% of the respective production values in 2010-11 when calculated on a fully inflation-adjusted basis.
The developed world, including the US, is keen on faster implementation of TFA to boost their sagging economies through international trade, unhindered by red tapism and lethargy at the customs stations.
Following demands from a few members including Argentina, the general council meeting also agreed to give equal prominence to all elements of the Bali work programme for easing world trade and all other areas of the post-Bali work, as given to food security issues and TFA. Another issue was a demand from least developed nations to pursue on a priority basis a package for their benefit.
Clauses and effect:
Deal removes perceived ambiguity over the permanency of a peace clause
Peace clause ensures members will not challenge developing countries’ food security programmes at WTO
Approves a protocol on the trade facilitation, meant to add $1 trillion to global economy by easing customs rules and create 21 million jobs
First major deal for trade reform in WTO’s 19-year history

Names on HSBC list to be made public: FM Jai...Arun Jaitley
(“When media comes to know,…)
NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the government has launched prosecution against several people who figure in the HSBC list of overseas account holders, some of whom are very influential people whose names will become public as prosecution progresses.
The government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list, notices and summons have been sent to them and proceedings are being initiated in the courts, Jaitley said, listing the steps the government has taken to unearth black money. The list has as many as 627 names.
"When media comes to know, it will note that there are influential people on the list," the finance minister said while replying to the debate on black money in the Lok Sabha, adding that 250 of them admitted to holding accounts. He said the government is trying to complete the assessment in these cases by March 31.
The Narendra Modi government has been under pressure to deliver on its poll promise to bring back black money from abroad and reveal the names of foreign bank account holders.
The government has maintained that the names are protected by the secrecy clause under which Germany and France provided information to India and has said that if wrongdoing is found, prosecution will be launched and the names made public through this process.
It cautioned that if the names are revealed without due process, no country will give more information and black money holders will get away.
"This does not mean information will never come out, but how it will come out. We will file cases and in a court, information can become public. If we make it public before that, it is violation of that treaty," the minister said.
He said that if the government made a hasty disclosure, "I will not get any evidence and the account holder will have the last laugh." Jaitley said Indian law cannot be out of sync with international laws, all of which have a confidentiality clause. He cited the case of the proposed Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of the US.
If India does not sign this agreement, then remittances into India and other payments would be subject to a 30% withholding tax and India will also not get information from the US or other countries signing the agreement.
The FM blamed the previous UPA government for not acting on the black money issue, saying it did not set up the special investigation team for three years despite the Supreme Court order. The NDA government formed the SIT in a decision taken at its first cabinet meeting. The finance minister said the government was trying to put in place a tax regime that will encourage compliance.
"Our tax system has to be friendly with taxpayers and that is what we are trying to do step by step," Jaitley said. The government is also renegotiating treaties with other countries to ensure that more information becomes available.
"I admit that there is a weakness in law. If the black money stashed abroad has to come, how will it come? Even the SIT is worried about this," the finance minister said.

How online markets are changing merchants  l...How online marketplaces are changing the lives of thousands of merchants

(The ability to reach out…)
From garages in Mumbai to sari shops in Varanasi, thousands of manufacturers and traders are today tapping a rapidly growing online retail market in India thanks to marketplaces like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon.
The ability to reach out to a nationwide market and lower costs are ensuring a sharp increase in sales for the over 80,000 merchants who sell just on these portals. A survey conducted by research firm Spire Research and Consulting this year showed that for offline retailers selling online, the latter is contributing up to 50% of overall sales.
Next year the online retail market is expected to reach $6 billion (over Rs 37,000 crore) in size. The online multi-category stores are responsible for almost 90% of the sales online, according to industry estimates, which means a bulk of this $6 billion will flow into bank accounts of merchants. No wonder then that online retail is changing the lives of thousands of merchants.
"Five years ago I did not have a job, now my apparel business has grown 15-fold and I am targeting over Rs 1 crore in sales," said Mumbai-based Saumya Gupta, 26, whose apparel brand Ten On Ten sells only through online sites like Flipkart and Snapdeal. There are challenges of course. Inability to increase production capacity at the same pace as demand, issue of returns, and lack of infrastructure are just some of the worries that are tempering merchants' optimism about the sector.
"There are now thousands of sellers in each category, so competition is growing," said Karan Chugh, owner of ethnic wear retail firm Florence Clothing from Surat. But for merchants, like the following six, online retail has meant success and a growth in ambition.
Rahul Agrawal, Chandrakala Enterprisess
Rahul Agrawal did not want to run his family business of distributing Banarasi saris and dress materials the traditional way. After graduating from IIT-Mumbai in 2009, Agrawal worked for a financial research firm in Delhi and then started an online games retailer in 2012. Running the games business helped him realise the potential of India's online retail market.
"With the games site, we faced challenges of procurement, but our sari business already had a strong procurement network," said Agrawal. He gave up his stake in the games business and moved back to Varanasi in 2013 to run the three-decade-old Chandrakala Enterprises. In September that year, he started selling his Banarasi saris on sites like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.
"Online is now contributing to about 25% of our business and could overtake our offline trade within the next two years," said Agrawal, 29. While issues like the inability of weavers to expand production rapidly remain, Agrawal is happy with his decision.
"I would have had to eventually take over the family business but thanks to online retail I am having fun," said Agrawal, who is targeting sales of at least Rs 16 crore this fiscal from online sales.
Yogesh Wadhwa, DMP Carrycases
Yogesh Wadhwa's eight-year-old business of manufacturing laptop bags for original equipment manufacturers ran into rough weather about two years ago when companies like Samsung and Sony decided to stop making laptops. Wadhwa decided to launch his own brand of bags and luggage, Bleu.
"The conventional route would have required a lot of investments, so we thought of going online," said Wadhwa, 43, who started retailing on Amazon about 10 months back. "We put up 10 designs one day and by next morning it was sold out. We realised we had a winner."
Around the time of launching on Amazon, he sold about 1,000 pieces of a toiletry kit on Groupon in one day. "I realised, apart from low prices, customers are attracted to products that are not easily available offline," said Wadhwa.
DMP sells about 150 products on regular days across most major online portals and is targeting about Rs 4 crore online sales this fiscal. "If I had to do this offline I would not have been able to do that without a heavier infusion of capital," said Wadhwa. "We are a totally debt-free company."
Karan Chugh, Florence Clothing
Karan Chugh's family has been running an apparel manufacturing and wholesale business, Majestic Silk, in Surat since 1960 and the family diversified into retail in 2007.
It was when Chugh, 25, started shopping online that he decided to retail the mass market Florence brand of saris and dress materials online.
"The idea was to explore," recalled Chugh, who started with Snapdeal in 2012 and now sells on most top marketplaces. In the first month, Florence sold Rs 5 lakh worth of products, but Chugh could see the steady ramp up in orders.
Within a few months, Chugh started Silk Bazaar, a more premium range priced up to Rs 30,000, just for the online market. With online retail accounting for over 70% of the company's overall sales, he has cut back offline operations from 30 stores to five. He also operates shop-in-shops in Vishal Megamart and at More.

"I am going to request the Finance Minister to give exemption of all the taxes. The buses which are running on the basis of bio fuels will reduce pollution.  All electric vehicles, vehicles on bio gas, bio diesel and ethanol.. we want to encourage them. It is a new technology. For this purpose, we want to give them concession. All are new inventions. We need to make some capital investments in it. We have to reduce the cost as these are going to reduce the pollution in this country," Gadkari noted.

Rahul meets slum dwellers  dares govt to run bulldozer over himRahul Gandhi backs evicted slum dwellers in Delhi
Sidhartha Dutta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 27, 2014
First Published: 23:52 IST(27/11/2014) | Last Updated: 13:15 IST(28/11/2014)

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday visited slum-dwellers of Israeli Camp in Rangpuri Pahari near Vasant Kunj — that was demolished by the forest department on Tuesday — and dared the Delhi government to run a bulldozer over him.
“These people (slum dwellers) are innocent and they should not be rendered homeless. If they want to run a bulldozer here, they should first run it on me,” said Gandhi. “The Congress has always fought for the poor and shall continue to fight for them,” he added.
Gandhi reached the Israeli camp area around 7:30 pm amid a lot of chaos and confusion, triggering almost a stampede-like situation with even his security guards failing to control the crowd. He spent at least 45 minutes in the area, taking stock of the situation and speaking to the residents.
“My grandson was born two weeks ago. He was inside the house when the bulldozer came to carry out the demolition. We pleaded with them to spare our house for the sake of the newborn. But they did not listen to us. Now the baby and his mother are living outside in this cold weather,” said Lal Dori, who works as a daily-wage labourer in Vasant Kunj.
More than 2,000 residents were rendered homeless after the forest department pulled down 500 houses and left a large number of people to spend their nights out in the open.
Many of the affected families had migrated to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and have been living here for the past 20-25 years.
Most of them are daily-wage labourers, with a handful among them working as drivers, maids and some even running small businesses in the vicinity.
“They didn’t even allow us to fetch our belongings from the house. We have lost all our possessions and now have been left to die in the cold. Had it not been for Bal Vikas Dhara (an NGO), we would have starved since yesterday,” said Raheeba, a mother of six children.
Other political parties too were quick to oppose the forcible eviction.
The AAP said the action was taken at the behest of BJP MLA SP Rana with an intention to polarise the atmosphere.
According to sources, L-G Najeeb Jung has indicted the forest department for carrying out the drive without any notice.

Japanese stocks gained ground on Friday as a weaker yen helped exporter stocks, while falling oil prices were seen as likely to stimulate global demand, supporting investor sentiment.
The Nikkei benchmark added 1.0 percent to 17,410.87 by 0125 GMT, and is on course for a monthly gain of around 6 percent. The Nikkei has risen over 10 percent since the Bank of Japan stunned markets with fresh easing on Oct 31.
"Japan is amidst a perfect positive storm," said Stefan Worrall, director of equities cash sales at Credit Suisse.
"The oil price decline is stimulatory to world demand for Japanese exports, and offsets the impact of the weak yen on domestic energy costs."
The weak yen gave a leg up to major export shares. The Japanese currency traded at 118.21 against the dollar by 0115 GMT, near weekly highs of 118.57.
Toyota Motor Corp jumped 1.6 percent and Panasonic Corp gained 0.5 percent, while Honda Motor Co added 1.0 percent.
Oil prices plunged on Thursday after OPEC chose not to cut production despite huge oversupply and prices sliding by a third since June.
With airlines set to benefit from cheaper fuel costs, ANA Holdings Inc was the Nikkei's best performer, jumping 5.3 percent to its highest since March 2011. Japan Airlines Co Ltd also surged 4.0 percent.
On the negative side of the ledger, OPEC's decision did hit Japan's oil production-related shares. Inpex lost 5.0 percent, while Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd fell 2.8 percent.
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products, slowed for a third consecutive month in October, highlighting the challenges facing the economy as it attempts to overcome deflation.
But market participants were unconcerned, emphasising that the Bank of Japan's aggressive easing last month was a pre-emptive move against deflation.
The broader Topix gained 0.9 percent to 1,403.80.
The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.8 percent to 12,778.58.

Amit Shah attacks CongressAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Lauding the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government for making “historic” and “extraordinary” achievements in just six months, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah yesterday said his government has not just made the life of the common man easier but also laid the foundation of a strong India.
Shah also attacked Congress accusing it of making baseless allegations in its bid to tarnish the government’s image and said a party that had ruled the country for 60 years and “throttled democracy” and “pushed the people towards poverty has no right to question” the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) rule on its achievements in a short span of time.
Complimenting the government on completion of six-months in office, Shah claimed it has taken many steps to fulfil the promises made ahead of polls.
“The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has made historic achievements in a short period of six months…Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team has made extra-ordinary achievements. Due to steps taken by the government, the lives of common man has not only just become easy but a foundation of a strong India has been laid,” Shah said in a statement.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief listed a host of achievements of Modi regime including steps to control price rise and inflation, check corruption, generate employment opportunities and steps taken to bring back black money besides working as “Team India” for taking the nation forward.
He also listed the steps for a clean India, improve infrastructure, focus on rural hinterland and improving life of people there, besides steps taken in the interest of youth, women and the elderly.
Hitting out at Congress, Shah charged “the party which despite ruling the nation for 60 years deprived the country from development, forced the people to live in penury, put shackles of unemployment in the hands of youth, tried to strangulate democracy, the same party is now seeking an account of six months of rule.”
He said “an exploitative, repressive and undemocratic party has no right to ask about the account of six months rule of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.”

Govt likely to impose more spending cuts to meet fiscal deficit targetDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
The government is likely to consider imposing further cuts on spending later in the year if tax revenues fall short, in order to meet the fiscal deficit target.
“We will review the situation around January by when the revised estimates for 2014-15 will be finalised. Also, there will be a more realistic estimate of revenue receipts by then. As of now, the fiscal situation seems under control,” said two officials familiar with the development.
The finance ministry had last month re-imposed an austerity drive and called for a 10 per cent cut in non-plan spending, including a ban on five star hotels and first class travel as it grapples to keep the fiscal deficit under check.
In the first half of 2014-15, the Centre’s fiscal deficit shot up to 82.6 per cent of its full year target. Data on the fiscal deficit till October 31 will be released on Friday.
The ministry is already working out Revised Estimates for expenditure for the current fiscal for each ministry and department. “There would be some cuts in allocation in the Budget for ministries based on the exercise,” said the first official.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has till now maintained that the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of the GDP in 2014-15 is daunting but will be achieved. The minister had last month said that higher tax refunds were putting pressure on the fiscal deficit.
“Right now the data we have is for just six to seven months of the fiscal. Traditionally, tax revenues tend to pour in towards the end of the financial year but collections have been low this year,” said one of the officials, adding that non-tax revenue from planned stake sales in ONGC, Coal India and SAIL should help meet the target.

BSE Sensex  Nifty hit new highs ahead of GDP dataMarket Update: Sensex, Nifty hit new highs as rate cut hopes rise on oil price drop
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 18:47 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Stocks continued their upward sprint for the third straight session on Friday with benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)Sensex galloping 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty surging 94.05 points to 8,588.25 as tumbling oil prices strengthened the case for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next week.
Brent crude oil contracts for January settlement were trading around $72/barrel, the lowest level since August 2010. Falling oil price is good news for India, which imports 80 per cent of its requirements. This will also help the country narrow its Current Account Deficit (CAD).
Stocks related to oil like oil marketing companies, airlines, paint makers attracted heavy buying interest.
Shares of banks, automobile makers and realty firms spurted on rising hopes of a rate cut on December 2.
Besides, select NBFCs saw heavy investor interest after RBI yesterday unveiled final guidelines for small finance banks and payments banks.
All eyes are now on quarterly GDP data to be released later on Friday.
The BSE 30-share Sensex resumed better and shot up to log new life time high of 28,822.37. It shed some gains on weak European cues but nevertheless settled at yet another closing peak of 28,693.99, up 255.08 points or 0.90 per cent.
In three days, the index has gained over 355 points.
Similarly, the broader 50-issue NSE Nifty also flared up by 94.05 points, or 1.11 per cent, to register fresh closing peak of 8,588.25. It also hit new intra-trade peak of 8,617.
"Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC's decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week," said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, total investor wealth in Indian stock market intra-day today hit a record high above Rs 100 lakh crore. It settled at over Rs 99,81,550 crore at close, up by over Rs 87,550 crore from Thursday's levels.

Black Friday deals: Here s how to be a smart online shopper todayComments
It's the big date you just cannot afford to forget. And you don't have to be a hardcore shopaholic to feel that adrenaline rush. The annual shopping extravaganza, called Black Friday, is 28th November, and it promises some of the most outlandishly cheap deals the click of a mouse. Big screen TV’s for less than $300 (Rs 18,000), designer bags at 40% discounts, and SLR cameras at the price of cheap point-and-click ones are only a few examples.
But for Indian shopaholics here is one big issue though: These deals are mostly available only in the US. Therefore getting access to these deals means reliance on a relative residing there. But the advent of online shopping and global shipping services means you too now be part of this shopping madness.
Here are a few useful tips and hacks to help you get your hands on the best ‘Black Friday’ deals
1. Cyber Monday: While ‘Black Friday’ is the marquee shopping day when retail stores offer big discounts, don’t lose hope if you miss out. Some of the best deals of the week, especially on electronics, are available on ‘Cyber Monday’ (1st December). Most importantly ‘Cyber Monday’ deals are exclusive to online stores like Amazon and eBay which makes it’s easier to order.
2. Global Shipping: Try to make your purchases from site that offer shipping to India. Sites such as Amazon US, eBay and Newegg ship most of their goods to India and will be upfront with the cost of shipping and customs before you check out. This ensures some degree of safeguard against loss or steep customs on arrival.
3. Package forwarding services: Now try as hard as you might, many items on sale simply won’t offer worldwide shipping. But there is a work around for this: Try package forwarding services who get the product delivered to their local warehouse and then ship it on their own to customers abroad. Mind you, these services are not free and require you to provide ID and other documents. You can choose services offered by banks like MyUS(HDFC), Borderlinx (Citibank), Global eShop(ICICI) or use third party services like ShopNShip and Viabox.
4. Shipping and customs:  Always take shipping and customs into account before you make the purchase. In some cases it will be cheaper to buy locally than order from the US if shipping and customs are steep. The best way to deal with this is to pick a shipping service that’ll charge for customs up front and will clear it from customs if need be.

Nikkei Jumps on Weak Yen, Oil Price Slump
Reuters | Updated On: November 28, 2014 08:00 (IST)
Fund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
Tokyo: Japanese stocks gained ground on Friday as a weaker yen helped exporter stocks, while falling oil prices were seen as likely to stimulate global demand, supporting investor sentiment.
The Nikkei benchmark added 1.0 per cent to 17,410.87 by 0125 GMT, and is on course for a monthly gain of around 6 pe rcent. The Nikkei has risen over 10 per cent since the Bank of Japan stunned markets with fresh easing on Oct 31.
"Japan is amidst a perfect positive storm," said Stefan Worrall, director of equities cash sales at Credit Suisse.
"The oil price decline is stimulatory to world demand for Japanese exports, and offsets the impact of the weak yen on domestic energy costs."
The weak yen gave a leg up to major export shares. The Japanese currency traded at 118.21 against the dollar by 0115 GMT, near weekly highs of 118.57.
Toyota Motor Corp jumped 1.6 per cent and Panasonic Corp gained 0.5 per cent, while Honda Motor Co added 1.0 per cent.
Oil prices plunged on Thursday after OPEC chose not to cut production despite huge oversupply and prices sliding by a third since June.
With airlines set to benefit from cheaper fuel costs, ANA Holdings Inc was the Nikkei's best performer, jumping 5.3 per cent to its highest since March 2011. Japan Airlines Co Ltd also surged 4.0 per cent.
On the negative side of the ledger, OPEC's decision did hit Japan's oil production-related shares. Inpex lost 5.0 per cent, while Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd fell 2.8 per cent.
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products, slowed for a third consecutive month in October, highlighting the challenges facing the economy as it attempts to overcome deflation.
But market participants were unconcerned, emphasising that the Bank of Japan's aggressive easing last month was a pre-emptive move against deflation.
The broader Topix gained 0.9 per cent to 1,403.80.
The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.8 per cent to 12,778.58.

See more acquisitions; like healthcare space: 8K MilesWe are looking at healthcare and life sciences as our domain expansion and see life sciences pharma industry as another growth area.
Suresh Venkatachari
Chairman & CEO
8K Miles Software
8K Miles Software Services  the global secure cloud solutions company through its US subsidiary announced the acquisition of SERJ Solutions. SERJ provides innovative Epic EHR consulting, custom application development, and support solutions for the healthcare market.
Suresh Venkatachari, chairman & CEO, 8K Miles in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said the company has paid Rs 15.8 crore for the acquisition and the funding was through internal accruals and warrant issue. Serj currently generate revenues to the tune of Rs 35-40 crore, he added.
The company is also looking at one or two more acquisition opportunities in the near-term and is likely to complete an acquisition in FY15. They are looking at opportunities in healthcare and life sciences space. "Our intention is to leverage our cloud based offering to this domain mathematical. So, what we are looking at is a strong domain technology company where we can able to integrate with our cloud, secure cloud offering and we can offer as software service or planning services," said Venkatachari. 
Serj has no debt on the books and neither does 8K Miles except line of credit, he said.
Below is the transcript of Suresh Venkatachari’s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: Detailed to us what is the cost that you have paid, what are the sales of this company and what is it earning per share (EPS) accretive for you from day one?
A: The companies surge is actually an innovative, epic based EHR consulting and solution provider. It has approximately about less than 30 people in the US mainly helping various large to mid size hospitals in implementing EHR solution and providing consulting services.
We want to integrate with our 8K Miles to leverage that into the next way of growth. We paid approximately Rs 15.8 crore for the acquisition.
Latha: What are they making in terms of the sales?
A: Currently, they generate approximately about Rs 35-40 crore in revenue.
Latha: Why did you pay only 16 crore. Do they have debt?
A: They have earnout option also available (Earnout refers to a pricing structure in mergers and acquisitions where the sellers must "earn" part of the purchase price based on the performance of the business following the acquisition. In an earnout, part of the purchase price is paid after closing based on the target company achieving certain financial goals).
Earnout on top of the performance, so it’s a cash component, assured component is about 16 crore and the additional ear out options they have.
Latha: Can you give an idea of what will be the total cost in that case?
A: It’s based on the profitability. It’s not basically linked to the sales of organisation. It is to generate based on the graph’s margin what we generate out of the business. So it is not related to bigger sales, its one element. We focus on two things which are very important for us (1) long-term relationship with the client and (2) EBITDA margin. Therefore, based on the EBITDA margin they have additional 10 percent on the EBITDA they can able to earn.
Sonia: Will this integration result in any margin pressure. What will the blended margins look like?
A: This Company is a very good managed company. It’s a very small but much focused company and they do approximately around 22 percent on net profit and if you minus the other promoters’ salaries then it is between 20 and 23 percent net profit.
Latha: How are you paying for it?
A: We have a lot of internal receivable accruals and also we have subscribed for warrant issue for approximately around 55 crore, using that money as part of our acquisition.
Sonia: What is the debt on the books for 8K Miles currently?
A: There is no debt actually except the line of credit what we have today.
Latha: Do Serj Solutions have debt?
A: There is no debt on Serj books.
Latha: What is the half year earning or what is the percentage increase in earnings that we can expect?
A: We did about a 36 percent EBITDA in the half year earnings this year.
Latha: How much will it go by with this acquisition?
A: We are hopping to maintain at the same level or increase our overall operation efficiency that is our plan.
Sonia: Any more acquisitions that you have lined up?
A: We are contemplating couple of more opportunities but not right now. We are looking at healthcare and life sciences as our domain expansion and see life sciences pharma industry as another growth area.
Our intention is to leverage our cloud based offering to this domain mathematical. So, what we are looking at is a strong domain technology company where we can able to integrate with our cloud, secure cloud offering and we can offer as software service or planning services.
If you really look at in a healthcare market there is a deep need for EHR for smaller to midsize community hospitals. They don’t have that today because only the large companies have to spend millions of dollars to get the EHR implemented.
8K Miles Soft stock price
On December 10, 2014, 8K Miles Software Services closed at Rs 541.50, down Rs 40.35, or 6.93 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 804.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 75.00.

Bank Can Lend For Low-Cost Housing Against Infra BondsBank Can Lend For Low-Cost Housing Against Infra Bonds
Asian shares wither on OPEC decisionAsian shares wither on OPEC decision

Singapore, Nov 28:  
Oil prices, oil-related shares and oil-linked currencies all tumbled in Asia on Friday, in the wake of OPEC’s decision to refrain from cutting output despite a huge oversupply.
US markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, leaving the spotlight on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ meeting in Vienna where Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer cartel members to cut production to stem a slide in global prices.
“OPEC is clearly signalling that it will no longer bear the burden of market adjustment alone and this decision puts the onus on other producers,’’ Barclays analysts said in a note.
Crude oil
Crude prices had been under pressure ahead of the meeting, but the sharp dive afterward — the largest since 2011 — showed the decision was not fully priced in.
Brent crude stood at $72.60 a barrel after settling at a four-year closing low on Thursday, poised to fall more than 15 per cent for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008. US crude was last down 6.5 per cent at $68.93.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slumped 0.7 per cent, on track for a weekly gain of nearly 1 per cent but a monthly loss of about 1.6 percent.
Australian shares dropped 1.6 per cent as energy companies took a hammering, with Sundance Energy, Drillsearch, Santos Ltd falling 10-16 per cent.
The Nikkei stock average bucked the regional downtrend and added 0.9 per cent, on track for a slight weekly gain and a hefty monthly gain of over 6 per cent.
Japan industrial output, consumer inflation
Japanese data out earlier on Friday showed Japan’s industrial output unexpectedly rose 0.2 per cent in October, marking a second straight month of gains, the jobless rate fell and the availability of jobs edged higher.
But Japan’s annual core consumer inflation slowed for a third straight month in October due to falling oil prices.
“Japan is amidst a perfect positive storm,’’ said Stefan Worrall, director of equities cash sales at Credit Suisse.
“The oil price decline is stimulatory to world demand for Japanese exports, and offsets the impact of the weak yen on domestic energy costs.’’
Two-year Japanese government bonds traded at a negative yield for the first time in history on Friday, as the Bank of Japan’s massive bond buying quest to vanquish deflation crushed short-term debt yields.
Dollar vs yen
The dollar rose about 0.4 per cent against the yen to 118.20 yen, while the euro drifted down about 0.1 per cent to $1.2455.
But the greenback made dramatic moves against the currencies of oil-rich countries. The dollar rallied to 6.9570 Norwegian crowns, a high not seen in over five years, and was last at 6.9463.
The US dollar spiked to a one-week high against its Canadian counterpart at C1.1355, before steadying at C$1.1335 in Asia.
Spot gold
Spot gold extended losses into a third session on expectations that plunging oil prices could sap inflationary pressure and curb the metal’s appeal as a hedge. Gold was down 0.5 per cent at $1,184.80 an ounce, down about 1 per cent for the week and ready to snap a three-week rally.
On Thursday, the euro fell against the dollar, after data showed German inflation sinking to its lowest since February 2010, reinforcing bets the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy more aggressively.
The European Commission will tell France, Italy and Belgium on Friday their 2015 budgets risk breaking EU rules, but it will defer decisions on any action until early March, when France could face a multi-billion euro fine and Italy and Belgium be put on a disciplinary programme.
According to draft documents seen by Reuters, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and Malta are also at risk of busting budget limits.

Oil marketing companies gain as crude prices fallOil marketing companies gain as crude prices fall
SI Reporter | Mumbai Nov 28, 2014 09:47 AM IST
Shares of all three listed state-owned oil marketing companies – Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) are trading higher between 4-5% on BSE after Brent crude fell $5.17 to $72.58 a barrel on Thursday.
“Brent oil fell more than $6 to $71.25 a barrel, its weakest since July 2010, after OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna left the group's output ceiling unchanged despite huge global oversupply, marking a major shift away from its long-standing policy of defending prices”, the Reuters report suggests.
Brent has lost more than 37% since June as increasing production in North America from shale oil has overwhelmed demand at a time of sluggish global economic growth, added report.
The lower crude oil prices will help reduce oil marketing companies' under-recoveries.
Among the individual stocks, HPCL has rallied 5.3% to Rs 577 on BSE. BPCL up 4.4% to Rs 752, while IOC up 3.7% at Rs 362 at 0941 hours.

India more attractive than before; see 20-25% growth: Jim Walker08:00 am
India has become more attractive than before, even more favourable than China, says Jim Walker, MD, Asianomics citing his bullish tone on India. Having concluded a 3-year consolidation phase, he anticipates another 20-25 percent growth in Indian equities.
According to him, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is well on course to meet fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP. People will be surprised at how low inflation can go in 2015, he says in an interview to CNBC-TV18.
Meanwhile, modest growth figure will give Reserve Bank room to cut rates quickly. However, he does not expect any rate cut in December 2 policy but sees 100-150 bps rate cut in 2015.
The recent additional plunge in crude and oil prices is another shot in the arm for India, he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Does India just become a little more attractive after the events in Vienna yesterday?
A: Yes, I have started to believe that India could become any more attractive than it already is - yes of course, with crude oil prices where they are and seeming inability for Organisation of petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) to cut their supplies then I suspect would give more downside to the oil price which is exceptionally good news for India generally.
Q: India’s import bill can now meaningfully declined because of the fall in crude so do you think this will help the finance minister meet his fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP?
A: Yes. I am sure that we are pretty well on course for the fiscal deficit target, not so much because of the falling oil price. By the fact that the government has already eradicated subsidies on diesel given the fall in prices but those subsidies have gone and there has been progress in cutting subsidies elsewhere and of course we are now at the cusp of an upswing in economic activity in India which is going to help the financial position of the government anyway. So I think that is pretty much on course.
Q: What is your estimate of the GDP number that will come out later today but more generally what is the growth forecast for the FY15 itself and connected to that what do you expect governor will do on December 2?
A: Yes, I would not be looking for a huge figure for the GDP number today. I think we saw surprisingly strong number for Q2, I wouldn’t be surprised if it will be a bit below of Q2 number. From Q4 onwards of 2014 into 2015 is when we expect to see the business cycle swinging upwards. So it is relatively good if we had modest growth figure because it would certainly allow the Central Bank to cut interest rates more meaningfully and perhaps more quickly than it currently intend. I am not sure whether they will cut interest rates in December, I hope they do but certainly through the course of 2015, we are looking for between 100 and 150 bps worth of interest rate cuts in India and will easily be able to take given where inflation has trended.
Q: Would you be terribly worried or upset if the rate cut didn’t come in December and the governor chose to wait till February because there is a base effect to the consumer inflation for the October-November numbers? If the rate cuts were postponed but his language turn dovish quite clearly indicating what he might do later on, will that still keep India attractive?
A: Yes, I think so. The main thing about India is that it has gone through a three-year consolidation phase where economic activity has not been good, businesses have been cutting capital expenditure, they have been repairing their balance sheet and we are now entering a phase where the Indian corporate sector is in much better health, economic can start to grow again plus we have much more pro-active, pro-business government in place. Regardless of what the RBI does in the coming week, that is going to be the real key for whether or no people are putting investments in India and that foreign investors that I speak to are greatly enthusiastic at the moment about India and their biggest problem is finding enough companies and enough liquidity in the market to buy.
Q: In fact, we got a sense of that with the number of QIPs that have taken place in the last many days but how much do you think retail inflation could average in 2015 because of falling crude prices?
A: That is going to help. The key thing has been the control of money supply and credit that has been going on now for the last two-three years in India through the policies followed by Mr Subba Rao and kept on by Raghuram Rajan. So the inflation has been squeezed of the system because money and trade are being controlled. I am not worried about pick up in inflation in India next year at all, I think people will be surprised about how low it can go.
Q: Would you not be worried about growth also – when you look at lead indicators like auto sales or PMI numbers, the Q2 earnings were quite a disappointment across most corporate. When do you see growth meaningfully picking up for the first calendar quarter next year, second calendar quarter or even further down?
A: You may even see when the results of the fourth quarter calendar year 2014 come to an end by early 2015, I think the beginning sign of basing Indian economy have been evident now for the last three to six months, the upturn should come and overview from hereon. We are in a quarter where the economy will be coming up and next year be coming more meaningfully and of course if it can be supported by government policies that get businesses more confidence and more clarity about the future as well as bring through infrastructure projects and capital spending than set fear for us. A very very positive next two-five years.
Q: The indices have already gained 35 percent this calendar year. How much more can they run in the next 12 months?
A: I would expect certainly another 20-25 percent over the next year.
Q: Between India and China, is the argument still tilting in favour of India?
A: Yes, it’s tilting in favour of India. India just at the beginning of a business cycle upswing, China is still very clearly known. We see a global commodity prices and many other indicators from China that is in a very significant slowdown phase. I think it will probably start bottoming out in 2015 but then has a two years consolidation period, the same as we have just seen in India where we really start to talk about a business cycle upswing in China at the end of 2016 if not in 2017.

Nov 27:  
Radio telescopes on Earth will beam 90,000 messages to Mars on Friday to commemorate the launch 50 years ago of the first robotic probe to visit the planet.
A US space funding company called Uwingu organised the extraterrestrial shout-out to mark the 50th anniversary of NASA's Mariner 4 mission and to raise funds for its other projects.
Uwingu's ‘Beam Me To Mars’ initiative invited interested participants to send digital radio-wave transmissions of their names, messages and pictures to Mars for fees ranging from $5 to $99.
The effort attracted several celebrities including actor and comedian Seth Green and actor George Takei, who portrayed Mr. Sulu on the television series "Star Trek."
The transmission is scheduled to begin just after 3 p.m. EST/2000 GMT on Friday. Travelling at the speed of light, the messages will take 15 minutes to reach Mars. The entire transmission will be repeated twice.
While there is no one on Mars to answer the call, project organisers say that is beside the point.
Copies of the messages will be delivered to Congress, to NASA headquarters in Washington, and the United Nations in New York as a show of support for space exploration.
"Though no one is on Mars yet to receive the messages, here on Earth people will hear them loud and clear," Uwingu wrote on the project website.
Uwingu, pronounced "oo-wing-goo" which means "sky" in Swahili, is a privately owned company that raises money to fund space research and educational outreach projects.
Since Mariner 4's successful flyby of Mars, returning the first pictures of the planet's surface, more than 20 other spacecraft have successfully visited, orbited or landed on the planet's surface.
NASA currently has three orbiters and two rovers working on Mars, and the European Space Agency and India each have one Mars orbiter.
The long-term goal of the US space programme is to land astronauts on the Red Planet.

BSE market capitalisation hits Rs 100-trillion markBSE m-cap hits Rs 100-trillion mark, investor wealth up 10 times in a decade
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 12:46 IST
(Photo: Associated Press)
The total investor wealth in Indian stock market hit a record high of Rs 100 trillion on Friday, marking a jump of ten times in little over a decade.
The 30 Sensex companies alone, which are among the biggest in the country, now account for nearly 50 per cent or about Rs 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
Measured in terms of total market capitalisation of all listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the overall investor wealth in the Indian stock market rose to Rs 100.01 lakh crore at 10.05 am as benchmark Sensex soared by over 300 points in its continuing record rally.
MUST SEE: India's top 500 most valuable companies 2014
This includes Tata Consultancy Services, the country's most valued firm  and the only entity to have a market value of over Rs 5 lakh crore,  followed by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and private sector  behemoth Reliance Industries with market caps of over Rs 3 lakh crore  each.
Companies commanding market cap of over Rs 2 lakh crore include ITC,  Infosys, HDFC Bank, SBI and Coal India. Besides, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Sun  Pharma, HUL, Bharti Airtel, L&T, Wipro, Tata Motors, HCL Tech, NTPC  and Axis Bank have market cap of over Rs 1 lakh crore each. Among these,  ICICI Bank is very close to moving into Rs 2 lakh crore club.
Of the overall stock market wealth, promoters command nearly 50 per cent share while foreign investors own close to 20 per cent and the rest is shared between institutional and retail investors from India.
The total market cap of all BSE listed companies had crossed Rs 10  lakh-crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003 while it has doubled from  about Rs 50 lakh crore five years ago in 2009.

Bomb kills 5 Nigerian troops; Boko HaramsuspectedBy: Reuters | Yola |
Posted: November 29, 2014 1:10 am | Updated: November 29, 2014 10:45 am
Gunmen set off three bombs and opened fire on worshippers at the central mosque in north Nigeria’s biggest city Kano, killing at least 65 people on Friday, witnesses and police said, in an attack that bore the hallmarks of Islamist Boko Haram militants.
“These people have bombed the mosque. I am face to face with people screaming,” said Chijjani Usman, a local reporter who had gone to the mosque in the old city to pray.
The mosque is next to the palace of the emir of Kano, the second highest Islamic authority in Africa’s most populous country, although the emir himself, former central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, was not present.
No one immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on Boko Haram, a Sunni jihadist movement fighting to revive a medieval Islamic caliphate in the region.
Boko Haram regards the traditional Islamic religious authorities in Nigeria with disdain, considering them a corrupt, self-serving elite that is too close to the secular government.
The insurgents have killed thousands in gun and bomb attacks on churches, schools, police stations, military bases, government buildings and mosques that do not share their radical ideology.
At least 65 people died on Friday, deputy police commissioner Sanusi N Lemo told reporters in Kano. “Three bombs were planted in the courtyard to the mosque and they went off simultaneously,” a security source who declined to be named said.
“After multiple explosions, they also opened fire. I cannot tell you the casualties because we all ran away,” added a member of staff at the palace.
Angry youths blocked the mosque’s gates to police, who had to disperse them with tear gas to gain entry.
The insurgency has forced more than one million people to flee during its campaign focused on Nigeria’s northeast, the Red Cross told reporters on Friday, an increase on a September UN refugee agency estimate of 700,000.
Islamic leaders sometimes shy away from direct criticism of Boko Haram for fear of reprisals. But Kano’s emir Sanusi, angered by atrocities such as the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok in April, has been increasingly vocal.
He was quoted in the local press as calling on Nigerians this month to defend themselves against Boko Haram. During a broadcast recitation of the Koran he was reported to have said:
“These people, when they attack towns, they kill boys and enslave girls. People must stand resolute … They should acquire what they can to defend themselves. People must not wait for soldiers to protect them.”
Persistent insecurity is dogging President Goodluck Jonathan’s campaign for re-election to a second term in February 2015.

Markets on a roll: Sensex scales new peak  Nifty eyes8 600By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: November 28, 2014 10:30 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 4:38 pm
Markets gained for the third straight session today with benchmark Sensex surging 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty rising 94.05 points to 8,588.25, led by banking and auto shares, as hopes of a rate cut by RBI brightened after oil prices tumbled to multi-year lows.
FII buying in bluechips and retail investors picking up midcap shares helped markets cement gains. All eyes are now on quarterly GDP data to be released later. Total investor wealth is within a sniffing distance of Rs 100 lakh crore.
The BSE 30-share barometer Sensex spurted by 255.08 points, or 0.90 per cent, to close at new high of 28,693.99. It broke previous peak 28,499.54 recorded on November 24. Intra-day, it touched a new high of 28,822.37, bettering previous lifetime high of 28,541.96 also hit on November 24.
The Sensex has now gained over 355 points three days.
Gainers in the 30-share Sensex included Tata Steel, Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Coal India, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC, Hindalco, HDFC, Wipro, ITC Ltd, Tata Power and RIL.
“Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC’s decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week,” said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty barometer topped the 8,600 mark for the first time to hit life-time high of 8,617.00. It finally settled 94.05 points, or 1.11 per cent, higher at record close of 8,588.25. Thus, it surpassed its earlier closing peak of 8,530.15 touched on November 24.
Banking was the front-runner ahead of RBI monetary policy review next week. SBI led gains by rising over 5 per cent. Others such as ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank also rose.
Globally, brent crude prices fell to trade at over four-year low of USD 71.21 per barrel in Asian trade. This boosted shares of OMCs, paint makers and airline companies.
Sectorally, BSE Banking index gained the most by rising 2.87 per cent, followed by Auto 1.95 per cent, Realty 1.65 per cent and Consumer Durables 1.16 per cent among others.
Mixed closing at other Asian markets and a lower opening in European markets also influenced trading sentiments here.
Foreign investors bought shares worth net Rs 389.73 crore yesterday, as per provisional data.

E-comm players gear up for Google s shopping...Black Friday
(Sites that offer price comparisons, couponing and…)
BENGALURU: Many online sites are gearing up for a surge in business with a fortnight of discounts during the ongoing Google-led online shopping festival followed by Black Friday and Cyber Monday next week. The affiliate sites are creating 'howto' guides for best deals in different categories, anticipating a four-fold rise in traffic and a similar jump in revenue.
Sites that offer price comparisons, couponing and best deals may come up on top by creating 'how-to' guides during the GOSF (Google Online Shopping Festival). Smaller e-commerce merchants also gain from the rising traffic, given that they offer niche products and comparable discounts.
Typically, GOSF aims to tap firsttime shoppers, which constituted a large chunk — nearly 30% — during the 2013 festival. "This year, we have five times the number of merchants against when we started GOSF in 2012. Though there are 250 million internet users, only 35 to 40 million users shop online. Our idea is to get more and more first-time shoppers to experience this," says Nitin Bawankule , industry director for e-commerce, local and classifieds at Google India .
"While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are not Indian phenomenon, we have created a GOSF section specifically on Desidime to help shoppers. Diwali and GOSF make up nearly 30% of our annual revenues and last year the traffic went up by 120% during GOSF. We will be adding 20 additional servers this year in anticipation of the volumes," says Mehul Jobanputra , CEO and co-founder of Desidime.
Given that 14 days of pre-GOSF which would showcase 14 different e-commerce players offering their best deals, affiliates will turn a channel for product discovery and collating updated deals. "Price wars are likely on key days and it is a big question whether the featured e-commerce players offer their best deals on the day they are featured or on days when their competitors are featured,leading to never-seenbefore discounts.
Given the technical interruptions last year and earlier this year for the shopping festivals, there is a better amount of preparedness," says Swati Bhargava, co-founder of cashback and coupon site Cash-Karo, which is expecting four times the traffic and three times the revenues during the GOSF days. The smaller e-commerce players reach out to a larger audience, expecting to benefit from the rising traffic. Last year, smaller players registered twice the traffic during GOSF.
"GOSF is a good platform for the smaller players who do not have the marketing muscle. The listing will be random and will rotate so as not to have any specific merchant's name on top. However, greater the number of categories the merchant offers, better the presence," says Bawankule.
Many smaller e-commerce players register a repeat customer base of up to 50% due to the exposure during the event. "During GOSF, there is a bump which remains. Many of our partners reported a 50% rise in repeat customers' post-GOSF and the festival benefits everyone in the ecosystem. The overall sales go up nearly three times.
The idea to launch a microsite is to help people search for best deals which are catalogued based on the brand or categories," says Sameer Parwani, CEO and founder of Coupondunia . The affiliate site started its dedicated microsite for GOSF on Monday. Incorporated in 2010, the couponing website was acquired by Times Internet earlier this year.
Digital media network Komli Media, which ran a series of deals and coupons ahead of the GOSF pre-party between November 17 and November 23, indicated better results for smaller players, given that the top e-commerce players will be holding on to their deals in anticipation of GOSF.
"The increase in transactions for the bigger players has gone up by 20 to 30% while smaller e-tailers have seen a jump of nearly four times the usual transactions over a period of two days," says Sandeep Balani, director, publisher development at Komli Media, which incentivised affiliates as part of its offer.

Its RSS all the way in BJPNEW DELHI, November 27, 2014

It’s RSS all the way in BJP

TOPICS
parties and movements
The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh never had it so good in the BJP. After the appointment of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is a direct import from the RSS, party president Amit Shah’s residual team of general secretaries (after the Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet was expanded on November 9) has mostly Sangh deputationists and former pracharaks running party affairs.
As the political arm of the Sangh, the BJP has always had prominent leaders with RSS background including both NDA Prime Ministers. But the Sangh’s influence on managing day-to-day affairs of the party has never been so pronounced, insiders admit.
The party currently has five general secretaries, of whom Ram Madhav, Ram Lal and P. Murlidhar Rao were sent directly from the RSS into the BJP. The remaining two, Bhupendra Yadav and Saroj Pandey, have close links with the RSS. Mr. Yadav, in fact, was sent from the RSS to the Akhil Bharatiya Adivakta Parishad, the Sangh’s lawyers collective, before he was brought into the BJP and given Rajya Sabha ticket in April 2012.
Mr. Madhav joined the party in July. He was the RSS spokesperson before that. Mr. Rao was sent to the BJP in 2009 as an attaché to the then party president Rajnath Singh. Mr. Ram Lal came in 2006 as general secretary (organisation), a post created especially for RSS pracharaks who act as a bridge between the Sangh and the BJP. There are several such bridges now. Mr. Shah is the first president to appoint four joint general secretaries (organisation). All four — V. Satish, Saudan Singh, Shiv Prakash and B.L. Santosh — are swayamsevaks. Mr. Prakash, who joined the party in August, was RSS kshetra pracharak in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand before that. Sources said he is likely to be elevated to the post of general secretary when Mr. Shah expands his team while Mr. Madhav could find a slot in the party’s apex decision-making body, the Parliamentary Board. While Mr. Yadav is in charge of the Jharkhand elections and Bihar, Mr. Rao has been asked to look after Tamil Nadu along with his primary responsibility of Karnataka.
Despite several office-bearers becoming ministers, Mr. Shah is not in a hurry to replace them. “We are focussing on the membership drive and the State elections. New appointments are not likely at least till December 23,” a party leader said.
From the time Mr. Shah was brought in from Gujarat State politics and appointed general secretary of Uttar Pradesh and later elevated to the position of party president, he has constantly relied on Sangh men for managing elections and party affairs. During the Lok Sabha elections, he brought in Sunil Bansal from the RSS to manage the war room in Lucknow.
Mr. Bansal is now general secretary in the State which sent one-fourth of BJP’s MPs to the Lok Sabha. After the BJP’s win in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, believed to have been catalysed by the vast network of RSS cadres, the Sangh’s influence within the party has only increased.

Brent crude plunges to 4-year low of $72 as OPEC refrains from output cutsBrent crude plunges to 4-year low of $72.50 as OPEC refrains from output cuts
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Nov 28:  
Brent crude held above $72 a barrel on Friday, close to a four-year low touched in the previous session after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for output reductions, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 9 cents at $72.49 a barrel at 0446 GMT, after plummeting $5.17 in the previous session to close at $72.58. Earlier on Thursday, it touched its weakest since July 2010 at $71.25 a barrel.
Brent is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, said.
US crude
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.78 from Wednesday's to $68.91 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75. U.S. markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Oil may fall to $60
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

Two Filipinos and an Indonesian convicted in 2002bombingBy: Associated Press | Manila |
Posted: November 28, 2014 11:11 am
A Philippine court has convicted an Indonesian militant and two Filipino extremists for their role in a 2002 mall bombing that killed at least 12 people and signaled the start of the alliance of two of Southeast Asia’s most violent terrorist groups.
Judge Leili Cruz-Suarez said in her ruling on Thursday that Jul Kifli from Indonesia and Abu Sayyaf militants Ahmad Jekeron and Yacob Basug were “guilty beyond reasonable doubt” of staging the April 21, 2002, bombing that also wounded dozens of people at the Fitmart shopping mall in the southern port city of General Santos.
State prosecutor Aristotle Reyes, who initially handled the case, said the convictions would serve as a deterrent to terrorism and complement military actions to defeat the resilient militants. A former Abu Sayyaf militant and key witness, Abu Hamdie, said the bombing was the first joint attack by the Abu Sayyaf and the Indonesia-based terror network Jemaah Islamiyah.
He said the Abu Sayyaf was looking for a diversion to fend off a military offensive at the time, and Jemaah Islamiyah “wanted to show off their bomb-making prowess.” With the help of Filipino militants, including notorious bombing suspect Basit Usman, Jul Kifli manufactured the powerful bomb and placed it near the entrance of the mall. The bomb was remotely detonated with a cellphone call made by Jekeron, Hamdie said.
“He uttered a short prayer then dialed the cellphone number given by Jul Kifli,” he said. Usman, who is also wanted by the U.S. government for several, deadly bombings, remains at large. Indonesian Ibrahim Ali and Abu Sayyaf militants Arman Ameruddin and Ikram Ameruddin were acquitted in the trial.
The Abu Sayyaf was founded in 1991 in the south, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic country and scene of rebellions for a separate Muslim homeland. Washington considers the Abu Sayyaf, which currently has about 400 armed fighters split into about six factions, as a terrorist group.
A U.S.-backed offensive has weakened and largely isolated the Abu Sayyaf, but it has endured by turning to ransom kidnappings and extortion. It currently holds about a dozen hostages.

Army positions tanks for final assault as encounter resumes in ArniasectorWritten by Arun Sharma | Jammu |
Posted: November 28, 2014 10:53 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 2:20 pm
After a night long lull, the encounter between army troops and terrorists restarted in Arnia sector on Friday morning.
According to police, firing from terrorists holed up inside an army bunker came around 9.30 am when the later moved forward to ascertain that all of them were dead. The army has positioned its tanks for the final assault which, it said, could not be launched last night as some territorial army jawans were also trapped on a post in the vicinity of encounter site.

As they have succeeded in moving out of the area, the final assault will be launched any time now, a police officer said.
Nearly a month ago, Arnia was the worst hit by unprecedented unprovoked shelling by Pakistani Rangers which had continued for over a fortnight leading to migration of a large number of villagers from their native places. (Source: AP)
A group of heavily armed terrorists had on Thursday morning sneaked nearly two kilometres inside the Indian territory in Arnia sector from across the international border and killed three army men and civilians at Kathar.
During an over 12 hours long operation on Thursday, the army had claimed to have killed four terrorists. The Inspector General of Police for Jammu zone, Rajesh kumar, however, said that though local people claim to have seen four terrorists, there number can be more as well.
The fidayeens had taken refuge inside an army bunker and were reportedly using the army ammunition already stored there. (Source: AP)
The fresh infiltration by terrorists so deep inside the Indian territory on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit to Udhampur and Poonch has come as a surprise to many in view of BSF claims about intensified vigil along the international border after last month’s unprecedented mortar shelling by Pakistani Rangers.
In view of the latest infiltration attempt by terrorists, the police has intensified security all along the national highway and roads leading to both Udhampur and Poonch where Modii is scheduled to hold election rallies during the day.

(Brent crude had fallen 13…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude held above $72 a barrel on Friday after hitting a new four year low earlier in the day after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for output reductions, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 38 cents at $72.20 a barrel at 0806 GMT, after plummeting $5.17 to close at $72.58 on Thursday. It earlier fell $1.46 in trading on Friday to touch $71.12, its weakest since July 2010.
Brent is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, of Thursday's fall.
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.79 from Wednesday's closing to $68.90 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75. US markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

How online marketplaces are changing the lives of merchantsHow online marketplaces are changing the lives of thousands of merchants

(The ability to reach out…)
From garages in Mumbai to sari shops in Varanasi, thousands of manufacturers and traders are today tapping a rapidly growing online retail market in India thanks to marketplaces like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon.
The ability to reach out to a nationwide market and lower costs are ensuring a sharp increase in sales for the over 80,000 merchants who sell just on these portals. A survey conducted by research firm Spire Research and Consulting this year showed that for offline retailers selling online, the latter is contributing up to 50% of overall sales.
Next year the online retail market is expected to reach $6 billion (over Rs 37,000 crore) in size. The online multi-category stores are responsible for almost 90% of the sales online, according to industry estimates, which means a bulk of this $6 billion will flow into bank accounts of merchants. No wonder then that online retail is changing the lives of thousands of merchants.
"Five years ago I did not have a job, now my apparel business has grown 15-fold and I am targeting over Rs 1 crore in sales," said Mumbai-based Saumya Gupta, 26, whose apparel brand Ten On Ten sells only through online sites like Flipkart and Snapdeal. There are challenges of course. Inability to increase production capacity at the same pace as demand, issue of returns, and lack of infrastructure are just some of the worries that are tempering merchants' optimism about the sector.
"There are now thousands of sellers in each category, so competition is growing," said Karan Chugh, owner of ethnic wear retail firm Florence Clothing from Surat. But for merchants, like the following six, online retail has meant success and a growth in ambition.

"With the games site, we faced challenges of procurement, but our sari business already had a strong procurement network," said Agrawal. He gave up his stake in the games business and moved back to Varanasi in 2013 to run the three-decade-old Chandrakala Enterprises. In September that year, he started selling his Banarasi saris on sites like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.
"Online is now contributing to about 25% of our business and could overtake our offline trade within the next two years," said Agrawal, 29. While issues like the inability of weavers to expand production rapidly remain, Agrawal is happy with his decision.
"I would have had to eventually take over the family business but thanks to online retail I am having fun," said Agrawal, who is targeting sales of at least Rs 16 crore this fiscal from online sales.
Yogesh Wadhwa, DMP Carrycases
Yogesh Wadhwa's eight-year-old business of manufacturing laptop bags for original equipment manufacturers ran into rough weather about two years ago when companies like Samsung and Sony decided to stop making laptops. Wadhwa decided to launch his own brand of bags and luggage, Bleu.
"The conventional route would have required a lot of investments, so we thought of going online," said Wadhwa, 43, who started retailing on Amazon about 10 months back. "We put up 10 designs one day and by next morning it was sold out. We realised we had a winner."
Around the time of launching on Amazon, he sold about 1,000 pieces of a toiletry kit on Groupon in one day. "I realised, apart from low prices, customers are attracted to products that are not easily available offline," said Wadhwa.
DMP sells about 150 products on regular days across most major online portals and is targeting about Rs 4 crore online sales this fiscal. "If I had to do this offline I would not have been able to do that without a heavier infusion of capital," said Wadhwa. "We are a totally debt-free company."
Karan Chugh, Florence Clothing
Karan Chugh's family has been running an apparel manufacturing and wholesale business, Majestic Silk, in Surat since 1960 and the family diversified into retail in 2007.
It was when Chugh, 25, started shopping online that he decided to retail the mass market Florence brand of saris and dress materials online.
"The idea was to explore," recalled Chugh, who started with Snapdeal in 2012 and now sells on most top marketplaces. In the first month, Florence sold Rs 5 lakh worth of products, but Chugh could see the steady ramp up in orders.
Within a few months, Chugh started Silk Bazaar, a more premium range priced up to Rs 30,000, just for the online market. With online retail accounting for over 70% of the company's overall sales, he has cut back offline operations from 30 stores to five. He also operates shop-in-shops in Vishal Megamart and at More.

Goldman Sachs-led group investing in South Korean online food serviceBaedal Minjok service
(Baedal Minjok, which means…)
HONG KONG: Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private equity arm-led group of investors is putting 40 billion won ($36.1 million) in South Korea's largest online and mobile food ordering service, as more consumers take to ordering meals from their phones.
The investment in Woowa Brothers Corp , which owns the Baedal Minjok service , will help the company expand internationally and develop new technology, Goldman said in a statement. Woowa last month started a joint venture with chat app company Line Corp to launch a food delivery service in Japan.
Line is owned by Naver Corp , South Korea's top Internet portal operator. Naver last month said it was holding off on an IPO for Line to build up the chat app company's revenue and profit.
Goldman didn't disclose the size of the stake in Woowa bought with the investment.
Baedal Minjok, which means "Delivery Nation" in English, processes more than 4 million orders a month, 99 percent of which are done through mobile devices.

Delhi nursery admissions: HC to give verdict todayNursery relief at last, HC gives schools more say
Soibam Rocky Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014
First Published: 09:11 IST(28/11/2014) | Last Updated: 01:45 IST(29/11/2014)
Comments
Holding out hope that nursery admissions this time round won’t be the mess they were last year, the Delhi high court on Friday empowered private unaided schools in the Capital to fix their own criteria, quashing last year’s government-mandated points-based system.
The court also restored the 20% management quota followed by schools before it was scrapped last year. With admission season just around the corner, the verdict effectively gives private schools “maximum autonomy in day-to-day administration, including right to admit students”.
The Delhi government plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, leading to apprehension of protracted litigation and, thereby, of a repeat of last year’s chaos.
In 2013, schools had reluctantly followed lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung’s points-based system that earmarked a massive 70 points for neighbourhood, 20 for siblings and 5 for alumni while doing away with the management quota. Five points for inter-state transfer cases was later scrapped by the government after parents went to court against it.
Various schools and parents had challenged the L-G’s guidelines in court, triggering a messy fight with more than 15 petitions filed. The admission season, which starts in January and concludes by March 31, had dragged on till May-end and the academic year had started from July instead of April. The L-G had defended his decision then, calling it an effort to end “commercialisation of education”.
However, the high court on Friday said Jung’s actions were “neither procedurally proper nor rational”. In his verdict, Justice Manmohan pointed out that the government did not submit any document or material to show schools were indulging in any malpractice.
The court also said that by awarding 70 out of 95 points for neighbourhood, the L-G’s guidelines had placed “undue emphasis on location of residence of a child over which she/he has no control”.
“This court is unable to appreciate that a student’s educational fate can be relegated to his position on a map,” the judgment read.
It added that by awarding five points for siblings studying in the same school, the guidelines placed an only child at a disadvantage.
The court said that the power to choose a school has to rest primarily with the parents and not the administration, and opined that “by increasing parental choice and granting schools the autonomy to admit students, the accountability of private schools can be ensured”.
For now, private schools can go back to the ‘flexible’ pre-2013 system of admission. This means they can fix their own criteria and the quantum of points to go with them. A school can choose to retain or omit the neighbourhood criteria, for instance.

Falling crude impact on oil paints to reflect in Q3: BergerTo benefit from decline in freight costs on account of fall in diesel prices.
Abhijit Roy
MD
Berger Paints
Abhijit Roy, Managing Director, Berger Paints in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke about the likely benefit of fall in crude prices for the company going forward.
According to him it is very difficult to pin point the drop of oil price impact immediately but it is sure to impact some of the raw material prices which are used for oil paints and so that will see an immediate drop. It will be passed on to the customers in a short timeframe.
However the other elements of raw material and derivatives like emulsion which is used in water paints will have a lagged effect, so the impact will be seen in fourth quarter and not the third quarter, he said.
The benefit of slide in diesel prices to have positive impact on freight costs.
 
So far the company has derived 1.2-1.3% EBITDA to sales benefit from the drop in crude, he added.
According to him the gross margins will see an expansion if the crude prices and dollar levels sustain.
On the demand front he said there has been no significant change on industrial side but decorative paint volumes will continue to grow at double-digits.
Below is the transcript of Abhijit Roy\\'s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: It’s been great times for paint companies like yours considering the amount of fall that we have seen in crude prices but can you quantify for us how much will every dollar fall in crude prices or every barrel fall in crude prices impact your margins and your earnings per share (EPS) as well?
A: There are two areas in which it has an impact – (1) on the raw material prices and some of the raw material prices like the solvents which are used for oil based paints, those will drop immediately as per the crude prices drop because that’s passed on normally within a very short timeframe.
The other elements of the raw materials and the derivatives like emulsion which are used on water based paints – that has a lag-ffect and it will probably come into the fourth quarter and not immediately in this quarter.
Therefore, it is very difficult to pinpoint when the oil drops what will be the impact immediately because a part of it comes in this quarter and the rest of it will flow into the next quarter. (2) The other element which is likely to impact us is the freight cost reduction which might happen because diesel prices going down. So that is also an impact which will be beneficial for us.
Latha: Can you quantify it in terms of what you have already seen in the third quarter?
A: About 1.2 to 1.3 percent EBITDA to sales – that’s the benefit that we have got.
Latha: Let me look at it differently – your gross margins improved by 160 bps year-on-year in Q2, what is your estimate for Q3 and Q4?
A: If the prices hold through and if the dollar holds these levels then it will move up further. The gross margin expansion that you saw in Q2 was not so much on account of the raw material price drop but more on account of the mix change which happened and some of the industrial businesses which were struggling earlier started showing signs of little bit of revival both in terms of price and in terms of volume. So that is why the gross margin expansion took place.
The third quarter expansion – a part of it will be the benefit coming in to the industrial business and also other decorative business also but most of it will come now from the raw material and freight advantage.
Latha: Your gross margins were at 41.2 percent in Q2 and since you said 1.2 percentage points, should we expect 42.4 as of now for Q3?
A: That is right.
Sonia: Also on operating profit margins (OPMs) which were at about 11.5 percent, by the end of the second half of the year where do you see them stand and also if you can give us a slightly longer term view. On an average if crude prices have trended lower by the end of FY16 what kind of a margin profile Berger Paints will stand at?
A: This is a very difficult question to answer because the operating profit does not depend only on the crude prices remaining stable or dropping because normally history would show that we tend to pass on these benefits to customers to drive up volumes.
Operating margins depends on essentially four factors, the topline, the cost that we are able to control non essential cost. The raw material cost of course is a factor, which is very important and the mix which we have. All factors come into play, so it’s very difficult to isolate one.

Karvy's report on rupee
Rupee Review: Owing to a trading holiday in the US markets for Thanksgiving, markets globally with an exception of a few have had muted sessions yesterday. Indian rupee remained largely range bound for the day opening at 61.8150 to close marginally lower at 61.87 in the spot market. Economic data from the German and European markets have led to minor bouts of volatility in those particular economies. Major event that the global markets were looking for was the OPEC meeting in the evening for any signaling of a cut in production.
Outlook: Asian markets are trading on a mixed note this morning after the US markets have remained closed for thanksgiving on Thursday. The release of the statement from OPEC in which they have not announced any cut in production. OPEC has left production at 30 million barrels per day triggering a steep fall in the oil price.
In terms of currency, Asian currencies are trading on a negative note with respect to the dollar. US dollar index has appreciated in a low volume trading session yesterday. US dollar index has pulled itself above the 88 level and is currently trading at 88.08. Euro is currently trading at 1.2456 and has a possibility of opening around 77.40 for the December contract in the Indian market. One month Rupee NDF is trading at 62.14 with a change of 2 paisa from yesterday’s close. Positivity arising out of the low oil prices would have a marginally positive impact on the Indian Rupee; however the strength in the US dollar globally could have an opposite effect to nullify any possible gains.
Economic data from the UK, German and EU economies would have a considerable impact in their respective currencies in today’s session. Later in the evening we have the Indian GDP and fiscal deficit to be released. Indian GDP is expected to decline to 5.1 percent as compared to the previous level of 5.7 percent. Any impact from the same could be seen in Monday’s session.
Technical Recommendation:
USDINR DEC: BUY NEAR 62.12 Target 62.32-62.35 Stop Loss 62

New Delhi: In a huge relief for prive schools in Delhi, the High Court has allowed them to set their own guidelines for nursery admissions quashing the guidelines of city government with respect to the general category seats.
The High Court has also ruled that power to decide the school of a child should lie with the parents and not with the government adding that "position on map cannot decide which school a child should go to."
The court added that administrative autonomy of private unaided schools cannot be restrained by way of office orders.
#delhi #nursery admissions #school #delhi high court
The HC in its order upheld the 2007 Ganguly committee recommendations on nursery admissions. The court observed that the government does not have the authority to make guidelines with respect to the admission criteria.
However, the court also said that the decision does not affect the 25 per cent Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota.
Private schools had been protesting against guidelines set by the government. The Delhi L-G had taken the authority on to decide the guidelines for the process.
Soon after the verdict, the principals of private schools hailed the High Court's decision. "We have been wanting autonomy in the admission process. I am happy that this decision has been taken," Principal Tagore International school Madhulika Sen said.

BJP, Shiv Sena leaders to meet today, truce over power sharing likely in Maharashtra

Mumbai: Bharatiya Janata Party leaders Maharashtra minister Chandrakant Patil and Union Minister for petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan will be meeting Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday evening fuelling speculations yet again about a truce between the two former allies on power sharing in the state.
According to sources, broad contours of a power sharing deal has been agreed upon. With less than a fortnight to go for the crucial winter session of the state assembly and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) speaking in multiple voices on support to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis government, the BJP knows the need to get the Sena on board to be numerically comfortable.
The BJP has a total of 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly and the Sena is the second largest party with 63 MLAs. While the BJP does not have majority without Sena, the Sena too, cannot play the role of an effective opposition party in the state as it continues to share power at the Centre.

Sex traffickers 'using Facebook' to lure young women into prostitution

Lodon: Gangs are using social media sites such as Facebook to lure young women into crime and prostitution, the head of European policing agency Europol said Tuesday.
Rob Wainwright said traffickers were drawing victims in by posting advertisements for childcare or cleaning vacancies and once ensnared, controlling their movements with webchats and webcams.
"They are using modern technological tools to more efficiently monitor an increasing number of victims," Wainwright told the Centre for Social Justice think-tank in London.

#europol #sex trafficking #prostitution #social media
"So instead of paying them a visit every day they can use webchat services and also webcams to confirm that they are where they should be, in that brothel waiting for the next customer.
"In the past pimps and traffickers had to do that by physically visiting them. Now they can just do it at the click of a button and therefore control 50 victims much more easily and readily in virtual form," he said.
The police chief said criminal gangs regarded trafficking as a "low-risk, high profit" venture, which generates around $150 billion a year for criminal gangs.
Most of Europe's estimated 500,000 victims are from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary with Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands the most likely destinations.
Wainwright called for an international effort to tackle the problem.
"As things currently stand, organised crime groups are going about the business of modern slavery with little fear of being caught and pursued. We urgently need to do much better," he said.
"There is no point in sitting on a vital piece of information in one country if it can break a syndicate spread across five or more others. The culture of policing must change," he added.

EU Parliament votes overwhelmingly to break up GoogleNov 28, 2014 at 10:26am IST
EU Parliament votes overwhelmingly to break up Google
24
0
Strasbourg: The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly for the break-up of Google Thursday in a largely symbolic vote that nevertheless cast another blow in the four-year standoff between Brussels and the US Internet giant.
In a direct challenge to Google, MEPs assembled in Strasbourg approved a resolution calling on the EU to consider ordering search engines to separate their commercial services from their businesses.
While Google is not directly mentioned in the proposal, the California-based search engine is clearly the target. The resolution passed with 384 in favour and only 174 votes against.
The resolution calls on the EU to consider ordering search engines to separate their commercial services from their businesses.
#google #european parliament #anti trust
The European Parliament has no power to launch the break-up of Google, but the move, introduced by two senior lawmakers, is further indication that the mood towards the company in Europe has soured.
Google has become a lightening rod for critics in Europe on a broad range of issues from privacy to the protection of national publishers.
"We wanted to give a strong signal to the European Commission but also to US companies like Google and to citizens," said Belgian MEP, the socialist Marc Tarabella.
Since 2010, Google has been under investigation by the European Commission in response to complaints that its search engine, the world's biggest, was squeezing out competitors in Europe.
Google and Brussels have also clashed over the so-called "right to be forgotten", in which the EU's top court ruled last year that people had a right to ask search engines to delete results involving them after a period of time.
Right to be forgotten
In another attack on Google, on Wednesday EU privacy watchdogs issued guidelines calling on the company to apply the right to be forgotten rule to all search results, no matter the country.
For now, the ruling only applies to European domains, such as google.fr and google.de, and users can turn to other domains to find unmodified information.
The parliament debate falls as the commission, the EU's executive arm, begins a new five-year term, with former Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker at its helm.
The new competition commissioner, Denmark's Margrethe Vestager, has said she would look at the sensitive case carefully, but the resolution will be added pressure for her to move quickly.
Weeks before stepping down, Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, sharply criticised the "irrational" response by European politicians to the Brussels investigation of Google.
Google and Almunia had made three attempts to resolve the dispute, but in each case intense pressure by national governments, Internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort.
In a statement Wednesday ahead of the vote, the US mission to the European Union said it had "noted with concern" the parliament resolution.
"It is important that the process of identifying competitive harms and potential remedies be based on objective and impartial findings and not be politicised," a spokesman for the US mission said.

AAP collects Rs 91 lakh from Kejriwals fund-raiser dinnerAAP collects Rs 91 lakh from Kejriwal’s fund-raiser dinner

Mumbai, Nov 28:  
AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal hosted a Rs 20,000 per plate dinner for young professionals, diamond merchants and bankers here kick-starting the party’s fund-raising campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections.
“We collected Rs 91 lakh from the fund-raiser dinner last night. Rs 36 lakh was collected from donor passes, Rs 36 lakh was through cheque donation from those who came and our volunteers collected Rs 21 lakh,” AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon told PTI here today.
“The next fundraiser will be in Bengaluru. We are impressed with the response to our fund-raiser drive,” she said.
With online donations, AAP is looking to raise funds differently to take on BJP which is relying on ‘brand Modi’.
“The Mumbai dinner had space for a maximum of 200 donors, mostly our supporters. Most of those who attended were young professionals, some diamond merchants and a few directors from Bollywood,” she said.
AAP’s Maharashtra unit has a target of raising Rs 5 crore over the next two months through reach-out drives,” she said.
In the run-up to this year’s Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal had in March hosted a fund-raising dinner in Bengaluru, inviting criticism from Congress which questioned whether the AAP leader — who then also charged Rs 20,000 per person for having a meal with him — could claim to represent the common man.
“Kejriwal has appealed to the people to donate for the party,” Menon said.
To encourage donations, AAP is tweeting online donors’ names with the hashtag #IFundHonestPolitics.
After the Delhi Assembly elections in December 2013, the party has so far received donations from over a lakh donors.
The maximum money has come from Maharashtra, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Analyst Corner: APTEL ruling positive for GSPL & GAILSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
In another setback for gas regulator PNGRB (Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board), in its tariff dispute with GSPL, the appellate tribunal (APTEL) has overwhelmingly ruled in favour of GSPL.
APTEL has said that PNGRB’s tariff order had a fatal deficiency, and has set aside the tariff order.  Highlighting that a 12% post-tax return on capital employed (as permitted in regulations) is in the interest of all stakeholders, it has asked PNGRB to re-work the tariff orders.
We think PNGRB will be more liberal now in re-working the tariff, and believe 10-15% tariff upsides are easily likely for both GAIL/GSPL. With APTEL emphasising that a 12% post-tax ROCE is important and in the interest of all stakeholders, we think PNGRB will be forced to re-look at the entire tariff setting exercise, and will likely be more liberal.
While it is too early to determine the extent of tariff increases, we think overall 10-15% tariff increases are like for both GAIL and GSPL. On our estimates, a 10% increase in tariff would increase: GSPL’s FY16F EPS and fair value by 12-14%; and GAIL’s FY16F EPS and fair value by 6-7%.
In addition, there will likely be retroactive gains, as the re-worked tariff orders will apply from the date the existing orders were made applicable.
For several of GAIL’s key pipelines, current provisional tariff orders were applied from Nov-2008. Thus, retroactive gains will be for a longer period and likely higher.

No Indian sugar export deals signed due to doubts over subsidiesNo Indian sugar export deals signed due to doubts over subsidies
Reuters
Tweet
MUMBAI, Nov 27:  
Indian traders have yet to arrange sugar export deals for the new season harvest as mills are not producing raw sugar due to uncertainty over whether the government will offer incentives, industry officials said.
A drop in exports by India, the world's second-biggest producer, would support global sugar prices and let rivals Brazil and Thailand increase shipments of the sweetener.
In the 2013/14 marketing year to Sept. 30, India exported 2.1 million tonnes of sugar, including 1.2 million tonnes of raws. By the end of November 2013, dealers had signed contracts for nearly 500,000 tonnes of raws but this year they've clinched none.
To help mills saddled with large stockpiles, India gave a subsidy of Rs 2,277 to Rs 3,371 ($37 to $54) a tonne for the production of raw sugar for export in 2013/14. After a change of government in May, no decision has yet been made about 2014/15.
"No one is producing raw sugar this year. Unless government announces a subsidy for exports, they won't start production of raw sugar," Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, told Reuters.
The western state of Maharashtra accounts for most of the raw sugar produced in India.
India's mills traditionally produce white sugar but a global glut has made exports difficult. To bring down inventory, mills produced raw sugar last year, taking advantage of rising refining capacity in Asia and Africa. They are currently producing only white sugar.
"We are not producing raw sugar since exporters are quoting very low prices," said Balasaheb Patil, chairman of Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory, which produced 25,000 tonnes of raw sugar last year. "There is no point in producing raw sugar unless we are sure about prices and the government subsidy."
Kamal Jain, managing director of Pune-based brokerage Kamal Jain Trading Services, said a stronger rupee had added to the pain caused by low global raw sugar prices.
"In the local market, prices will fall further if we fail to export. The government should quickly announce a subsidy to avoid distress sales by mills," Jain said.
Domestic sugar prices hit a nine-month low this month.
In 2014/15 India is set to produce surplus sugar for the fifth year in a row, putting further pressure on mills, which have to pay government-set prices to farmers for cane.
By Nov. 15, mills had produced 560,000 tonnes of sugar compared to 462,000 tonnes in the same period a year ago.

UltraTech to raise $1.2 bn for Holcim asset buyUltraTech to raise $1.2 bn for Holcim asset buy
BS Reporter & Bloomberg | Mumbai Nov 28, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned UltraTech Cement is in talks with bank to raise $1.2 billion to fund the takeover of Holcim's Brazilian assets, which the Swiss firm is selling to meet the regulatory requirements for a merger with Lafarge.
UltraTech has made a non-binding offer to take over Holcim's Brazilian assets and the Swiss-based company will soon announce the results of the bids it has received from across the world. Bankers say UltraTech's talks with banks will gain momentum once Holcim announces the results of the sale by December.
While a Birla group spokesperson declined to comment on the fund-raising plan, an insider said the company was raising Rs 150 crore for capital expenditure. UltraTech has raised Rs 500 crore as non-convertible debentures early this month, according to filings with stock exchanges.
Birla is not alone in its quest for Holcim's assets, which generate $4.4 billion of sales and has 10,000 people on the rolls. Birla has, however, climbed down from the earlier plan to bid for all assets, which could have cost as much as $9 billion, as analysts raised concern over increased debt burden on UltraTech in the event of bidding for assets.
Apart from the Birlas, Irish cement maker CRH, Cemex and Germany's HeidelbergCement and Brazilian firm Votorantim Cimentos are considering a joint bid for the entire portfolio. The bids can also be made for assets in a particular geography and, hence, over 100 bids are expected from around the world.
At least four marquee private equity firms are also eyeing the entire portfolio, media reports from New York said. Private equity firms BC Partners, Advent and Temasek have teamed up to make a bid. CVC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are the second bidders, while Singapore's GIC, Bain and Onex form the third group and Blackstone, Cinven and Canadian pension fund CPP are the fourth consortium in the race.
If Birla wins the race, it will catapult the group among the top cement makers in the world. The group is one of the largest cement companies in India with 62 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity. Rival Holcim and Lafarge will have a capacity of 57.5 mtpa once the two merge in India.
UltraTech stock closed unchanged at Rs 2,477 a share on Thursday. The stock has gone up by 41 per cent this year compared to a 36 per cent jump in BSE Sensex this year.

RBI will create a framework for licensing small banks and other differentiated banks. Differentiated banks serving niche interests, local area banks, payment banks etc. are contemplated to meet credit and remittance needs of small businesses, unorganized sector, low income households, farmers and migrant work force".

Cricket world reacts to Phil Hughes’ death
Australia cricketer Phillip Hughes passed away on November 27, 2014 in Sydney following a head injury he had incurred in a Sheffield Shield match on November 25. During this game for South Australia against New South Wales, Hughes was batting on 63 when he was struck on the right side of his head by a bouncer from pace bowler Sean Abbott.

Phil Hughes will forever be remembered as one of Australian cricket's free spirits. Hughes had been in an out of the Australian national team for the past five years but had been pushing for re-selection. As a batsman he had his flaws, but those imperfections seemed to make him even more popular.
The Australian public loved his fighting spirit and boisterous nature, a kid from the bush who made it to the top but never changed as a person.

Ferguson protests dwindle as businesses regroupAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
As demonstrations in California heated up overnight, the robust protests in Ferguson dwindled in size and severity, a change from the days immediately following the grand jury decision not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old.
People have begun cleaning up the battered suburban community of Ferguson and seeking something closer to normal. Meanwhile, a group gathered in downtown St. Louis on Thursday morning for what the organizer called a ”pro-community” car cruise.
Organizer Paul Byrd said the cruise – which consisted of a few vehicles – was meant to be peaceful and to counteract the violence seen earlier this week in Ferguson after Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted in the fatal August shooting of Michael Brown.
Byrd, a 45-year-old construction worker from Imperial, Missouri, declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted, ”I totally support police officers.” The cruise, which started near Busch Stadium, was escorted by a city police vehicle. No protesters showed up.
The racially charged case has stoked passions nationwide, triggering debates over the relationship between black communities and law enforcement.
There were no reports of major confrontations or damage to property in Ferguson overnight – where about a 100 people marched in a light snow and St. Louis County police said there were only two arrests. Troops with rifles were posted at intersections and parking lots in an area where stores were looted and burned Monday into Tuesday.
Since the grand jury’s decision was announced, demonstrators have been active in other cities throughout the U.S. Most have been peaceful. But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night, while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism, according to police officials.
Ferguson business owners and residents on Wednesday covered up broken windows, cleared away debris and hoped the relative calm would last into Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday.
The footage people see on the news ”is such a small bit of what’s happening here,” said Kari Hobbs, 28. ”There’s so much donation and charity going on with the businesses that have been affected and the people that have been affected.”
There were no seats inside Cathy’s Kitchen – a restaurant near the Ferguson Police Department that had windows smashed during the violence – and a line had formed at the back of the building. Jerome Jenkins, who runs the restaurant with his wife, Cathy, said he never considered closing his doors.
”It really wasn’t about wondering if the building would get torched or not,” Jenkins said. ”Me and my wife, we expected it to get damaged … we decided to go home, and we would live with whatever fate would give us.”

Post your opinion here
 
The government is considering a plan to reduce stakes in state-run banks to 52 percent that could enable it to raise about 891.2 billion rupees (USD 14.39 billion), Jayant Sinha, junior finance minister told lawmakers on Friday.
The government holds stakes ranging from 56 percent to 84 percent in the state-run banks that account for 70 percent of India's total outstanding loans of about USD1 trillion.
"The reduction of government of India share in equity capital of PSBs (public sector banks) to 52 percent will enable mobilisation of about 891.20 billion rupees," Sinha said in a written statement.
He said the stake sale will enable the government to scale back its budgetary support for the banks.
India's 26 state-run banks, which include State Bank of India ,  Bank of Baroda need as much as USD 60 billion in new capital over the next few years to meet upcoming global regulations and to build a buffer against rising bad loans.
According to the central bank's estimates, the government would need to inject as much as 2.4 trillion rupees into state-owned banks by end March 2019 to meet capital requirements including Basel III, provisioning for asset quality, and additional risks.
Officials in the finance ministry say the federal cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to take a final decision on the issue of stake sale soon.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is concerned about mounting bad assets of the state-run banks - estimated at 2.16 trillion rupees at the end of previous fiscal year - has promised to take steps to improve their performance.

In the broader market, BSE midcap index, up 1.3% is outperforming its larger peers while BSE smallcap index is marginally underperforming with a gain of 0.8%. Market breadth in BSE is positive with 1,528 advances against 838 declines.
 
Scaling a new peak, the total investor wealth in Indian stock market today hit a record high of Rs 100 trillion, marking a jump of ten times in little over a decade.
 
The total market cap of all BSE listed companies had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003 and the Rs 50 lakh crore mark in 2009. The 30 Sensex companies alone, which are among the biggest companies in the country, now account for nearly 50% or about Rs 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
 
This includes TCS, the country's most valued firm and the only entity to have a market value of over Rs 5 lakh crore, followed by state-run ONGC and private sector behemoth Reliance Industries with market caps of over Rs 3 lakh crore each.
 
Those commanding market cap of over Rs 2 lakh crore include ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, SBI and Coal India. Besides, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, HUL, Bharti Airtel, L&T, Wipro, Tata Motors, HCL Tech, NTPC and Axis Bank have market cap of over Rs 1 lakh crore each. Among these, ICICI Bank is very close to moving into Rs 2 lakh crore club.
 
Of the overall stock market wealth, promoters command nearly 50% share, while foreign investors own close to 20% and the rest is shared between institutional and retail investors from India.
 
Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in Indian equities worth Rs 389.73 crore on Thursday, as per provisional stock exchange data.
 
The rupee was trading at 61.91, slightly higher compared with Thursday's 61.87 close. Month-end dollar demand from importers is likely to hurt the Indian unit.

As expected PM Modi will go vegan during the SAARC summit in Kathmandu, while Pakistan premier Nawaz Sharif will relish Halal meat dishes.
It is a simple vegetarian spread “with less spices and oil” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif is having halal meat dishes during their stay in Nepal for the SAARC Summit.
Hotel Crowne Plaza Kathmandu—Soaltee, where the SAARC leaders including Sharif and Modi are staying for the two-day Summit, has taken special care of the tastes and preferences of the visiting leaders.
“Modi is having simple vegetarian food with less spices and less oil, while for Sharif, halal meat dishes are prepared,” a hotel staff involved in preparing the cuisines said.
For lunch, Modi takes jeera rice with dal and two types of vegetables besides tawa roti and vegetable soup. He also takes plain curd and Masala Chaas with his food.
“Instructions have been given to make the dishes less oily and less spicy with less use of paneer,” he said.
For dinner, the Prime Minister prefers Khichadi with Gujrati curry, dal and roti, while for dessert, he takes mixed fruit.
His breakfast comprises mixed fruits, utappam or idly and digestive biscuits, along with tea.
For Pakistani Premier Sharif, halal meats are prepared.
He also prefers fish with special Pakistani preparation and takes organic chicken or mutton for lunch and dinner. For dessert, he prefers saffron kheer.

Now  black shawls to raise black money issue in LSNow, black shawls to raise black money issue in Lok Sabha

After black umbrellas, it was black shawls that Trinamool Congress members used in Lok Sabha on Thursday to rake up the issue of black money.
As soon as the Question Hour commenced, TMC members entered the House draped in black shawls. They raised slogans like 'kala dhan wapas lao' (bring back black money) before taking seats.
Unlike earlier occasions, they did not disrupt the proceedings on Thursday. Anguished over display of slogan-written umbrellas inside Lok Sabha by TMC members, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had on Wednesday warned them not to force her take action against erring parliamentarians.
There are provisions for disciplinary action against erring members. We are the ones who should be seen as ideal people.
Let me not take action. Allow me to run the House smoothly without taking any action, she had said.
Her comments came after Trinamool Congress members on Tuesday brought in black umbrellas with anti-government slogans painted on them to highlight the demand for bringing back black money stashed away abroad.

India lagging behind in exploiting bauxite reserves'India lagging behind in exploiting bauxite reserves'
Our Bureau
Tweet
Visakahapatnam, Nov 27:  
India is lagging behind in exploiting its bauxite reserves and in aluminium production due to certain "misplaced concerns" over ecological issues and due to other factors, according to several experts in the field.
They were speaking here at the inaugural of the three-day international seminar on bauxite mining and aluminium production organised by the International Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminium Society (IBAAS) in association with several other organisations. Over 200 delegates, several from abroad, attended the seminar.
Vedanta Resources CEO Tom Albanese in his key-note address said India was lagging behind in exploiting its bauxite reserves, though the country had quality bauxite ore in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha in the eastern ghats. He blamed it on certain negative propaganda and misplaced concerns over ecological issues. Even though technologies were available for sustained exploitation of the reserves and development of the industry in an eco-friendly fashion, these notions were persisting to the detriment of the growth of the industry. The industry should make sustained efforts to dispel these notions.
He said raw material security was the key factor worrying those seeking to invest in the aluminium sector and steps should be taken to address the concerns.
H. Mahadevan, the president (projects) of Anrak, said that red tapism and "misplaced commotion over red mud and other so-called ecological issues" were impeding the aluminium refinery projects and bauxite mining in the eastern ghats.
He said there would always be "a certain degree of ecological disturbance engendered by any sort of mining, but as long as there is no long-term ecological degradation, the activity should not stopped on that count and it should be carried out withl long-term and sustainable safeguards and precautions."
Describing aluminium as a green metal, he said it had definitively been proven that there would not be any long-term eco degradation in the area under bauxite mining and "in fact usually in the area where bauxite reserves are found there is not much greenery and the groundwater level is also negligible. After mining the greenery improves in the area and groundwater level also increases."
He also said aluminium can be recycled infinitely, and with low energy consumption, and "therefore it will not be lost to the posterity." He said of the ten projects sanctioned in the Eastern Ghats, "only one is fully operational and two are partly operational and the rest are languishing due to various reasons. It is regrettable."
He said it was also the responsibility of the industry to dispel these concerns about ecological issues and enlist the co-operation of the local communities to undertake bauxite minining on a long-term basis and in a sustained manner. He emphasised the need for value-addition and setting up the most modern refineries.

A year after Apple introduced iPhone 5C with a colorful plastic body, it is now preparing to roll it back, a report said.
Priced at 99 dollars on contract and 549 dollars off contract in the United States, the device was touted as Apple's "budget phone," meant to target emerging markets like India and China.
However, it was not received well by consumers, who were much excited about the pricier iPhone 5S, reported The Huffington Post.
The 5S outsold 5C in some places by margins as high as 5 to 1 in the days after the launch.
If the rumours are to be believed then Apple may discontinue the product in the middle of next year.
However, the information has not been verified by Apple yet.

Chipmaker Intel for stronger Indian trade se...Intel wants government to strengthen protection for trade secrets under IPR policy

(Intel has a design and development centre in Bengaluru for…)
NEW DELHI: Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of computer chips, has called on the Indian government to strengthen protection for trade secrets under the intellectual property rights policy, raising concerns that the current regime is not strong enough. It has even asked for criminal sanctions to discourage theft.
Information is vulnerable to theft by employees or to being leaked when regulatory filings are made, said an expert.
"A lot of vital information of MNCs gets leaked in Bengaluru. It is indeed a concern for these global IT players. As they expand their R&D and innovation in India, a tough law to protect trade secrets will give these companies confidence," said the person.
US Trade Representative Michael Froman had also raised the issue of trade secrets with his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman at the bilateral trade and investment dialogue on Tuesday.
Intel has a design and development centre in Bengaluru for key products and is expanding its high-end technology research and development efforts. It sought a tightening of the rules in its letter to the government and the panel that's drafting the country's intellectual property rights (IPR) policy.
"As India continues to grow in IT and innovation, it needs to depart from the British model of contractual protection and to elevate trade secrets to a genuine IP right with statutory protection with specific criminal sanctions," Intel said.
Intel said such a move would increase investor confidence. The company didn't specify any particular incident of secrets being stolen. Intel couldn't be reached for a response on any specific cases related to this matter.
The Narendra Modi government is looking to attract foreign investment through its 'Make in India' drive and is also urging overseas companies to set up R&D facilities in the country.
California-based Intel argued that unlike patent rights, which eventually expire, trade secrets need to be protected for an unlimited duration.
Trade secrets protection may be important for startups as they may not the have resources to patent their innovation, it added. The letter included comments related to other aspects of IPR as well, such as copyrights and patents.
The US Uniform Trade Secrets Act is a state law enacted by 47 states so far. Besides, the US expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts last year over cases related to misappropriation of trade secrets by enacting the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act.
According to reports, an ex-Intel employee in the US was sentenced to three years in prison for stealing secrets worth $1 billion and using them to help a rival company in 2008.
On the discussions with USTR Froman at the bilateral trade policy forum, a government official said that while India does not have trade secrets protection legislation, the country has a law of contracts, which is what the courts rely on. "We said we will exchange our papers on the legal regime. We will exchange legal documents, to better understand each other's laws," he said.

Piyush Goyal: Coal block auction to be completed by March 31Disinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Coal minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said e-auctioning of the canceled coal blocks would be completed by March 31, 2015. In case the bidding process is delayed, then a designated authority has been empowered by a recently promulgated ordinance to would take over the mines.
Replying to a query in the Lok Sabha, Goyal said as per the Supreme Court’s Order on September, 36 coal blocks can continue to produce fuel till March 31, 2015. Efforts are on to complete e-auctioning of identified mines in a transparent manner.
“However, in case the auctioning is delayed, then the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance 2014 empowers a designated authority to take over the mines, which could not be bidded out,” he said.
The envisaged production from following auctioning in the first round of coal blocks would be around 200 million tonne, Goyal informed the House.
After the Supreme Court cancelled the allocation of 204 blocks in September, the government has set a target to auction 72 mines in the first phase by March 31.
“As regards financial implication of the judgment on the coal sector, the total amount of additional levy payable by the allocatees of producing blocks for coal produced or likely to be produced up to March 31, 2015 is estimated at Rs 10,494.36 crore,” a PTI report quoted Goyal as saying. He countered Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia who said that cancellation of mines has created a ‘crisis’ for the government, by saying that it is an opportunity, not a crisis for it will help clean up the sector.

(Of late, Pappu Yadav has…)
PATNA: Laid low by the humiliating drubbing in the Lok Sabha elections, RJD is now troubled by its over-ambitious MP from Madhepura, Rajesh Ranjan, alias, Pappu Yadav. A section of the party has openly backed the burly politician who has tried to portray the image of Robin Hood image in Bihar's North Kosi and Seemanchal area.
Of late, Pappu Yadav has become very active, as he sees an opportunity to become a political mascot of the numerically strong Yadavs as RJD chief Lalu Prasad has been forced to take a back seat due to health reasons and conviction in a case.
Pappu Yadav had charted an independent course by floating the Yuva Shakti Sanghathan and launched agitations against doctors but the RJD leadership has reasons to believe that he has been buttressing his case at the expense of the party.
"RJD youth workers have been asked to keep away from the Yuva Shakti Sanghthan of Pappu Yadav. The party will initiate action against them if they are found participating in the programmes. Yuva Shakti is not a frontal organisation of RJD, nor has it any right to use the party's flag for any purpose" RJD president Ramchander Purve said, hinting at action against Yadav for breaching party discipline. The five-term MP, as acquitted in the Ajit Sarkar murder case in 2013, however, remains unfazed despite the warning of the party leadership .
"Laluji is our undisputed leader, and we are fighting for the cause of the poor people. Again Yuva Shakti is an organisation which is fighting for the rights of impoverished and downtrodden. Bu those who want to weaken the party are issuing statements against me. These people don't have any ideology nor they have any base," the MP said.
Lalu Prasad's popularity notwithstanding, the MP commands a following of his own in Seemanchal and Kosi. He had even won from Purnea Lok Sabha seat as an independent candidate and fared better than JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav in Madhepura. His wife Ranjita Ranjan is a Congress MP form adjoining Supaul seat.

WTO resolves impasse  inks first global trade deal in historyWTO inks its first global trade deal, takes India's concerns on board

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has adopted the first worldwide trade reform in its history, after years of stalemate, months of deadlock and a final day's delay following an eleventh-hour objection.
The historic trade facilitation agreement (TFA) would now need to be ratified by governments of individual member countries, including India, for coming into effect which is expected some time next year.
Ending months-long deadlock, WTO on Thursday approved a trade facilitation pact while agreeing to India's demand for continuing the peace clause till a permanent solution is found to the food stockpiling issue, crucial for continuing food security scheme.
"Until a permanent solution is agreed and adopted...(WTO) members shall not challenge through the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism, compliance of a developing Member with its obligations ...of the Agreement on Agriculture in relation to support provided for traditional staple food crops in pursuance of public stock-holding programmes for food security purposes existing as of the date of the Bali Decision ," WTO said.
WTO's General Council, the highest decision making body, met in Geneva on Thursday and accepted India's demand for extending the peace clause till a permanent solution is found for its food stockpiling issue.
It said that if a permanent solution for the issue of public stock-holding is not agreed and adopted by the 11th Ministerial Conference (2017), "the mechanism...shall continue to be in place until a permanent solution is agreed and adopted".
On TFA, it said that the pact for easing customs norm was adopted by WTO members for acceptance.
On the positive development in Geneva, WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said this is a very important moment for the multi-lateral trade body.
"By agreeing these three decisions we have put ourselves back in the game. We have put our negotiating work back on track... that means all the Bali decisions: trade facilitation, public stock-holding, the LDC (least developed countries) issues, the decisions on agriculture, development, and all of the other elements," he said.
Thursday's decision is crucial for India to meet over Rs 1 lakh crore a year food security programme, which needs 62 million tonnes of foodgrain in a year.
This will enable India to continue procurement and stocking of foodgrain for distribution to poor under its food security programme without attracting any kind of action from WTO members.

What threatens Apple Here s what has experts worriedWhat threatens Apple? Here's what has pros worried

Loic Venance | AFP | Getty Images
Apple's ( AAPL ) share price has been on a tear this year, but perhaps the company has come a little too far too fast.
During the last year, the tech giant's stock price has soared more than 50 percent and on Tuesday the company's market capitalization reached a record $700 billion. But now the lingering question is how long can the momentum last?
Read More Apple's market cap hits $700B, doubles under Cook
"The stock has done really well, largely from the fact that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have been a big success for these guys. So the question is how far can this keep sustaining?" said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
And while it's difficult to find an analyst on Wall Street who is bearish on Apple, even those who have a "buy" or "outperform" rating on the stock see some perils for the company.
Read More At new highs, Apple only starting to ripen: Analysts
Here's a look at some risks that bullish analysts are watching.
Apple's iPhone sales account for more than half of the company's revenue. And because the new iPhone 6 models feature significant hardware and software updates, it's widely expected that the upgrade cycle will have legs well into 2015.
Wall Street estimates Apple will ship more than 60 million iPhones in the first quarter, according to StreetAccount. One estimate by the well-connected KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo even projects iPhone sales will reach 71.5 million for the holiday quarter.
Optimism about the potential for a longer upgrade cycle even has analysts setting the bar high for iPhones sales well beyond 2015. But perhaps they have set the bar too high.
"The big concern I see is not being able to live up to the huge expectations they have now," said Louis Basenese, founder of Disruptive Tech Research.
"They had a great launch of the iPhone 6 and the estimates are very aggressive for unit volumes. It's a contrarian indicator, but the analysts now are extremely bullish and their revised price targets are already underwater and you get concerned it's come a little too far too fast and you look at what causes shares to correct and I think it would be missing expectations for unit volumes," said Basenese, who is long-term bullish on Apple.
Another fear is that iPhone sales could hit a wall in 2015 because of its success rate, RBC's Daryanani said.
The iPhone is on track to capture almost 70 percent of the high-end smartphone market ($300 or more) in the next few months, at which point the company could possibly face some market saturation concerns, said Daryanani, who has an "outperform" rating on the stock with a $120 price target.
"If you are looking at having 70 percent market share in the next few months, you have to ask where is the new opportunity or where are the new revenue drivers for them?" he said. "So you have a hit point where you run into some saturation in the market. In the next six months this could become an issue."
While many analysts expect Apple's expansion in China to continue to be a catalyst for iPhone sales, increased competition from smartphone makers who sell at a lower price point could pose a threat to the company's success in the region.
Read More Apple locks in key partnership in China
"China is the single-biggest swing factor. But it's also the largest untapped opportunity," said Alex Gauna, an analyst with JMP Securities.
While China's growing wireless infrastructure means more smartphones in the region, it doesn't mean the iPhone will be the dominant player.
Gauna, who has an "outperform" rating on Apple's stock with a $135 price target, said that some Chinese handset makers, like Xiaomi, are doing very well and that could pose a threat to the iPhone maker.
Read More China's Xiaomi makes strides in smartphone race
"Xiaomi has been very, very successful. So they could have the potential to create the same headache that Samsung (Korea Stock Exchange: 593-KR) created for Apple two years ago," Daryanani said.
While Wall Street is hopeful that the Apple Watch will be a new revenue generator, the company still runs the risk of weak consumer adoption.
"I think the Watch, does it really become the next product for them or is it just a cool accessory? They need it to be the next product, a new category for them. If it's not, if it doesn't become one like some of the other smartwatches out there, that's a downside risk," Basenese said.
Poor battery life, not enough use cases and high price point are just a few of the things that could also deter consumers from purchasing the device, industry experts said.
"It's probably the use cases and the battery life. Why does one need to go out and buy an Apple watch, suddenly having a product that needs to be charged every day? It's not the most convenient thing," Daryanani said.
Still, though, Daryanani said that he estimates Apple will begin selling the devices in March and will sell 20 million units at an average price of $520 in 2015. In total, he predicts that Apple Watch sales will come to $10 billion in additional revenue and 40 cents in earnings per share. Given that the Apple Watch is only compatible with models of the iPhone 5 or later, though, he said estimates should remain conservative.
Besides adoption of the watch, investors should also be keeping an eye on how well Apple Pay fares, Basenese said.
"If traction isn't significant right out of the gate, they are going to be playing catch up. Apple will have to explain why they aren't getting more adoption," Basenese said. "They have the credit cards on file, they have the smartphones in peoples' hands, there are plenty of places where consumers can use it. Explaining why they don't have traction, would become a significant problem."
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, the company seems confident of its chances for success. CEO Tim Cook said during Apple's last earnings conference call that demand for the iPhone 6 is "off the charts." He also said that "we are heading into the holiday season with Apple's strongest product lineup ever." And "we are also incredibly excited about the Apple Watch and other great products and services in the pipeline for 2015."
Apple also predicts that it will sell more products in the three months leading up to January than it did in all of 2010.

Cardamom up by 1.2% on firm demandCardamom up by 1.2% on firm demand
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Nov 28, 2014 12:30 PM IST
Cardamom prices rose by 1.26% to Rs 799.40 per kg in futures trade today as speculators indulged in creating fresh positions driven by firm demand in the spot market.
Further, tight supplies in the physical market following restricted arrivals from producing belts also supported the uptrend.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, cardamom for December contracts rose by Rs 10, or 1.26%, to Rs 799.40 per kg, with a trading volume of 339 lots.
The spice for delivery in January 2014 was trading up by Rs 5.90, or 0.69%, to Rs 855 per kg, with a business volume of 60 lots.
Traders said rising export and spot demand against restricted arrivals from producing regions mainly influenced cardamom prices at futures market.

Uber crackdown: Colombians protest ban on ride-share companyCourt refuses to let off Hindalco in coal block allocation case
Furious taxi drivers and loyal users of Uber are butting heads over Colombia’s new ban on the ride-sharing company.
Amid threats of a strike by yellow taxis who consider cars affiliated with Uber to be “pirates”, the Transportation Ministry this week declared illegal all smartphone applications that facilitate the hiring of cabs that aren’t registered for that purpose.
Taxi drivers fearing a loss of business from Uber’s credit card-only, spruced-up service have challenged the company on similar grounds in many of the 50 countries around the world where it operates.
But the service has won a large following in Colombian cities since arriving a year ago. The reason is simple: a fear of being ripped off by doctored meters or even assaulted by taxi drivers with a reputation for violence.
What’s known as a “millionaire’s ride,” where assailants in cahoots with cabbies jump into a car and force passengers at gunpoint to empty their bank accounts at cash machines, are a top public safety concern. Last year, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official was killed in a botched robbery attempt. His assailants, seven taxi drivers, were extradited to the United States.
”When I use Uber I don’t feel like I’m being robbed,” Andrea Zapata told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ”It’s frustrating that they’re not allowed to operate.”
Cabbies say drivers of the increasingly ubiquitous white SUVs and sedans affiliated with Uber don’t face the same restrictions or pay the high fees and taxes required of yellow cabs. Licenses for such cars are supposed to be reserved for drivers servicing hotels, schools and other specially designated clients.
”Using this service is the same as buying smuggled goods,” said Jose Rodriguez, president of the National Transporters Association.
Ana Paula Blanco, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Uber, told Blu radio on Wednesday that the company hadn’t been notified of any ban and continues to operate normally. She said Uber is committed to resolving any regulatory concerns in Colombia but insisted that the company, as a provider of technology, isn’t violating any laws and that its affiliated drivers are registered under Colombian norms.

Volcano in south Japan erupts  disrupting flightsBy: Associated Press | Tokyo |
Posted: November 28, 2014 11:47 am
A volcano in southern Japan is blasting out chunks of magma in the first such eruption in 22 years, causing flight cancellations and prompting warnings to stay away from its crater.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said Friday that Mount Aso had spewed out lava debris and smoke, shooting plumes of ash a kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky. Dozens of flights from Kumamoto, the nearest city, have been canceled.
The observatory does not expect the eruption to increase in scale. Mount Aso, about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) southwest of Tokyo on Kyushu island, is one of the world’s largest. Earthquakes and other seismic activity stepped up in late August.
Eruptions by another volcano, Mount Ontake, in Nagano west of Tokyo killed more than 50 people in late September.

Modi @ SAARC: Will make investments in regionNarendra Modi woos Saarc nations, pledges slew of investments to counter China

(Modi said India would fund…)
KATHMANDU: India pledged a slew of regional investments at Saarc summit this week, seeking to counter China's growing economic inroads into its backyard as it remains embroiled in bitter rivalry with Pakistan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would fund regional infrastructure, health facilities and even a communications satellite, and promised to free up its markets to exporters in smaller countries in the region.
Modi has made clear that boosting India's influence in its immediate neighbourhood is a key strategic priority for his government.
Critics say the previous Congress party government began to take relationships for granted, allowing economic giant China — which shares a border with four of India's neighbours — to step into the breach.
But the failure of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) to make any significant progress during a two-day meeting underscored the scale of the challenge New Delhi faces.
Cross-border trade among the eight Saarc nations — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — still accounts for less than five percent of total commerce in the region.
"Indians want to keep South Asia as their exclusive sphere of influence," said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs in Delhi.
"To do that... we need to play the economic game and we need to play the connectivity game better. We have been protectionist, and that is not good," he said, welcoming Modi's pledge to help smaller nations reduce their trade deficits with India.
Leaders signed just one agreement, on energy cooperation, at a summit that was overshadowed by the rivalries between India and Pakistan, leading host country Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala to say that Saarc had fallen short of expectations.
Nepal, long under the political influence of New Delhi, has benefited hugely from China's bounty over the last decade, getting much-needed new roads and other infrastructure. Even the venue where the leaders met was built with Chinese money.
It is among several Saarc nations including Pakistan and Sri Lanka that reportedly support full membership for China, which currently enjoys observer status in the regional grouping.
India has resisted promoting its regional rival to full membership status, which comes with the power to veto agreements.
Frustrated by the slow pace of progress towards regional cooperation, it has also sought to woo its neighbours outside the Saarc framework.
Modi held separate meetings with all the Saarc leaders except Pakistan's on the summit's sidelines, and agreed a deal to invest in a major hydropower plant in Nepal shortly after arriving.
But China has deeper pockets than India, which also suffers from a reputation for unwanted interference in the domestic affairs of some of its neighbours.
Nepalese newspapers criticised Modi for urging the country's leaders to complete a constitution-drafting process that has dragged on for years shortly after he landed.
"While his advice is correct, the place and context were wrong," the Republica daily said in an editorial, accusing the Indian leader of violating "diplomatic decorum".
Analyst Tanvi Madan of the Washington-based Brookings Institution said it was natural for the smaller Saarc states to cozy up to China.
"Indian policymakers and analysts objecting loudly to these links is futile and, arguably, counterproductive," she wrote in a briefing paper ahead of the summit.
"An effective Indian approach requires presenting a viable alternative. It means convincing Saarc countries that it wants to take them along on the path to economic prosperity."

India s guar growers chase new marketsAs the shale dream fades, India's guar growers chase new markets

Guar gum
(India was in an enviable…)
MUMBAI: Sitting in his village in the desert state of Rajasthan, Sehdev Bishnoi worries that oil firms a world away in the United States will buy less of his guar in future, ending a short-lived boom that helped him and other Indian farmers out of poverty.
Food firms are also buyers and the sector is likely to take more this year as traders scout out new markets, but it will be hard to match the impact made by oil industry demand in recent years.
Drillers use the gum derived from guar, also known as cluster beans, for hydraulic fracturing and many poor farmers switched crops to ride the US shale boom.
Guar gum exports had been ticking along at around 200,000 tonnes a year until 2009/10, but as US frackers stocked up, shipments jumped to a record of about 700,000 tonnes in the financial year to March 2012. Prices jumped tenfold.
India was in an enviable position, with around 80 per cent of the guar market. Its guar seed output has almost tripled in the past three years to 3 million tonnes.
However, its crop can be unreliable due to swings in monsoon rains, and oilfield service firms such as Halliburton started developing more reliable alternatives, with predictable results: guar seed prices have slumped 47 per cent to 4,900 rupees ($79.112) per 100 kg since May 2013.
"I'll make a loss at these prices because production costs have gone up but prices are so low," said Bishnoi, whose state produces about 80 per cent of India's guar seed output.
A collapse in oil prices to four-year lows has added to the anguish.
"This is worrying everyone. Below $75 per barrel it's not profitable for the fracking companies to continue operations," said BD Agarwal, managing director of Vikas WSP, an exporter of guar gum in Rajasthan.
No wonder that Indian farmers and traders are scrambling to find other markets, with the food industry the best bet.
FOOD AND TEXTILES
At the moment, about 60 per cent of the flour-like gum obtained after milling guar is used in shale drilling to raise the viscosity of proppants, materials that are forced into shale fractures to enlarge them so that oil and gas can be extracted.
  The food industry is already the second-biggest buyer. Guar gum acts as a stabiliser in sauces and noodles and prevents the formation of ice crystals in frozen desserts such as ice cream.
Guar is also used by the textile industry as a thickening agent for printing dyes and its by-products are used as high-protein cattle feed. It takes 3 kg of guar seeds to make 1 kg of guar gum.
Traders are hoping the drop in prices will encourage more food firms to pick up guar gum rather than alternatives such as locust bean gum, derived from the seeds of the carob tree.
"Demand from oil firms has come down due to rising use of alternatives such as slickwater and other things, but inquiries from food companies have improved at lower prices," said Purshottam Hissaria, an exporter in Jodhpur.
Guar gum consumption by food companies in the fiscal year to March is likely to rise 13 per cent to 35,000 tonnes, said Sohan Jain, an exporter of food-grade gum mainly to Europe.
With the food industry taking up some of the slack from the oil sector, albeit at much lower prices, India's guar gum exports this fiscal year may be slightly higher than the 475,000 tonnes shipped last year, Hissaria said.
Even so, farmers such as Bishnoi are considering their options.
"Guar has not remained as profitable as it was a few years ago," he said. "Next year I will sow some other crop."

The Indian tablet market reported a strong third quarter, clocking 8 per cent growth over the previous quarter. Tablet makers shipped 0.94 million units in the third quarter of 2014, said International Data Corporation (IDC).
In the previous quarter (Q2), tablet market shipments in India stood at 0.86 million (mn), a 9 per cent growth over the first quarter of the year.
"The initial phase of impulsive buying seems to have faded, as the consumers are more aware of the use case of tablets now. Therefore the current size of the market looks more realistic and stable," said Tanvi Mann, Market Analyst, IDC India.
Among operating systems, Android was clearly the leader with over 90 per cent marketshare. Android is expected to dominate the market in the foreseeable future as well, said IDC.
Sub $200 Windows tablets are expected to see better adoption. Overall, tablet sales have grown slower than expected because of the greater adoption of 'Phablets'.
Samsung continued to corner a large portion of the market, followed by Micromax and iBall. Micromax saw a 15 per cent decline in the quarter compared to the previous quarter. IDC said that iBall is making inroads into be market quickly in the tablet segment.
According to the market research firm, commercial segment is likely to grow in comparison to a stable consumer market in 2015. Government projects and government aided education projects should remain key to the growth in the commercial tablets, said IDC.

UDHAMPUR: Fresh firing today erupted near the Arnia border belt of Jammu district when security forces launched a cordon and search operation to track down a militant hiding in a bunker and retrieve bodies of civilians killed in a gunbattle.
A day after militants attacked two Army bunkers close to the Indo-Pak border leaving 10 people, including three civilians and as many army men dead in a gun battle, security forces launched an operation to track down the holed up ultra.
An Army official said that security forces, who had launched a cordon and search operation at the site of encounter in Arnia this morning to retrieve bodies of civilians, came under fire from a militant hiding in a bunker triggering fresh exchanges.
The engagement with the militants is going on when the reports last came in, the officials said.
Bodies of the three civilians could not be taken out yesterday in view of the gun fight, he said, adding search for another militant was also launched simultaneously.
In a terror strike on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jammu Division, militants wearing combat uniform had yesterday attacked two Army bunkers close to the Indo-Pak border leaving 10 people dead.
The dead also included four heavily armed militants who were holed up in a bunker after they were suspected to have infiltrated into Arnia sector from across the border in Jammu district to carry out a fidayeen attack.
Army used tanks in the operation with an intention to blast the bunker, where the lone surviving militant has taken shelter during the encounter.

Nepal: Mass animal slaughter underway despite protestsprint
Gadhimai Mela, the world's biggest animal fair held once every five years, began at Bariyarpur in Bara district of Nepal bordering Bihar on Friday.
Thousands of buffaloes, mostly calves, were sacrificed at an enclosed field close to the temple of Goddess Gadhimai, a Hindu deity, believed by devotees to grant wishes if they sacrifice animals and birds.
But unlike previous occasions, the total number of sacrifices is expected to be much lesser this time due to efforts by animal rights activists and a ban on bringing animals to the fair from India.
Every five years, the world’s largest animal sacrifice takes place at the Gadhimai Temple in Nepal. The month-long festival has raised controversy due to the large number of animals killed – up to 500,000 over two days. (AP Photo)
Sacrifices at the fair began on Thursday night with 'pancha bali'---where five animals—a pig, pigeons, duck, hen and rat were offered to the goddess by the priest of the temple.
The sacrifice of buffaloes began early on Friday morning where hundreds of locals armed with swords, machetes and khukuris started the mass killing.
Hundreds of thousands of devotees from all over Nepal and from neighbouring India are converging at the site and many have brought animals are birds along to offer the goddess.
"Over 1300 police personnel have been deployed near the temple to manage the smooth flow of devotees. Routine checking is also being conducted," said a local police officer.
The ritual continues for two days and on the second day goats are sacrificed. Devotees and residents of villages near the temple sacrifice rats, pigeons, ducks, hens and goats themselves.
Nearly 25,000 buffaloes were killed during the 2009 fair, but there is no data on the total number of animals and birds sacrificed. Some estimate it to be around 500,000.
This year due to efforts of animal rights activists to spread awareness and make people desist from offering animals and birds to appease the goddess, the figure is expected to be much less.
"Besides faith there is a network of vested interests who want to promote the killings to earn profits," Indian activist Swami Agnivesh who is camping near to temple to stop the sacrifices told a Nepali news channel.

Last month India's Supreme Court directed the government to enforce a ban on illegal entry of animals to Nepal especially for the Gadhimai Mela.
Usually nearly 70% of the buffaloes and goats sacrificed at the fair come from India. But enforcement of the ban has led to drop in figures.
It was estimated that nearly 5,000 buffaloes were sacrificed within few hours on Friday morning. The killings will continue on Saturday.
A news report says nearly 125,000 goats have been sold in local markets near the temple in the past three months. They will be sacrificed on Saturday.

Fresh gunfight in Arnia hours ahead of PM Modi s visit to Jammu and KashmirArnia encounter over, 5 civilians among 12 dead

"The encounter has ended and boys did a good job by preventing the militants from striking anywhere," Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police K Rajendra told PTI.
"In all, we have lost three army personnel and five civilians. All the four militants have been killed," he said, after the end of the encounter this morning which lasted over 24 hours following the fidayeen attack.
On Thursday, it was stated that four militants were killed and one more was still holed up in an army bunker which came under attack. Officials said there was some confusion on establishing the identity of one the dead on Thursday.
The operation to neutralise the militants began Thursday morning and went on throughout the day but was suspended during the night.

Piecing together the events that led to the attack, sources in the security establishment said all the four terrorists had entered India from across the Indo-Pak border during the intervening night of November 26 and 27 and were hiding behind a culvert when they were spotted by Territorial Army personnel.
A fierce gunbattle then ensued and the terrorists who were in combat fatigues later entered two abandoned bunkers and remained holed up before three of them were neutralised.
Security officials suspected that the militants wanted to carry out a sensational strike in the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir to coincide with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held a poll rally in Udhampur on Friday. The venue of the rally was about 100 km from Arnia.
On November 26, Pakistani rangers had fired on some posts in Arnia sector and by the time the troops could retaliate, the four militants are believed to have infiltrated into the state, official sources said. BSF, which guards the International Border(IB), maintains there was no sign of infiltration.
The five civilians who died also included two people who had tried to flee from the car, in which they were travelling, when it got caught in the cross-fire between militants and security personnel.

Delhi schools can now set nursery admission guidelines: HCNursery relief at last, HC gives schools more say
Soibam Rocky Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014

Holding out hope that nursery admissions this time round won’t be the mess they were last year, the Delhi high court on Friday empowered private unaided schools in the Capital to fix their own criteria, quashing last year’s government-mandated points-based system.
The court also restored the 20% management quota followed by schools before it was scrapped last year. With admission season just around the corner, the verdict effectively gives private schools “maximum autonomy in day-to-day administration, including right to admit students”.
The Delhi government plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, leading to apprehension of protracted litigation and, thereby, of a repeat of last year’s chaos.
In 2013, schools had reluctantly followed lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung’s points-based system that earmarked a massive 70 points for neighbourhood, 20 for siblings and 5 for alumni while doing away with the management quota. Five points for inter-state transfer cases was later scrapped by the government after parents went to court against it.
Various schools and parents had challenged the L-G’s guidelines in court, triggering a messy fight with more than 15 petitions filed. The admission season, which starts in January and concludes by March 31, had dragged on till May-end and the academic year had started from July instead of April. The L-G had defended his decision then, calling it an effort to end “commercialisation of education”.
However, the high court on Friday said Jung’s actions were “neither procedurally proper nor rational”. In his verdict, Justice Manmohan pointed out that the government did not submit any document or material to show schools were indulging in any malpractice.
The court also said that by awarding 70 out of 95 points for neighbourhood, the L-G’s guidelines had placed “undue emphasis on location of residence of a child over which she/he has no control”.
“This court is unable to appreciate that a student’s educational fate can be relegated to his position on a map,” the judgment read.
It added that by awarding five points for siblings studying in the same school, the guidelines placed an only child at a disadvantage.
The court said that the power to choose a school has to rest primarily with the parents and not the administration, and opined that “by increasing parental choice and granting schools the autonomy to admit students, the accountability of private schools can be ensured”.
For now, private schools can go back to the ‘flexible’ pre-2013 system of admission. This means they can fix their own criteria and the quantum of points to go with them. A school can choose to retain or omit the neighbourhood criteria, for instance.

BSE Market Cap Hits 1 Lakh Crore; Investors  Wealth DoublesFund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
The market capitaliastion of all listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange hit a record Rs 100 trillion (lakh crore) mark just past 10 a.m. on Friday. The landmark came on a day when the Sensex hit a record high of 28,822 in intraday trade.
The total market cap of all BSE listed companies had crossed the Rs. 10 lakh crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003. In the last five years, BSE's market cap doubled from about Rs. 50 lakh crore to Rs 100 lakh crore today.
This is good news for long-term investors, who would have stayed put in stock markets over the last five years. Investment in no-risk instruments such as the Kisan Vikas Patra takes more than eight years to double.
Of the overall stock market wealth, promoters command nearly 50 per cent share, while foreign investors own close to 20 per cent and the rest is shared between institutional and retail investors from India.
Market capitalisation is used to compare companies in terms of their market value. Nearly 5,500 companies are listed on the BSE, but the top 100 companies make up for over 70 per cent in market capitalization. Tata Consultancy Services, India's biggest company by market cap, is valued at over Rs 5 lakh crore.
To gauge BSE's standing, its market cap should be seen in the global context. In dollar terms, BSE's market cap is now nearly $1.7 trillion (at Rs 60 per dollar). That is roughly one tenth the size of the New York Stock Exchange, which has a market cap of nearly $18.8 trillion according to World Federation of Exchanges data.
Market caps of domestic exchanges generally mirror the GDP of their economies. India's GDP is estimated at around $1.9 trillion. The size of US' economy is estimated at $16.8 trillion.
India is also behind the Tokyo Stock Exchange ($4.5 trillion), Euronext ($3.5 trillion), London Stock Exchange ($3.4 trillion), Hong Kong Stock Exchange ($3.1 trillion) and Shanghai Stock Exchange ($2.87 trillion), according to World Federation of Exchanges data. Its closest competitor is Swiss Exchange.
BSE is among the world's ten largest exchanges in terms of market value, Press Trust of India reported.
BSE is slightly ahead of the National Stock Exchange in terms of market cap, though the volume of shares traded on the NSE is much higher. NSE lags behind BSE in market cap because fewer companies (1,597) are listed on the Exchange.
Raghu Kumar, cofounder of domestic brokerage RKSV said, "This is big news as it gives investors across India and around the world that India is to be invested in right now... From a FII and investor confidence perspective, nothing beats a headline that proclaims Asia's oldest exchange having 100 lakh Crores in market capitalization among its listed companies."
The Sensex has gained over 35 per cent year-to-date on the back of nearly $40 billion of overseas investment in debt and equities.

Relatives  vendors come under insider trading scannerTeam Money Today        Edition: December 2014
(Photo: Reuters)
A person who is an employee of a company or a relative of an employee may possess information about the company which when comes in public can make the stock price move (either way). This information can be used (it has been used in the past) by that person to his undue advantage and in the process hurt other investors.
Though the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has framed laws to curb the practice of insider trading, the menace continues. Now, to make existing laws stricter, the capital market regulator has widened the definition of insider trading.
Now, insiders will include persons (other than employees) who are connected to an insider through a contract, trust or relationship and are privy to unpublished price-sensitive information. Besides, the onus now is on the 'accused' to prove his innocence.
"In case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of unpublished price sensitive information should be on such connected persons," said Sebi.
"This is one of the most important shift from existing laws. Earlier, it was Sebi's responsibility to prove the guilt of an insider trading accused. Given the fact that Sebi lacks the wherewithal to prove guilt, it is a big step forward," says Puneet Agarwal, senior member, research team, Cian Analystics.
New Sebi norms try to align insider trading rules with international practices. Accordingly, they bar sharing of unpublished price-sensitive information with anyone unless it is necessary to do so for business transactions or on account of any legal obligation. The new norms also require companies to disclose price-sensitive information at least two days before trading.
This means a company can make disclosure, say only after Friday closing, so that investors have two days (Saturday and Sunday) to absorb the information. Insiders, who have access to price sensitive information all round the year, will also have to formulate pre-scheduled trading plans.
The new norms also bar directors from taking call and futures bets on the company's shares.

Moody s Pegs Rating Revision to Speedy ReformsRBI to Wait for 'Clearer Read' Before Cutting Rates in April-June
Mumbai: Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday said the sovereign outlook for the country remains stable at 'Baa3', but future rating trends depend on the reform measures taken by the government.
"Sovereign credit rating trends in 2015 will depend on the extent to which the government addresses high fiscal expenditures, recurrent food price inflation, and wide infrastructure deficit," Moody's said in a report.
All the three big international rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's and Fitch have 'BBB' ratings on the country's sovereign with a stable outlook. The current rating is closest to junk status or below investment grade.
The report says the government's ability and willingness to undertake structural reforms will have a bearing on the credit rating outlook of the country.
"The government's recent policy measures, such as diesel price deregulation, a greater focus on local manufacturing, as well as the Reserve Bank's efforts to contain inflationary pressures and raise banking system efficiency, could increase savings, investment and productivity in the economy," Moody's said.
The report further said the recent steps are augmented with additional steps next year to address infrastructure gaps and attract foreign direct investment inflows, government policies can support the sovereign credit profile through higher medium-term GDP growth.
After growing at over 9 per cent for three successive years, the economy lost its steam and grew at sub-5 per cent levels in the past two fiscal years due to policy paralysis under the past government. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, the GDP clipped at an unexpected 5.7 per cent, while the second quarter GDP print is slated to be much lower at 5-5.3 per cent.
The government will release the September quarter GDP numbers later this week.
The report said the possibility of confidence shocks from the expected rise in US interest rates, especially in the case of a disorderly market reaction may have an impact on the country's credit quality.
Moody's believes that although inflation and the current account deficit have declined over the last year, a tightening in US monetary policy could still result in some volatility in capital inflows and the exchange rate.
Moreover, elevated government debt and the risk of recurrent inflation limit room for the authorities to stimulate the economy in the event of a shock from significantly lower-than-anticipated global growth, it added.
The rating agency also said the global sovereign outlook for 2015 is stable as a gradual global recovery supports sovereign credit quality.
"However, GDP growth rates for sovereigns globally are likely to remain lower than the levels seen before the global financial crisis in 2008-09."

ITC bounces back  analysts say small-pack cigaretteslikelySpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
The ITC scrip bounced back in Wednesday’s trade with analysts of the view that the company could take counter-measures to mitigate the impact of a possible ban on loose cigarettes.
According to a Jefferies report, although cigarettes could become less affordable for a certain segment of consumers, price elasticity, favourable product mix and introduction of smaller pack sizes could limit the impact on volumes for ITC.
Rajasa Kakulavarapu and Apurva Kumar at Jefferies in a note said that the Kolkata-based company could address the affordability gap to an extent with smaller pack sizes. Morgan Stanley also believes that the cigarette player can reduce impact of a ban by introducing a 5-stick pack.
In Wednesday’s trade, ITC gained as much as 2.9%, before settling 2.1% higher at R363.30 on the BSE.
ITC’s performance amid adverse policy environment in the past is a source of optimism for certain analysts. “ITC has negotiated an adverse policy environment in the past decade well – introduction of VAT on cigarettes in FY08, 3-5x increase in excise duty of non-filter cigarettes resulting in ITC’ exit from that segment in FY09 (20% of then volumes), ban on smoking in public places, pictorial warnings, three consecutive years of 15%+ excise duty increase since FY13 – and managed to grow its cigarette EBIT at 18.7% CAGR over FY09-14 and 17.1% over FY04-14,” Motilal Oswal observed in a note.
Jefferies’ analysts add that despite the increasing regulatory and taxation constraints over the years, ITC’s earnings have grown at a remarkably consistent and strong pace (c.18-20% p.a.), mainly driven by pricing and mix. “… we do not see major risks to this trajectory in the near future …,” they added.
On Tuesday, shares of ITC along with other cigarette players were under pressure as a Reuters report suggested that health minister JP Nadda in a statement to Rajya Sabha has said that his ministry has accepted the recommendation of an internal panel to ban the sale of single cigarettes.
ITC’s shares ended 5% lower to R355.7 on the BSE. Among other cigarette players, Godfrey Phillips (9%) and VST Industries (2%) ended in the red.

Vikram is a director’s delight, says Vijay Milton

The cinematographer-turned director is working on a road movie titled 10 Enradhukulla
More than a decade ago, cinematographer SD Vijay Milton was called to shoot a song for Samurai. He spent close to nine days on the road with director Balaji Sakthivel and actor Vikram — to film the melodious ‘Moongil Kaadugale’ song. “We travelled in three jeeps across South India, and shot in natural light. Not many actors would have taken that kind of effort for just a song. It’s an experience I’ll never forget,” he says.
Now, in 2014, Vijay, fresh from the success of his well-made Goli Soda, is shooting in Coimbatore for his next directorial, 10 Enradhukulla, starring Vikram and Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The road thriller has so far been shot across Ladakh, Sikkim and Hyderabad.
The team is now canning an action sequence, featuring Vikram and Pasupathi, with 14 cameras. Stunt choreographer Lee Whittaker, who has worked on Viswaroopam, Arrambam and most recently Lingaa, is working on the stunts for this film too.
Director Vijay Milton says they chose to shoot in Coimbatore because, in the film, the action takes place here. They have so far shot at the expansive CODISSIA grounds, IT Park stretch and the Avanashi Road flyover.
Vijay knows there is huge expectation of his film, purely because it is Vikram’s next after Shankar’s magnum opus I. “Star power is a huge draw for this film,” admits Vijay. After Goli Soda, where he directed young people, how different is it directing top-ranked stars? “There’s just no difference. Vikram Sir is very down-to-earth and a malleable actor. He is a director’s dream-come-true, a delight to work with. We discovered that we enjoy great vibes years ago, and the friendship still continues,” he says.
Vijay smiles when asked about ‘Moongil Kaadugale’, and the much-spoken about shot of a giant tree, which eventually turns out to be a small shrub. “Vikram found that shrub and pointed it out to me. What a scene it was!” he recalls.

The demographic challengeUpdated: November 27, 2014 01:09 IST
The demographic challenge
social conditions
The rhetoric on the capacity of countries to reap the so-called demographic dividend cannot mask the more complex reality of a not-so-young world in 2014, and non-uniform patterns of growth. About a quarter of the world’s population — 1.8 billion — is in the age-group of 10-24 years, according to the latest United Nations Population Fund report. In 1950, the proportion was higher, at almost a third of the global total, at 721 million. The 10-24 age segment has thus declined overall, while it has more than doubled in absolute terms during the period. This means that in theory, people in this age bracket, their number larger than China’s population, can hope to live longer, be better fed and educated, do decent jobs and earn adequate incomes. In concrete terms, this segment would swell the share of the working-age population — those between 15 and 64 years — over the next few decades. But here is the catch. Nine out of ten people, or 89 per cent, in the 10-24 age-group live in less developed countries, says the UNFPA report. Most people who are alive today are below 30 years of age. In 17 states, 15 of them from sub-Saharan Africa, one half of the population is under 18 years. One in three girls in the developing world is married before reaching 18, raising the risk of early and perhaps unintended motherhood among children and hampering the realisation of their full potential. One in seven HIV infections occur during adolescence.
According to the World Bank, last year there were 100 dependants (those below 15 years and above 64 years) for every 100 people in the working age in Angola. The ratio was even higher, at 103, for Chad; for other states in the conflict zones of sub-Saharan Africa, the figures were in the 80s and more. Whereas India’s age-dependency ratio has ranged in the 50s per 100 working population between 2010 and 2013, China has stayed in the mid-30s during the corresponding period. India’s higher ratio underscores the extent to which social protection measures would have to be strengthened for both the components to ease their mutual interdependence and enhance the quality of life. Alongside measures to boost growth and attract multinational corporations in the manufacturing and services sectors, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must take up massive public-funded programmes in basic education, health care and vocational training, with a thrust on building a clean economy. Only then could the current younger age profile of the population prove advantageous. The demographic dividend refers to the potential among countries to increase economic growth by taking advantage of the changing age structure in the population.

Data wars: RCom offers plan with no cap on downloads; Airtel to give 4G at 3G ratesYou are here: Home > Collections
Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel mark the beginning of data tariff war
Kalyan Parbat, ET Bureau Nov 28, 2014, 10.34AM IST

(Anil Ambani-led telco unveils…)
KOLKATA: Anil Ambani-headed Reliance Communications has unveiled, what it calls, a disruptive data plan which promises data usage at a monthly rental of Rs 999 with no download quantity caps whatsoever, a move which comes barely 24 hours after Bharti Airtel said it would offer 4G services at or below 3G rates.
The back-to-back moves could mark the beginning of a bruising data tariff war as telcos move to garner as many higherpaying data subscribers as they can in the run-up to Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm's expected 4G services launch next year. The Sunil Mittal-founded Bharti Airtel, India's No. 1 carrier, had said on Wednesday it would offer 10 GBs of data on 4G at Rs 999, which is 33% cheaper than its 10 GB data variant on 3G, priced at Rs 1,499.
RCom's unlimited data offer, launched on Thursday, directly takes on rival CDMA operator Sistema Shyam Teleservices' identical Rs 999 data plan, which has 40GB and 20GB limits for postpaid and prepaid customers, respectively.
Gurdeep Singh, chief executive (consumer business) at RCom, told ET that the move is aimed at grabbing potential data customers from rival networks who are "dissatisfied with their current data speeds or the quality of indoor coverage".
The company's unlimited data plan at unbridled data speeds up to 14.7 Mbps would initially go live in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune and eventually be extended to other key cities including Delhi and Mumbai.
Singh stressed that the plan "was truly unlimited", in that, a customer opting for it could safely go ahead and download, say, "100 GBs for Rs 999 without fear of a bill shock at the end of the month".
The offer "was not a promotional offer in disguise to grab data customers in key markets. We are here for the long haul and plan to extend this offer nationally in all key markets," he added. RCom will be in direct competition in Bengaluru and Pune where Bharti Airtel operates 4G services, while it would be sparring with the Indian unit of Russia's Sistema JSFC in Chennai and Bengaluru.
Till the time of filing report, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Sistema Shyam declined to reply to ET's queries on whether they would also slash 3G data rates or go unlimited.
Lately, India's top mobile operators have been cherry-picking lucrative data customers amid surging demand for data services and also in anticipation of fierce competition on the 4G front from Jio which is widely expected to launch its own 4G services by March next year. Higher margin data services are expected to drive revenue growth at India's mobile phone operators in the coming years.
At the end of September, non-voice revenue, including from data, made up over 24% of RCom's telecom revenue, and over 20% of Bharti Airtel's mobile services revenue. Both Bharti Airtel and RCom had over 15 million 3G customers as on September 30.
Industry experts, however, are sceptical about RCom's offer, arguing that it is "technically impossible" to offer unlimited data downloads at the promised speeds over a long term to a large customer base as it would choke up the network and disrupt mobile coverage.
"Since a data pipe's capacity is finite, a large group of customers collectively opting for such an unlimited offer are bound to experience a serious loss of speed at some point, especially since DoT allows operators to downgrade data download speeds as part of its fair usage and trade policy once a customer is seen to be abusing a data plan," a top executive of one of India's biggest telcos told ET on condition of anonymity.

RBI may cut rates in Feb, feel Morgan Stanley, YES Bank
Shubhada Rao of YES Bank sees consumer price inflation averaging around 5.8-5.9 percent in 2015. Chetan Ahya of Morgan Stanley expects CPI to drop to 4.5 percent in November
Post your opinion here
08:00 am
A steeper-than-anticipated decline in inflation could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to cut benchmark rates in February, much earlier than what market was expecting, feel Chetan Ahya of Morgan Stanley and Shubhada Rao of YES Bank . They were participating in a discussion on the economy, on CNBC-TV18.
Crude prices have dipped to their lowest level in over 4 years and economists expect this cool down inflation further.
Rao sees consumer price inflation averaging around 5.8-5.9 percent in 2015. Ahya expects consumer price inflation to drop to 4.5 percent in November.
He sees the first rate cut by the RBI in February and has forecast a 50 basis point-cut in rates for 2015. Rao says the probability of a rate cut in February has increased and she too expects a cumulative 50 basis point reduction in benchmark rates over the next 12 months.
Ahya sees September quarter GDP at 5.1-5.2 percent, and at 5.7 percent for the full year. And while crude prices have been sliding and fallen to around USD 72 per barrel, Ahya expects it to stabilize around USD 85 per barrel over the next 6-12 months.
Below is the edited transcript of Chetan Ahya and Shubhada Rao's interview:
Q: How are you drawing the inflation trajectory from hereon? What is the in-house Morgan Stanley view of the trajectory of crude prices over the next one year and separately what is your trajectory of inflation over the next 12 months?
Ahya: For crude, it’s a bit more of an evolving situation. The expectation was that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet and decide to take some production cut but since the way the outcome has come out, it looks like it is more favourable for the oil prices and so in that sense, oil prices are surprising us on the downside, which is good news for India of course but from the oil commodity price perspective, it is downside forecast.
In terms of inflation, we are expecting it to hit to 4.5 percent in November 2014 first and then as base effect recedes, it is expected to rise back again in Q1 but the key number that RBI is looking at is when does inflation transition to 6 percent sustainably and we think that period is April 2015, which is well ahead of January 2016 that RBI had put itself as the comfort timeframe.
Q: Your trajectory?
Rao: For FY16, if oil does settle somewhere even if at a conservative level of USD 85 per barrel, we could see a consumer price index (CPI) averaging at 6 percent in the next fiscal year. If of course oil trends even lower than that on an average level at USD 80 per barrel, we could see about 5.8-5.9 average CPI for the next year, which to my mind is a great, huge positive. From a peak of USD 115 per barrel, we have seen 38 percent cut, let us not forget RBI had assumed USD 100 per barrel which now stands somewhere close to around USD 72.50 per barrel. Of course we need to see at what level it eventually settles, but broader consensus, I would believe, would emerge somewhere between USD 75 per barrel give or take USD 2 per barrel.
So overall, I think oil is definitely providing the biggest comfort both to the government and importantly as the situation evolves, also to the RBI.
Q: Can you tell us what the math looks like now given that we have seen a fall of about 35 percent in crude in the last six months, how much will the import bill go down by?
Ahya: The sensitivity to oil prices is roughly 0.5 percent of GDP for every USD 10 per barrel change in oil prices so essentially that is the impact on the balance of payment (BoP). In terms of the implications on oil subsidy, honestly now we have reached a stage of oil prices where the subsidy has already become zero. It is not likely to be positive as long as the prices pass through but now it has almost become irrelevant for oil subsidy perspective, so it is really BoP that is 0.5 percent of GDP.
Q: Now to the December 2 expectation. Your average to the next year is 5.8-5.9 percent but the November number at 4.5 percent is also not sustainable. What is the governor doing on December 2, when are you expecting the first rate cut and how much over a 12 months period?
Rao: I would think that taking in significant levels of oil at these USD 72.50-80 per barrel if they settle around that, I think RBI would probably also consider a February rate cut. While until two days ago, we were putting as an outside chance for February rate cut but the probability over the last two-three days seems to have increased.
Our base case scenario was of April being the first rate cut of 25 bps followed by another 25 bps somewhere close to the end of Q2, so overall we were pencilling in about 50 bps cut in the policy rates over the next 12 months however we believe that the oil prices if they continue to remain at these levels, we probably could see the rate cuts being brought ahead sometime in February. So if we look at growth somewhere settling around 5.4 that is our own estimate for the current year, have inflation trending significantly lower as indicated by the RBI, I would think that evolving situations would be more supportive of an earlier rate cut than before. Of course RBI is not expected to be triggered happy and instantly announce a rate cut on December 2, I think the situation would be watched as to where eventually the oil seems to settle but the OPEC meeting of yesterday seems to have formalised the speculative observation that oil is trending at multi-year low and this to my mind should begin to provide some comfort to the RBI.
Q: How many cuts you think in the next 12 months?
Rao: We are looking at two rate cuts of 25 bps each but with some small upside risk as well.
Q: What is the expectation as far as growth is concerned, what is the number that you are expecting later today and on an average in 2015, what are you pencilling in for GDP?
Ahya: We are at 5.1 percent to 5.2 percent for the number that is going to be announced today and for the financial year, we are maintaining it that 5.7 percent for March 2015.
Q: Just to continue with the credit policy and the interest rate cuts, what are your expectations, when and how many?
Ahya: We are expecting the first rate cut to happen in February and for this forecast we have made even before the OPEC meeting and we have assumed USD 85-90 per barrel for oil price. So we think even if oil prices rises back to those levels, the first rate cut should probably happen in February and we are effectively just following the framework that the RBI has led down. RBI has basically mentioned that as long as they can see 6 percent inflation visibly, which we think would be possible to see by February and as mentioned earlier, we are seeing that transition to happen from April, so as long as that is visible, it should be possible for them to make the first rate cut in February. Cumulatively we are forecasting 50 bps as well but we are also highlighting the bull case scenario, which we have assigned a significant probability of 30 percent and said that it is possible that we could transition to 5 percent sustainably from June 2015.
In that scenario, if that pans out, which is now possible with oil going lower and by the time we reach June, we would have known whether oil is sustainably staying lower or not that would potentially open up the door to do 100 bps instead of 50 bps during calendar year 2015.
Q: One tends to have a facile assumption that when crude prices fall by 35-40 percent inflation will fall hugely in India. That will lead to a logical conclusion that you can outsource monetary policy making to the Middle East. If you can just detail for us exactly how crude prices impact the CPI calculation?
Rao: For every USD 10 cut in crude oil prices we are seeing a 25 basis points direct impact on the CPI. On the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) it is a larger impact, 40-50 basis points immediately. So we are looking at a WPI number for instance for December close to one percent, a tad over one percent. So every assumption of a USD 10 cut in crude oil price is going to have a direct cut in the CPI forecast by about 20-25 basis points.
So we have seen about from 100 to 75, so 25. So, we clearly see about 45-50 basis points cut in the CPI forecast and as I said we were looking somewhere close to the average of FY16 close to about 6 percent and if crude settles around 80 rather below 85 we could even see it averaging at 5.8. That is well visible within the RBI’s fan chart and more importantly I would think that if the monetary policy framework indeed is going to formalise it somewhere early in December we would be probably looking at a scenario where the medium term target of CPI could get fixed somewhere not at 4 or 6 but in between because the governor in a couple of occasions had articulated about 4 percent being inflation of industrialised nations. So, keeping that in mind 5 percent is something that we could see that the monetary policy committee could arrive at in terms of medium term inflation.
We have seen studies by the RBI, we ourselves have done in house studies on the tolerable level of inflation at a level point where which you see a drop in growth and that somewhere would stand on long term basis around 6 percent.
Q: Where is the ten year, say in April and one year down the line?
Ahya: I don’t make revenue forecasts.
Q: Two numbers from you, the yield production and your GDP numbers as well?
Rao: We are looking at settling yield at about 8 percent by March. We are looking at about 7.3-7.5 into the next 12 months, i.e. 12 months later. As far as GDP is concerned this second quarter GDP we are pegging at 5.2, slightly higher than consensus. We are at about 2.5 on agriculture industry at 2.7 that includes of course the construction component and services steady at 6.8 percent.
So, altogether agriculture would see some cut, industry is predominantly being correcting because of flattish manufacturing though electricity has given a significant support but service is tad sideways. We are seeing good traction in trade, hotels, transport, and communications. We have seen similar move in the finance component also, but government we could see close to about 9.5 percent. Base effect will be more favourable for the government services this time around.
Q: What is your team at Morgan Stanley forecasting in terms of an average for Brent in the next 6-8 months?
Ahya: Right now, we are forecasting about USD 85 dollars average for 2015. So that is the sort of expectation that we have but as I mentioned earlier things have been changing in the way we had expected OPEC to react, the reaction has been positive surprise for us from macro perspective but negative for oil. So that is the way I would summarise our outlook.

Indians' tour game cancelled after Hughes' death

Decision taken after Hughes' death.India's second tour match in Adelaide has been cancelled as Australian cricket takes a 'grief now, sport later' approach following the death of Phillip Hughes . Cricket Australia must also decide over the coming days how to approach the first Test at the Gabba, which is due to start on Thursday next week.
Four of the players picked in Australia's Test squad were on the field at the SCG at the time when Hughes was struck by an ultimately fatal blow during the Sheffield Shield game between New South Wales and South Australia on Tuesday. The full round of Shield matches had been abandoned by the close of Tuesday.
After Hughes died on Thursday afternoon, Cricket Australia's CEO James Sutherland said no thought had yet been given to the Brisbane Test and how Australian cricket would move forward in the immediate future. As well as the Test match, consideration will also need to be given to an appropriate farewell for Hughes.
"The Test match next week, we haven't thought that far ahead and we really don't think it is appropriate at this time," Sutherland said. "The whole of Australian cricket is grieving and all we want to do is provide the Hughes family all the support we possibly can right now. In the fullness of time we'll think about what's ahead, but to be honest we really haven't thought that far ahead.
"Phillip has only died this afternoon. The important thing is to provide support for everyone. In time people will start to think about what's next and obviously a funeral is one of those things. But we'll certainly make sure the Australian public get their opportunity to pay their respects to Phillip in an appropriate way in the foreseeable future."
In the hours after Sutherland spoke, it was confirmed that India's tour match against a Cricket Australia XI had been cancelled. Initially, the two-day match had been scheduled for Friday-Saturday, and then it was delayed until the weekend. By Thursday evening, it had been abandoned entirely.
"Today we were reminded that cricket is just a game and it is the characters that play the game that make it so special," Pat Howard, Cricket Australia's executive general manager of team performance, said. "We have spoken to the players and the ACA [Australian Cricketers' Association] and have made the decision based on the best interest of all concerned.
"Several of the CA XI players have returned home to seek support and solace from their family, friends and team-mates. We appreciate the support and cooperation shown by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, team management and the India players who have been nothing but respectful during this tragic time."
The India squad was set to train in the Adelaide Oval nets on Friday, but not on the ground proper, as a mark of respect to Hughes. After Hughes died, the India squad released a statement offering its condolences.
"The touring Indian team joins the cricketing fraternity across the world in offering condolences to the family of Phil Hughes, who has departed from our midst," the statement said. "In this moment of grief, we pray that they are bestowed with divine strength to overcome this unfortunate tragedy.
"As fellow cricketers we cherish the memories of playing along with him and deeply respect his contribution to the game of cricket."
Grief was also felt around the world: in Sharjah, the second day of the third Test between Pakistan and New Zealand was abandoned after news of Hughes' death was received. The match will resume on Friday and will be extended by a day.
It was also confirmed that Sydney's grade cricket, from first grade through to fifth grade, would not go ahead this weekend "as a mark of respect following the tragic passing of Phillip Hughes ". Hughes played for the Western Suburbs club in Sydney's first-grade competition after moving to Sydney from the country town of Macksville.

Coal block cancellation: PSBs may lose over Rs 96 000 crCoal block cancellation: PSBs may lose over Rs 96,000 cr

NEW DELHI, Nov 28:  
An Indian Supreme Court order scrapping most coal extraction permits given to companies would have a likely impact of Rs 96,484 crore ($15.6 billion) on state-run lenders, the junior finance minister told parliament on Friday.
The government had deduced the impact of the cancellation of the so-called coal block allotments on banks due to likely stoppage of power production, Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to a lawmaker question on bad loans for state banks due to the verdict.
It was, however, not clear whether he was referring to an increase in bad loans or loan exposure of banks to affected companies.
Bankers and analysts have previously said it was difficult to quantify the increase in bad loans as the scrapped coal blocks will be returned after March and as all the loans to the affected companies may not turn sour.
Sinha said bad loans of state lenders were a provisional 5.32 per cent of total loans as of end-September, while that of private sector lenders was a provisional 2.04 per cent.
Bad loans of state banks in coal industry were 0.23 per cent as of end-September, while for private banks it was 0.22 per cent.

Mentha oil falls 0.3% on profit-bookingMentha oil falls 0.3% on profit-booking
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Nov 28, 2014 12:30 PM IST
Mentha oil futures drifted by 0.35% to Rs 680 per kg today as speculators locked in gains at prevailing levels amid slackened spot demand.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, mentha oil for delivery in November declined by Rs 2.40, or 0.35%, to Rs 680 per kg in a business turnover of 68 lots.
Likewise, the oil for delivery in the December traded lower by Rs 2.20, or 0.31%, to Rs 691.50 per kg in 131 lots.
The fall in mentha futures was mostly due to profit-booking by speculators after recent gains and sluggish demand in spot markets from pharmaceutical units, analysts said.

We are cautious bidders  will keep scanning for opportunities: JSW SteelWe are cautious bidders, will keep scanning for opportunities: JSW Steel
Aditi Divekar | Mumbai Nov 29, 2014 10:27 PM IST
Though JSW Steel seems on track to meeting its target of raising its capacity in India to 40 million tonnes (mt), its plan for greater global presence doesn’t seem to be shaping up on expected lines.
According to a media report, Lucchini, Italy’s second-largest steelmaker whose Piombino complex JSW Steel had sought to acquire for less than $100 million, has now decided to sell it to Algerian conglomerate Cevital. This follows the Sajjan Jindal-led company’s decision not to pursue its plans of acquiring Italy’s Ilva Steel.
The Piombino complex employs about 2,000 people and can produce up to 2.5 mt of steel a year. The loss-making Lucchini, earlier owned by Russia’s Severstal, was declared insolvent in 2012. Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis and stiff competition from Asia, it had recorded slowing demand.
High environmental and pension liabilities had forced JSW Steel to drop its plan to bid for Europe’s Ilva Steel, valued at $600 million, sources said.
“It is true. We have decided to move away from Ilva as well,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel.
“It is the company’s strategy to make basic steel in India and then send it to finishing mills acquired abroad to make enhanced finished products,” Rao told Business Standard. “By acquiring such mills abroad, we are basically building the front end for the product portfolio.”
“I won’t say we are aggressive bidders. We are cautious in whichever geography we might be. We are in no hurry and will keep scanning for opportunities,” he added.
Nilendu Lall Mukherjee, director (corporate clients), Royal Bank of Scotland, said, “In my view, lower capital outlay would have been the principal reason for JSW bidding for these plants.” He added if an asset was available at a low cost, operations could be well managed by an Indian owner.
JSW Steel is yet to see a turnaround in its plates and pipes mill in the US. In 2007, it had acquired 90 per cent stake in the unit for $900 million to tap demand from the oil and gas sector.
Analysts, however, remain optimistic about the mill’s prospects. “Now, the US is in a recovery mode and it does have replacement demand for oil pipes, apart from laying fresh ones. This will surely help the company’s US mill,” said an analyst with a local brokerage firm.
Analysts also say failure on acquisitions in Europe might be a blessing in disguise. “I understand having capex when the economy is down. But capex should be in a growing market, not a shrinking one such as Europe,” said an analyst with a foreign brokerage firm. “While Lucchini was a small-ticket rolling mill and, therefore, wasn’t significant, the fact that Ilva wasn’t acquired, for whatever reason, is good for the company.”
“It is good to know the management has taken a rationalised approach in bidding,” said Giriraj Daga, senior analyst with Nirmal Bang.
In the domestic market, however, JSW Steel has been quite aggressive on the acquisition front.
Early this year, it had acquired Vallabh Tinplate, which gave it an entry into the tinplate business. This was followed by the acquisition of Welspun Maxsteel.
JSW Steel runs a 10-mt plant in Karnataka, a one-mt unit at Tamil Nadu and a 3.3-mt unit in Maharashtra. The tinplate business has given the company a sound footing in the north of the country, too.

OnePlus One review + video: This is a flagship killer  no doubtCourt refuses to let off Hindalco in coal block allocation case
Quick on the heels of Xiaomi, which has tasted stupendous success in India without spending a paisa on marketing or advertising, another Chinese company is trying to make a mark with a hard-to-own smartphone that calls itself the flagship killer. But is this phone really worthy of the near cult following it has in some markets. We decided to take the phone for a spin.
Specs: 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080p, 401 PPI) LTPS IPS with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 2.5GHz Quad-core | 3GB RAM | 64GB internal storage, no external slot | 13MP rear camera + 5MP front camera | 4K video recording with slowmotion | 3100 mAh battery | 4G with nano and micro SIM trays in box | Cyanogen 11S OS based on Android 4.4
Price: TBA
Design: This is what I like most about this phone. I got the Black Sandstone finish version for the review. The matte finish granite like rear panel syncs well with my concept of style and sophistication while a lot of my friends found the same weird. The design is minimalist in every sense and you have just the volume rocker and power buttons on either side. But the two buttons blend so well that in the dark you will be groping to find them or even the right side of this phone. The rear panel has the camera and flash as the only relief from the granite-like finish along with the smooth OnePlus log. All very classy. This class is also visible in the charging cable and even the SIM tray pin that comes in the box, all designed with intent.
Display: The 5.5-inch Full HD display uses the faster LTPS (Low Temperature PolySilicon) LCD technology which makes its easier on the eyes and the images crisper. This screen can compare with any other Full HD screen in the market though I could not find anything that makes it better.
Performance: Running the most powerful chipset from Qualcomm, the One present no hassles for you. Multi-tasking is easy and even with the toughest of tasks the phone does not heat up. Apps load real fast and you can easily move from one app to the other.
Software: The OnePlus One does not run stock Android and has instead loaded itself with Cyanogen 11S. This is a lot like stock Android, but also offering lots of tweaks and even full themes that change everything from the font to the icons. Even in the two themes that come free with the phone the customisation options run deep. But the other themes are all paid, with prices starting at a Dollar. However, the Cyanogenmod has issues. I noticed that often calls drop as soon as you have answered it. Then, some Android apps have trouble starting. Plus, some features like the call log take some getting used to. But after a while I could only agree that this is a better experience that what any other Android tweak is offering at the moment.
Camera: The OnePlus One has a cool clicker which again gives you lots of options to work on the photo even before you click. On the camera screen you can change modes by just swiping down from top. The camera is also fast and there is a burst mode that lets you click up to 20 frames in one go. The results are quite good with great details, even in macro shots.
The phone, thanks to its powerful processor, also lets you shoot 4K video, which however is not default. In 4K you have make some excellent timelapse videos, but the slow motion at 60fps is not available above 1080p. And to the phone’s credit is the fact that it stayed cool even after almost 5 minutes of 4K shootings, which is an achievement in itself. This is a camera that can suffice all the needs of even very demanding users.
Storage: The review unit I had came with 64Gb storage out of which you have just above 50GB left to use. There is no external storage and this extra large internal storage is more than crucial.
Connectivity: No issues on this front. The phone lets you use both nano and micro SIMs as it offers separate trays for both.
Battery: One of the best things about the phone is the battery life. I would start my day around 6.30 am with a full charge and come back home around 8 pm with about 30 per cent remaining. I could not ask for more. It can last a full weekend, when the call activity is much less, without a recharge.
Verdict: At the moment, we are not sure what the India price of the OnePlus One will be. But let me assure you that this phone can take on any flagship heads on and give a good fight. So if the price is around the Rs 25,000 that we believe could be the final price, it might be worth begging or licking a few boots to get that coveted invite that will let you buy this phone. This is without doubt a flagship killer.

Violence in China continued despitecrackdownBy: Associated Press | Beijing |
Posted: November 28, 2014 1:17 pm
Chinese authorities say in a six-month report card on their security crackdown in Xinjiang that they busted 115 terrorist gangs before they could unleash violence. But tallies of death tolls in the ethnically tense region suggest the violence has continued, and may even have intensified.
Information from the region is routinely suppressed so experts caution against any firm conclusions about the level of violence in the far western region that is home to 10 million members of the Muslim Uighur minority, who chafe under what they consider suppression by China’s ethnic majority Han. However, both Chinese state-run media and foreign outlets who monitor Xinjiang have continued to report a stream of deadly clashes.
“It’s safe to say that violence has continued roughly as it was before this latest crackdown, if not with greater intensity,” said Rian Thum, an assistant professor specializing in Uighur history at Loyola University New Orleans. Chinese state media outlets have reported at least 175 deaths in the past six months in eight violent incidents, including a massive attack on local government facilities that left 96 dead. That compares with 46 reported killed during the same period last year.
Rian Thum’s own tally drawn from reports by the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia showed an even higher toll for the period, about 200 this year compared to roughly 50 the previous year.
Beijing blames the violence on separatist terrorists fueled by religious extremism and with ties abroad, and argues that it has invested generously to boost Xinjiang’s economy and improve its quality of life. Critics attribute the violence to home-grown disgruntlement over local corruption and an influx of Hans who have brought economic development that has not equally benefited Uighurs.
In May, Beijing announced a one-year security clampdown in Xinjiang following a series of high-profile attacks on civilians blamed on Uighurs, both in Xinjiang and elsewhere. That came on top of heightened security measures in place since deadly riots broke out in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in 2009.
A six-month report card on the campaign published on the Xinjiang government’s official news site this week focused on prosecution data. It said authorities detained 334 suspects and prosecuted 294 cases of sharing online terrorism-promoting audios and video, and seized 18,000 copies of illegal religious books.

Maharashtra: BJP to resume talks with Shiv Sena over joininggovernmentBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: November 28, 2014 1:06 pm | Updated: November 28, 2014 3:42 pm
Ending weeks of acrimony between the former saffron allies, the BJP and Shiv Sena will on Friday resume talks on the issue of the latter joining the four-week-old government in Maharashtra.
The BJP, facing the heat from several quarters over NCP’s outside support to it to form the government, is keen to take the Sena onboard to ensure a stable government.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said his party is keen to join hands with the Sena once again after a bitter split in the run up to the Assembly elections.
“I spoke with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on phone a few days back and talks between the two parties will start on Friday,” Fadnavis told reporters on Thursday.
“From BJP, we have asked Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra minister Chandrakant Patil to open the talks with the Sena. Both parties may have fought elections separately, but there is no reason why we cannot come together,” he said.
Uddhav, however, chose to keep mum on Fadnavis’ comments and said he would talk to the BJP when it initiates the process.
“I am willing to resume talks with them (BJP). But let them start at least,” Thackeray said.
A senior BJP leader told PTI on condition of anonymity that the Sena will almost certainly join the government during the next Cabinet expansion.
“The Cabinet expansion will happen either on 30th of this month or December 1. I’m almost certain that Sena will come on board,” the leader said.
The state Assembly’s winter session will commence from December 8.
In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs, while the Shiv Sena is the second largest party with 63 legislators.
The Sena’s inclusion in the Fadnavis government will also strengthen the latter’s position as it is 22 short of simple majority in the House.

Scotland to get new powers after rejectingseparationBy: Associated Press | London |
Posted: November 28, 2014 12:55 pm
Britain’s main political parties agreed Thursday to grant Scotland new tax and spending powers to fulfill a promise of greater autonomy made as politicians scrambled to persuade Scots to reject independence in a recent referendum. The plans are unlikely to satisfy hard-core Scottish nationalists, but could have far-reaching consequences, taking Britain toward a looser, more federated state.
In a September 18 referendum, 55 percent of Scottish voters opted to remain in the United Kingdom, while 45 percent voted to leave. Since then a commission of politicians from Scotland and the rest of Britain has been thrashing out proposals to fulfill the promise made by anti-independence forces in the final weeks of the campaign, as polls showed rising support for separation.
A plan published Thursday would give the Edinburgh-based Scottish parliament, established in 1999, the power to set income tax rates and keep the revenue in Scottish coffers. Scotland would also gain new control over welfare spending.
Prime Minister David Cameron said the proposals kept a promise he’d made during the referendum campaign, “that a No vote did not mean no change.” But John Swinney, deputy leader of Scotland’s pro-independence administration, said the powers fell short of what Scottish people wanted. “Under these proposals, less than 30 percent of our taxes will be set in Scotland and less than 20 percent of welfare spending will be devolved to Scotland,” he said.
The proposals will be introduced as legislation in Parliament in January. They could open a constitutional can of worms, boosting calls for other British regions, and even major cities, also to be given tax-raising powers.
Cameron also promised to introduce a contentious proposal for “English votes for English laws.” It is intended to address a quirk of Britain’s political system that means Scottish lawmakers in the House of Commons can vote on policies that only affect England.

India should not have cancelled talks  nothing new in consulting Kashmiri leaders ahead of dialogue: NawazSharifBy: Press Trust of India | Islamabad |
Posted: November 28, 2014 12:42 pm | Updated: November 29, 2014 10:17 am
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said India should not have cancelled the Foreign Secretary-level talks, insisting that there was “nothing new” in consulting Kashmiri leaders ahead of a dialogue.
“We had been talking to the Kashmiri leaders in the past whenever Pakistan-India talks are held. This is nothing new as we have to seek the opinion of the Kashmiri leaders on an issue that concerns them the most,” Sharif told reporters on board his aircraft while returning home from the 18th SAARC Summit on Thursday.
Consultations held by Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi with Kashmiri separatists led to the cancellation by India of Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh’s visit to Islamabad in September. Since then both countries have maintained that they are willing to engage in a meaningful dialogue provided the other side takes the initiative.
Sharif said that India should not have cancelled the Foreign Secretary-level talks as was agreed upon during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his swearing in at New Delhi, The News reported.
He said Pakistan wishes to pursue the dialogue process from a position of dignity, honour and self-respect.
“We believe in it and will maintain it at all costs,” he said.
Sharif said Pakistan desires a “meaningful” dialogue to resolve all issues including the Kashmir dispute.
His remarks come after frosty Indo-Pak ties briefly gave way to some warmth yesterday when a smiling Prime Minister Modi and Sharif shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, but India cautioned against reading too much into such “courtesies”.
Moments before the SAARC Summit concluded after two days of deliberations in Kathmandu, Modi and Sharif shook hands and exchanged a few sentences to loud applause of other leaders and their delegations which were witness to the cold vibes between the two Prime Ministers at the opening session when they ignored each other.
Sharif said he twice shook hands with his Indian counterpart and exchanged pleasantries at the SAARC Summit.
He said Pakistan has always desired a meaningful dialogue with India with sincerity and wants it to be reciprocated from the other side.
When asked how the ice between the two leaders was broken, Sharif said when he arrived at the retreat, Prime Minister Modi along with other leaders was already there. He met others and also shook hands with Prime Minister Modi.
Sharif also categorically stated that if India wants to restore ties, the Kashmir issue must be discussed and “that too seriously with full sincerity”.
We had been talking to the Kashmiri leaders in the past whenever Pakistan-India talks are held. This is nothing new.

SC verdict on coal blocks: $15.6 billion hit...Banks
(Bankers and analysts have…)
NEW DELHI: A Supreme Court order scrapping most coal extraction permits given to companies would have a likely impact of $15.6 billion on state-run lenders, the junior finance minister said on Friday.
The government had deduced the impact of the cancellation of the so-called coal block allotments on banks due to likely stoppage of power production, Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to a lawmaker question on bad loans for state banks due to the verdict.
It was, however, not clear whether he was referring to an increase in bad loans or loan exposure of banks to affected companies.
Bankers and analysts have previously said it was difficult to quantify the increase in bad loans as the scrapped coal blocks will be returned after March and as all the loans to the affected companies may not turn sour.
Sinha said bad loans of state lenders were a provisional 5.32 per cent of total loans as of end-September, while that of private sector lenders was a provisional 2.04 per cent.
Bad loans of state banks in coal industry was 0.23 per cent as of end-September, while for private banks it was 0.22 per cent.

BJP ill prepared to face civic polls in West Bengal
7

Kolkata: BJP is still ill prepared for the civic polls in West Bengal due next year. Though the civic polls will give clear signals for BJP's acceptance which is likely to decide whether BJP may win power in the upcoming assembly polls in 2016.
The ruling Trinamool Congress registered a huge victory in the 2008 panchyat polls followed by large-scale win in the civic polls. It was evident that it was going to topple the Left government in the assembly polls in 2011.
This time around too TMC is determined to replicate its success both in the assembly polls and in the civic polls. Serious preparations are already on. Trinamool is all the more serious and leaving no stone unturned in view of the setbacks it has suffered thanks to the Saradha scam and Bardhaman blasts.
Trinamool is all the more serious and leaving no stone unturned in view of the setbacks it has suffered thanks to the Saradha scam and Bardhaman blasts.
#tmc #bjp #civic polls #west bengal
Mamata Banerjee is personally seeing to it that those do not eat into her vote banks. While her MPs are trying to create sand storm in the Parliament to cover Modi government, she is busy galvanizing her party workers against the BJP onslaught in the home turf. Thus party workers conferences are being organized in districts and the CM Mamata Banerjee herself is presiding over those. She wants to use a forked weapon. First, she wants to convince all party men that she remains invincible and thereby push up their confidence level. Second, she wants to formulate strategy for both defence and offence.
But BJP is way behind in its organization of things. It is mostly banking on the CBI netting more TMC leaders, on the NIA investigations into blasts, Modi image and on many people's disenchantment with Mamata and Trinamool. The only significant message it has sent forth so far is its ability to fight TMC on the ground. Recurring clashes between TMC and BJP supporters bear this out. If BJP wants to take on TMC in the civic polls first, it has to get its acts together. It has already decided and for which green signal has come from party HQ in Delhi, to employ whole timers for the party - 294 for 294 assembly seats. But assembly polls are in 2016. It needs organizational muscle for the civic polls which is in 2015. Time is short for BJP.

At 12:05 am, the 30-share Sensex was up 370 points at 28,809 and the 50-share Nifty was up 118 points at 8,613.
 
Earlier, the Sensex touched the life-time high level of 28,822.37 and Nifty reached all-time high mark of 8,616.70.
 
In the broader market, BSE midcap index, up 1.3% is outperforming its larger peers while BSE smallcap index is marginally underperforming with a gain of 0.8%. Market breadth in BSE is positive with 1,528 advances against 838 declines.
 
Scaling a new peak, the total investor wealth in Indian stock market today hit a record high of Rs 100 trillion, marking a jump of ten times in little over a decade.
 
The total market cap of all BSE listed companies had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003 and the Rs 50 lakh crore mark in 2009. The 30 Sensex companies alone, which are among the biggest companies in the country, now account for nearly 50% or about Rs 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
 
This includes TCS, the country's most valued firm and the only entity to have a market value of over Rs 5 lakh crore, followed by state-run ONGC and private sector behemoth Reliance Industries with market caps of over Rs 3 lakh crore each.
 
Those commanding market cap of over Rs 2 lakh crore include ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, SBI and Coal India. Besides, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, HUL, Bharti Airtel, L&T, Wipro, Tata Motors, HCL Tech, NTPC and Axis Bank have market cap of over Rs 1 lakh crore each. Among these, ICICI Bank is very close to moving into Rs 2 lakh crore club.
 
Of the overall stock market wealth, promoters command nearly 50% share, while foreign investors own close to 20% and the rest is shared between institutional and retail investors from India.
 
Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in Indian equities worth Rs 389.73 crore on Thursday, as per provisional stock exchange data.
 
The rupee was trading at 61.91, slightly higher compared with Thursday's 61.87 close. Month-end dollar demand from importers is likely to hurt the Indian unit.

There is  good buzz  around business ecosystem: SitharamanThere is 'good buzz' around business ecosystem, says Nirmala Sitharaman
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 13:55 IST
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
Noting that steps were being taken to improve the overall business environment, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said there is generally good buzz around the ecosystem after the new government came to power.
Sitharaman, who also holds industry portfoiio, said IIP (Index of Industrial Production) saw a growth of 2.8 per cent during the April-September period of current fiscal, after falling for the past three years.
"There is a positive movement after the decline. Hope the trajectory of growth will keep going", she told the Lok Sabha during the Question Hour.
Noting that government is taking various steps to improve the ease of doing business and stimulate industrial production, Sitharaman said that now, there is generally good buzz around the ecosystem. Before growing 2.8 per cent in latest April-September period, IIP had seen negative growth of 0.1 per cent in 2013-14 period.
It fell to 1.1 per cent in 2012-13 period from 2.9 per cent seen in 2011-12 period.
For the creation of a conducive business environment, the government is constantly simplifying and rationalising the processes and procedures for boosting investor sentiment, simplifying FDI policy and correcting the inverted duty structure, she said.
Besides, the government has launched the e-biz mission mode project under the national e-governance plan and also the 'Make In India' programme.
The growth of manufacturing sector during the last three fiscal years has declined continuously, eventually recording marginally negative growth in 2013-14 and the growth of capital goods has been negative during the same years.
However, growth of manufacturing sector and capital goods has registered modest recovery during the first half of the current fiscal year, Sitharaman said.
Admitting that industrial growth numbers were not happy news for the country, Sitharaman said the situation is improving.
She said moderation in domestic demand, build up of inflationary pressure in recent past, increase in input costs and slowdown in other economies were among the reasons for decline in industrial growth.
Responding to a query on whether government is looking into the reasons for fall in industrial production, the Minister replied in the negative and said the figures come as statistical information.

The Indian tablet market reported a strong third quarter, clocking 8 per cent growth over the previous quarter. Tablet makers shipped 0.94 million units in the third quarter of 2014, said International Data Corporation (IDC).
In the previous quarter (Q2), tablet market shipments in India stood at 0.86 million (mn), a 9 per cent growth over the first quarter of the year.
"The initial phase of impulsive buying seems to have faded, as the consumers are more aware of the use case of tablets now. Therefore the current size of the market looks more realistic and stable," said Tanvi Mann, Market Analyst, IDC India.
Among operating systems, Android was clearly the leader with over 90 per cent marketshare. Android is expected to dominate the market in the foreseeable future as well, said IDC.
Sub $200 Windows tablets are expected to see better adoption. Overall, tablet sales have grown slower than expected because of the greater adoption of 'Phablets'.
Samsung continued to corner a large portion of the market, followed by Micromax and iBall. Micromax saw a 15 per cent decline in the quarter compared to the previous quarter. IDC said that iBall is making inroads into be market quickly in the tablet segment.
According to the market research firm, commercial segment is likely to grow in comparison to a stable consumer market in 2015. Government projects and government aided education projects should remain key to the growth in the commercial tablets, said IDC.

(The massive operation to…)
CHANDIGARH: A whopping Rs 26.61 crore was spent on the arrest of self-styled godman Rampal and security arrangements for producing him in court in the contempt case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court was informed today.
Under heavy security cover, the controversial godman was produced before a division bench of justices M Jeyapaul and Darshan Singh here which adjourned the contempt proceedings to December 23 when Rampal along with two other contemnors Ram Kanwar Dhaka and O P Hooda have been directed to be present before the court again.
After the high court issued directions for submitting a statement detailing the expenses incurred on making security arrangements in connection with the appearance of Rampal and his arrest, the states of Haryana and Punjab, Union Territory Chandigarh and the Centre submitted expenditure to the tune of Rs 26.61 crore with the court.
In an affidavit, Haryana DGP S N Vashisht pegged the total expenditure incurred on the Rampal's arrest at Rs 15.43 crore.
This expenditure includes Rs 2.19 crore as damage to public property, government property, farm crop, over Rs 7 crore spent on deployment of police officials including two IGP rank officers, over 5,000 other police officials, Rs 1.69 crore spent by railway police, Rs 2.36 crore as transport expenditure and Rs 4.50 lakh expenditure on 'food for force' while carrying out operation to arrest Rampal from his Satlok Ashram at Barwala in Hisar .
While Punjab and Chandigarh submitted expenditure of Rs 4.34 crore and 3.29 crore respectively on the arrangements for producing Rampal in the court, the Centre said Rs 3.55 crore was spent till November 20.
Wearing a sleeveless jacket and blue shirt, an unshaved Rampal arrived in the court room around 9:30 am. He appeared to be calm and unnerved during the entire court proceedings.
63-year-old Rampal was arrested on November 19 after a two-week tense standoff between his supporters and the police after close to 15,000 of his followers were evacuated from the sprawling premises.

India should not have cancelled talks: Pak PM Nawaz Sharif
Sharif also categorically stated that if India wants to restore ties, the Kashmir issue must be discussed and "that too seriously with full sincerity".
Post your opinion here
 
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said India should not have cancelled the Foreign Secretary-level talks, insisting that there was "nothing new" in consulting Kashmiri leaders ahead of a dialogue.
"We had been talking to the Kashmiri leaders in the past whenever Pakistan-India talks are held. This is nothing new as we have to seek the opinion of the Kashmiri leaders on an issue that concerns them the most," Sharif told reporters on board his aircraft while returning home from the 18th SAARC Summit yesterday.
Consultations held by Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi with Kashmiri separatists led to the cancellation by India of Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh's visit to Islamabad in September. Since then both countries have maintained that they are willing to engage in a meaningful dialogue provided the other side takes the initiative.
Sharif said that India should not have cancelled the Foreign Secretary-level talks as was agreed upon during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his swearing in at New Delhi, The News reported.
He said Pakistan wishes to pursue the dialogue process from a position of dignity, honour and self-respect. "We believe in it and will maintain it at all costs," he said.
Sharif said Pakistan desires a "meaningful" dialogue to resolve all issues including the Kashmir dispute. His remarks come after frosty Indo-Pak ties briefly gave way to some warmth yesterday when a smiling Prime Minister Modi and Sharif shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, but India cautioned against reading too much into such "courtesies".
Moments before the SAARC Summit concluded after two days of deliberations in Kathmandu, Modi and Sharif shook hands and exchanged a few sentences to loud applause of other leaders and their delegations which were witness to the cold vibes between the two Prime Ministers at the opening session when they ignored each other.
Sharif said he twice shook hands with his Indian counterpart and exchanged pleasantries at the SAARC Summit. He said Pakistan has always desired a meaningful dialogue with India with sincerity and wants it to be reciprocated from the other side.
When asked how the ice between the two leaders was broken, Sharif said when he arrived at the retreat, Prime Minister Modi along with other leaders was already there. He met others and also shook hands with Prime Minister Modi.
Sharif also categorically stated that if India wants to restore ties, the Kashmir issue must be discussed and "that too seriously with full sincerity".

Wait over: DDA draw to be finally held todayIt is official now, the much awaited and much delayed draw of lots for Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014 is going to be held on Tuesday, November 25.
 
DDA had earlier scheduled November 5 as the tentative date for holding the draw but the last 20 days saw a massive flip flop as new dates were announced that eventually went by. The draw was again announced on November 17 but a day before DDA said it is postponing the draw indefinitely.
 
DDA said that the draw would now take place at its headquarter Vikas Sadan on November 25 from 11.30 am. The whole process is expected to take about two hours and within an hour after the draw, DDA promises to upload the results on its website http://dda.org.in/ddanew/index.aspx . For the first time, DDA would also webcast the draw live at www.ddadrawlive.in .
 
DDA has offered 25,034 flats in its biggest ever housing scheme and received 10,08,700 applications. For every flat, there are approximately 40 people who have applied, which means each applicant has a 2.5 per cent chance of landing a flat. Though better than the 2010 housing scheme, when the ratio of flats to applicants was about 46, you still need to be very lucky to get a flat when DDA holds its draw of lots.
 
Most of the flats on offer are one bedroom flats. Prices for the flats range from Rs. 6.10 lakh for a Janta flat to Rs. 1.20 crore for a three bedroom flat. Prices of two bedroom flats are in the range of Rs. 70 lakh, while the average price of one bedroom flats – which form the majority – range between Rs. 14 to 20 lakh.
 
DDA sold 17 lakh housing scheme forms and got a record number of applications. The high number of applications resulted in the draw getting delayed as the 14-year-old and obsolete application being used by DDA has been unable to process the huge data.
 
If your name doesn’t figure in the list of the lucky 25,034 applicants who get a flat, DDA would return the registration amount of Rs. One lakh within three months.
 
DDA would also draw a list of applicants in a separate waiting list was also made. If any applicant cancels the allotment or is disqualified on any ground, the flat will go to the next person on the waiting list. The names and application numbers of those on the waiting list, however, would be kept a secret.

Game is to hide: Srinivasan symbolic of deeper rotprint
Prime time news television thrives on the idea of a daily enemy, someone who can be court-martialled every night and then pronounced guilty by the news anchor playing the double role of judge and prosecutor. Politicians are the staple accused, but in the last 18 months our netas have had competition from a cricket official. In news television’s imagination, N Srinivasan has come to exemplify the rot in the country’s number one sport and there have been loud calls for his removal from the cricket board. But much like our netas, Srinivasan too hasn’t been willing to budge, his bulldog-like brazen refusal to quit making him a walking talking advertisement for Fevicol. But is the big boss from Chennai really the ‘bad man’ of Indian cricket?
To be fair, Srinivasan is not like some of our politicians who see cricket administration as just another sticker on their CV. He is a genuine cricket lover, his family and company India Cements have been involved with patronising the sport for almost 50 years now. There is also no evidence that he has been involved in spot or match fixing, or that his wealth has come from the sport. Srinivasan’s ‘crime’ is not corruption as is popularly understood, but an abuse of power stemming from a blatant ‘conflict of interest’.
It is this notion of ‘conflict of interest’ that lies at the heart of the Supreme Court’s trenchant observations against Srinivasan. As the court observes: “You are the person managing the BCCI. You are also the person having a team in the IPL as owner of the Chennai Super Kings. Is it not a conflict of interest?” The standard legal definition of ‘conflict of interest’ is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.”
Clearly, Srinivasan in his dual role has violated this principle: How else can one explain the attempt to whitewash the entire betting controversy involving the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, absurdly referred to as a “cricket enthusiast”. Or that captain of the CSK and India team MS Dhoni is also the vice-president of India Cements?
But the larger question is this: Is ‘conflict of interest’ really a concept that is taken seriously enough, or is Srinivasan simply symbolic of a deeper malaise in public life? Interestingly, the rules of the IPL were amended to allow Srinivasan to own a franchise when Sharad Pawar was BCCI president and Lalit Modi the driving force behind the league. Modi has denied it, but the fact is, there have been persistent allegations that he distributed select franchises like Rajasthan Royals to relatives and friends.
Pawar too exemplifies “conflict of interest”: Remember he was the country’s agriculture minister for a decade even while having vast personal interests in the agricultural sector. Could sugar policies, for example, not be ‘fixed’ by Pawar for individual benefit, and was this issue raised strongly enough when he was in power? Would he not have been better off in another ministry where he didn’t have to face such a charge?
The fact is, we have members of Parliament who might own an airline and yet be on the standing committee on civil aviation; own a television channel and be shaping policy on broadcasting; be in the mining business and seek changes in mining regulation. While Parliament’s rules are meant to prohibit such ‘conflict’, the obvious ethical transgressions are rarely seen as such.
A few years ago, actor-turned-politician Hema Malini landed herself in a spot of bother when in a rare intervention in Parliament she asked for an excise cut for water purifiers that used reverse osmosis technology. What she forgot, or didn’t wish to reveal, is that she had a direct commercial link with one such equipment manufacturer as its brand ambassador. When confronted later, her weak response was: “I don’t know nothing about any such rules, I speak for people’s concerns.” The innocence was touching, but few would believe it. Indeed, a sting operation a few years ago revealed how the entire business of asking questions in Parliament can be influenced at times by commercial considerations.
The solution to these glaring instances of ‘conflict of interest’ lies in equally open disclosure norms. If a newspaper or a channel, for example, is doing a story on a particular sector or business in which it has direct pecuniary interests, it must be incumbent to disclose that interest. A few do, a majority don’t. Are there bureaucrats whose children work in private firms whose fortunes could be influenced by the decisions the officer takes? Are there judges who choose to frame a law which might help a firm in which a family member has a stake? Sadly, in an opaque society, there is a tendency to hide information rather than place it in the sunshine of the public discourse.
Which is why Srinivasan perhaps didn’t even bother with the glaring conflict in his dual role as BCCI head and owner of an IPL team. And which is why even today he is unwilling to either sever his ties with the Chennai franchise or step out of cricket administration. After all, like so much else in a cosy club like the BCCI, it really is all in the family where the rules are made and bent by those who are often its direct beneficiaries.
Post-script: Interestingly, another former senior BCCI official and now finance minister Arun Jaitley has set a seemingly healthy precedent. He has apparently recused himself from all matters pertaining to the `20,000 crore Vodafone tax dispute and delegated decision-making in this regard to the junior minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, and the revenue secretary. Jaitley had advised Vodafone as a senior lawyer in the case.

'Tis the season to gawk at festive holiday displays — and this year's crop of retail facades are sure to draw attention.  Stores such as Tiffany, Macy's and Lord & Taylor have unveiled elaborate displays filled with bright colors, unique characters and a plethora of holiday pizzazz.
Festive store windows have been a New York holiday tradition since the 1870s, when Macy's started featuring dolls in Christmas scenes. Since then, the scenes have transformed into elaborate, animated and interactive displays at all the major department stores along Fifth Avenue.
This year, Macy's showcases the story of a boy who imagines what Christmas would be like on other planets. Bergdorf Goodman's windows are centered around the arts, featuring influential figures in literature, architecture, sculpture, film, dance, theater and painting. Barney's partnered with film director Baz Luhrmann and his costume-designer wife Catherine Martin for an elaborate display of optical illusions, a giant mechanical owl, and psychedelic 'love mixtape' boom box surrounded by rainbow-colored mushrooms.
The planning starts a year in advance, from discussing ideas to rendering designs to manufacturing the pieces and then installing scenes, says Roya Sullivan, national director of window presentation at Macy's.
"We like to combine the old school artistry of sculptural pieces with mechanical and digital ability," she says. "It's truly an art."
Some windows are more commercial, like Bloomingdale's modern display of chic party-goers and interactive touchscreens.
Sibyl McCormac Groff, a New York tour guide and historian who leads a Christmas walking tour of Manhattan, says she's drawn to whimsical windows. This year, her favorites are Bergdorf-Goodman's.
"They are so creative," she says. "Look at the work that went into it. Those are just fabulous."
As technology has evolved, so have the displays. Once lit with gas lights, windows now come to life with multi-colored LED light shows and video screens. One of the Macy's windows is interactive: a touchscreen portion of the glass invites people to play a game called Neptune Wars that, once completed, lights up an ice city depicted on the distant planet.
To a degree, the windows have "become competitive," Groff says, an opportunity to draw in shoppers during what has become the most crucial time of year for  sales. But Sullivan says the windows are about honoring a tradition and the excitement of the season. "It is our gift to the city," she says. "We reach into every person's inner child and bring out the magic of Christmas."
Indeed, Macy's helped solidify New York's reputation as a Christmas destination with holiday windows and then its Santaland, Groff says, immortalized in the film classic Miracle on 34th Street, about a department store Santa put on trial for believing he's the real deal.
The displays remain a nod to New York's storied holiday history, one that led Groff to coin the term Gothamtide for the city's secular festivity –  "to show the commonality that we all have," she says. "It's just the excitement here."
Saks Fifth Avenue's "enchanted experience" theme features classic fairytale characters such as Cinderella and Prince Charming visiting and shopping in New York City.

Veritas analyst turns himself in to police for Indiabulls reportTigerair, Axis Bank to offer one-way free ticket from Singapore
More than two years after Indiabulls Group filed a police complaint against Canadian brokerage firm Veritas Research and its two analysts Neeraj Monga and Nitin Mangal for coming out with a scathing report against its group companies and alleging that Monga had demanded money for holding it back, Mangal finally surrendered before the Gurgaon police on Tuesday.
“Mangal surrendered on Tuesday and we produced him in court. He has been booked under Sections 383, 384 (extortion) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, in addition to Sections 66 A and B (sending offensive messages) and b (dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource) of the IT Act. He has been remanded in police custody till December 1,” said Sangeeta Rani, DCP West, Gurgaon confirming the development.
A source close to the development told that while Mangal had applied for anticipatory bail with the Supreme Court, the plea was rejected. He was thus left with no option but to make himself available to the police.

India imports nearly two-thirds of its crude oil requirement. The sharp fall in global crude prices will cut companies’ import bills,  enabling them to reduce retail prices of petrol and diesel.
Domestic oil industry sources said petrol prices could fall below Rs. 60 a litre in the coming weeks, if the slide in global crude prices continues to follow the current pattern.
Lower fuel costs will aid the government’s efforts to keep inflation low and stable.
India’s retail inflation fell to a three-year low of 5.52% in October while the wholesale inflation rate plunged to a five-year low of 1.77%, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.
Lower inflation, in turn, could prompt the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates and nudge banks to lower home loan EMIs.
“If the slide in oil prices continues, we can expect petrol prices to drop below Rs. 60 a litre from around Rs. 65 presently (in Delhi),” said the chairman of a leading oil company seeking anonymity.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel of 12 oil producing nations that controls 40% of the world’s oil output, in a five-hour meeting in Vienna decided not to reduce production, despite a 30% fall in oil prices since June.
Since August, petrol has turned cheaper by Rs. 9.36 a litre in six price cuts, while diesel prices have been cut by Rs. 5.62 a litre since October.
Petrol now cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 71.91 in Mumbai. Diesel, India’s most consumed fuel, costs Rs. 53.35 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 61.04 in Mumbai. Prices vary between states due to local levies.
Softer crude prices will also bolster the government’s plans to tame inflation and curtail fuel subsidies. A lower subsidy bill will help contain fiscal deficit — a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Being the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, India imports around 190 million tonnes of crude oil a year at $145 billion, or more than a third of its total import bill. With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore.

Analyst Corner: Further re-rating likely for PFC; maintain buySpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Reaffirm ‘buy’ on Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and raise our 6-month target price of R385 per share (earlier R248) as we now value the stock at a P/B of 1.4x on our FY16e BVPS (previously 1.25x for FY14e),  to reflect a reduced risk we see for its power sector lending activity. We expect several positive policy decisions on the power sector in the coming months, which should improve PFC’s loan growth and asset quality prospects and drive a re-rating of the stock. Our FY16-17e EPS are 7-12% higher than the Bloomberg consensus, as we are more bullish on PFC’s loan growth and NIM.
PFC trades at a 1.1x P/B based on our FY16e BVPS of R269, which is at about a 15% discount to its past-5-year mean P/B. The market’s lingering concerns about PFC’s asset quality and loan growth outlook are currently reflected in a lower P/B for the stock compared with its ROE, but we believe these are overdone and that the stock will re-rate over the coming months.
We forecast PFC to deliver strong net profit growth over FY15-17, driven by our projections of a 17.5% loan CAGR and a stable NIM for this period. We forecast its net profit to rise at a CAGR of 20% over FY15-17. PFC looks well-placed to generate loan growth over FY15-17 without diluting its equity further given its strong capital adequacy ratio. Thus, we forecast the company to maintain a high ROE of 21% in FY15 and about 22% in each of FY16 and FY17.

Gold futures fell by 0.47 per cent to Rs 26,509 per 10 grams at the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as speculators offloaded their positions tracking a weak global trend.
Market analysts said the fall in gold futures was mostly due to a weakening trend in the global market as crude oil at the lowest level in four years increased prospects for a cooling of consumer prices, reducing demand for an inflation hedge.
In the futures market , the yellow metal for delivery in far-month February fell by Rs 125 (or 0.47 per cent) to Rs 25,509 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 265 lots.
On similar lines, gold for delivery in December plunged by Rs 117 (or 0.45 per cent) to Rs 26,130 per 10 grams in 529 lots.
Meanwhile, gold in Singapore, which sets the price trend on the domestic front, dropped 0.90 per cent to US $1,181.84 an ounce, its lowest since November 20.

See oil @ $70: HSBC | Sensex gains 350 pts on rate hopes as oil cracksBrent price
(Following the OPEC decision…)
NEW DELHI: OPEC maintained its existing 30mbd output ceiling at its 27 November meeting, which pushed the Brent crude prices to a 4-year low of $71.25 on Thursday. This leaves the oil market with a prospective supply surplus of around 1mbd for 2015, HSBC said in a report.
According to the global investment bank, this seems to paint a bleak outlook for crude prices, we think sentiment (and prices) could bottom fairly rapidly if we start to see signs of the market adjusting - notably in falling US drilling activity or rising demand estimates.
Following the OPEC decision it may take some while for the market to tighten materially, so a significant rebound in prices does not look likely that soon, said the report.
Indeed, in the absence of further near-term news flow, it is quite possible to see Brent prices breaching the USD70/bbl level, says HSBC who thinks that the near-term impact of lower oil prices is likely to be varied.
They continue to assume a USD85/bbl price for Brent for 1Q15 and an average price of USD90/bbl for 2015. Longer term, the impact of weak prices on non-OPEC investment should cause a tightening of the crude market, leading prices to rise in the coming years. This reinforces their confidence in our longer-term USD95/bbl Brent price assumption, added the report.
Clearly, oil producers will suffer and oil importers benefit. However, we caution against getting too carried away with the good news that comes with lower oil prices, said the HSBC report.
The investment bank believes that falling oil prices are a mild positive for the European economies. However, given the broader macro environment and high debt levels it seems likely that any benefit to corporate or household disposable income will be saved rather than spent.
Instead they believe that the biggest beneficiaries are in the emerging world, most notably India, Korea and Turkey.
A further drop in inflation could spur central banks to become even more dovish, said the HSBC report. In combination with a positive impact on corporate profits, this should have a positive effect on equity markets.
However, the USD high-yield credit market is vulnerable because a high proportion of the market is oil producers. Selective EM currencies could also come under pressure, they say.

Rahul Gandhi backs evicted slum dwellers in DelhiRahul Gandhi backs evicted slum dwellers in Delhi
Sidhartha Dutta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 27, 2014
First Published: 23:52 IST(27/11/2014) | Last Updated: 13:15 IST(28/11/2014)

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday visited slum-dwellers of Israeli Camp in Rangpuri Pahari near Vasant Kunj — that was demolished by the forest department on Tuesday — and dared the Delhi government to run a bulldozer over him.
“These people (slum dwellers) are innocent and they should not be rendered homeless. If they want to run a bulldozer here, they should first run it on me,” said Gandhi. “The Congress has always fought for the poor and shall continue to fight for them,” he added.
Gandhi reached the Israeli camp area around 7:30 pm amid a lot of chaos and confusion, triggering almost a stampede-like situation with even his security guards failing to control the crowd. He spent at least 45 minutes in the area, taking stock of the situation and speaking to the residents.
“My grandson was born two weeks ago. He was inside the house when the bulldozer came to carry out the demolition. We pleaded with them to spare our house for the sake of the newborn. But they did not listen to us. Now the baby and his mother are living outside in this cold weather,” said Lal Dori, who works as a daily-wage labourer in Vasant Kunj.
More than 2,000 residents were rendered homeless after the forest department pulled down 500 houses and left a large number of people to spend their nights out in the open.
Many of the affected families had migrated to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and have been living here for the past 20-25 years.
Most of them are daily-wage labourers, with a handful among them working as drivers, maids and some even running small businesses in the vicinity.
“They didn’t even allow us to fetch our belongings from the house. We have lost all our possessions and now have been left to die in the cold. Had it not been for Bal Vikas Dhara (an NGO), we would have starved since yesterday,” said Raheeba, a mother of six children.
Other political parties too were quick to oppose the forcible eviction.
The AAP said the action was taken at the behest of BJP MLA SP Rana with an intention to polarise the atmosphere.
According to sources, L-G Najeeb Jung has indicted the forest department for carrying out the drive without any notice.

Wrap  It Up: Why the Best Gift You Can Give Yourself Is Entrepreneurshipreddit
Think you don't have the time or experience to start your own business? University of Pennsylvania freshman Brandon Saw became an entrepreneur one week before starting college. Three months later, Brandon launched his Kickstarter campaign raising over $27,000 and now he's back home speaking to students at the University of Washington on being a successful young entrepreneur creating work for yourself and others.
What made you want to launch a product?
The number one thing I wanted was the experience. I was actually looking at going into business in the future, so I thought launching a small Kickstarter would be a good way to learn some basic marketing and manufacturing. And it has definitely paid off in this area, more so than I ever imagined it could. From finances, to people skills, to graphic design, running a Kickstarter campaign teaches you a little of everything.
How do you run a Kickstarter while being a full-time student?
It's definitely a challenge but it's manageable. It can feel easy to let the business overwhelm my time but I have to remind myself that my grades are a priority. And I find that even when I put my studies first, I still have time every day to manage Wrap. When I don't let my tasks fill my time, I find that I have plenty of time to get things done. And being a university student has lots of benefits as well. There's a lot of great faculty here that let me bounce ideas off of them, one professor has written several papers on Kickstarter dynamics, and another who has actually launched his own and raised $65,000.
Why did you choose Kickstarter as a platform to launch Wrap?
I knew I wanted to launch on Kickstarter from very early on. Crowdfunding is an incredible way to get eyes on what you're doing, essentially for free. It makes it very easy to see if there's a demand for what you're doing and get a proof-of-concept. There were only about three months between the first idea of Wrap, and when we launched our Kickstarter. Just enough time for me to make sure I had all the logistics covered. And I only had to spend a little over a hundred dollars to get it rolling, and almost all of it went towards prototyping. The rest was on domain names, boosting Facebook posts, and other small stuff. You can put together a good-looking Kickstarter page and project without investing a ton of capital, and get the same exposure as products that have been through years of design and refinement.
How did you get Wrap off the ground?
I just tried to get the ball rolling as fast as I could. I had the idea about a week before move-in day, and three days after I was moved in I had the first prototype in my hands. The next step was taking the time to set up a good-looking website. Having a link with a few pictures of your product, along with a couple selling points, helps tremendously in having people take you more seriously. From then on it was just getting feedback from as many people as humanly possible, and working out the logistics in order to launch my Kickstarter.
What is the biggest challenge of being a 'student entrepreneur'?
Sometimes it gets easy to doubt yourself. Doing a project like this isn't the norm in college, so you get a lot of peers and others that don't take your product seriously. And it's not the product, it's that they don't believe a college student could really have a great idea. Having critics like that is just part of the game when you start at this age. There are a lot of people who didn't take me seriously until I could concretely show some success.
What's the best advice you'd give another student entrepreneur?
Don't be afraid to reach out to people. I've emailed other local students with business ventures and asked them if they had time to get lunch with me. I've cold-pitched executives at major companies and a lot of them were actually very willing to help. I've gotten some invaluable legal advice from just calling a lawyer who's a friend of a friend. It never hurts to ask, so really tap your network, which is bigger than you think. It's pleasantly surprising how many people are willing to help out a student entrepreneur.
What's the best advice you've received?
A professor told me to make sure I'm aware of the opportunity cost of my time. As a student, there are a lot of new opportunities that we could be exploring besides trying to launch a business. So while it's great to be passionate and dedicated to what you're doing, don't be so consumed with it that you can't have a balanced lifestyle.  I'm very driven and ambitious, but I have to remind myself that it may not be worth it to work all day and night for a week just to make a deal that's worth a few hundred dollars. Be aware of what's practical and worth your time.
Who is your business role model?
Definitely Elon Musk. And that's not just because he's a Penn alumni. It's obviously incredible how he has started and owned so many different influential companies, but I especially admire his vision. He really wants to use his businesses to change the world, and not in a clichéd way. PayPal changed how transactions occur, SolarCity revolutionized practical, sustainable energy, Tesla is breaking ground in environmentally conscious electric cars, and of course Space X is looking to make the greatest advancement in technology yet. It's amazing how all of his endeavors aim to make a huge impact on the world.
What's something you wish you had known before you started?
You're going to get 'nos'. You're going to get people who don't like your product. And you just have to know that that comes with being an entrepreneur. We've all heard this before. We've heard stories about how startups like Microsoft and Facebook got rejected, so we think it'll be really easy to brush off. But at one point someone whose professional opinion I valued very highly essentially told me I was wasting my time, and nothing can really prepare you for that. Have confidence in what you're doing.
What has been the most enjoyable memory of launching Wrap?
It was definitely when the first 'stranger' backed my project. I remember the Gmail notification popping up on my screen, and the thrill (as strange as it sounds) of not recognizing the name. There was something immensely gratifying in seeing someone who was willing to pledge their money solely on the merits of my idea and story.
What's a lesson you've learned so far that other student entrepreneurs can learn from?
Low hanging fruit usually isn't low hanging fruit. There have been a lot of opportunities that sound great and seem to solve a lot of problems, but they either don't live up to expectations or they don't pan out. Be practical and (at the risk of using two idioms) don't count your chickens before they hatch. A lot of entrepreneurs think there's just one thing holding them back. If only they had this much capital, or if only that media source featured my project. I think that a lot of times this wishful thinking leads me to making excuses, and it's a better use of my time to do the best with what I have.
Brandon inspires me as I balance a full-time job, while organizing the GlobalMindED Conference with a team of dedicated volunteers and board members. I'm also reminded of my transition from corporate America to my company LifeBound , when I held a day job while laying the groundwork for my own business. Much of our new economy will be fueled by the risks, commitments, and efforts of entrepreneurs like Brandon who learn how to do at least two big things at one time.

BJP to restart talks with Sena today over joining govtBJP to restart talks with Sena today over joining govt
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Nov 28, 2014 12:36 PM IST
Ending weeks of acrimony between the former saffron allies, the BJP and Shiv Sena will today resume talks on the issue of the latter joining the four-week-old government in Maharashtra.
The BJP, facing the heat from several quarters over NCP's outside support to it to form the government, is keen to take the Sena onboard to ensure a stable government.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis yesterday said his party is keen to join hands with the Sena once again after a bitter split in the run up to the Assembly elections.
"I spoke with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on phone a few days back and talks between the two parties will start on Friday," Fadnavis told reporters yesterday.
"From BJP, we have asked Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra minister Chandrakant Patil to open the talks with the Sena. Both parties may have fought elections separately, but there is no reason why we cannot come together," he said.
Uddhav, however, chose to keep mum on Fadnavis' comments and said he would talk to the BJP when it initiates the process.
"I am willing to resume talks with them (BJP). But let them start at least," Thackeray said.
A senior BJP leader told PTI on condition of anonymity that the Sena will almost certainly join the government during the next Cabinet expansion.
"The Cabinet expansion will happen either on 30th of this month or December 1. I'm almost certain that Sena will come on board," the leader said.
The state Assembly's winter session will commence from December 8.
In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs, while the Shiv Sena is the second largest party with 63 legislators.
The Sena's inclusion in the Fadnavis government will also strengthen the latter's position as it is 22 short of simple majority in the House.

SAARC: Modi pledges investments to counter C...Narendra Modi woos Saarc nations, pledges slew of investments to counter China

(Modi said India would fund…)
KATHMANDU: India pledged a slew of regional investments at Saarc summit this week, seeking to counter China's growing economic inroads into its backyard as it remains embroiled in bitter rivalry with Pakistan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would fund regional infrastructure, health facilities and even a communications satellite, and promised to free up its markets to exporters in smaller countries in the region.
Modi has made clear that boosting India's influence in its immediate neighbourhood is a key strategic priority for his government.
Critics say the previous Congress party government began to take relationships for granted, allowing economic giant China — which shares a border with four of India's neighbours — to step into the breach.
But the failure of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) to make any significant progress during a two-day meeting underscored the scale of the challenge New Delhi faces.
Cross-border trade among the eight Saarc nations — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — still accounts for less than five percent of total commerce in the region.
"Indians want to keep South Asia as their exclusive sphere of influence," said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs in Delhi.
"To do that... we need to play the economic game and we need to play the connectivity game better. We have been protectionist, and that is not good," he said, welcoming Modi's pledge to help smaller nations reduce their trade deficits with India.
Leaders signed just one agreement, on energy cooperation, at a summit that was overshadowed by the rivalries between India and Pakistan, leading host country Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala to say that Saarc had fallen short of expectations.
Nepal, long under the political influence of New Delhi, has benefited hugely from China's bounty over the last decade, getting much-needed new roads and other infrastructure. Even the venue where the leaders met was built with Chinese money.
It is among several Saarc nations including Pakistan and Sri Lanka that reportedly support full membership for China, which currently enjoys observer status in the regional grouping.
India has resisted promoting its regional rival to full membership status, which comes with the power to veto agreements.
Frustrated by the slow pace of progress towards regional cooperation, it has also sought to woo its neighbours outside the Saarc framework.
Modi held separate meetings with all the Saarc leaders except Pakistan's on the summit's sidelines, and agreed a deal to invest in a major hydropower plant in Nepal shortly after arriving.
But China has deeper pockets than India, which also suffers from a reputation for unwanted interference in the domestic affairs of some of its neighbours.
Nepalese newspapers criticised Modi for urging the country's leaders to complete a constitution-drafting process that has dragged on for years shortly after he landed.
"While his advice is correct, the place and context were wrong," the Republica daily said in an editorial, accusing the Indian leader of violating "diplomatic decorum".
Analyst Tanvi Madan of the Washington-based Brookings Institution said it was natural for the smaller Saarc states to cozy up to China.
"Indian policymakers and analysts objecting loudly to these links is futile and, arguably, counterproductive," she wrote in a briefing paper ahead of the summit.
"An effective Indian approach requires presenting a viable alternative. It means convincing Saarc countries that it wants to take them along on the path to economic prosperity."

Six months after he left his suburban Mumbai home to join Islamic State militants, 22-year-old Areeb Majeed returned from West Asia on Friday and was being questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), officials said.
Hindustan Times was the first to report that Areeb, earlier thought to have been killed in an air strike, was alive and had called his father, Dr Ijaz Majeed, seeking help to return from Turkey.

“I am yet to meet him or contact him. I will first offer Friday prayers and then plan how to meet my son,” Dr Majeed said.
Sources say Areeb landed at Mumbai international airport at 5:15am and was immediately taken into custody by NIA officials.
Areeb and three other young men – Fahad Shaikh, Saheem Tanki and Amaan Tandel —from Kalyan in Maharashtra’s Thane district went to Iraq in May to join the jihadi group, investigators said. How Areeb managed to escape and go to Turkey is still unknown.
According to police, the four engineering students – radicalised over the internet – flew to Baghdad as part of a group of 22 pilgrims visiting religious shrines in Iraq. But intelligence agencies later intercepted phone calls where the men were crying and asking their families to seek the government’s help for their return.
On August 26, Saheem called up Dr Majeed and told him that his son had become a “martyr”, and Pakistan-based terrorist group Anwar-ul-Tawhid declared Areeb’s martyrdom on its now-defunct website.
Maharashtra’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which earlier questioned the youngsters’ relatives, is also in touch with the NIA over Areeb’s return, sources said.
Intelligence and security officials have warned that the Islamic State is trying to indoctrinate and recruit young volunteers online from India – home to the world’s second-largest Muslim population.
However, national security adviser Ajit Doval said at this month's HT Leadership Summit that no more than 10 Indian Muslims had gone to join IS militants in Iraq and Syria.

The encounter in Arnia sector of Jammu region close to Indo-Pak border ended on Friday morning after the remaining fourth militant was gunned down by security forces during the terror attack on an Army patrol that in all left 12 people dead including five civilians and three army personnel.

"The encounter has ended and boys did a good job by preventing the militants from striking anywhere," Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police K Rajendra told PTI.
"In all, we have lost three army personnel and five civilians. All the four militants have been killed," he said, after the end of the encounter this morning which lasted over 24 hours following the fidayeen attack.
On Thursday, it was stated that four militants were killed and one more was still holed up in an army bunker which came under attack. Officials said there was some confusion on establishing the identity of one the dead on Thursday.
The operation to neutralise the militants began Thursday morning and went on throughout the day but was suspended during the night.
An army official said that security forces, who had launched a cordon and search operation at the site of encounter in Arnia Friday morning to retrieve bodies of the civilians, came under fire from a militant holed up in a bunker triggering fresh exchanges in which he was killed.

Piecing together the events that led to the attack, sources in the security establishment said all the four terrorists had entered India from across the Indo-Pak border during the intervening night of November 26 and 27 and were hiding behind a culvert when they were spotted by Territorial Army personnel.
A fierce gunbattle then ensued and the terrorists who were in combat fatigues later entered two abandoned bunkers and remained holed up before three of them were neutralised.
Security officials suspected that the militants wanted to carry out a sensational strike in the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir to coincide with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held a poll rally in Udhampur on Friday. The venue of the rally was about 100 km from Arnia.
On November 26, Pakistani rangers had fired on some posts in Arnia sector and by the time the troops could retaliate, the four militants are believed to have infiltrated into the state, official sources said. BSF, which guards the International Border(IB), maintains there was no sign of infiltration.
The five civilians who died also included two people who had tried to flee from the car, in which they were travelling, when it got caught in the cross-fire between militants and security personnel.

BJP event at AMU may spark  communal conflagration   warns V-CFresh trouble brews in AMU over BJP event

Aligarh Muslim University vice chancellor on Friday wrote to Human resource development (HRD) minister Smriti Irani, warning of "communal conflagration" if the BJP goes ahead with plans to mark the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap in the varsity premises.
Without naming the BJP in his letter, vice chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah said if "certain elements" go ahead with their plans to hold a demonstration at AMU on December 1, "it could lead to massive student unrest at the campus".
The debate started after some BJP leaders decided to hold a demonstration on the campus on the birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap, an alumnus of AMU, whose family was closely associated with Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of the institution.
"Some elements are threatening to hold a demonstration on the grounds that Raja Mahendra Pratap donated large tracts of land for establishment of AMU and should be honoured accordingly," the vice chancellor's letter said.
"We have always acknowledged that the Raja did lease 3.04 acres of land to AMU in 1929 at a rate of Rs. 2/- per annum. We are proud of this freedom fighter. However, there were a large number of other donors and the main campus of the AMU was built on a land procured from the British government originally belonging to the Aligarh cantonment," he said.
Some local and state BJP leaders had recently claimed that AMU was built on land donated by Raja Mahendra Pratap but AMU authorities "failed to acknowledge his contribution".
The vice chancellor said that in order to defuse the situation, they had agreed to hold a joint celebration on Raja's birth anniversary
"On November 25, at the instance of some ex-servicemen of this district, who offered to mediate, I held a meeting with representatives of some outfits who are threatening to hold the demonstration.The idea was to defuse the situation and we agreed to hold a joint celebration of the Raja's anniversary".
However, the decision to observe the anniversary has now been revoked due to reports that there are internal differences within the group which was holding the protest, he said.

SC urges Centre to continue with German as third language in KendriyaVidyalayasWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: November 29, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 29, 2014 2:56 am
THE government was on Friday compelled to revisit its decision to immediately replace German with Sanskrit as the compulsory third language from Class VI to VIII in Kendriya Vidyalayas with the Supreme Court nudging it to put off the implementation to next academic year in the interests of the students.
Questioning as to why students should suffer  because of the mistake of the government, the court urged the Centre to defer its decision and granted it a week’s time to decide whether it was willing to continue with German as a third language and Sanskrit could be introduced as an additional one for this session.
A bench of Justices Anil R Dave and Kurian Jospeh remained unimpressed with Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s argument that German could not be allowed since the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the KV with Max Mueller Bhavan was “wrong and illegal”. He had asserted that allowing the foreign language even for one more day would mean permitting an illegality to persist.
The court retorted that the students could not be faulted for this fiasco and that it was more concerned about the difficulties they would have to face if a new language is introduced mid-session. “Why are you punishing students for your mistake?” asked the bench, while suggesting that German could remain a third language and Sanskrit could rather be introduced as an additional one for this session.
It asked the Attorney General to communicate the court’s feelings to the HRD Ministry on postponing the implementation of the decision and fixed the matter for hearing on December 5.
Justice Dave, who headed the bench, said: “As an individual, I am for Sanskrit. Sanskrit is the mother language of all our languages. Why should we forget about our culture? With Sanskrit, you can learn other languages easily as it is mother of all languages. But students must not be affected.”
The court added: “Think from the point of view of students and and parents. Let this academic year continue and you better implement it next year.”
The court was hearing a petition filed by a group of parents of KV students, challenging the Centre’s decision to replace German language with Sanskrit in middle of ongoing academic session.
Responding, the government filed its affidavit, making it clear that Sanskrit will be the compulsory third language from Class VI to VIII in KV but the syllabus and marks awarded in the current session will be that of an entry-level course to avoid “undue stress” on students.
Earlier, on November 21, the SC had agreed to give an urgent hearing on the plea.

HBO shows us freedom from cable may not be so free3
Cable companies, on average, pay more than $6 per month per subscriber to carry ESPN, according to media research firm SNL Kagan. If anything, ESPN parent Disney would charge more if it had to sell it on its own to offset the amount it now gets from people who may never watch its programming and protect the value of the bundled deals it now has.
But, just to show that these stand-alone services are front of mind behind the scenes, part of ESPN's most recent deal with the National Basketball Association announced earlier this month included a nine-year licensing agreement to establish a framework for an online-only streaming joint venture.
Within the TV industry, this bypass of broadcast, cable and satellite is referred to as OTT, or an "over the top" service. For viewers of a certain age, this conjures up memories of "Over the Top," a 1987 Sylvester Stallone flop about an arm-wrestling truck driver out to win the respect of his estranged son that was everything its title promised.
Watching Stallone cash his $12 million paycheck would have been more entertaining. But the film nonetheless wound up in heavy rotation on cable in the late '80s and early '90s, helping define the "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)" era that seems quaint by today's standards.
Twenty-some years later, some shows and movies still seem to be in a continuous loop. Yet there are countless programs available all the time, many worth watching, and plenty of platforms to watch them on. In the end, it's likely not going to be a question of whether anything's on, but what it's worth.
There are many unknowns in this new paradigm, including what happens to the variety of new programming viewers now enjoy if marginal channels don't get a financial boost from stronger ones and whether customer service stands to get better or worse independent of cable companies.
What's clear is the momentum, and the money, is headed one way. Everyone in media, whether ad supported or not, is looking for new revenue sources and is determined to land them. Sony plans to launch an Internet TV service. Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has invested in Roku, which, like Apple, Google and Amazon, puts out devices to help viewers channel streaming shows onto home TVs.
Celebrate all of this if you want, but you might want to save your cash rather than pay for party favors.
Up to now, cord cutters who had a friend with HBO could access current programs on its online complement service, HBO Go, with a borrowed password. One imagines the data collected through this usage has helped inform HBO's strategy. Although nothing official has been said, the lax policing probably ends.
For "Game of Thrones," you'll have to ante up — and that's just the beginning.

Bad Credit Linked to Higher Heart Attack Riskbad credit linked to higher heart attack risk
Google s Brian Fitzpatrick says he s got just...0
Before adopting the ticketing system at Alinea, consistently rated among the top restaurants in the world, Kokonas employed three full-time workers to handle reservation lines, he wrote in a June blog post. The post, long enough to be deemed a manifesto for restaurant ticketing, has generated more than 1 million page views, Kokonas said.
"A high volume of calls, especially around the days we would open a month's reservations book, meant that callers often could not get through," he wrote. "One time so many people called that the entire 312-867 exchange went down. AT&T asked us if we were running a Groupon."
Fitzpatrick met Kokonas Jan. 14, 2009. He knows the date.
"I keep almost everything," he demurred, half-joking, in a joint phone interview with Kokonas, as he looked up the date. "Grant had come over to Google to give a talk."
Thereafter, Kokonas and Fitzpatrick kept bumping into each other at dinners or events. Fitzpatrick invited Kokonas to ORD Camp. And at some point, Kokonas began soliciting Fitzpatrick's advice, forwarding that blog post, for instance, and asking for feedback.
Fitzpatrick replied that he had already read the post. Twice.
"He asked me to vet some engineers, to help him find some people who are not going to screw him over," Fitzpatrick said. "So we sat in his kitchen and drank espresso for two hours. And I decided I didn't want to advise people on this. I wanted to do this. I think this is the future of restaurants."
Fitzpatrick joked that when he extended the offer, it was the only moment he'd ever seen Kokonas rendered speechless.
"I didn't expect it," Kokonas said. "But I instantly said, 'OK. We'll figure it out.' He's joining not as an employee but as a founding partner in this effort."
When Fitzpatrick launched Google's Chicago engineering team in 2005, the company employed him and 29 sales people here, he said.
"One engineer showed up in jeans, and everybody else was dressed up fancy," Fitzpatrick recalled. "And I thought, it's never going to be the same, folks."
Chicago is now home to more than 550 employees, including about 100 engineers, according to a Google spokeswoman.
Fitzpatrick, who goes by "Fitz," has not helmed the engineering team here for many years. He moved on to found and lead Google's "data liberation front," ensuring Google users can take their files and photos elsewhere, or delete them.
He also leads the company's transparency engineering team, which tallies and helps publish the number and types of government requests Google receives to remove content or turn over information about users for criminal investigations. His umbrella included attempted and achieved government censorship, concerns about copyright and trademark violations, as well as government surveillance.
"Fitz's vision, leadership and energy have made a big impact both here at Google Chicago and in the Chicago tech community," Jim Lecinski, the head of Google's Chicago office, said in a statement.
A New Orleans native, he came to Chicago to study Latin and minor in Greek at Loyola University. Prior to joining Google, he was a software engineer at CollabNet and Apple. He also co-wrote "Team Geek: A Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others" with Ben Collins-Sussman.
Most importantly, he says he refuses to move to Silicon Valley.

How to deal with insurance contractors after a fire0
How do you find an independent claims adjuster? Your telephone book or the Internet will list a number. Try to interview two or three just to make sure they know what they are doing and are truly independent. The problem is that some are hungry for business and often get to the fire before the fire department.
The second thing you should do is find a company that will do the reconstruction, so that you get an estimate of what the repairs will cost. That company does not necessarily have to be a fire-related company, but it certainly helps if it has experience working with insurance companies, especially yours.
You should also alert your lender. You may not realize it, but once you reach agreement with your insurance carrier, its check will be made payable to you and the lender. You will find that requirement in your deed of trust (the mortgage document).
So talk with your lender. It wants the house to be fixed up and returned to good condition, and may have some names of adjusters as well as construction companies it has worked with in the past.
Q: My boyfriend of 27 years died without a will. I had been living with him for over 26 years at our condo, which is only in his name. I didn't realize there is no common law marriage in my state. He has four adult children who now inherit everything. There is a warehouse building, construction equipment and the condo, which includes belongings that he mostly paid for but that we decided on together from travels around the world.
The estate is in probate and the kids want to come into my home and take things. In addition to mourning very deeply, I am dealing with this stress. I don't even know where I will live. They are coming from out of town to take things so that the estate is not overvalued for tax purposes, I'm told. I don't think I will ever see these belongings again.
One of his kids said that I should not mention a lawyer or get anyone angry. What rights do I have? I don't want to start a war, I just want everything to stay the way it is until I can think and get a grasp on living my life without him. They have keys; can they come and go as they wish?
A: Get a lawyer immediately. Clearly, at the very least, the children cannot just barge into the apartment without some advance notice to you. In most states, the personal representative of the estate (the executor) needs to be appointed to dispose of the real estate, although in some states, the property will automatically go to the heirs. You (or preferably your attorney) should contact the executor and discuss your situation. Perhaps an amicable compromise can be obtained.
But, and permit me to be a little blunt, your biggest mistake was that you did not have a partnership agreement. If you own property with anyone other than a spouse, please enter into a written partnership agreement spelling out who gets what if one wants out of the deal, who pays if one can't pay, etc.
You also may have some rights under the landlord-tenant laws of your state.

JW Marriott s Akira Back offers more than just sushiPrachi Bhuchar        Edition: Nov 23, 2014

Think Japanese food and most Indians will automatically think sushi. Yet over the years, the changing palate of Indians has allowed them to experiment with the cuisine in all its glory, and ramen bowls, udon, fine cuts of fish and most expensive beef are now finding favour at top restaurants in the country.
Akira Back, housed in the JW Marriott hotel close to the airport has a heavy lineage to live up to; chef Akira was the executive chef at Nobu in Aspen, and when he went independent, he set up restaurants in Las Vegas and Delhi. Next up is Jakarta.
The dishes are fine, elegant and there is nothing extra, either in texture, flavour or look. The menu relies heavily on imported proteins and local greens and is contemporary and packed with flavour.
Begin with the classic tuna pizza which comes on a fine platter. The bite-size pieces are fresh and bursting with originality. Brushed with truffle oil and slivers of truffle, the ponzu mayo is a clear winner and delicately balances all the other flavours on the plate.
Move on to the yellowtail jalapeno dipped generously in yuzu soy that smacks of citrus and silken soy. Truly delicious.
Salmon Carpaccio
If you are a shrimp fan we would recommend the rock shrimp which one again relies on the acidity of yuzu to cut through the rich clutter on your tongue . The Korean chilli adds the right amount of heat and texture to this dish.
If sushi is your calling, dive straight into Viva Las Vegas, which stuns the mouth and head all at once with the mix of snow crab, asparagus and popping candy. Feel the fizz on your tongue as the sweetness from the candy merges with the Asian flavours of the roll.
The dragon and lobster roll also come highly recommended.
For mains, the organic chicken which is cooked in a sous vide bag to retain its moistness, comes highly recommended. Served with kimchee beans and a potato puree, it is truly art on a plate.
You could also try the lamb chops with roasted baby potatoes or the imported beef on the menu.
End your meal with a ginger crÃ¨me brulee or the chocolate lava cake with peanut butter powder and vanilla ice cream. A cup of hot green tea adds the final touch to a classic meal.
The service, as expected, is unobtrusive yet attentive and the servers know the menu well. Chef Curt, who has been at the restaurant since its inception, does a fine job of creating authentic flavours in contemporary dishes.
Vegetarians need not fret as there are countless green options on the menu.
BT More recommends: Tuna pizza, Viva Las Vegas sushi roll
Meal for two: Rs 5000 plus taxes (without alcohol)

(Adds details, background, statement from New York Fed)
By Tanya Agrawal
Nov 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it  fired two employees over the leaking of confidential information  from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, raising again  questions about the bank's alleged cozy relationship with its  regulator.
The bank said a junior employee was sacked for passing on to  a colleague information from the New York Fed, his former  employer, while a supervisor was fired for knowing about the  matter but not escalating it.
The disclosure of the firings comes a day before a U.S.  Senate subcommittee is scheduled to start hearings on whether  the Fed's relationship with the banks it regulates is too close.
The hearing follows the release of secretly recorded  conversations between the New York Fed and Goldman officials  that suggested Fed officials were reluctant to push Goldman for  answers on a transaction with Spain's Banco Santander.
Goldman said on Thursday it had immediately reported the  incident that led to the firings to the New York Fed.
The junior banker had been employed with the bank for less  than four months, Goldman said.
The confidential information provided Goldman a window into  the New York Fed's private insights, including details about at  least one of the bank's clients, the New York Times reported,  citing lawyers familiar with the matter.(http://nyti.ms/1yVpoq6)
It is unclear whether Goldman's bankers used the  information, the Times added.
The "revolving door" relationship between Goldman and other  government agencies such as the New York Fed has been a source  of criticism in the past, with frequent movement of employees  between the bank and its regulators.
Current New York Fed President William Dudley, for example,  was Goldman's chief economist until 2005.
In an internal memo obtained by Reuters, Goldman said the  proper handling of confidential information was among its  highest priorities and that it had a specific policy prohibiting  an employee's use of information obtained from former employers.
Goldman added that it was reviewing its policies regarding  hiring staff from government institutions to ensure they were  effective and robust.
The New York Fed said in a statement it had detailed rules  and controls for protecting confidential information.
"Of course, we also know that we are not perfect, that  information today is more difficult to safeguard, and we are  resolute to learn from our experiences."     (Additional reporting by Rama Venkat Raman and Avik Das; Editing by Rodney Joyce and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)

Lets hear it from ArshTweet
Lego to the lab Arsh Shah Dilbagi’s invention, Talk, won the Voter’s Choice award at this year’s Google Science Fair in Palo Alto, California kamal narang
This Panipat teen’s invention allows people with speech impairments to communicate using their breath. The handy, affordable device can prove life-changing for 1.4 million Indians
Standard XII for most students is a time of great stress — extra tuitions, unending revisions ahead of final examinations and deciding on the courses to apply for in college. Arsh Shah Dilbagi, however, is spared of this set of worries as he has another one to grapple with. What will he speak about at his upcoming Tedx talk, how can he build on the Voter’s Choice accolade he won at the Google Science Fair, how to commercialise his innovations and, of course, somewhere at the back of his mind, how to get good grades in his exams?
The only Asian in the final round of the Google Science Fair this year, his innovation, Talk, is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device that could change the lives of many who have speech impairments including those with neurodegenerative disease and congenital impairment such as cerebral palsy, autism and Parkinson’s disease. The user’s breath patterns are processed through Morse code, and the device — no heavier than a regular smart phone — takes only 0.8 seconds to dictate the letter ‘A’, 0.4 seconds for ‘E’ and so on. Most importantly, it will be affordable ($200 roughly) and life-changing for more than 1.4 million Indians afflicted by strokes each year.
A Lego story
“I didn’t want him to sit in front of the TV all day, so I got him a Lego kit instead of a PlayStation,” says Arsh’s father, Amit Dilbagi, a 46-year-old executive engineer at the thermal power plant in Panipat.
He and his wife, Ritu, have supported their son’s endeavours since he was an adolescent, and Arsh always travels in his father’s company.
When we met, they had just driven over from Panipat to a south Delhi school, where Arsh was speaking at a tech conference.
The Lego Mindstorms kit from his father was Arsh’s first step into the world of robotics.
“It was probably the first Lego kit that was shipped to Panipat,” says Arsh. “I always wanted a dog, so one of the first things I built was a robot-dog.” That was in 2010 as a 12-year-old, the same year he won the national-level Indian Robot Olympiads. He won a regional competition the next year. He has since built a 50-centimetre-tall humanoid which, according to him, can do pushups, stand on its head and climb stairs, as also a hexapod (spiderlike robot) and an unmanned ground vehicle that fetched him honours in 2012 from the then President, Pratibha Patil.
Apart from a fully functional lab at his Panipat home that is equipped with soldering stations, glue guns and high-end computers, Arsh owns eight robotics kits at last count. “I make frequent trips to Nehru Place and Lajpat Rai market in Delhi to pick up spares. There are also a few websites from which I order what I need,” he says, adding, “I have been lucky to have parents who support me and provide all the resources. I have a nice, big room with everything I need.”
The Google experience
“There was a chauffer-driven Cadillac waiting for us outside the airport,” he gushes about his experience at Palo Alto, California, during the Google Science Fair’s final round last month. “The setting was quite unconventional.
We had a full crash-pad with everything — Xboxes, table-tennis setups, mini-golf, anything that suits your fancy. We were treated like total celebrities.”
This was the fourth edition of the annual competition organised by Google, Lego, Virgin Galactic, National Geographic and the Scientific American magazine. There were many Indian-American children in the final round, but Arsh was the sole entrant from Asia.
“I was really happy that I got the voters’ choice award. I was eyeing the grand prize, but this award was selected by the audience and I’m glad people believe that my device can change the world,” he says.
Since the award, Arsh and his family have been receiving many calls from prospective buyers, but they first have to decide how to manufacture Talk commercially. “Even though it only started as his science project, it has become something more now. Literally, it gives voice to the voiceless,” says Dilbagi.
Arsh is looking for some financial aid. “I love robotics, but it is an expensive subject and there are hardly any scholarships at the undergraduate level. I’m looking for funding to study further and enrol in a great institution," he says. In the meantime, there’s still work in progress. “I’m making modifications to Talk.
Next is a system where you plug in to a monitor using an HDMI portal and you can access the Internet using your breath alone. A breathcontrolled operating system of sorts.”

The war and truce between TrueCar and auto dealersThe war and truce between TrueCar and auto dealers

TrueCar founder Scott Painter knew how he'd change the way cars are sold -- until car dealers rebelled.
A few years ago, Scott Painter had it made. He was wealthy, handsome, and smart, a  TED  and Davos guy who hung out with Elon Musk and Richard Branson. “Everything in my life had gone unbelievably well,” he says. “Just off-the-chart success.” Over two decades, he had started dozens of companies and raised over a billion dollars in venture funding before finally hitting upon his Really Big Idea in 2005: A company eventually called TrueCar would bring price transparency to the sneaky world of auto salesmanship, and give consumers leverage by telling them exactly how much other people were paying for cars.
Almost all of these events were like AA meetings: 'My name is Scott Painter, and I have violated all of you, and I want to change.' - Scott Painter
For car shoppers, it was nirvana: no more haggling, no more waiting for that gold-chained salesman to talk to his manager to “see what I kin do.” Instead, you just went to TrueCar.com, typed in your Zip code and the make, model, and extras you wanted (don't forget the fuzzy dice!), and printed out a voucher, redeemable at your local  TrueCar  dealer, with a guaranteed low price. It was free and easy. And dealers paid TrueCar only if the lead turned into a sale — $299 for new cars, $399 for used.
8
Dealers signed up by the thousands, hoping to make up for lost ground after getting whacked by the Great Recession. Customers loved it, flocking to TrueCar's site and those of Capital One, USAA, and other partners that used its technology for their car-buying programs. Investors were thrilled too, ponying up more than $185 million in venture capital. With Painter as chief executive, TrueCar reached nearly $76 million in sales by 2011,  went public  this past May, and, in its first quarterly earnings report, beat analyst expectations for revenue ($50.5 million) and web traffic (4.2 million unique visitors per month). In September, its certified dealer count hit 9,000.
But in early 2012, TrueCar nearly became just another overhyped internet flop. The problems started just as it was gaining critical mass, airing national TV spots showing real customers saving $3,000, $8,000, even $14,000 on their cars. What those ads failed to mention is that most dealers, despite their greedy reputation, make very little money selling new cars. The average profit margin of a new-car sale was only 3.8 percent last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association; most dealers survive on ancillary services such as maintenance, financing, and warranties. “If I pay TrueCar $299 for a lead, I just gave away much of the gross profit on that car,” says Donald Hall, head of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, who tangled fiercely with Painter.

Near-hysteria broke out among dealers, who feared that TrueCar was encouraging a destructive race to the bottom that would disrupt them right out of existence. In a speech in 2011, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, the nation's largest auto retailer, called the situation “a death spiral” for dealers.
The blogosphere lit up. Dealers began telling Painter exactly where he could put those vouchers. Big dealer chains cut ties with TrueCar. State associations told members they could get in trouble with regulators because Painter's company was possibly violating state franchise laws designed to protect dealers. Honda threatened to cut off advertising funds to TrueCar dealers who sold vehicles too cheaply, arguing that it would harm the brand's image. Pictures of Painter as the devil circulated on the internet. “Basically, they suck!” screamed an auto sales trainer named Jerry Thibeau in a typical YouTube video.
Between December 2011 and February 2012, a third of TrueCar's 5,600 certified dealers canceled. Without dealers, it had no business. At TrueCar's offices, in Santa Monica, California, they had a nickname for the crisis: the Swirl. By that, they meant maelstrom, though it also conjured images of TrueCar spinning down the toilet. Before the Swirl, TrueCar had $40 million in cash and was growing rapidly by every measure, from dealerships and cars sold to revenue and web traffic. But all the dealer defections caused TrueCar to lose $75 million in 2012, and its TV ads disappeared. “I thought, ‘Holy shit — in 45 to 60 days, I'm out of business,’” Painter says.
Painter's  personal life  also began to crumble. He was fighting a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife over his two oldest children, and his second marriage was falling apart, he says, because he was so focused on trying to stop the Swirl that he neglected his wife, who was trying to deal with two young children and an unavailable husband. “I was a horrible husband and a horrible father,” he says. Panic attacks left him unable to breathe. So he went to the doctor — and was told he had a serious congenital heart defect and had to lose 50 pounds and stop drinking immediately.
The failure of TrueCar would also mean personal financial ruin, because Painter had invested so much of his own wealth in the company. As his performance bonuses dried up, he fell into debt and had to beg his board of directors for a pay raise to support a lifestyle that included a house in Bel Air, a nine-car garage, and a $220,000 silver Aston Martin Rapide.
In early 2012, a desperate Painter did what any upscale 43-year-old Californian whose life was imploding would do: He turned to his therapist. “What's going on?” he wanted to know. “Why is all this happening to me?”
His therapist thought for a moment and said, “Have you ever thought that all of this is your fault?”
Painter fell silent. That had never occurred to him. To the words he uses to describe himself — workaholic, idealist, perfectionist — nobody who knows Painter well would argue with adding charming, intelligent, creative, hyperarticulate, and deeply committed to his techno-libertarian beliefs. But, as shocked as Painter was, the therapist had a point. Today, Painter himself says, “I'm an arrogant jerk.” And sometimes, he adds, “a complete asshole!”
Arrogant jerkdom takes years to develop, as any shrink will tell you, and for Painter it began in middle-class Sacramento, where he grew up with a stepfather who was “a real hard-ass.” Painter was a restless, precocious lad. Inspired by his grandfather Ed Swofford, then CEO of Aloha Airlines, he started his first company, an automobile-detailing service, at age 14. Later, he joined the Army, studied at West Point (political science and engineering), and went to the University of California at Berkeley (economics) on a rugby scholarship. He graduated from neither school. A Berkeley class project led to InfoAccess, his first company to offer car-buying information online to consumers.
Since then, Painter has founded a staggering 36 stock-issuing, incorporated companies. “I love manifesting things out of thin air,” he says by way of explanation, adding that he probably has attention-deficit disorder. He also loves cars, which you might guess from the nature of many of his startups. Prior to TrueCar, he was probably best known for CarsDirect, which he launched in 1998, raising $350 million in venture capital. Painter resigned as CEO the following year under pressure from investors after he'd laid off 90 people. As its name implied, CarsDirect aimed to sell cars directly to consumers from the manufacturer, leaving out the middleman. So it's easy to see why many auto dealers still despise Painter — despite the fact that they share certain traits, including a love of choice expletives. “When people say, ‘Scott's evil!’ they go back to CarsDirect,” says Painter. “How can you be a dealer and hear that and not go, ‘I hate that fucking guy!’?”
8
What Painter learned from CarsDirect, and a failed car venture he tried called Build-to-Order, is that the auto franchise system is so protected by state laws, and so politically powerful, that it's nearly impossible to defeat it in any battle. (As his buddy Elon Musk has discovered while trying to set up Tesla dealerships.) So with his next company, Painter decided to partner with dealers. All he had to do was convince them that the information revolution was rendering their old-school selling methods obsolete. If consumers can buy a computer or dishwasher for nearly the same price at a variety of retailers nationwide, he argued, why should the price of a car vary up to 45 percent from one dealer to the next? “We believe that buying a car should be fun and should be fair,” Painter declared. “Cars are one of the last commodities that don't behave like commodities because of the franchise system.”
4
Talk of the digital revolution was not exactly embraced by car dealers — price transparency being digerati-speak for “lower prices” — but many felt they had little choice. In 2005, Painter and his associates founded Zag.com to run the car-buying programs for big corporations and member-based organizations such as AARP. (Today these businesses account for more than half of TrueCar's revenue; 38 percent comes from ordinary consumers visiting TrueCar.com and related mobile apps; the rest comes from selling data and consulting to auto and finance companies.) Three years later, Zag launched TrueCar, which culled pricing information from a multitude of sources — finance and insurance companies, vehicle registration, dealers, and other data aggregators — to give consumers something they had never seen before: an up-to-date, real-life snapshot of what people actually pay for cars. In 2010, the two companies merged under the name TrueCar.
Painter's pitch resonated with investors partly because they could all relate to how miserable it can be to visit a car dealership. According to a recent survey by Edmunds.com, one in five people said they'd willingly give up sex for a month rather than haggle for a new car. One in three said they'd rather do taxes, go to the DMV, or sit in an airplane's middle seat. It became Painter's mission in life to fix that. After his first two kids were born, he decided that TrueCar was his perfect chance to settle down and finally build a sustainable company.
Some dealers loved the leads TrueCar provided, especially when car sales dropped off a cliff during the financial crisis of 2008. “TrueCar is better than other lead generators, because customers get a price they can believe and I don't have to pay unless I make a sale,” says John Harmond, general sales manager of Santa Monica Ford/Lincoln-Subaru, who has used TrueCar since its earliest days. Though Harmond has to pay $299 for every sale, TrueCar argues that dealers like him can actually save more than $1,000 per transaction, through reduced haggling time and inventory costs as cars sell faster, and by cutting back on marketing and sales staff. About 5 to 6 percent of TrueCar leads turn into sales, Harmond says, far better than the 2 to 3 percent from other lead generators, such as Edmunds.com.
Still, Painter admits that his company was so consumer-centric, and had whipped itself into such a frenzy with what he calls its “Stick it to the man!” attitude, that dealers felt under attack. One TrueCar employee got so carried away that he registered the domain name fuckedbythedealer.com. Painter says he would never authorize such a thing and was shocked when he found out, and the employee was promptly fired. But by that time, the damage had been done.
And, as for that “complete asshole” thing — well, one moment that stands out came when Painter sat down for a family Thanksgiving dinner in 2011. At the table was his brother-in-law, Phil Kerr, a Mazda dealer in Arizona. With TrueCar at its pre-Swirl peak and its flashy ads saturating TVs nationwide, Painter began gleefully berating Kerr about how dealers like him would get steamrolled by the digital revolution unless they embraced internet-driven price transparency — all while the rest of the family was attempting to enjoy their mashed potatoes and drumsticks. “I was such an arrogant ass to put him in his place,” Painter says.
What Painter didn't know was that the tide had already begun to turn, and within mere weeks, the Swirl would begin to overwhelm TrueCar. Those TV ads played a big role — dealers saw that $3,000 to $14,000 in consumer savings coming directly out of their pockets — and industry bloggers began hammering TrueCar. “Your company is evil,” wrote Jim Ziegler, an industry consultant and a leader of the dealer revolt. “Your agenda is to destroy us.”
TrueCar was also accused of violating state laws by acting as a broker and extracting too much valuable customer data from dealers' computer systems. Painter denies that TrueCar was ever a broker, but the company voluntarily suspended service in Louisiana and Colorado while it overhauled its business model. Now it charges dealers a monthly subscription fee in some states, rather than on a per-deal basis, and operates legally in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Troy Foster, TrueCar's chief legal and compliance officer, insists that TrueCar is very clear with its dealers about what data it collects and how it is used and that it has never resold customer information to third parties. (Meanwhile, dealers and trade associations confirm they've received queries from the Federal Trade Commission about whether they violated competition laws by conspiring to boycott TrueCar; the FTC declines to comment.)
Struggling to reverse the slide, Painter hired Mike Timmons, a former AutoNation executive, to reach out to dealers. But this was as much a culture clash as a business dispute, with the colorful, rough-edged world of car dealers deeply distrustful of Painter's elite team of technocrats from Santa Monica. One day at a dealer convention, Timmons approached Ziegler, who often wears a baseball hat emblazoned with his nickname, Alpha Dawg, and posts goofy videos of his attempts at rapping on YouTube. Timmons introduced himself and extended his hand in greeting — and Ziegler retorted, “I know who you are,” slapped his hand away, and kept walking.

Back in therapy, Painter realized that the solution to this mess was staring back at him in the mirror each morning. “Why don't you start with the thing you can affect the most?” his therapist said. “Why don't you go back and tell your wife, whom you love, that you're sorry that you didn't have the empathy to understand that she needed you to be there for her? And that it's all your fault? Why don't you own that and see how that goes?”
Painter did, going into couples therapy with his wife and saying almost those exact words. “Unbelievable!” he recalls. “The clouds parted.” His relationship with his wife improved immediately; now he had his first point of refuge in the storm. Next, he decided to try the same approach at work and found miraculous results there, too. “It became very easy to come into work and say, ‘You know, it's actually my fault!’” he reports in a surprisingly cheery tone. “It became an almost intoxicating, gratifying thing to just own it.”
4
So he kept at it. Realizing he had not truly paid attention to the concerns of dealers — the lifeblood of his business — he went on a nationwide listening tour, meeting with dealer groups, car manufacturers, and industry media and influencers. “I realized very quickly it didn't matter what I said. As long as I just took the blame for everything, we could get to a better place,” he says. “Almost all of these events were like AA meetings: ‘My name is Scott Painter, and I have violated all of you, and I want to change.’”
Next, Painter created a council of auto dealers that meets six times a year to tell TrueCar what it's screwing up and what it's doing right. He hired trusted insiders such as Pat Watson of the South Carolina Automobile Dealers Association and John Krafcik, former CEO of Hyundai Motor America. He spent 10 hours traveling to and from Norcross, Georgia, just to meet with Ziegler for a few hours to explain TrueCar's new business model and show him the latest TV ads. They met at an outpost of the Cajun chain Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. “I was smirking at the very fact that I had this sprout-eating, preppy-ass Californian sitting in a Cajun restaurant eating spicy deep-fried alligator tails,” Ziegler boasted on his blog later. “I even took a photo of Scott Painter wearing my Alpha Dawg hat.”
Meanwhile, TrueCar.com scrapped its old slogan — “Know the Real Price” — and replaced it with “Never Overpay.” It has stopped showing estimates of how much dealers pay for cars. It no longer encourages dealers to beat the lowest price, instead rating dealer prices as good, average, or above average. The site also gives customers reasons to choose a dealer beyond price, including location and such added services as oil changes, car washes, and delivery. New TV ads talk glowingly about dealers as TrueCar's “trusted partners.”
Painter also reformed his company's culture. To drive home the point that TrueCar needed to do a better job balancing the needs of customers and dealers, he created a large metal see-saw etched with the word Consumer on one end and Dealer on the other. At company gatherings, groups of employees stood on both ends of the see-saw and tried to achieve a perfect balance.
While the new TrueCar has probably resulted in some consumers paying more for cars than they did using the old site, Painter believes he finally has a sustainable business model that benefits both buyers and sellers. He points to a recent TrueCar survey showing that most consumers believe dealers make a 20 percent profit on a new car — more than five times the average margin of 3.8 percent — and that if they discovered that dealers made nothing on a car sale, they would voluntarily tip them 8 percent. This shows that car buyers want the dealer to succeed, Painter says — they just don't want to get ripped off. That's where TrueCar comes in.
All together these changes produced a stunning turnaround. Since the depths of the Swirl in February 2012, TrueCar has more than doubled the number of participating dealers, to around 9,000, website traffic and the volume of cars sold have nearly tripled, and quarterly revenue has more than tripled.
Not all of TrueCar's indicators are positive. Its IPO last spring, during a period of market volatility, raised only $70 million — its shares traded below its initial forecasted price — and its first earnings report this August included a $15 million net loss thanks to increased operating expenses, mostly for sales and marketing to attract new customers.
And Painter still has many critics. David Ruggles, a former dealer who is now a prominent consultant and writer, says, “I'm not mollified in the least.” He argues that TrueCar encourages the consumer to behave like a poker player who demands to see everyone's cards before placing a bet. “Painter gets up and apologizes and says, ‘We were arrogant and we were wrong,’ because he lost millions in the dealer revolt. But his objective is still the same. The whole principle of demonizing dealers is opportunistic and I hate it. He's not out to change world for the better unless Scott Painter makes a buck doing it.”
TrueCar also recently annoyed dealers by announcing it will no longer offer financial credit to dealers who can prove a sale involved a third-party site other than TrueCar. Meanwhile, the mega retailer AutoNation plans to spend $50 million building its own web tools to generate leads, cutting out internet sites such as TrueCar and Cars.com. Some dealers are even turning the tables on Painter by showing customers TrueCar's prices to prove how competitive their own offers are, helping them close the deal without paying a fee to TrueCar.
As for whether Painter has truly changed, others share Ruggles's skepticism. “He's still arrogant and full of himself,&rdquol says Hall of the Virginia state dealer's association, who adds that he was using a “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” strategy when asking Painter to speak to his group's annual convention in 2012. “But I like Scott and admire him, because he's smart enough to recognize problems and change the way he operates. He walked into a lion's den when he came to speak to us. It took a lot of nerve to do that.”
Painter is, at least, a wiser man about the forces of technological disruption, insisting that internet entrepreneurs cannot have the same haughty attitude they did during the heady days of the '90s. That's when his CarsDirect was one of the many internet companies to emerge from Bill Gross's legendary Idealab, along with spectacular flameouts such as eToys. “Everybody was rolling with the zeitgeist of the time, saying the internet is going to transform everything,” Painter says. “But that's one of the blind spots of technology investing in general. Disruption for disruption's sake is not a good idea in terms of creating long-term sustainable value.”

ICICI s non-banking ops render 22% of total profitsStory
Satellites in the Sun

ICICI Prudential is the largest contributor to the ICICI Group's profits among the subsidiaries, Rs 1,567 crore in 2013-14. (Photo: Reuters)
Think ICICI and most times it is the country's biggest private bank alone that comes to mind. But the ICICI group is, in fact, a financial supermarket, offering the full range of financial services - life insurance, general insurance, private equity, mutual funds and securities. Set up between 1993 and 2000, these subsidiaries, however, were of little account even five years ago, contributing hardly anything to the group's bottom line. Instead, ICICI Bank often helped them stay afloat. Today, they provide 22 per cent of the total profit.
When Chanda Kochhar , 53, took over as CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank in May 2009, the global financial meltdown was at its worst. Every bank faced mounting non-performing assets and related problems. How Kochhar put ICICI Bank back on the growth path has been well documented, but the success of the once-struggling subsidiaries during her tenure is less known. Despite the persisting downturn, they have all put their worst behind them. "The non-banking subsidiaries have now moved from the investment phase to the growth phase," says Kochhar. "They are generating returns and giving back dividends to their parent."

Experts agree with her, maintaining that the culture of the group has changed. Under the redoubtable KV Kamath, Kochhar's predecessor, the culture - especially in the mid-2000s with the economy in high-growth mode - was entrepreneurial, geared towards aggressively generating more business. "Everybody was busy exploiting opportunities without focusing on profit or de-risking the business model," says a former ICICI official. But with the downturn, there was no option but to consolidate. Under Kochhar, the emphasis, both for the bank and the subsidiaries, has been on profitable growth, preservation of capital, use of technology for distribution, cross-selling and building domain expertise.
One vital step Kochhar took was to place handpicked individuals at the head of four of the five subsidiaries. (The exception was Nimesh Shah, 43, CEO and MD of ICICI Prudential AMC, who has held the position since July 2007.) Kochhar had no choice - there were a number of resignations after she succeeded Kamath, leaving at least a couple of the subsidiaries headless. Shikha Sharma, heading ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, and Renuka Ramnath, chief of ICICI Venture, both quit. About the same time, Subrata Mukherji retired from ICICI Securities, while Sandeep Bakhshi, who had built the general insurance business, returned to the bank. Kochar then made Bakhshi CEO and MD of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, while Bhargav Dasgupta, Vishakha Mulye and Anup Bagchi took over in the same position at ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI Venture and ICICI Securities, respectively. Barring Bakhshi and Bagchi, the others were hard core bankers with no experience at all in their new domains.
Wasn't Kochhar taking a big chance? "The culture and approach are common across the group," she says. "It's not very difficult for a person in one business to take charge of another." Bagchi of ICICI Securities adds that the bonding that already existed between the new heads - all of them having been colleagues under Kamath - made all the difference. "Relationships are not built on organisational structures alone," he adds. "Trust also develops when you have grown together."
Setting an example (Data: Annual reports)
This trust - higher than in earlier teams, according to the subsidiary CEOs - has led to better synergies. "The new leadership is probably one reason for the group synergy," says Kochhar. Having new team heads also enabled Kochhar to get a tighter grip on the subsidiaries, which may not have been possible had the earlier incumbents - some of whom were her seniors in the profession - remained. The current subsidiary chiefs, for instance, are all required to meet Kochhar for monthly reviews of how their businesses are doing. Finally, a new team made altering the business model of a subsidiary wherever required - to adapt to the changing environment - easier.
ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE
ICICI Lombard General Insurance has faced major challenges, incurring losses in 2010/11 and 2011/12. "This was mainly due to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) increasing the provisioning requirement," says Dasgupta, 48, MD and CEO since May 2009. Another crucial change was the de-tariffing of most general insurance products IRDA introduced - companies are free to decide their own premiums instead of the Tariff Advisory Committee doing so. "In the changed environment, we focused on building capabilities in risk management, especially underwriting skills," Dasgupta adds.
Good times, bad times
ICICI Lombard has also changed its business mix, the share of retail business increasing from 49 to 60 per cent, with growing emphasis on health and motor insurance. "We have consciously moved to a greater focus on personal lines than on corporate," says Dasgupta. Besides, specialty segments are being nurtured such as liability insurance, aviation insurance, credit insurance and weather insurance. "These businesses, which contributed eight per cent earlier, now bring in 14 per cent of the total premium," Dasgupta adds.
New ways of selling are very much on Dasgupta's mind. Direct online insurance sale, which does away with the traditional agent, has been a great success, with 46 per cent of ICICI Lombard's premium coming through this channel in 2013/14, compared to 32 per cent in 2008/09.
ICICI PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE
Just as IRDA's orders on increased provisioning affected the general insurance segment, its directives curbing unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) hit life insurance companies hard. ULIPs are essentially investment products which offer life insurance as well, and IRDA's orders, coupled with the sluggishness of the stock markets during the downturn, saw their popularity drop sharply. The ULIP share in the life insurance products' basket has fallen from 96 per cent in 2008/09 to 66.5 per cent at present.
Best covered
Overall, life insurance has not grown at all in the last five years, but renewals of ICICI Prudential's existing policies - 70 per cent of its total premium in 2013/14 - have seen it generate steady profits. MD and CEO Bakhshi, 54, is clear that he does not need any more capital infusion from the bank. "We have generated surpluses over the years," he says. "Our solvency ratio is 350 per cent against 150 per cent mandated by IRDA. This will sustain future growth." (Solvency ratio is an index of the company's ability to meet its financial obligations.) ICICI Prudential has also seen great success in selling policies through ICICI Bank - 60 per cent of its fresh premium in 2013/14 came through that route. It is also the largest contributor to the ICICI Group's profits among the subsidiaries, Rs 1,567 crore in 2013/14.
ICICI PRUDENTIAL AMC
ICICI Prudential AMC has made impressive strides
Fund house ICICI Prudential AMC has changed in three important ways. For one, it was earlier more focused on selling products, and relatively inconsistent in the returns it gave investors. It is now much more investor-oriented, with the products department a part of the investment department. For another, it is now much more process-driven than before, an orientation, insiders claim, Kochhar was particularly keen on.
"Fund management is not about star fund managers but having strong processes in place," says MD and CEO Shah. There are defined processes on every aspect of fund management - cash calls, portfolio construction, risk mitigation, portfolio review and monitoring. For a third, better known earlier for its expertise in fixed income management, the fund has since improved its equity products suite too, with equity market share of over 12 per cent. "We have beaten the benchmark equity indices in most of our schemes," says Shah.
ICICI Prudential AMC has the second-highest AUM among mutual funds in India
The fund house runs two more verticals - portfolio management and international fund advisory services. "In the last five years, we have got funds from West Asia, Southeast Asia and Japan," says Shah.
ICICI VENTURE
Vishakha Mulye, MD & CEO, ICICI Venture
When Vishakha Mulye took charge in April 2009, ICICI Venture, the group's private equity subsidiary, had only two verticals - PE and real estate. Mulye has added two more verticals - infrastructure and special situation fund (distressed assets). "Our vision is to become a multi-asset platform," she says. The last five years have been particularly difficult for PE, but Mulye has raised $1.4 billion across the four verticals during this period and now oversees a total of $2.5 billion. The fund has also returned an estimated $900 million to investors in the last five years, using an innovative mix of exits - strategic sales, promoter buybacks, sales to other PE players and initial public offerings.
Turning the corner
Each vertical has a dedicated investment team. Still, profitability has been a struggle in depressed market conditions, with profits dropping from Rs 148 crore in 2008/09 to Rs 33 crore in 2013/14. Earlier this year, the company was even taken to court in Mauritius by a group of NRI investors who allegedly lost money on the real estate fund. ICICI Venture maintains PE as an asset class can never guarantee returns. But there is hope that with the equity market showing buoyancy this year, profits will rise. The asset portfolio may also see new verticals such as credit fund or PIPE (public investment in private equity) funds.
ICICI SECURITIES
"A vital part of our strategy in the last five years has been to focus on non-equity products"
ANUP BAGCHI
MD & CEO, ICICI Securities
There has been a complete shift in the business model of ICICI Securities. To reduce volatility, MD and CEO Anup Bagchi has expanded the focus from mostly brokerage and equity-linked business to cover distribution of financial products such as mutual funds, insurance, non-convertible debentures, fixed deposits and home loans as well. The organisation has also changed to accommodate the widened focus with senior lateral hires from both within the ICICI Group and outside. "This helped reduce the time to market," says Bagchi. "The same organisational structure cannot implement a different strategy." The fresh domain expertise it has inducted gives ICICI Securities access to more in depth knowledge and better ideas as well as new clients. The equity to non-equity share in the company's business is about 65:35. The investment banking business, which had been shifted to ICICI Bank in the heyday of mergers and acquisitions, has come back to the subsidiary.
LOOKING AHEAD
The subsidiaries are thus all sitting pretty. ICICI Lombard and ICICI Prudential are both leaders in their segments, while ICICI Prudential AMC is at No. 2, second only to HDFC MF in terms of assets under management. The synergy is apparent from ICICI Securities being the biggest non-banking distributor for ICICI Prudential AMC, while ICICI Securities is the largest distributor of home loans for ICICI Bank. But are the profits sustainable? Kochhar remains cautious. "The subsidiaries are in businesses which are very market dependent," she says. "Some volatility will happen because of the market."

Transgene GDR case: Sebi must call taxmen for deeper probe

Transgene GDR case: Sebi must call taxmen for deeper probe
It may not be a case of inadequate disclosure by the promoters and directors; rather it could well be about round tripping of funds and calls for a deeper probe by the tax authorities

The Sebi on Friday barred promoters and directors of  Transgene Biotek from dealing in securities of any kind till further notice, on charge of defrauding shareholders . The 3 promoters—K Koteshwar Rao, Nirmala Rao and K Srinivas—and three directors—PK Ghosh, SS Marthi and NM Pentyala—have been slapped with Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (FUTP) violations.
Sebi’s main charge against the six is that they hid material and price-sensitive information from shareholders, causing huge loss to them (shareholders) when the stock price fell subsequently.
But it may not be a case of inadequate disclosure by the promoters and directors; rather it could well be about round tripping of funds and calls for a deeper probe by the tax authorities.
In 2011, Transgene had raised USD 40.5 million abroad by issuing Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) in two tranches—first in February and then in September. By December, the company had transferred USD 38.4 million of those funds to three entities--Asia First Technologies(AFTL), Symetric Sciences and Sristek.
The company said the payments were under the terms of the agreement signed with the firms for technology transfer, personnel training and consultancy services.
But Transgene’s balance sheet made no mention of technology transfer or other services. From April 2012, the stock price started sliding as the investors who had subscribed to the GDR issue converted the GDRs into shares and started offloading them in the Indian market. By November 2012, the stock was down to Rs 5 from a high of Rs 60 a year back.
When asked by Sebi, Transgene Chairman Koteswara Rao admitted that the company had not received the technology or services, but said the fund transfers were not authorized by him. The regulator refused to buy this argument.
Over the last 4-5 years, many mid-cap companies are said to have been using the GDR route for making a quick buck or even laundering their black money stashed abroad. In 2011, Sebi had pulled up a few companies and foreign institutional investors for abusing the GDR route. The orders against some of the FIIs involved in those dubious deals were later revoked.
There are a couple of ways in which promoters rip off their shareholders through sham GDRs.
When the aim is solely to make a quick buck, the promoters try up with NRI market operators, usually based out Dubai. These operators have some dummy FII accounts which are shown to have subscribed to the GDR issue. At times, these operators can get some FIIs, who are willing to ‘lend’ their name for the GDR issue. The issue is priced at a premium to the share price in the Indian market so as to create excitement among local investors.
The ‘on-hire’ FIIs invest for a brief period. The issue proceeds go into the company, from where it is returned to those investors through a chain of transactions, along with an interest payment.
The GDRs held by the FII are then sold to entities controlled by the promoter/operator. The entities convert the GDRs into shares and start offloading them on unsuspecting investors in India. The profits from the sale are split between the operator and the promoter.
The promoters can also launder their undisclosed money abroad, through the GDR route. Say, the promoters want to convert USD 50 million of black money abroad into white. In this case, the FIIs investing in the GDR will be fronts for the promoters. The USD 50 million will come into the company’s books and become legitimate. A few months after the issue, the ‘investors’ will write to the company saying they want to convert the GDRs into shares. The shares are then offloaded in India; an additional source of profit for the promoters.
In the Transgene order, Sebi whole-time member Rajeev Agarwal has made a few observations, though it may need the help of other Indian regulators and investigative agencies to pursue the matter further.
Excerpts from the Sebi report:
“Considering the foregoing facts and circumstances of the matter, I, prima facie, find that the other entities involved in the transfer and receipt of funds are in complicity with Transgene and its promoters/directors in the design to defraud the investors.
There is a need for a detailed investigation in the entire GDR issues of Transgene till the end utilization of the funds, including the role, if any, of allottees of the GDRs, role, if any, of FIIs /Sub Accounts in cancellation of GDRs and subsequent selling thereof along with the role of AFTL, SyMetric, Sristek and Allshore Fiduciary Services.”
Sebi could start with details about the FIIs who had subscribed to the GDR issue and check for links with some of the other companies and promoters Sebi has hauled up in the past for a similar violation.

Marijuana Industry Sets Its Sights On The MainstreamMarijuana Industry Sets Its Sights On The Mainstream
Posted:
reddit
Marijuana is growing up. As Colorado and Washington’s recreational marijuana industries blossom and new markets in Oregon and Alaska begin to take shape, so-called ganjapreneurs are looking for ways to take cannabis mainstream. Before long, they hope, marijuana products will be as widely available as alcohol -- and just as socially acceptable.
“Ideally, I would like to see the 21-to-35 year-old taking a four-pack of these to a barbecue,” Joe Hodas, chief marketing director for the marijuana product manufacturer Dixie, said earlier this year of the company's new watermelon cream-flavored "elixir," Dixie One. The drink contains five milligrams of THC -- just enough to produce a subtle buzz.
“This is a full experience in a bottle, much like beer," Hodas said. "Sometimes they’ll want a beer, sometimes they’ll want two or three beers. This sort of affords you that calibration."
Since starting in 2010, Colorado-based Dixie has developed a wide array of marijuana products, from THC-infused chocolates to concentrated cannabis for e-cigarettes. Many of its offerings are aimed at experienced marijuana users with high tolerances -- the company's top seller is a line of elixirs containing 75 milligrams of THC. Lower-dose products are proving increasingly popular, however.
“It’s been selling really surprisingly well,” Hodas told The Huffington Post recently of Dixie One. “In some of our stores, it had been outselling our 75 mg elixir. We were going to be happy if it sold decently well, but it was outselling in some cases. That said to us, we were correct, there is a market for that consumer.”
Encouraged by the success of Dixie One, the company is focusing on casual cannabis consumers. This week, Dixie released another low-dose product, a mint that releases THC directly into the bloodstream as it dissolves in the mouth.
“I think the low-dose consumer is an expansion demographic for us,” Hodas said. “It’s my belief that the core marijuana user is a small circle, and in a much larger surrounding circle is the casual user and a much larger market.”
At the moment, the recreational cannabis industry is limited to Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon. Marijuana advocates and business owners say it's only a matter of time before more states follow, bringing cannabis products like Dixie One to store shelves and backyard barbecues across America. More than 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, and this month voters in Washington, D.C., approved a referendum to legalize recreational use in the nation's capital.
Already, Colorado and Washington state illustrate how cannabis is shedding its stoner image and entering mainstream culture. Marijuana products have been featured prominently in gourmet dinners and in cooking seminars in both states. The drug has become a fashionable substance to offer as a celebratory toast at weddings . Yoga enthusiasts can seek zen at marijuana-fueled classes.
Earlier this year, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra held a “Classically Cannabis” fundraiser , where well-heeled attendees sipped drinks, shook hands and smoked pot from joints, vaporizers and glass pipes, while a brass quintet played Debussy, Bach, Wagner and Puccini.
"Cannabis is being elevated into the pantheon of refined and urbane inebriants, no different than boutique rye or fine wine," said Matt Gray, the publisher of a new gourmet marijuana cookbook .
A number of worrying episodes have accompanied the legal high, however. In March, a 19-year-old college student leapt to his death from a hotel balcony in Denver after eating marijuana-infused cookies. In April, police said a Denver man shot his wife to death after he said he had eaten marijuana candy and prescription pills.
Hospital officials in Colorado have said that they have been treating a growing number of adults and children who have consumed marijuana products, whose potency can be hard to judge.
State laws in Colorado and Washington already require a “serving” of THC in an edible marijuana product to be limited to 10 milligrams -- about the amount in a medium-sized joint. (The rules in Alaska and Oregon have not yet been set.) Some products, such as candy bars, may contain multiple servings, however, and package labels do not always include serving size or dosage information.
To address these issues, Colorado and Washington officials, and representatives of the cannabis industry, are finalizing new regulations that will require clearer labeling and childproof packaging. And, much like the alcohol industry encourages consumers to "drink responsibly," the makers of marijuana products are taking steps to educate customers and encourage responsible consumption.
“I think the idea of being proactive with our messaging -- being safe and responsible with our messaging -- we’re trying to do that now early on, versus being told to do that after the fact,” Hodas said.
“We are concerned about the uneducated consumer who may have a bad experience with edibles, because that means they may not use our products in the future," Hodas added. "So educating that consumer and making sure they know how to use them is of great importance to Dixie and the rest of the industry."
To that end, Dixie, like most marijuana product companies, has detailed information its website about how to enjoy its products. Marijuana Policy Project launched an educational campaign, aptly named ”Consume Responsibly,” with advice about preventing and responding to over-consumption or accidental consumption, as well as other detailed information about cannabis products, their effects and the laws that govern their possession, sale and use.
Recognizing that Colorado's marijuana laws are luring tourists to the state, the inaugural billboard for the campaign in Denver encouraged moderation and patience. “Don’t let a candy bar ruin your vacation," the sign read. "With edibles, start low and go slow.”
"We are aiming to boost the industry's image by removing negative stereotypes and stigmas, while promoting education surrounding the many uses of cannabis,” said Olivia Mannix, co-founder of Cannabrand, an ad agency representing marijuana-related businesses. “We feel that the public image of cannabis ultimately influences policy makers and is crucial for widespread legalization.”
Still, getting the message -- and brands -- in front of the public has been a challenge for marijuana companies. State laws ban advertisements on television or billboards that directly market marijuana products. Google, Facebook and Twitter refuse to accept marijuana advertising on their websites.
While marijuana businesses may have dreams of mass market sales and global domination, for the moment, they seem to be taking the "go slow" approach.
“The eyes of the world are on us right now, and how we handle that spotlight will go a long way in shaping public opinion about legal marijuana,” Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, told HuffPost. “Our businesses and our people are committed to building an industry we can be proud of. That means no shortcuts and none of the leeway that plenty of other industries out there get."
Her appeal to the marijuana industry is simple: “The future of this industry depends on the present -- don’t screw it up.”
CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story suggested that the "Consume Responsibly" campaign was launched by the industry, but it was launched by advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project. The story has been adjusted to reflect that. We regret the error.

Traveling with food for the holidays can be a pain and it can be dangerous. Tips for securing your cargo.
Driving with food during the holidays? Secure your cargo and protect your passengers with bungee cords.
At some point we've all been tasked with the thankless Thanksgiving job of holding a hot casserole dish on our laps while the family drives to Grandmother's house.
Those dishes can become a dangerous projectile if not secured properly in the car.
Here are some tips on how to safely transport holiday favorites so you and your favorites can arrive in tact and on time.
Casseroles and slow cookers
Automakers face a looming reality: Families are ditching the second car. ( Sarah Parvini )
Piping-hot casserole dishes can be a pain and cause pain to the person in the car holding them in their lap. The heat from the dish itself can burn your spouse's lap — not to mention the damage that could occur if it spills and your hubby is left with 350-degree green-bean casserole drippings on his, well, you get the idea. Placing the casserole dish on the floor rather than on someone's lap isn't much better. Do you really want to be cleaning oyster stuffing out of your car's carpet and floormats for the next three months?
Instead, invest in a travel casserole dish that comes with a Pyrex casserole dish, a rubber lid, a microwaveable gel pouch to help keep the goodies hot on the road and an insulated carrying case.
You don't, however, want your travel casserole dish to be sitting loose on the car's floor. If you have to brake quickly to avoid another holiday road warrior, the casserole dish could become a danger to your passengers.
Try securing your travel casserole dish in your car's trunk, or safely away from the passenger compartment.
If you don't have a travel casserole dish and don't want to invest in one, you can secure a casserole dish and lid with two rubber bands. This can then be secured inside a tote basket or laundry basket lined with towels. The basket can be stashed snugly on the floor behind the driver's seat or better yet, secured in your car's cargo space using a few bungee cords and the tie-down anchor points in the cargo floor. If the dish happens to leak during transport, the towels will soak up any messes. The same approach can be used for slow cookers.
Pies
If I had my way, we'd skip right to the pumpkin pie at any family celebration. Insulated pie carriers by companies such as eBags enable safe transport for the pie.
For passenger safety, secure the pie in the trunk. Use the grippy-drawer-liner technique to keep your pie carrier from sliding around, or better yet, stash it in the laundry basket next to your casserole.
Leftovers
If you're going to take some goodies home, come prepared and arrive with your own plastic storage containers and zippered plastic bags. Pack a load of disposable plastic containers in areusable waterproof shopping tote. Then you can pack the containers full and have a convenient tote at the ready to carry them to the car.

Doggy Day Care Chain Makes Pet Sitters Sign Restrictive ContractDoggy Day Care Chain Makes Pet Sitters Sign Noncompetes To Protect 'Trade Secrets'
Posted:
reddit
WASHINGTON -- Last month, The Huffington Post revealed that Jimmy John’s sandwich shops subject their low-wage workers to stringent noncompete agreements , theoretically barring them from working at other sandwich shops after they leave their jobs at Jimmy John's.
So if the guy making your tuna sandwich has to sign a noncompete, then why not the guy looking after your golden retriever for the weekend?
Camp Bow Wow is a doggy day care franchise. The company has more than 100 North American locations where pets board overnight, and it also offers in-home pet-sitting services. Camp Bow Wow workers look after dogs. But before they can do that, they apparently have to sign strict noncompete contracts similar to the ones used by Jimmy John’s.
According to a Camp Bow Wow “employee confidentiality and non-compete agreement” obtained by HuffPost, by signing the contract employees agree not to work for a competing business within 25 miles of their Camp Bow Wow location's "franchise territory" for a period of two years following the contract's termination. (Each pet care location is surrounded by its own designated territory, meaning that the actual distance within which employees are barred from working may exceed 25 miles.) The definition of a “competitive business” is vague yet broad: “any business operating in competition with, or similar to, [Camp Bow Wow’s] business.”
In other words, if you leave Camp Bow Wow and want to continue caring for dogs, this contract, if successfully enforced, would leave you with two equally unattractive options: You could either move to another city, or wait two whole years before seeking your new dog-sitting gig.
What’s more, Camp Bow Wow asserts the rights to any invention its workers come up with during their employment. The contract says, “Employee acknowledges that all Inventions are the sole property of D.O.G.,” which is short for D.O.G. Development LLC, the corporate name under which Camp Bow Wow franchised its locations until recently. That means if a Camp Bow Wow dog sitter comes up with, say, a neat idea for a new dog harness, the company could lay claim to it.
To be clear: HuffPost knows of no instances in which Camp Bow Wow tried to legally enforce this contract. A spokeswoman for Camp Bow Wow said the company would not comment on the noncompete, saying it is “corporate policy for Camp Bow Wow to not discuss its procedures and guidelines in public.” The company’s founder, Heidi Ganahl, and her booker for speaking appearances did not return phone calls seeking requests for comment.
It’s worth noting that as a franchiser, Camp Bow Wow does not even technically employ the workers in question -- its franchisees do. Indeed, the International Franchise Association, a lobby group of which Camp Bow Wow is a member , likes to say that franchisees are independent business owners who exercise full control over their workforces -- an interpretation that helps insulate big franchisers from liabilities.
Yet in this noncompete agreement, Camp Bow Wow seems to be trying to dictate the employment terms between its franchisees and their workers. And according to the company’s franchise disclosure documents , the franchisees who run individual Camp Bow Wow locations are required by contract to make workers sign the noncompete. The franchise agreement states:
“You must maintain the confidentiality of our confidential information and trade secrets and adopt reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information, including without limitation the obligation to require that all of your Personnel execute our nondisclosure and non-competition form.”
Noncompetes have typically been reserved for high-ranking executives or employees with access to sensitive business information, though they’re becoming increasingly common in various fields of work, including low-wage ones. Business owners argue that they’re merely protecting their investments, while critics say the restrictions laid out can be unfair and unreasonable.
The revelation of Jimmy John’s noncompete agreement brought widespread mockery upon the Illinois-based sandwich chain, as well as demands for an investigation from dozens of members of Congress. As those lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Labor Department and the Federal Trade Commission, “there is no justifiable business interest” in imposing a noncompete on workers who earn little more than the minimum wage and “are not privy to any of the company’s proprietary information.”
It isn’t clear what necessitates such an agreement at Camp Bow Wow, either. Rank-and-file workers at the doggy day care company are known as camp “counselors.” According to the company website , counselors "are the ones who ‘tidy’ each cabin, fluff the fleeces on the Kuranda Cots for the overnite Campers and tuck each camper into their own spacious, comfy and clean Camp Bow Wow cabin.”
Several workers on review websites described the pay at Camp Bow Wow as low-wage. Glassdoor.com pegged the average hourly pay for a camp counselor at $8.89 per hour , which is barely above the minimum wage in many states.
According to a Wall Street Journal report from August, company founder Ganahl previously had a career in pharmaceutical sales, a field in which firms frequently use noncompetes to discourage workers from jumping ship with company information and clients. The Journal reported that Ganahl recently agreed to sell Camp Bow Wow to VCA, the pet health care company, for an undisclosed sum, though she will remain the company’s chief executive.

Consider This The Anti-Photoshopreddit
In contemporary culture, we're all too used to seeing human skin smoothed out, cleared up, airbrushed and Photoshopped, until what was once fuzzy flesh with all its singular bumps and marks is made to resemble a flawless spread of plastic.
If you've just about had it with the ways skin is often depicted, allow Dutch artist Juuke Schoorl to give you a taste of something completely different. Her photography series "Rek," which translates to stretch, extends the aesthetic possibilities of skin, quite literally.
"I was inspired by the materiality of the human skin and how it reacts to external stimuli," the artist explained to The Huffington Post. "The adaptability of this curious stretchable material amazed me and I realized it is much more malleable than we usually notice or realize."
Instead of minimizing the more peculiar aspects of human skin, Schoorl brings any oddities or idiosyncrasies to surreal new heights. Using low budget supplies like nylon fishing rope and cellotape, she makes a canvas out of the human body, warping its slippery surface into surprising shapes and textures. Schoorl explained her intent to capture "not only [skin's] inherent flexibility and adaptability but also accentuate it’s function as our own biological upholstery. And possibly allow speculation about new aesthetic applications."
Schoorl's DIY special effects capture the alien nature of the biological structure that encases our insides. "By showing it in a photographic or aesthetic context instead of a medical or scientific one I hope people get a new appreciation for this familiar organ." Take a look at Schoorl's anti-Photoshopped images below and let us know your thoughts.

Earth s Interior Is Way More Complicated Than You ThoughtAn Ocean Is Hidden Inside Earth, And We'll Take You There To See It (VIDEO)

Earth's interior is way more complicated than you probably thought -- turns out it has molten metal and hidden oceans, and parts of it are hotter than the surface of the sun.
Check out the video above and/or read the transcript below. And leave your thoughts in the comments. Talk nerdy to me!
CLICK HERE FOR FULL TRANSCRIPT
JACQUELINE HOWARD: Hey everyone. Jacqueline Howard here. Ever wonder what it’s like inside our planet? Come with me on a subterranean tour all the way from the rocky crust where we live through the layer known as the mantle to the wild half-solid/half-liquid core of the Earth. We’ll also be stopping by a newly discovered underground ocean. Let’s go!
First stop, Earth’s crust--the solid outer layer where we live. The crust is made up of several elements, from iron to silicon to magnesium to sulfur , and its thickness ranges. The continental crust--the stuff found under land--can be up to around 50 miles thick ; while the oceanic crust--the stuff under our oceans--is around four miles thick . But let’s see what lies below that.
Now we’re about 50 miles below the surface, at the uppermost region of the mantle . This layer is made up of rock that’s rich in oxygen, silicon, iron, magnesium, aluminum and it extends from here all the way down to around 1,800 miles below the surface .
The mantle is also where molten rock known as magma can form before it flows upward during volcanic eruptions --at which point the magma becomes lava. This was pretty much the picture scientists had of the mantle until earlier this year--when a vast hidden ocean of water was discovered some 400 miles beneath North America. It goes to show that the rocks down here have a pretty impressive capacity to store water. Now let’s travel a little deeper. You ready?
Here we are, 1,800 miles down, at the Earth’s outer core, which runs all the way down to around 3,000 miles . This is a layer of molten iron that surrounds Earth’s inner core. And it’s really, really hot down here. In fact, it’s between 7,200 and 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit . But if you think that’s scorching, wait until we reach the center of the Earth…
And, we made it, to around 3,000 miles down--the uppermost part of the Earth’s inner core. Like the outer core, it’s made of mostly iron but the pressure down here is so intense the stuff is solid --and it’s almost incomprehensibly hot. It’s about 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit down here --hotter than the surface of the sun ! Now the actual center of the earth is about 4,000 miles down --but I’m starting to sweat so let’s skip that and head back to the surface...
Phew, back on the surface! If my virtual tour of the Earth’s interior had been a real one, it would have been a first. We all know that no one has ventured beyond Earth’s crust. But how do we know what’s down there? Scientists use waves of energy, called seismic waves, emitted by earthquakes to measure what type of material is inside Earth and where that material lies. See, as seismic waves travel through our planet , the rate in which they’re traveling -- whether they’re moving fast or slow -- reveals what exactly they’re traveling through , whether that material’s solid, liquid, or something else. Now you know.

How Thanksgiving Is Dividing The Nation In TwoHow Thanksgiving Is Dividing The Nation In Two

A single mom in Pennsylvania may skip her family’s Thanksgiving dinner so she can start her holiday shopping early. A newly divorced dad plans on getting out at 6 a.m. on turkey day to buy gifts for his kids. A Best Buy worker in Iowa knows for sure that he’ll be missing his family’s celebration: He has to work.
Welcome to Thanksgiving in 2014, a day that many lower- and middle-income Americans will spend either at work or out bargain hunting.
Nearly 20 percent of people in households making $40,000 a year or less said someone in their family will be working on Thanksgiving, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in November. That’s compared to just 11 percent of households earning $80,000 or more.
Even if they could use the extra money -- retailers are typically paying time-and-a-half -- many say they’d rather have the holiday off. Employees at multiple retailers have written to The Huffington Post via email, Twitter and Facebook complaining about having to work on Thanksgiving.
Shoppers looking for deals on the holiday also divide along income lines. Nearly 20 percent of people in households making less than $80,000 said they plan to shop at some point on Thanksgiving, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. That’s compared to just 10 percent of households earning $80,000 or more.
While some stores like Walmart and Kmart have opened on Thanksgiving for years, recently more and more retailers have joined in. That means more low-wage workers are staffing stores and more stores are advertising “can’t miss” bargains. Increasingly, Thanksgiving is a holiday that only some can afford to celebrate.

The Best Buy worker in Iowa said he’s realistic about the realities of retail work, like near-minimum wage pay and reporting for duty on Black Friday. But he started to resent cutting his holiday short once his employer began opening at midnight as Thanksgiving ticked over to Black Friday in 2012. This Thanksgiving, Best Buy is opening at 5 p.m. on Thursday.
“I get it they want to make a lot of sales and they want to do well that day,” said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his job. “I didn’t start getting annoyed until they started opening on Thanksgiving day. Maybe for some stores it was voluntary to sign up, but at my store it wasn’t.”
Best Buy told HuffPost that the chain tries to staff its stores with volunteers whenever possible on Thanksgiving. Employees who do work the holiday will get paid one-and-a-half times their hourly rate, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman wrote in an email. Most retailers open on Thanksgiving have similar policies.
“Many employees want the premium pay and many like to be part of the excitement of the store opening,” Shelman said. “Millions of Americans have voted with their feet and shown that they want to shop on Thanksgiving evening,” he added.
But Ken Perkins, the founder of data firm Retail Metrics, said, “There is a significant element of the shopping population out there who feels compelled to shop on Thanksgiving for financial reasons.”
Linda Hutchinson, the 51-year-old single mother in Pennsylvania, may skip the three-and-a-half-hour drive to Thanksgiving at her sister’s house this year. She wants to make sure she has the energy to go out shopping after her turkey dinner.
Heading to the mall on the holiday “allows you to get things that you probably wouldn’t get otherwise,” she said.
When stores open or offer the best online deals on Thanksgiving day, it creates “enormous pressure” for shoppers trying to find affordable gifts for their families, said Nadja Gutowski, who started a petition last year asking retailers to stay closed on turkey day.
About two-thirds of holiday shoppers live in households with an income of $50,000 or less , according to a recent survey from consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. They’re particularly susceptible to Black Friday promotions because their shopping is largely restricted by affordability.
Paul Driscoll said he always uses Thanksgiving to get deals on gifts for his six kids, ages 6 to 31. In past years, Driscoll has only gone out bargain hunting after Thanksgiving dinner, but this year the newly divorced dad said he plans to head to Kmart at 6 a.m. to get a jump on the sales.
The 49-year-old, who works two jobs himself, said he’s sympathetic to the people who have to staff stores on the holiday. “It is unfortunate people have to work. I know the pay isn’t great,” Driscoll said.
An Illinois Kmart worker, who makes minimum wage, said she was “shocked” when she looked at her schedule and found out she was working on Thanksgiving. She was planning to have about 10 or so people over for dinner.
“I’m supposed to tell them now, ‘No, sorry, you’ve got to find your own thing to do,’” she said.
The 54-year-old worker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her job, said she was under the impression that seasonal employees and volunteers would be the only ones required to work on the holiday -- that’s how it’s been framed in the media by Kmart brass.
Yet this worker sent HuffPost a photograph of a sign hanging in her break room telling employees they can’t request time off between Nov. 23 and Jan. 2.
These signs telling workers not to request time off during the holidays were sent to HuffPost by a Kmart worker in Illinois, who said the signs were hanging in her break room and were later taken down.
Kmart stores “do their very best” to staff the holiday with seasonal workers and employees who volunteer, a Kmart spokeswoman wrote in an email to HuffPost. The retailer also pays employees who work the holiday time and a half.
“We make every effort to accommodate associate shift requests during this time,” the spokeswoman wrote, adding that the chain has been opening at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving for four years and has received positive feedback from shoppers.
But the Illinois worker said, “The only thing they asked people to volunteer for is if they wanted to do the overnight. As far as the daytime hours, there was nothing like that at all.”
This year, about 16 percent of employees said they will spend Thanksgiving at work, according to a survey from CareerBuilder.com . If lawmakers and businesses don’t take action, even more people could end up working on the holiday down the line, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
That’s because many of the fastest-growing jobs, like retail, are characterized by low pay and unpredictable schedules.
“The consumers are also employees in a low-wage economy,” Bronfenbrenner said. “They can’t afford to shop anywhere else.”
The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 19-20 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

Business class air travel makes a comebackStory
Flying in Class
Business class travelling is making a comeback with two new full-service airlines set to take off and existing carriers turn their focus to premium.
Manu Kaushik      Follow @manukaushik    Edition: Dec 7, 2014
India is not the only country where business class in air travel is making a comeback.
The aviation sector seems to have come a full circle. After about seven years of growing preference for low-cost carriers among air travellers, the business class is making a strong return as existing airlines as well as two upcoming full-service carriers focus on the premium segment.
Take Delhi-based Air One, for instance. In July, the aviation service provider received a licence to operate a full-service airline in India. Its Promoter and Director, Alok Sharma, an industry veteran and former president of Air Sahara, says the return of business class is nothing new to India. "Most countries go through this cycle. There's a market for both types of services," he says.
India is not the only country where business class in air travel is making a comeback. Developing countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have seen similar trends in the past. Still, the share of business class travel in India's total aviation pie is minuscule. According to the research and advisory firm Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) India, the total weekly domestic seats for August stood at 1.84 million. Of this, only 64,540 seats, or 3.5 per cent, were in business class and the remaining were economy seats. Analysts say the entry of new players will increase the number but the overall percentage may not rise much because low-cost carriers also have expansion plans.
"There's definitely demand for full-service airline segment. The two biggest full-service airlines, Jet Airways and Air India, have seat [load] factors in high 70s. Their market shares in September 2014 were 20 and 17 per cent, respectively," says Amber Dubey, Partner and India Head of Aerospace and Defense at global consultancy KPMG. Seat load factor is an industry term which refers to the percentage of seats occupied in a particular time period as compared to the total number of seats available.
"Travel today is more functional instead of being experiential and travellers are made to feel like just another seat number"
PHEE TEIK YEOH
CEO, Vistara
Besides Air One, another full-service airline that has taken the plunge is Vistara, a joint venture of Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines. Vistara had plans to start operations by October but is awaiting approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The airline has already taken delivery of two planes - Airbus A320-200 - and has plans to operate 20 aircraft, including some A320neos, by the end of five years of operations. Vistara management is silent on the plane configuration, but it is believed that around 35 per cent of its seats will be business class and premium economy.
"We carried out an in-depth consumer research to gain valuable insight. From the research, we learnt that air travellers are in an emotionally vulnerable state. Travel today is more functional instead of being experiential and travellers are made to feel like just another seat number," says Phee Teik Yeoh, CEO, Vistara. He adds that full-service is more than just a meal on board. "Once the guests experience the seamless travel, they will surely discover the value that Vistara offers," he says, without revealing details about the airline's differentiated offering.
Nevertheless, experts are closely watching Vistara because of the two heavyweight names which are backing the airline. Tata Sons holds a 51 per cent stake in Vistara's owner Tata SIA Airlines Ltd (TSAL) while the remaining is owned by Singapore Airlines.

While the new airlines are expected to take off soon, the existing players are also ramping up their business class capacities in anticipation of latent demand. Jet Airways, GoAir and SpiceJet are betting big on this segment.
In August, Naresh Goyal-led Jet Airways announced that it will discontinue its no-frills brand JetKonnect and transform completely into a full-service carrier from December. The single-brand entity Jet will offer premium seating , lounge passes, and higher baggage allowances than competitors. The airline had in March 2012 rebranded its two low-cost services JetLite and JetKonnect as JetKonnect.
SpiceJet, another low-cost carrier, has introduced SpiceMAX, a product under which the airline reconfigured most of its Boeing 737 fleet to give extra legroom in the first five rows - at least six inches more legroom compared to standard seats. A SpiceJet executive says: "The airline does not have business class, but it is certainly focusing more on corporate customers than before. Over the years, we have learnt that while customers are not always willing to pay the huge premium for business class, they would be happy to pay a little more for greater comfort and convenience in economy class."
What's causing the rise in demand for business class seats? Some believe that there's latent demand for business class travel that low-cost airlines have not been able to serve. Also, analysts say corporate travellers are more willing to fly business class today comparison to, say, three or four years ago. While there are no official estimates, more than 60 per cent of the overall aviation demand is estimated to be generated by the corporate sector where improved business sentiment is prompting companies to loosen their purse strings on travel-related expenses. Also, some initial spurt in business activities and increased optimism over the past few months as improvement in economic conditions is making the corporate mindset a little more relaxed towards peripheral expenses.
Vijay Deshpande, Vice President and Head (Human Resources) at JK Tyre & Industries, says austerity measures introduced by companies when the economy slowed down in the past couple of years are gradually being withdrawn. "Several companies, including ours, are lowering such restrictions. In travel-related matters, we leave it to the discretion of the head of various functions. Each function has an annual travel budget which is directly linked to business performance. If the top line goes up, the travel budget also rises," he says.
Challenges are aplenty to run a full-service carrier profitably in India. High fuel costs, steep airport charges and aircraft lease costs, price-sensitive customers and cut-throat competition could derail the second coming of the business class.
Corporate travel is picking up but a large number of companies allow their executives to fly business class mostly on international routes. For both the new airlines, that's another challenging area because existing rules do not allow them to fly outside of India until they complete five years of operations and have a fleet of 20 aircraft. Air One's Sharma says he is waiting for the government to do away with this regulation. "As soon as that happens, we will launch our airline," he says.
Also, flying scantily-occupied aircraft to remote locations as part of the India's route dispersal guidelines will hurt these airlines. Under these guidelines, all Indian carriers have to deploy a minimum of 10 per cent of their capacity to connect remote destinations that are not commercially viable.
Is it worth the cost?

Providing business class services have extra operational challenges related to the difference in cabin crew, food and beverage , service quality, lounge facilities, but the yields more than make up for it. The profit margins in the business class are much higher. On average, the cost-per-seat of the business class is roughly 1.5 times of the economy class. The airlines, however, price a business class ticket two to four times that of an economy class ticket.
"It's a matter of space utilisation. Airlines have the option to use its space either for economy or business class seats. Business class seats command four times more premium than economy class," says Air One's Sharma, who has plans to put one business class seat for every six economy seats. So, in a 180-seater Airbus A320, it will have about 26 business class seats.
The first few months are going to be exciting, says KPMG's Dubey. "Initially, there may be a lot of traffic due to the novelty factor but sustaining a full-service model in the Indian market would be an interesting challenge for the newcomers," he says.
To begin with, the routes have to be chosen carefully based on a demand analysis. Otherwise, the airlines might find themselves flying with a handful of passengers.
The Indian aviation sector is known to be ruthless to companies which do not pay attention to the cost analysis and efficiency improvement. Take the case of Kingfisher Airlines and Paramount Airways. Kingfisher started with much fanfare in 2004 but later ran into a series of troubles that ultimately resulted in its downfall. Paramount, which was largely a business class carrier, lost its airline licence in 2010 after it was unable to repay its debt.
In fact, the launch of Kingfisher Airlines came at a time when the business class was seeing its first biggest uptick in the country. During early 2000s, the economy was firing on all cylinders, corporate and leisure travel was growing at a stupendous rate. However, there were not many players to cater to the rising demand. The market was mostly divided among state-run Air India (and Indian Airlines), Jet Airways and Air Sahara, all of which were full-service carriers. It was only in 2003, when Air Deccan entered the market as a low-cost carrier.
Kingfisher Airlines, which kept its fares low, adopted characteristics of a traditional full-service carrier. In 2007, Jet completed the acquisition of Air Sahara. This was followed by Kingfisher acquiring a controlling stake in Air Deccan. Both acquisitions turned out to be failures. It was then that low-cost carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir took control of the aviation market.
After years of lull, business class travel is making a comeback. Some skeptics believe that existing market dynamics continue to favour low-cost carriers. Moreover, the difference between the economy and premium economy segments of full-service and low-cost carriers is not enough to justify the price difference. Unlike other countries where full-service carriers and low-cost airlines fly from different airports, business class travellers in India get access to just exclusive airport lounges.
"The business class capacity has significantly reduced in the last few years but due to changes in strategy of Jet [Airways] and Vistara, the capacity increase is now visible," says Kapil Kaul, CEO (South Asia), CAPA. "It will be very competitive going forward. I think business class traffic will remain limited."

Ferguson Grand Jury Evidence Reveals Mistakes  Holes In InvestigationFerguson Grand Jury Evidence Reveals Mistakes, Holes In Investigation

Soon after Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, law enforcement’s handling of the case was already being criticized as callous and sloppy. Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, looked on in horror as police officials failed to cover and later to remove Brown’s body from the street for hours.
Now that the grand jury evidence , including forensic records and testimony from Wilson and those investigating the fatal shooting, has been released, it's clear that other mistakes were made in attempting to figure out what happened on that August afternoon. The best physical evidence and testimony might not have been as ironclad in Wilson's favor as prosecutor Robert McCulloch characterized it on Monday night.
From the reams of grand jury testimony and police evidence, here are some key points that, if this case had gone to trial, could have been highlighted by prosecutors (not including the witnesses who appeared to contradict Wilson’s testimony):
1. Wilson washed away blood evidence.
In an interview with police investigators, Wilson admitted that after the shooting he returned to police headquarters and washed blood off his body -- physical evidence that could have helped to prove or disprove a critical piece of Wilson’s testimony regarding his struggle with Brown inside the police car. He told his interrogator that he had blood on both of his hands. “I think it was his blood,” Wilson said referring to Brown. He added that he was not cut anywhere.

2. The first officer to interview Wilson failed to take any notes.
The first supervising officer to the scene, who was also the first person to interview Wilson about the incident, didn’t take any notes about their conversation. In testimony more than a month after the incident, the officer offered his account from memory. He explained that he hadn’t been equipped with a recorder and hadn’t tried to take any written notes due to the chaotic nature of the situation. He also didn’t write up any notes soon after the fact. “I didn’t take notes because at that point in time I had multiple things going through my head besides what Darren was telling me,” the officer stated.
The same officer admitted during his grand jury testimony that Wilson had called him personally after they both had been interviewed by investigators. Wilson then went over his account again with the officer. The officer told the grand jury that there were no discrepancies between Wilson’s first account in person and his second account on the phone. But the call raises questions about whether Wilson may have influenced witness testimony.
3. Investigators failed to measure the likely distance between Brown and Wilson.
An unnamed medical legal examiner who responded to the shooting testified before the grand jury that he or she had not taken any distance measurements at the scene, because they appeared “self-explanatory.”
“Somebody shot somebody. There was no question as to any distances or anything of that nature at the time I was there,” the examiner told the jury.
The examiner also noted that he or she hadn’t been able to take pictures at the scene -- as is standard -- because the camera's batteries were dead. The examiner later testified that he or she accompanied investigators from the St. Louis County Police Department as they photographed Brown’s body.

4. Investigators did not test Wilson’s gun for fingerprints.
Talking with police investigators and before the grand jury, Wilson claimed that Brown had grabbed at Wilson's gun during the initial incident in the police car and that Brown's hand was on the firearm when it misfired at least once. Wilson also told police that he thought Brown would overpower him and shoot him with his own gun. “I was not in control of the gun,” Wilson said. Eventually he regained control of the weapon and fired from within the car.
Investigators could have helped to prove or disprove Wilson’s testimony by testing his service weapon for Brown’s fingerprints. But the gun was not tested for fingerprints. An investigator argued before the grand jury that the decision was made not to test the weapon because Wilson “never lost control of his gun.”
5. Wilson did not immediately turn his weapon over to investigators after killing Brown.
A detective with the St. Louis County Police Department, who conducted the first official interview of Wilson, testified to the grand jury that Wilson had packaged his own service weapon into an evidence envelope following his arrival at the police station in the wake of the shooting. The detective said the practice was not usual for his department, though he was unclear on the protocol of the Ferguson Police Department. He said he didn’t explore that aspect further at the time.
According to the detective’s testimony, standard practice for the St. Louis County Police Department would be for an officer involved in a shooting to keep his or her weapon holstered until it can be turned over to a supervisor and a crime scene unit detective. While that clearly didn’t take place in Wilson’s case, the detective also testified that he believed the firearm was handled in a way that preserved the chain of custody.

6. An initial interview with investigators was delayed while Wilson traveled to the hospital with his superiors.
The same St. Louis County Police Department detective also testified that while he had intended to conduct his initial interview with Wilson at the Ferguson police station, a lieutenant colonel with the Ferguson Police Department decided that Wilson first needed to go to the hospital for medical treatment. The detective said that while it is common practice to defer to any medical decision of this nature, Wilson appeared to be in good health and didn’t have any notable injuries that would have prevented an interview from being conducted at the station. Wilson would also testify that he didn’t believe he needed to go to the hospital.
But that day, Wilson got into a vehicle with the lieutenant colonel and another Ferguson police official and went to the hospital, while the St. Louis County detective traveled in another vehicle.
7. Wilson’s initial interview with the detective conflicts with information given in later testimony.
In his first interview with the detective, just hours after Brown’s death, Wilson didn’t claim to have any knowledge that Brown was suspected of stealing cigarillos from a nearby convenience store. The only mention of cigarillos he made to the detective was a recollection of the call about the theft that had come across his radio and that provided a description of the suspect.
Wilson also told the detective that Brown had passed something off to his friend before punching Wilson in the face. At the time, the detective said, Wilson didn’t know what the item was, referring to it only as “something.” In subsequent interviews and testimony, however, Wilson claimed that he knew Brown’s hands were full of cigarillos and that fact eventually led him to believe Brown may have been a suspect in the theft.

Darren Wilson: There s  No Way  Michael Brown Put His Hands UpDarren Wilson: There's 'No Way' Michael Brown Put His Hands Up

Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson opened up for the first time in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos , part of which aired Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours after it was announced a grand jury would not indict him for the death of Michael Brown.
Wilson said there was "no way" Brown put his hands up before Wilson fired his weapon, as some witnesses have described. Wilson said he thought, "he will kill me if he gets to me" when he saw Brown come toward him.
Wilson: “When he stopped, he turned and faced me, and as he does that his right hand immediately goes into his waistband, and his left hand is a fist at his side, and he starts charging me.”
Stephanopoulos: “What did you think when you saw that?”
Wilson: “I didn’t know, I mean, my initial thought was, is there a weapon in there?”
Stephanopoulos: “Even though he hadn’t pulled something out earlier when he was confronting you.”
Wilson: “Yeah, it was still just the unknown. And again, we’re taught to, let me see your hands.”
Stephanopoulos: “As you know, some of the eyewitnesses have said, when at that moment he turned around, he turned around and put his hands up.”
Wilson: “That would be incorrect. Incorrect.”
Stephanopoulos: “No way?”
Wilson: “No way.”
Stephanopoulos: “So, you say he starts to run, does a [unintelligible], starts to come toward you.”
Wilson: “Mmm hmm.”
Stephanopoulos: “And?”
Wilson: “At that time I gave myself another mental check: Can I shoot this guy? You know? Legally, can I? And the question that I answered myself was, I have to. If I don’t, he will kill me if he gets to me.”
George: “Even though he’s what, 35-40 feet away?”
Wilson: “Once he’s coming that direction, why, if he hasn’t stopped yet, when’s he gonna stop?”
Wilson said the incident with Brown was the first time he'd ever used his gun. When Stephanopoulos asked if there was any way the incident could've been handled differently, Wilson replied, "no."
Wilson said he has a "clean conscience" about the way he handled the incident with Brown.
“I don’t think it’s haunting. It’s always going to be something that happened," Wilson said.
"The reason I have a clean conscience is because I know I did my job right," Wilson added.
In an excerpt of the interview aired on "Nightline" early Wednesday morning, Wilson also responded to a statement released by Brown's family after the grand jury decision was announced that said they were "profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions."
“I think those are grieving parents who are mourning the loss of their son. I don’t think there’s anything I could say, but again I’m sorry that their son lost their life," Wilson said when Stephanopoulos asked him about the statement. "It wasn’t the intention of that day. It’s what occurred that day. And there’s nothing you could say that could make a parent feel better.”
Asked whether he felt remorse for killing Brown, Wilson said that "everyone feels remorse when life's lost."
"I never wanted to take anybody's life. That's not the good part of the job, that's the bad part of the job," Wilson said. He added that if Brown would have moved out of the street and onto the sidewalk, the incident never would have happened.
Wilson said that the most important thing people should know about him is that he was acting professionally during the interaction with Brown.
"I just did my job," he said. "I did what I was paid to do and that was my job. I followed my training, the training took over, the training led me to what happened. I maintained the integrity of this investigation, and that's it."
Wilson has been keeping a low profile since he shot and killed Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black teenager, in Missouri on Aug. 9. Wilson's lawyers released a statement Monday night in reaction to the grand jury's decision, thanking the officer's supporters and saying any further "commentary on this matter will be done in the appropriate venue and not through the media."
Stephanopoulos teased the interview earlier Tuesday, saying there was "no question off limits."
A few days before, it was reported that Wilson had been meeting with network anchors in anticipation of giving an interview after the announcement of the grand jury's decision. CNN's Brian Stelter reported that Wilson met with Stephanopoulos, NBC News’ Matt Lauer, CBS News’ Scott Pelley, and CNN's Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon.

These Dogs Were Rescued From A Massive Fighting Ring. They Are Loving Their Freedom.The '367 Dogs' Were Rescued From A Massive Fighting Ring. They Are Loving Their Freedom.
Posted:
Updated:

Bear the dog is a 367 survivor. Now he lives with Tara Doyle and her husband Nate. | Tara Doyle
They're called the 367 dogs, because that's how many of them were taken in on August 23, 2013 -- the first day of what would turn out to be the country's second largest multi-state dog fighting bust .
Then that number grew. By a lot.
"As the investigation progressed -- more arrests, more information gathered from the suspects in questioning -- more dogs were rescued. There were also a good number of puppies born once the dogs were in our care," the Humane Society's Stephanie Twining told The Huffington Post.
The final tally, according to Twining: 486 rescued dogs pulled from locations across Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.
Fourteen suspects were arrested . Donnie Anderson, the so-called "godfather" of the bunch -- prosecutors say he electrocuted or hanged dogs who lost fights -- pleaded guilty in July , and was sentenced to eight years in federal prison earlier this month .
And as Anderson serves his time in jail, his victims are finally able to thrive.
Some of the 367 dogs are now family pets. Some are in training to be therapy dogs. Some are still waiting for that special someone to treat them kindly for the rest of their lives. And even those who can't be adopted have been given a special opportunity to blossom.
It's not just the dogs whose lives are getting better, either. It's that way for the people who love them, too.
"These dogs have changed us all in some way, I'd like to think for the better," said Rose Tremblay, who keeps a Facebook page where members of the "367 rescue family" share their photos and updates and keep tabs on the dogs who haven't yet been adopted.
"They have made us stronger, and they have solidified the fight we have inside to never let what they've gone through or who they have since become to be forgotten," Tremblay added. "We celebrate the survivors, remember the victims and honor their bravery and resilience every day. We owe them that much, they've proven it over and over."
Dozens of the dogs' families and caretakers talked to HuffPost about how they came to be part of the 367 family, and what their lives are like now. Each one told a story of love, resilience and well-earned freedom:
Ruby
MaryEllen Malysia
Ruby was very pregnant at the time of her rescue. When she went into labor, giving birth wasn't easy.
"Ruby just put her head on my lap and really was a trooper. She stayed so calm and just wanted someone to stay with her," said veterinary technician MaryEllen Malysia, a responder at the ASPCA’s emergency shelter where Ruby and many of the other 367 dogs were taken after their rescue.
Malysiak fell so in love with Ruby she adopted her in April when the pup came ready for a permanent home. Now Ruby goes to work with Malysiak every day, and is in training to become a therapy dog.
"She has been an amazing dog," according to Malysiak, whose only worry now is how Ruby will handle her first Illinois winter.
Bear
Tara Doyle
Tara Doyle's husband Nate adopted Bear the dog one day while she was at work, bringing the big doggie home to live with the couple and their two cats.
"They had an instant connection. I'm not really sure what caused us to make the decision to adopt at that particular time, but having Bear in the family has been wonderful for my husband and wonderful for our marriage," she said.
Nate, a former pro wrestler, suffers from bad anxiety and "couldn't really deal with going out into large crowds of people without freaking out," according to Doyle. That's all changed since Bear came into their lives.
There's been some other changes, too. "As far as the cats go, Bear is their BFF. They just don't know it yet," Doyle said. "He loves them so much and tries to snuggle them all the time."
Bliss
Camp Justice
Bliss will live out her life at a place called Camp Justice in Arizona. It's a brand new sanctuary for dog fighting victims who are friendly with people, but aren't good with other dogs and have been deemed unadoptable.
"Prior to coming to Camp Justice, these dogs have experienced violence and unimaginable cruelty at the hands of the criminals who use them for the inhumane thrill of watching dogs fight to the death or serious injury and for the financial gain of the gambling on the fight," said Jeannine Alexander, a sanctuary founder.
Bliss is Camp Justice's first resident, and is doing great.
"She grins and dances on her back two feet when she's happy. She likes to snuggle under the covers and she cries and whines for joy when her people come back from running errands," Alexander told HuffPost. "These are the things that all of these dog victims of dog fighting deserve to experience whether they are adoptable or not."
Theodore
Trish Loehr
Dog trainer Trish Loehr says she fell for "one special guy" when she was volunteering at the ASPCA's temporary shelter for the 367 dogs. His name is Theodore and you can see him here wearing a pink hat.
"Teo is incredibly outgoing and resilient considering he spent his first eight months on a chain and the next eight in a shelter," said Loehr. "Despite this less than ideal upbringing, he is an amazing, smart, outgoing, friendly and hilarious little dog, and took to living in a house like a fish to water."
Shiloh
Christy Heffner
"One of the best dogs ever," wrote Shiloh's new mom, Christy Heffner, on the 367 rescue family Facebook page . "We got him at 12 weeks to 'foster,' knowing we were looking for another dog after one of our rescued Springers died. He obviously found his place."
Heffner told HuffPost that when she and her three kids went to the Humane Society of Calvert County to adopt their new pup, they didn't realize at first they were getting a 367 survivor.
Now, she's so glad they did. "I think with animals, just as with people, everyone deserves a chance," Heffner said. "Shiloh is no different than any other young dog. At times he's crazy, at times he's destructive, at times he's hyper. But he's always sweet and will cuddle anyone who lets him, including the other dog and the cats. But mostly he loves his people."
Donovan
Erin Sullivan
In Marcy, Erin Sullivan adopted Donovan , one of the 367 dogs she'd helped care for in the Humane Society's temporary facility.
"Despite living his entire life on a chain, he was just a really happy dog," said Sullivan of her 12-year-old pup.
He's even happier now, living with Sullivan and her boyfriend in their Orlando home.
"He's an old man dog with a heart of gold," said Sullivan. "Everything about having him is the best part. I have owned a lot of dogs in my life, but I have never known a happier creature than Donnie. He wakes up happy, he's happy to see everyone, he loves to just be and explore his world."
Jensen
Hello Bully
Ashley Phelps is adoption coordinator for Hello Bully , a Pittsburgh-based rescue group that has taken in a half-dozen of the 367 dogs, including Jensen.
Phelps was Jensen's foster mom, then adopted him for good.
"He and my dog are inseparable," she said. "He has come so far, especially with the help of his canine sister. He now loves to play with balls, isn't afraid of the leaves anymore and plays in them, and is learning to be a regular dog who isn't scared of everything. He is incredible!"
Zander, Homer and Taco
Bark Nation
These three guys are living at the Bark Nation foster facility in Michigan, where they will be socialized, and trained, and loved -- and even given some dog massages -- until they are ready for homes of their own.
"They have lived a life that no dog deserves to live. It's their turn to find the joy in life, for the rest of their lives," said Bark Nation co-founder Kelly McLaughlin, who added that  the trio -- known as #TeamZomo-- can't get enough of romping around as a little pack.
"They draw comfort and courage from each other," she said. "Born to fight each other, and have ended up saving each other."
Lucy
Project Bully
Lucy is one of four dogs taken in by the Bully Project , a New York City-based rescue group.
She was one of the last dogs to be "released" -- meaning that the court has said she can now be adopted.
"She is sweetest thing. She is ready to roll and looking for her forever home!" said Project Bully's Jennifer Bristol.

Bam Bam
Michelle Ivkovich
Michelle Ivkovich was working at the Humane Society of Calvert County, a Maryland shelter, when Bam Bam came in.
Ivkovich decided to take the pup in as a foster, then "I fell in love and adopted her," she said.
Arya
Megan Miller
"I think I knew she was perfect the first time I saw pictures of her while she was at the shelter," said Arya's new mom, Megan Miller, who loves taking her dog out hiking. "Even though she was surrounded by barking dogs and very shy, she was so eager to please and will do just about anything for love and affection."
Miller and her boyfriend adopted Arya from the Florida rescue group Plenty of Pit Bulls , and says she's become "much more passionate" about fighting breed-based discrimination.
Deciding to bring Arya home was "one of the best things we have ever done," said Miller. "We love her to pieces."
Roxie
Kassiana Earp
Kassiana Earp met Roxie -- then known as Annie -- while working with the Humane Society's rescue team.
She was assigned to the so-called oddballs of the 367 dogs -- the non-pits -- when she met this sweet longhaired Dachshund.
"My husband and I were talking about getting another dog, and I couldn't stop thinking about Annie," Earp said.
Roxie is fitting in great with Earp and her husband, their four kids and another dog, Rustie, who is her new best buddy.
"Her typical day now is going to sleep in her very own dog bed in our room on my side of the bed, waking up, going outside, eat, play for a minute with Rustie, then snuggling and sleeping the rest of the day," said Earp. "She will play with Daddy or Rustie, but if I am home, all she does is follow me around and as soon as I sit down she's in my lap and curled up in a tiny ball sleeping."
Tillie
Handsome Dan Rescue
Tillie's legs are permanently bowed, and she's battling heartworms.
But she is now living happily in Rhode Island with Heather Gutshall and her family, including Handsome Dan, one of the former Michael Vick dogs.
"She is a wonderful little survivor, wonderful with my children, and every single day is the best day ever for Tillie," said Gutshall. "She is always super happy and loves every person she meets."
Hope
Lisa Grant
Lisa Grant's daughter gave Hope her name.
"She said there's hope for these dogs," said Grant. "I saw her on the local news the day she came to Kansas City. The next morning I set it up to meet my family and the rest is history."
Garbanzo
Even Chance Pit Bull Rescue
Garbanzo was sent to St. Louis-based Even Chance Pit Bull Rescue , once he was ready for his own family.
"He has since been adopted into an awesome home! He lives with mom, dad, human brother, a small Dachshund doggie brother and a black cat Nelly, whom he cuddles with," said Even Chance director Jessi McNamara.
The group's veterinarian thinks Garbanzo may have been bashed in the left side of his head in his previous life. He had a deep, large wound that caused dental issues, "as well as some issues with that eye," said McNamara. "He is healthy now and doing amazing!"
Finn
Anne Hall
Finn is now one of a family of four dogs and two cats, living in New Jersey, and going to work every day with his new mom, dog trainer Andrea Kilkenny.
Finn "has made lots of friends, both human and canine," said Kilkenny. "We are just amazed at how well he is doing, and his confidence grows daily. He loves meeting new people and is very gentle. We are hoping that he will become a therapy dog in the future."
Cinnabar
Humane Society of Calvert County
Cinnabar is one of nearly 20 367 dogs placed with the Humane Society of Calvert County in Maryland. She's friendly, and energetic, and great with other dogs -- but she's also the last one left, who hasn't yet been adopted .
"Now, we just wait for Cinnabar to find a home," said HSCC's spokesperson KIrstyn Northrop Cobb. "Maybe with me."
Bixby
Dog trainer Alison Waszmer says her pup Bixby is "a complicated guy."
"He is the sweetest little guy but very fearful and needy," she told HuffPost.
But that's why he's exactly right for her. "He's a work in progress, but we are getting there," said Waszmer. "Every day there are small improvements. This is why he became part of my family."
Zazzle
Toni Martin
Toni Martin wasn't looking to adopt Zazzle the dog. But Zazzle really didn't leave her any choice in the matter.
Martin was working at the ASPCA's temporary shelter when Zazzle declared his interests.
"It became clear he was in love with me, because he never tore his eyes off me," she said. "One day when returning Zazzle to his kennel from the exercise pen, I found myself on the floor with him in my arms, whispering to him that he would sleep in my bed one day and be spoiled rotten. A coworker heard me and when I turned around he was smirking: 'I thought you hated that dog?'"
"I said, 'I'm just being nice. Leave me alone.'" said Martin. "The following month that crazy dog was, indeed, in my bed."
Hank
Donna Kinsella
Donna Kinsella met her "special old man" while volunteering at the Humane Society's shelter. She adopted Hank in November from the rescue group Jasmine's House , which was responsible for finding homes for seven of the 367 dogs.
"I love this photo, because this old geezer, who has been through a hell we can't even imagine, looks just like a baby with his legs all tucked up underneath of him," said Kinsella. "My Hank."
Bodie
Linda Holman
Bodie stole Linda Holman's heart.
Holman was volunteering at the Humane Society's shelter for the 367 dogs, where 5-month-old Bodie "would lie on her side in her kennel and reach her paws through the fencing hoping someone would touch her," said Holman, who vowed to adopt the pup when Bodie was no longer tied up in the legal proceedings of the case.
In August, Bodie was ready to join Holman and her husband in California, where "there are moments when I see her past in her eyes and she looks to me for reassurance," Holman said. "Most times she's goofy and loving and she's brought such joy to our house."
Evan
Mandy Malecek
Evan is about 9 years old and has no teeth. Still, he's "a super happy boy," said Mandy Malecek, his foster mom.
"What I want people to know about Evan and all of the 367 dogs is that their past did not and will not break them," Malecek told HuffPost. "Evan is one of the oldest dogs from this group and likely endured pain and suffering the longest. Yet, he is one of the happiest, silliest and most loving dogs you will ever meet. His tail never stops wagging and his butt never stops wiggling."
All he needs now is a permanent home .
Aladdin
Plenty of Pit Bulls
This guy was born in the temporary shelter; his mom had been pregnant at the time of his rescue.
Well-socialized and gorgeous, Aladdin's now looking for a home of his own through Plenty of Pit Bulls , a Florida-based rescue group that is responsible for 18 of the 367 dogs.
"Overall, he's a happy and sweet-tempered dog with a lot of 'velcro,'" said Plenty of Pit Bulls board member Anna Peterson -- meaning that Aladdin will want to stick close to his human's side.
Plenty of Pit Bulls has two other 367 dogs still available for adoption, as well: Bambi and Vida .
"They are all wonderful dogs," Peterson said.
BeeGee
Brandi Smith
Check out BeeGee's Facebook page , where foster mom Brandi Smith has been chronicling this little lady's progress becoming a fully socialized (and completely adorable) family pet who is "comfortable being loved," as Smith put it.
Arabelle
Plenty of Pit Bulls
Arabelle spent the first decade of life having puppies born into dog fighting. Now she's been adopted by Sharon Nataline, a board member for Plenty of Pit Bulls .
"She had a couple of different kinds of cancer and other health issues," said Plenty of Pit Bulls' Anna Peterson. "Arabelle lives with a bunch of other dogs, including lots of senior Chihuahuas, and is absolutely perfect."
Keep up with these doggies -- as well as the others who are up for adoption -- on the 367 rescue family Facebook page .

Google faces the risk of losing its spot as the default search provider for Apple's Safari browser next year, a report said.
As the latest extension of the deal that placed Google Search in the iOS is set to expire in 2015, arch rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, are already making a case for change with Apple's leadership.
The two have pitched Apple SVP Eddy Cue on the idea of replacing Google as the default search provider . While Microsoft wants Bing to replace the search engine giant, Yahoo is eyeing the same spot for itself, reported The Verge.
Bing has already made inroads into Apple as it is the search provider used by Siri. Also, OS X Yosemite and its Spotlight use the search engine to deliver results, the report said.

Google s purchase of Nest Labs shows potential in Internet of Things0
Still, Turner and others agreed, Google’s $3.2 billion purchase of Nest Labs this year gave everyone in the I of T scene a jolt. Turner was part of a panel of investors at last week’s Second Annual Explore the Internet of Things Summit, sponsored by the Illinois Technology Association.
“We’re talking $3 billion, in a market that’s 2 percent penetrated,” Turner said.
Nest Labs, based in Palo Alto, Calif., makes smart thermostats that aim to manage temperatures more efficiently while collecting consumer data.
“There’s a land grab for who owns the home, and that’s primarily so (companies) can sell you all sorts of other things,” said Karen Kerr, senior managing director for advanced manufacturing at GE Ventures.
Harold Zapp, founder and CEO of German-based Relayr, said the Nest exit reverberated across Europe. Relayr makes a hardware-development kit for Internet of Things startups, and Zapp said he was having no luck securing funding, until Google’s Nest acquisition.
“After this,” he said, “the phone doesn’t stop ringing.”
Relayr closed a $2.3 million seed round in September, Zapp said.
The Internet of Things refers to the growing array of devices that connect objects to each other and to the Web. Industrial applications tend to focus on sensors that measure machine performance, increasing productivity. Consumer applications range from smart appliances to wearable devices for tracking fitness and health.
Howard Smith, managing director for investment firm First Analysis, emphasized that the technology continues to emerge. As a result, he said, he and his investment partners need to see a clear path to revenue before they recommend investing in I of T companies.
Return on investment “has to be very compelling and easy to understand,” he said. “If you have to get to the third sentence (to explain your company's business plan), it’s not for us.”
Turner cautioned that while the Nest purchase energized investors, it didn’t touch off a rash of massive exits. Samsung acquired SmartThings in August for a reported $200 million. That's a good price, Turner said, but hardly at the level of Nest.
Turner said investors looking to cash in on the Internet of Things quickly don’t need to go hunting to buy obscure startups but instead can invest in established companies.
“GE and Cisco are the closest things to pure Internet of Things plays right now,” he said.
Zapp is more bullish on startups, partly because of the open-source culture that he said imbues the growing maker movement. He said developers at startups collaborate, share and build on each others’ work, meaning they can innovate quickly.

How and where youll spend your money on Black Friday  in chartsBy Sarah Halzack November 26 Follow @sarahhalzack

In many American households, Thanksgiving weekend means three things:  Turkey, football and getting a jumpstart on Christmas shopping.
For many years, the shopping component of the weekend unfolded as reliably as the traditional dinner:  Throngs of people descended on the big-box retailers in the wee hours of the morning to elbow and push their way to the best deals of the holiday season.
But in recent years, the stereotypical image we have of Black Friday has been eroding: The sales are starting earlier and running longer.  Plenty of consumers are nabbing the deals online from the comfort of home.  And some shoppers are now sitting out the sales altogether in protest of the intrusion on Thanksgiving.
So what do Black Thursday and Black Friday even look like in 2014?  How will people be shopping and what will they be spending?
Researchers unleash a deluge of surveys and studies at this time of year that are aimed at answering these questions.  Here’s a roundup of some of their most interesting findings.
Black Friday is not really a one-day event anymore.
The National Retail Federation has found that 61 percent of shoppers, or 140.1 million of them, plan to shop online or in stores at some point over the holiday weekend.  This is roughly comparable to the number of shoppers that said they’d be going out last year.  It’s clear these shoppers will spread out their purchasing throughout the holiday weekend, likely because the deals stretch for much longer than a single day.
Related: Your vision of Black Friday anarchy is outdated
People plan to spend more this Thanksgiving weekend than last year.
A survey by consultancy Deloitte found that holiday shoppers’ planned spending for the holiday weekend has been inching up since 2011.  That finding comes as lower gas prices and a lower unemployment rate seem to be boosting consumers’ spending and confidence.  Another consultancy, Accenture, found in its holiday shopping survey that 25 percent of shoppers said they planned to spend more on their holiday shopping overall this year, compared to 20 percent who said so in 2013.
Hardly anyone’s waking up at the crack of dawn these days to get their shopping fix.
Remember those images you used to see of poorly-rested shoppers groggily standing in line before sunrise?  Those days are over. Big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart, Macy’s, Best Buy and Target kick off their in-store sales on Thursday evening at 5 or 6 p.m.  And many major malls open at midnight Friday, inviting shoppers into specialty stores such as Gap, Loft and Urban Outfitters.   In other words, most stores now open their doors at night, meaning Black Friday is now more about staying up past your bedtime than it is about setting your alarm.  This survey data, collected by Deloitte, illustrates this well:
Online shoppers beware: Cyber Monday might not be your best day to strike. 
Cyber Monday is supposed to be the banner day for online deals, but this chart from cloud computing company Akamai Technologies shows why you might not want to hold out for that day. Akamai measured the daily peak pageviews per minute to retail Web sites during Thanksgiving week last year.  And while Cyber Monday is indeed the peak traffic day, note how closely Thanksgiving and Black Friday compare to it.  It’s a sign that some merchandise could be out of stock or picked over by the time Cyber Monday rolls around.

There may be uproar about stores opening on Thanksgiving, but people are growing more comfortable doing online shopping that day.
You’ve seen the tweets and the Change.org petitions calling for stores to cool it on the Thanksgiving store openings .  But Akamai found that Thanksgiving Day traffic to retail sites was 21 percent higher last year than in 2012, suggesting that enthusiasm is growing for online shopping on the holiday.
Akamai also notes that while last year’s Thanksgiving Day registered more sustained Web traffic throughout the day than seen in 2012, you still see a distinctive pullback during the late afternoon and early evening, when people are most likely to be gathered around the dinner table.

Final norms on digitising insurance policies by DecemberTeena Jain Kaushal      Follow @MoneyTeena    Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 10:58 IST

Following a pilot project, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) plans to come out with final guidelines on digitising insurance policies by December.
Under the pilot, Irda had asked insurers to tie-up with all repositories so that policyholders can keep their policies in digital form. The project was implemented for two months from July 1. At the pilot stage, each life insurer had to convert at least 1,000 or 5% of existing individual policies, whichever is less, into electronic form. For new polices also, each life insurer had to issue at least 1,000 or 5% policies issued during the launch, whichever is less, in electronic form.
SV Ramanan, chief executive officer, CAMS Repository Services, says, "We have digitised one lakh policies so far but around 75% converted policies are existing ones. We have observed that agents are not very keen on issuing new policies in digital form as they do not get to see the policy documents. The digital copy goes directly to the policyholder. We have asked the regulator to look into the matter."
"Only a few companies have achieved the target of 2,000 policies, and it was mostly from existing policies. Many companies have even failed to comply with the project guidelines," he says.
Irda Chairman T S Vijayan says, "Initially the response was not very strong. That's why we asked insurance companies to do pilots. We wanted insurers to know the bottlenecks. Final guidelines are about to come but we may not make it mandatory for policyholders."
Irda has licensed five companies to act as repositories-NSDL Database Management, Central Insurance Repository, SHCIL Projects, Karvy Insurance Repository and CAMS Repository Services.
Experts say they have been talking with the regulator to make the whole process online so that policyholders do not have to go to the branch office for converting their policies. At present, one can convert by submitting the form directly to an insurance repository or by sending it through the insurance company. A unique number is assigned to every policyholder and details such as claim history and nominees are stored under that number.

PM Modi s wife files RTI over her security coverPM Modi's wife files RTI over her security cover
Mahesh Langa , Hindustan Times  Ahmedabad, November 24, 2014
First Published: 21:29 IST(24/11/2014) | Last Updated: 11:04 IST(25/11/2014)
Comments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s estranged wife Jashodaben Modi filed an Right To Information (RTI) application seeking details of the official order under which the government provided her with security, and the facilities she was entitled to by virtue of being the PM’s wife.

“I filed the application asking for details about my security and what else I am entitled to,” Jashodaben told HT.
Jashodaben, a retired school teacher who lives with her brother in a north Gujarat village, filed the well-drafted, three-page application herself on Monday at the Mehsana superintendent of police’s (SP) office.
The application came two days after Jashodaben gave an interview to a Mumbai-based tabloid in which she said, “If he (Modi) calls me once, I will go with him.”
After Modi took over as PM in May, the Gujarat government provided Jashodaben with four commandos at her residence. They tail her wherever she goes, including during her recent trip to Mumbai.
In her application, Jashodaben states: “I, the petitioner, who is the wife of Prime Minister Narendra Modi… travel by public transport while my bodyguards travel by official vehicle.”
“I should be provided a certified copy of the order under which security is provided to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's family members, brothers, sisters and me,” she stated, while asking for details to be given within 48 hours as the issue pertains to a life and death matter.
Elaborating, she cites the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her own commandos. “The commandos assigned to me have no official order by which they have been posted at my residence,” the application says.
“Since Narendra Modi himself has acknowledged her as his wife in his election nomination form, she is the first lady (sic) and is entitled to get all facilities like Manmohan Singh’s wife used to get from the government,” Jashodaben’s brother, Ashok Modi, told HT.
He added that the government should provide his sister with a car and female commandos as she was not comfortable with an all-male security detail.
“She deserves to be with Narendrabhai in Delhi because he is no longer an RSS pracharak. He is the Prime Minister of India now,” Ashok Modi said.
Mehsana SP JR Mothalia confirmed that the PM’s wife had indeed filed an RTI. “Today, she came to our office and filed an RTI to know about her rights as PM's wife with regard to security cover. We will give our written reply to her within the stipulated time," he said.

Microsoft launches first non-Nokia Lumia 535technology (general)
Microsoft Devices, on Wednesday, launched Lumia 535, its first Lumia smartphone without the Nokia brand name post its acquisition of the Finish handset maker. Priced at Rs.9,199, the dual-SIM device is the first smartphone in India to feature Microsoft branding. The U.S.-based software giant had acquired the handset business of Nokia earlier this year for $7.2 billion.
Lumia 535 runs on Windows Phone 8.1 and comes with a 5-inch display. It is powered by 1.2 GHz quadcore processor and 1GB RAM.
“Younger tech-involved audiences are increasingly looking at an uncompromised experience on their smartphones. With access to the best services right out of the box at a price they can afford, we believe Lumia 535 is an ideal solution to offer young India,” Nokia India Sales (a subsidiary of Microsoft Mobile Oy) Managing Director Ajey Mehta said.
(Photo: Lumia 53)
Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Mehta said the branding transition was a gradual process and the company intended to extend it to other areas such as marketing and its exclusive retail stores.
“Over a period, our marketing will be changed,” he said, adding that the modifications would include the Nokia Priority stores. However, he said the plan was still work under progress and did not divulge further details.
Lumia 535 will come bundled with Vodafone subscription and 500 MB data Internet pack a month for two months.

Black Friday cheat sheet: Your guide to retails big weekendBy Sarah Halzack November 26 Follow @sarahhalzack
After grappling with a lack of innovation in the industry, toy makers respond with playthings that work with apps or interact with gadgets like iPads, allowing more customization and creativity. (AP)
Shoppers, on your mark:  The long weekend of Black Friday sales is practically upon us.  Here’s a roundup of information that should help you navigate the sales, whether you’re hitting the mall or shopping on a tablet in your living room.
 When do the big sales start?
If you’re asking this question, you’re already a little bit behind the deal-nabbing curve.  Many holiday sales are already underway. Wal-Mart cut prices on 20,000 items way back on Nov. 1. Staples began its Black Friday sale on Nov. 16.  The Disney Store began offering its Black Friday prices on Monday.
But still, some fresh deals are poised to arrive on Thursday and Friday.  Here’s when some of the big sales kick off.  We’ve linked to each retailer’s Black Friday Web hub so you can get an idea of what kind of items and promotions they’ll be offering.

Thursday
12 a.m.  As soon as the clock strikes midnight, online sales start at Wal-Mart  and other large retailers.
6 a.m.   Kmart is the first big-box retailer to open its physical stores.
6 p.m.  The next wave of big-box retailers opens its doors: Target , Macy’s , Sears and Kohl’s .
8 p.m.  Wal-Mart is staggering its deals this year, so look for its big electronics event to kick off at this time.  (The promotions available earlier, at 6 p.m., are mostly focused on toys and home goods.)
10 p.m. to midnight.  Many major malls nationwide and specialty apparel stores will open somewhere in this time frame.  There’s plenty of variation from mall to mall and store to store, so check in with your local shopping center to know what to expect.
Friday
1 a.m.  Best Buy and some other retailers close up shop for the night instead of staying open continuously through Friday evening.  They’ve found that there’s not much shopping action in the wee hours of the morning, so it doesn’t make sense to keep the stores staffed during that time.
6 a.m.  Another round of new deals launches at stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart.
8 a.m.   Best Buy reopens.
Throughout the morning:  Major retailers who stayed closed on Thanksgiving, including Nordstrom and Costco, will open their doors.
Anything I need to know before I open my wallet?
Retailers are still going to be competing intensely on price .
You should be ready for Elsa-mania .
Relax.   Your vision of Black Friday anarchy is outdated .
Retailers are in a bigger-than-ever shipping battle this year, and that’s creating new conveniences for you.

Meet the startup turning your Thanksgiving scraps into fertilizer -- and cash0
LeSeuer had been out of the corporate world several years before  the startup bug  bit in 2009. It was the height of the recession and he was working in software development. Hungry for more stability, the former general manager of Windows Server Systems at Microsoft often thought of returning to the 9 to 5 grind with his former colleague Jose Lugo. But both had a nagging feeling they could do more in a down economy. “We saw this big waste issue and began asking questions like, Why are we wasting so much food?” LeSueur says. “If we could understand it, maybe we could do something about it.”
With help from PCC Natural Markets in Seattle, they began tinkering on what would eventually become  WISErg , a Redmond, Virginia-based startup that's taken  $5 million in funding  from private sources. WISErg does two things: it makes Harvester machines that enable grocers and food service providers to safely discard their food scraps, and it turns those food scraps into liquid fertilizer for organic crop production.
In April 2010, LeSueur approached Diana Chapman, PCC's director of sustainability in Seattle, with a daring proposal. “We have this technology that allows you to convert your food scraps into a useful product — all we need is a working laboratory,” she recalled him explaining. No stranger to composting herself, Chapman agreed to give the Harvesters a try.
“We were actually a very good partner because unlike most conventional grocery stores, we have a much higher percentage of food made on-site,” which creates more food scraps, she says. The stores were also a useful testing ground because of their focus on organic produce. Since those products turned over more frequently, “we could give [WISErg] any number of unique situations that they'd need to test.”
The first objective was to determine just how much food was going to waste. “Was there a better option for this product that was being sold at $8 a pound, or was it being thrown away as a cost of disposal?” LeSueur recalls thinking. “We needed to get data to help grocery stores avoid waste and begin to treat their high quality food as a resource. We didn't want to see it thrown away.”
Enter Big data
Four years later, Harvesters can be found at Whole Foods, Red Apple, and PCC Natural Markets. The loading unit resembles a double-door Sub-Zero and contains all the control and data-gathering centers. Next to it is the holding tank, “where all the biology occurs,” LeSueur says.
Using the Harvester is simple: Employees swipe a key or RFID so it knows who they are, then enter the category of food and why it's being eliminated (say, if it dropped on the floor). The door unlocks, they load the scraps, then close the door so it relocks.
From there, it takes about five to seven minutes to move the scraps into the biological tank, where the decomposing process of nutrients is halted so they can be used to enrich the fertilizer. The average size of a load is 120 pounds and stores will do anywhere from 10 to 25 loads a day, LeSueur says. The new unit coming in January could potentially double that size.
Throughout the discarding process, “we're capturing images of the food, plus its weight and temperature, and it's all going to the cloud, where we're  doing business analytics  on it,” LeSueur says. “We're able to not just understand what the categories and weights are of the food, but why it's being thrown out, and we can compare between stores and industries.”
This information is then relayed back to the stores, which they can access through WISErg's software. As WISErg builds up its client base, the hope is to show how stores compare to one another in the same region. “We see this playing out as real-time access to this information,” LeSueur says. “A grocer would be able to set thresholds of waste streams they expect and when those metrics are exceeded, they can get real-time alerts, because this is a workforce that has the potential for high turnover (and requires lots of training).”
During the holidays, the data will be especially useful. “By providing better visibility, store managers can act on issues and take them more seriously,” LeSueur says. And since many stores work with food banks over the holidays, they can use the data to see how quickly they need to send food before it spoils.
They may also find it's not worth it to purchase excess inventory. “We're hoping that by showing some of these stores the data, we can show them that just because you can buy more at a discount — think pumpkins at Halloween — it's not the best decision if their cost of disposal, including labor and time, is more,” LeSueur says.
In other words, the true value of the data rests in how it will change grocers' behaviors, or more pointedly, employees' behaviors. “The vast majority of the problems are related to handling practices, and the labor one is the largest challenge because it's hard to monitor that on a daily and hourly basis.”
However, changes have happened. One store loading its Harvester with over 300 pounds of vegetables over the course of eight weeks eventually learned that its indoor HVAC was not kicking in on time. “The shelf life had diminished so quickly that it was creating that excess of food,” LeSueur says. “There was no shame on anybody — it was just what the data showed.”

The service is part of San Francisco-based Uber's partnership with Chicago-based mall owner General Growth Properties. In addition to Oakbrook Center, Uber offers the free holiday service to Kenwood Towne Centre, outside of Cincinnati.

A prior version of this story incorrectly stated the promotion was only for new Uber users and for one-time use, based on information provided by the public relations firm representing the mall.

No Thanks: Retailers  holiday hours criticized0
The Facebook Group Boycott Black Thanksgiving, which has 114,000 likes, asks shoppers not to patronize stores that open on Thanksgiving Day and instead spend their money at stores that wait until Friday to open, a list that includes Nordstrom, GameStop and T.J. Maxx.
Some retailers tout their decisions to be closed on Thanksgiving as a point of pride. Oak Brook-based Ace Hardware released a statement saying it would be closed "so our employees and their families can enjoy time together giving thanks," as "some things are just more important than money."
Kmart is among the retailers receiving criticism for its Thanksgiving Day hours. This is the fifth year it will open at 6 a.m. Thursday, and it is staying open 42 hours until midnight Friday, an hour longer than last year. The retailer, which has been open Thanksgiving Day for 23 years, said it is "a destination for early-bird shopping and last-minute entertaining needs." It pays its employees time-and-a-half to work the holiday.
But in a petition on Coworker.org started by Jillian Fisher, the daughter of a Kmart employee, several dozen self-identified Kmart employees described being unable to have a say on whether they work Thanksgiving.
One part-time cashier at a Bridgeview Kmart, who asked not to be named for fear of being fired, said in an interview that her regular schedule has her off on Thursdays and Fridays, so she planned Thanksgiving dinner at her house and ordered turkey for 12 guests. She said she was shocked when she saw the schedule two Saturdays ago and learned she was scheduled to work 4-10 p.m. Thanksgiving Day as well as on Black Friday.
"I would have been more than happy to work up until noon on Thanksgiving, but they never asked me," said the cashier, who earns the $8.25 minimum wage. "I don't understand how they get away with that."
Jamie Stein, spokeswoman at Hoffman Estates-based Sears Holdings, which owns Kmart, said in a statement: "Our stores do their very best to staff with seasonal associates and those who volunteer to work holidays. Seasonal associates are told upon hire of our holiday store hours and we make every effort to accommodate associate shift requests during this time." She added that the company expresses "deep appreciation" for holiday workers.
The cashier, who does not want to tell her parents to eat Thanksgiving dinner elsewhere, said that if she's unable to swap shifts, she plans to call Kmart Thursday morning and let them know she won't be in.
"And they'll probably say, don't come back," she said. "But I have a feeling I won't be the only one doing that."

5 Ways to Raise the Accountability Bar Inside Your Companyreddit
It's one thing to create a grand plan to grow your company, it is a whole other thing to get your team consistently executing.
The most essential "in the trenches" key to execution is to raise the accountability bar inside your company so that each team member feels like what he or she does is seen, noticed, and applauded.
Here are 5 ways to create a culture of execution and accountability inside your company:
1. Be on time, all the time.
We have to start with first things first.  Be on time--all the time.  This simple behavior symbolizes to your team that you take your commitments seriously and live with integrity.
Sure it's easy to slip, your team always seems willing to wait.  But the message being late sends hurts your credibility inside your company.
When you take appointments and deadlines seriously, so will your team.  It is one behavior with a huge return on investment in terms of modeling accountability inside your company.
Too many companies implement respect in a hierarchical manner. Your time is not more important than an employee's time or a customer's time in their eyes. Being on time shows respect, and it makes a big difference to the receiver.
And of course you can rationalize why you didn't meet a stated deadline and no one will challenge you, but they will model the behavior you show them.  So model the high standard of being on time, all the time.
2. Clarify all action items and deliverables in writing at the end of every meeting.
One of the biggest reasons things get missed is because they weren't handed off cleanly to begin with.  Many times the receiving party doesn't know just what they've been asked to do, or in fact they may not know that they've been asked to do something at all.
Hence the need to clarify all action items and deliverables in writing.  Not only does this make sure that you've captured all your action items, but it is also a powerful way to role model how you want your team to behave.
Wherever possible, number the commitments so that they are absolutely clear.
At your next meeting this might sound like:  "Okay, summing up here's what I've committed to:  I've got three action items here. Item one is to review the Johnson Proposal and make a yes or no decision by this Friday end of business.  Item two is to give feedback via email to Carl about the new orientation process.  And item three is to send out the date of our next quarterly planning session to the exec team by noon tomorrow.  (I encourage you to visibly write each of them down in your notes as your meeting progresses). Now Cheryl, I have down that you've committed to two items..."
Teach your team to employ this same skill with their staff.  It's a best practice that companies that execute adopt.
3. Clearly state what you can't commit to so that you don't lower the accountability bar in your company by missing a "phantom deliverable."
"Phantom deliverables" are those things that the other person thinks you committed to but you didn't.
As a leader, you need to exhibit great communication by making any phantom deliverables you see come out of a meeting explicit. That way if you can commit to that deliverable, you do so, and if you can't, you clarify that you are not committing to it.
4. Hold Your Focus Long Enough to Make Progress and Reassure Your Team
There is nothing more frustrating to your team than a CEO who constantly shifts the playing field under their feet, one day focused on X, the next on Y.
There is a dynamic balance between flexibility and momentum.  Flexibility says, "Be willing to adjust to the market." And, "Seize opportunities."  Momentum says, "I'm working - feed me." And, "Support my successes and let me build on what's working."
Obviously you need both as you grow your company.
You need flexibility so you are nimble and move quickly to take advantage of opportunities.
You need momentum so you have time to hit critical mass and build the infrastructure to sustain your growth.
5. Credibility is a marathon, not a sprint.
You likely noticed that all four of the above accountability suggestions are for YOU the CEO and leader of your company.  Accountability is a function of culture, and culture starts at the top.
It doesn't help if you take off out of the gate gung ho in your desire to model accountability, only to let it slip a few weeks later. If you want accountability to be a real and lasting part of your company culture, you've got to maintain your behavior over time.
Good luck applying these five powerful accountability principles to grow your company.

Top Food Trends for 2015... Are You Readyreddit
There is a lot to look forward to in the New Year for food trends and the evolution of supermarkets.  Expect to see smoked as this year's key flavor and a huge rise in popularity for fermented foods.  Online grocery shopping will continue to expand to even small markets around the country and supermarkets will evolve into one-stop-shops to win back customers. We're already starting to see top trends like these emerging in the media, in the supermarket aisles in restaurants and on popular cooking shows so expect to see these trends take off big  in 2015.
For the last ten years, I've worked closely with ConAgra Foods to produce the annual food trends forecast for the coming year in order to share these with supermarkets across the country to insure they have what you want when you shop their stores. Here are the top trends on my radar:
Grazing Golden-Agers
Ninety-one percent of people say they snack daily, according to Nielsen. While snacking is on the rise among all ages and genders, research shows that snacking among consumers over the age of 65 could contribute to additional years with a higher quality of life. We'll see more boomers - those raised in the "three square meals a day" era - employ a "grazing" approach to eating next year.  When boomers snack, they'll focus on foods rich in nutrients like protein, fiber and Omega3s that can help promote bone health, like sunflower seeds, nuts and whole grain popcorn.
Grocery Shopping Goes 24/7 Online
Online grocery shopping and delivery has become a crowded space, with a number of services competing for consumer attention. Once online grocery delivery was considered a luxury for those living in urban areas, but revenue gains among these delivery services indicate the trend will expand to mainstream consumers living in both urban and rural areas next year. Previously, major e-commerce players like Amazon would only deliver non-perishable items, but other services like Peapod, Fresh Direct, Amazon Fresh and Instacart make it possible to have perishables delivered as well.
Everything Smoked
Just when you thought the bacon trend had cooled off, restaurateurs and at-home cooks are continuing to turn up the heat. The demand for smoked foods has risen as chefs begin to apply smoking and grilling to add some sizzle and impart new flavor to other proteins and alternatives like vegetables, butters, and even cocktails. And, with smokers gaining in popularity in backyards across America, at-home cooks are also experimenting with smoking non-traditional foods.
The Rise of Fermented Foods
2015 will be the year fermented foods - foods like yogurt, tempeh and sauerkraut take center stage. These foods contain live cultures, or are preserved in liquid so their sugars and starches can become bacteria-boosting agents. After multi-year growth of gluten-free foods, many consumers have found their digestive health improved. Nearly 50 percent of Americans have changed their diet to help improve digestion, with nearly 20 percent doing so in the past year, found a recent survey by ConAgra Foods.  Gluten-free will continue, but also evolve into a focus on fermented foods as people continue to look for foods to aid digestion. Once toppings or side items, these foods will become commonplace in meals this year.
Gen Z: Chefs Everyday
Millennials' passion for food-related adventures is undeniable, but Gen Z, the demographic group born after Millennials (1995 to present day), brings an entire new set of food values to the kitchen table. Exposed at a young age to more flavors and variety than previous generations, Gen Z's collective attitude toward food is simplicity and health. They tend to use stove tops rather than microwaves for cooking meals and fresh ingredients to prepared foods. Research by NPD Group indicates some of their favorite foods to cook include eggs/omelets, hot dogs, potatoes and chicken, which they can "dress up" with their own unique touch.
Craft Foods Make its Way into Kitchens Everywhere
Typically associated with foods made in small batches with specialized, local ingredients, major companies are finding ways to produce craft foods in larger quantities. The phenomenon of craft beer brought new excitement, flavors and sales to the struggling beer industry. In 2015, look for this trend to extend to other beverages and food, as Millennials in particular continue to seek unique tastes and foods with authentic origin stories.
Nutrition Labels: No Longer Just on Packaged Foods
As consumers want more information about their foods, innovative devices like Prep Pad will soon offer this information instantaneously. The Prep Pad pairs with an iPad app to calculate the exact nutritional content of your meals, including the carbs, fats, protein and calories by scanning the bar code of food packages used as ingredients or the items on your plate. Information about a food's ingredients, chemical makeup or nutritional values will become more readily available and commonplace in the supermarket and our kitchens.
Supermarkets Convert into Socializing Spaces
Supermarkets have evolved from straightforward centers where consumers could buy groceries to purveyors of lifestyle. Present day supermarkets are developing a variety of services that help set them apart and establish each outlet as an ambassador of niche lifestyle trends.  In the near future, we can expect supermarkets to further specialize in order to present their customers with a unique experience that showcases their personality and philosophy toward foods - instead of presenting themselves solely as vendors of goods.

A $10 Million Blow to Fair Trade: How a Grant to Fair Trade USA May Take Down a Movementreddit
News came out last week that Bob Stiller, founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (now Keurig Green Mountain) and still recognized as Chairman Emeritus, made a $10 million dollar grant to Fair Trade USA , a fair trade labeling organization on whose board Stiller sits. This is a challenge grant requiring $10 million additional dollars to be raised, bringing the total investment in Fair Trade USA (FTUSA) to $20 million.
In theory, this news should have the fair trade movement jumping up and down. Instead, many of us are wondering if this may be the final blow to the meaningful fair trade that we have advocated for so long.
Stiller founded a company with a mixed record. Yes, they are the largest single purchaser of fair trade certified coffee, but fair trade coffee makes up less than a third of their offerings. As their recent name change indicates, they are also the coffee that ushered in the single use K-Cups which wreak environmental havoc and ensure that farmers receive an even smaller percentage of the price consumers pay, with most money going to pay for marketing and packaging. Green Mountain is also a member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, an organization that lobbies for free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In the wake of NAFTA, 2 million corn farmers in Mexico were forced off their land. TPP is expected to have similar outcomes over greater swaths of the earth. Even $10 million dollars is not enough to buy farmers out of bad trade policy. Stiller's resources and influence could better be spent invested in organizations advocating for a trade architecture that supports small-scale farmers rather than squashes them.
Fair Trade USA's track record is not much better. After breaking away from the international Fairtrade Labeling Organization (now Fairtrade International), FTUSA announced its rogue Fair Trade for All initiative opening up the model to certify independent smallholders and large-scale "estates" (aka plantations) as fair trade. This was done despite protests from small-scale producer groups within the fair trade system as well as significant opposition from committed fair trade coffee roasters and other committed fair trade brands, advocacy organizations such as my own, and consumers.
One of the three areas of investment for this proposed grant is "strengthening the certification model." This is perhaps the most concerning aspect of the grant. Small-scale coffee farmers protested FTUSA's new model for certification precisely because it goes against the very essence of fair trade and the reason fair trade was developed in the first place. That is, it allows single-owner plantation coffee to be labeled as fair trade, directly competing against small-scale growers who have put democratic organization and building long-term relationships at the core of their model as they struggle to gain market access in a market that favors the bigger and the less democratic. These small-scale farmers understand they can be outcompeted, perhaps put out of business, in the very fair trade model that they helped create.  Strengthening the FTUSA certification model could very well mean the end of small-scale farmer fair trade.
Julia, a small-scale coffee farmer in Peru, shows her farm and explains the dangers of allowing plantations into the fair trade certification model.
Another priority of the grant is "deepening consumer engagement" which is code for marketing this model to unsuspecting consumers. Ones who still likely believe they are supporting small-scale farmers.
Our call to potential funders of FTUSA is let's not unlock this $10 million dollar "investment." Let's instead direct funding to organizations like the Small Producer Symbol whose very mission is to promote small-scale farmer fair trade because labelers like FTUSA failed them. Or let's invest in groups fighting against more NAFTAs and promoting fair trade policies that will allow small-scale farmers to stay on their land, producing food for both their community and northern consumers.

Guiding Principles for Success in Life and Businessreddit
Sometimes the most innocuous moments can have the biggest impact on your career. In university, I reviewed a business case focused on former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Her drive, courage and willingness to take on the most daunting challenges as the only woman to ever hold that post have stayed with me and have inspired me long into my 25 years in the telecommunications industry.
Today, according to a study across 48 countries, Canada takes the top spot for the country with the most female leaders (50 per cent). That's certainly something to be proud of. I've been fortunate to spend the bulk of my career with a company that fosters a culture of leadership to drive innovation and productivity; empowers employees; and recognizes the importance of supporting the diverse needs of our team members. In fact, this week, the Women's Executive Network (WXN) released its list of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Women and I was honoured to be recognized along with my fellow colleagues Monique Mercier and Sandy McIntosh.
This accolade is a great reminder that with strong guiding principles, anyone can be successful in business and life. Here are the top three that guide me.
Follow your passions
I'm passionate about growing my skills and taking on new challenges. As such, I constantly push myself, both body and mind, to try new things. Most recently for example, I've taken on learning a new language - French - to expand my mind, and trail running to push my body to new limits. As a leader and mentor, I take a similar approach with my team. I focus on structuring, supporting and motivating my team to follow their passions and to leverage their diverse strengths and talents for each new challenge.
I'm equally passionate about my family as I am my work. As a mother, I've had barriers to overcome in balancing my desire to be successful at home and at work. One of my greatest achievements to date has been the implementation of a national program designed to provide employees with the flexibility to work from wherever they are the most productive. This program encourages self-management of time and careers while affording employees the ability to balance life's expectations. Now in its eighth year, 60 per cent of our company has the option of flexible work, with a goal of 70 per cent by 2015.
Certainly, no accomplishment comes without barriers, but I believe the key to long term success is putting yourself out there and following your passions. By following this principle, I was able to implement a program that essentially eliminated one of my barriers while helping fellow team members achieve balance in life and business as well.
Take risks
If you asked my kids to pick one word that describes me they'd likely say "adventurous." I believe in taking risks and growing every day, in life and in business. I participate in outdoor adventures to spend time with my family, but also to learn more about myself when put in unfamiliar situations and environments. In business, I've always challenged myself by taking on new roles, in areas that I wasn't always familiar, to round out my skills and knowledge. Risks come in every form, and throughout your career taking risks could mean choosing lateral moves to learn new areas of your business or simply putting your hand up to take on new projects. Each one will broaden your skills and deepen your knowledge while getting you closer to reaching your full potential.
I encourage my team to take risks and collaborate more deeply. To further facilitate collaboration and innovation, I strive to create a platform for conversation by being approachable and exchanging ideas. I encourage my team to be bolder and reach higher. Risks however, don't come without some mistakes, but it's the tuition value of those mistakes that drives innovation. The opportunities that arise to learn, improve and grow are the tipping point of calculated risk. Having this courage to innovate can drive a realization that people actually have better judgment than what they think. We too often assume something will go wrong, or exaggerate the consequences.
Remain true to yourself
One of the reasons I think I've been successful is that I've worked at a company that has supported my ambition and has thrust me into new opportunities to push my boundaries and reach new heights. You'll quickly realize it if you're not aligned with a company that has similar values. A supportive corporate culture that embraces the needs of motivated individuals by providing an environment of constant challenge and change avoids running the risk of stagnation. I remained true to myself in that I knew I needed this type of environment to be successful. If you're a future female leader who wants to have it all, personally and professionally, look for a progressive corporate culture that supports leadership development, fosters innovation and encourages flexible work options so you can stay true to yourself - I truly can't imagine working any other way.
Although society seems to be shifting to accommodate the professional woman who also has a family, we still have a ways to go in engendering workplace cultures that value work-life balance. As you strive to achieve your goals, alignment with a company that enables self-managed work hours, provides exemplary benefits and, where possible, provides child care opportunities, will set you up to achieve greater success.
As a leader myself, I recognize that there's a need for more transparency about the challenges and barriers that women still face in advancing their careers. I seek out opportunities to step in and provide mentorship and programs that champion the pursuits of our young leaders and embrace their passions. It's only by recognizing the needs of our future female leaders and providing them with the support they need to remain true to themselves, we will build a stronger, more empowered and engaged workforce.

Why You Should Care That Tim Cook and Michael Sam Are GayHave you heard the news that Apple CEO Tim Cook is gay? Are you thinking, "OK, was anybody asking?" or perhaps more pointedly, "Who gives a flying fuck?"? Then this blog post is for you!
First, I have two guesses about who you are:
You are not gay.
You have not dealt with scores of people assuming that you, a straight person, are gay.
How could I be so presumptuous? Actually, it's easy:
If you were gay, you would understand the importance of coming out.
If you were straight but people were constantly assuming that you were gay, you would understand the importance of coming out.
I'm being snarky, I know. It's just that I get frustrated when I hear people criticize public figures for making announcements about their sexuality with sentiments akin to "I didn't ask, and I don't care." There was a whole lot of this when Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by the NFL, came out prior to draft day.
To be fair, the media made a ridiculous spectacle out of this story. Even I got tired of hearing about whether he would get chosen by a team and what that might or might not reveal about the NFL, but that was the media's doing, not Sam's.
Which brings me to the reason I get so frustrated with people who feel that Sam and Cook didn't need to make announcements about their sexuality. You see, there's this thing that happens to gay folks who don't fit the general stereotypes (i.e., the shaved-headed butch for women, and the dramatic, gesture-prone hairstylist or interior designer with a propensity for lilting Ss for men.) The thing that happens is that people assume we're straight. I know because it happens to me, and I am neither particularly butch nor girly.
Which leads to my next question : If it happens to me, how often do you think it would've happened to a guy like Michael Sam? I can tell you how often: all the time. And each time it happened, Sam would've had to make a split-second decision to either correct the inaccuracy or keep quiet. My friend's wife, who is a very feminine, Hilary Swank-looking lesbian, has to make this decision when her real-estate clients see the rock on her ring finger and assume that she has a husband at home. If she chooses to correct them, she might lose their business or face hostility, but if she chooses to keep quiet, things can get tricky.
Tricky how, you might ask? Well, imagine that you are conversing with someone and the person assumes that you live in a box. You do not, in fact, live in a box. You live in a house, but you don't correct the person because, well, there are lots of people who don't look kindly on houses, and besides, you had this same conversation yesterday with someone else, and you just don't feel like doing it today. The next thing you know, the person begins asking you questions about the box you supposedly live in: Where did you get it? How do you like it? How long have you lived there? Do you and the box want to have kids? (OK, that last one only makes sense if the box is a husband, which it is in this analogy.)
So, while it may be true that you personally never asked whether Michael Sam was gay, the odds are that most people who looked at him would've assumed he was straight, which means that his options were to either come out or to live with droves of people presuming his heterosexuality. Can you imagine how many questions he'd have to answer about his box?
When I came out to my mother many years ago, she struggled with the news for a time. She was afraid for me, afraid of what I might face if I lived openly. At one point she told me that I ought to keep the details of my "personal life" to myself. My sexuality was my business, nobody else's, she said.
In response, I asked her when was the last time she'd casually mentioned my father in a conversation. She did it all the time. "Nick and I went to the movies this weekend," she might tell a co-worker on a Monday morning. Did she realize that she was talking about "her sexuality" every time she mentioned her husband? Of course not, because she was merely talking about her life, which is, like, a thing that people do, in case you hadn't noticed.
In a perfect world, we wouldn't need labels -- straight, gay, bi, queer, trans -- at all. Instead, people would just be people, but that's not reality. We live in a world where individuals size each other up and make assumptions. As long as this continues, coming out is going to remain a necessity, especially for public figures.
If you yearn for the time where people announce that they are gay and no media outlet is interested in running the story because, yawn, who cares, guess what: You're not alone. Plenty of gay people yearn for that time too. Michael Sam and Tim Cook probably yearn for that time. I know I do, but we aren't there yet.

Meritocracy in the Modern Worldreddit
What distinguishes high achievers from the rest of the pack?
Malcolm Gladwell, the best-selling author, sought to answer this question in Outliers: The Story of Success. One essential ingredient, he argued, is intellectual courage - the ability to stand up for what you believe in, no matter what the perceived consequences. Willingness to heed that inner voice, with confidence and conviction, is a shared characteristic of successful people, he concluded.
To illustrate the unique power of this wholly human attribute, Gladwell drew on a popular theory about the root cause of Korean airliner crashes in the 1980s and '90s. In one such crash, a plane deviated from its course in heavy clouds and flew straight into a mountain. There were no survivors. Cockpit records later suggested that the young co-pilot knew the plane was off course, but said nothing because he was unwilling to contradict the captain, who was steering the plane.
Intellectual honesty is easy when nobody is watching. But as that young co-pilot so tragically experienced, it's a lot different when you have an actual audience - particularly if that audience happens to be your boss.
I raise this story to make a larger point: Many companies today don't foster environments that encourage employees to freely speak their minds. Instead, more times than not, companies make it clear that the only opinions that truly matter are those of senior managers. In that sort of environment, people who are lower on the corporate ladder tend to be reluctant to step forward and express an opinion, or share a creative idea. Not because they don't want to; because they feel they can't.
This is especially true in the Middle East, where I am from. Here, corporate cultures are infused with a number of influences - some are helpful to growing organizations; others, not so much. One example of the latter is the practice of using a family name or personal connections to drive career advancement. Known regionally as "wasta," it's a robust and highly subjective form of favoritism that grants special treatment to family as well as non-family members - virtually anybody can take advantage. In our part of the world, I'm sorry to say, wasta is age-old, and rampant.
To be clear, wasta is not about hierarchy; it's about personal achievement, and how an employee experiences that: through family connections or personal clout (wasta) or through hard work and true merit (non-wasta).
To the American ear, "wasta" probably sounds an awful lot like "waste," and in practice, I will tell you candidly, there are a number of similarities. Those who use their wasta to secure jobs often feel they don't have to work very hard. Wasta hires expect and routinely receive promotions, even if they've done little - or even nothing - to earn the reward. Non-wasta hires bear witness to all this, of course. The net result of bifurcating workforces like this is exactly what you'd expect: morale suffers, along with productivity and financial performance. Companies are the biggest losers, by far, because they never get to benefit from the insights, ideas and creative energy that a properly hired and incented workforce can deliver.
Simply put, wasta is a waste - of energy, ideas and human capital.
All businesses have hierarchies, of course - without order, there is chaos. But some hierarchies are more rigid than others. The danger for employees stuck in stricter environments is that they actually become accustomed to not speaking up. As result, they're not willing to share ideas, or talk openly about problems or opportunities they see that may not be apparent to senior management. Red flags all around: When pecking order - not the quality of ideas - is the main driver of a business, the creative flow skids to a halt. Layer on wasta, and the whole ship basically sinks. Businesses, as always, are the biggest losers.
At my company, Alghanim Industries, we don't engage in wasta. We have a hierarchy, of course. But the environment around the pecking order is, by strategy and design, nurturing and encouraging. We don't expect intellectual or creative deference from anybody. Quite the contrary, we encourage our people at all levels - from the most junior on up - to freely express their opinions. Ideas are weighted and considered according to their merit, not on the basis of who offered them.
We also welcome constructive criticisms. If Alghanim Industries is missing the boat on something we want to hear about that right away. Likewise, if somebody has an idea about how we can work better, smarter or more profitably across our portfolio - we have more than 30 businesses in 40 countries, and are continuing to grow our footprint - we want to hear about that, too. As in right now. Not tomorrow or next week - now.
You don't get that sort of feedback if you're strangling employees with hierarchy and wasta. You get that by hiring the best people you can find, and then fostering an environment that allows those same employees to soar like eagles.
Why do we put so much effort into this? One simple reason: It's good for business.
At Alghanim Industries, we don't affix a bright line between junior and senior staff - we believe in the power of fresh thinking, no matter where it comes from. In other words, we are a meritocracy. In practice, that means we encourage employees at all levels to think, create and collaborate - freely, openly and without artificial restrictions. Promotions aren't conferred; they are earned.
And that, ultimately, is what a true meritocracy is all about: Allowing people to work their way up the career ladder on the basis of conviction and contributions, not who you happen to know or be related to by birth. Engaging in wasta, I would add, runs directly counter to a meritocracy; the two are inherently at odds.
Some of our peers in the Middle East have difficulty comprehending this concept: Why would we allow, much less encourage, intellectual independence in our workforce, especially among younger employees, they want to know. As for promoting and rewarding on the basis of merit, not blood or social connections - what's the point?
And this is what I tell them: Age does not necessarily equate to infallibility. Nor does experience - just because you've been at it for 20 or 30 years does not mean you have all the answers. Family is at the heart of life in the Middle East, and plays a big role in my own life, I would add. But family names are meant to be honored, I believe - not used as base currency in service of career advancement.
In my world, intellectual honesty is the key - to everything. I believe there is no honor, or business benefit, to asking employees to simply accept directives and soldier on. That sort of iron-fisted management, in my view, can only serve to crush spirits as well as creativity. I believe that any business is only as good as its people, which is why we, at Alghanim Industries, spend so much time cultivating a culture that celebrates, promotes and rewards the best and brightest. We ask a lot of our people, yes. But we also offer something in return: the chance to stand tall and make a difference, and get rewarded in the process.
That brings me back to where I started: Malcolm Gladwell and his theories about what makes for successful people. He argued in Outliers that intellectual courage is critical to long-term personal success. I believe that same characteristic is also essential to success in business. Whether you're building a new business from the ground up, or adding value as part of a management team in an established enterprise, intellectual courage - which is really another way of referring to an individual's willingness to heed his or her inner voice - is a fundamental driver of long-term success. My view is informed by what I have personally experienced, and observed, for the entirety of my business life.
I also believe this: A questioning spirit is at the heart of innovation. If properly encouraged and nurtured, this uniquely human quality can lead to some pretty amazing outcomes. The iPhone didn't wow the world because Apple engineers and designers were following the pack; it steamrolled because they had the courage to re-imagine the status quo. And they clearly had support of management to defy convention, otherwise they never could have pushed the design edge that far. Likewise, GE has built a global reputation as a training ground for future CEOs. It's not that GE is necessarily smarter than other companies when it comes to hiring, but it has truly cracked the code on cultivating an internal culture that inspires, prods and propels people to be the absolute best they can be.
That sort of magic doesn't happen if employees have a muzzle on them - it happens because they have impunity to challenge, create, collaborate and excel. At Alghanim Industries, we pride ourselves on pushing the status quo in our own way, and our meritocracy-based style of management is a very big part of that.

Inventor of Knee Defender insists airlines shouldn t sell the same space twice25
A: Oh God, yes. I have two friends who are engineers, and every week I'd put a few prototypes in the mail to them. They would send back notes, and I would make adjustments. There's an amazing variety of thickness and size of the arms on tray tables. We needed to come up something that would work on most airplanes. I spent a year working on prototypes.
Q: Where did the basic design come from?
A: The eureka moment was on a flight from California to Europe. This woman in front of me was reclining, and she raised her seat to get up, and I saw the mechanics of how the seat worked. The edge of the seatback and the arms of the tray table are two pieces of aluminum rotating on the same axis — it moves like a scissor. If you open the blades of a scissors and put something hard between them you can't close the scissors. I had a compact umbrella and laid it across the arms of the tray table to see what would happen. When she came back, she couldn't recline her seat. I went, "Wow, that's so cool." Realizing this could be fixed was a great moment.
Q: But did you fix anything? Most airlines forbid the product, and it has led to plenty of midair squabbles, some of which have led to planes being grounded.
A: I'm not going to convince you Knee Defender is polite or the right thing. You have your point of view, and I've learned that people have pretty strong views on it. But it's right because it is a solution to a problem that shouldn't exist. If the problem was resolved by the people who should resolve it — the airlines — Knee Defender would disappear. Airlines have a duty to provide a safe environment for their passengers, and passengers have a right to protect themselves from being hurt.
Q: Well, I'd agree there. I think everyone's real gripe is with the airlines for shrinking space on airplanes and making the flying experience so remarkably unpleasant. Do you agree?
A: One would think that in my position I'd be advocating for the airlines to put fewer seats on the planes. I won't say that. They can put as many seats on the plane as they want as long as passengers are not subject to having their knees banged into.
Q: But it's not the right of the person behind me to take away that right. The airlines have already made that decision: When you buy plane ticket, it comes with a seat that reclines.
A: They have given you the ability to recline into the space behind your seat, but they have given me, with my ticket, access to that same space for my long legs. They have sold me that space, and they have sold you that space. The concern I have is that they have essentially sold the same space twice.
Q: That's a fair point that I hadn't considered. But the seats recline, and we all know that. I would argue that airlines offer extra legroom at a premium, and if you don't want a seat to recline into your space, then buy the more expensive seat with more legroom.
A: If claustrophobia is the issue, then buy the bigger seat. I'm not claustrophobic. Why should I have to buy more space?
Q: Because you require more space.
A: I believe the airline sold me the space that my legs consume. You only sort of agree with that. That's where we disagree.
Q: What about just reclining yourself to solve the problem?
A: This was on my list of things I wanted to discuss. Yes, you regain the cubic space you lost by reclining. But it doesn't do anything to change the distance from your seatback to the seatback in front of you. Reclining doesn't change the ability to stretch your legs out. It's just geometry. It doesn't solve the problem.
Q: So how do we resolve this issue? What do you want the airlines to do?
A: Install seats that don't recline. Or they can give us a 33-inch seat pitch again. (The industry average is about 31 inches.)
Q: But you can have a 33-inch pitch. You can buy it for extra money!
A: I shouldn't have to buy more space just to prevent a seatback from hitting me when it reclines.
Q: OK, we're talking in circles now. Let's change gears. As a business owner and inventor, I imagine it must have been gratifying to see your invention come to prominence and become part of the national discussion.
A: It was — thank you for asking. It was exciting to provide something that people wanted. The product has never been advertised. People found it because they thought they needed it. It has helped focus attention on an issue that airlines hoped no one would notice.
Q: Well, they've noticed. And they have forbidden the device from being used on their flights. Are you suggesting that people should use it anyway? That's aviation anarchy!
A: I've said from the start that Knee Defender shouldn't be used to hog space. It should be placed only so that you have the amount of room that you need for your knees. If you take it on the plane and no one notices, then you can use it. If you use it and you're asked to stop, then I would suggest taking it off. You might have a right to recline, but I have a right to do what's reasonable to protect myself from being hit by a piece of airplane equipment. If you use Knee Defender any other way, you're wrong.

Indian UAV maker off to a flying startIndian UAV maker off to a flying start

Local manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles attracts investor interest
New Delhi, November 25:  
Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi blockbuster Interstellar might just have given a glimpse into the future when it showed the film’s protagonist chasing down an Indian-made drone.
Although the country is yet to manufacture large unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) like the ones used by the US in military combat, the first steps are being taken by both the industry and Government.
Om UAV Systems, a company started about a year ago, is one of those aiming for a head start in the business. As one of the companies to get a licence for manufacturing UAVs in India from the Telecom Ministry — spectrum is needed for flying the UAVs — the company has attracted investor interest. The company’s licence is for producing 100 drones.
The other players to get the licence are Dynamatic Technologies, Ashok Leyland, Taneja Aerospace and Aviation, Avaana Software and Services, Basant Aerospace and SasMos HET Tech. But so far only Om UAV has developed its own firmware—software that is specific to a hardware—which will help the company cut down costs.
Ravindra Singh and Atul Khosla, graduates in engineering from Punjab University and batchmates of late astronaut Kalpana Chawla, started out from their own savings and have managed to offer a range of mini and micro drones, primarily used for surveillance.
“We have developed the firmware for our autopilot systems on the drones. Hardly any other Indian manufacturer has this. As compared to international products, ours comes at one-fifth of the cost,” said Khosla, who is Director-Marketing of the firm.
Finishing touches
“Right now, we are perfecting the product, receiving inputs from all the Indian defence forces. We also want some tangible sales under our belt before we accept the funding. Maybe in another six months, we would raise some funds,” said Singh, promoter and Director of the company. Khosla added, “When it comes to funding we are assessing whether we want angel investors or a strategic investor.” Om UAV Systems’ micro and mini drones have a range of a maximum 50 km and are primarily being marketed to various Indian defence forces for surveillance of border areas.
Khosla is excited by the potential civilian uses, but he admits meeting the regulations for such use will take time. The company’s products are manufactured locally.
Being small, the biggest differentiator for the micro and mini UAVs, compared with remote controlled aircraft is the autopilot capability.
“Our products can be programmed easily for the flight route, using the ground station which runs on a Windows-based laptop and uses Google Maps or other such maps,” said Khosla.
The products are being tested by the Border Security Force, the Army and Navy. Khosla said the feedback has been positive so far. “Our hope is to rack up some sales and have them in use,” he said. “After getting a round of funding and having our products in use, we can then look at seeking a licence for manufacturing more.”

Non-food credit growth stays muted at sub-12pctSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Non-food credit, or loans given by banks to companies and individuals, grew at a subdued 11.16% year-on-year, for the fortnight ended November 14, taking the outstanding credit in the system to Rs 61,47,091 crore,  according to RBI data. The increase in non-food credit for the fortnight ended October 31 had come in at an equally dull 11.27% y-o-y.
Meanwhile, growth in deposits came in at 12.16% y-o-y, taking total deposits to Rs 82,53,630 crore. While time deposits grew at 11.96% y-o-y to Rs 75,12,964 crore, demand deposits were up 14.24% y-o-y at Rs 7,40,675 crore.
Credit growth, which had plummeted to a decade low of 9.8% in the fortnight ended September 5, has picked up in subsequent fortnights. With few takers for project loans, however, much of the disbursements relate to working capital. However, several corporates have been tapping other means of cheaper funding, such as the commercial paper (CP) market for their needs. With project sanctions having dropped by a sharp 32% in FY14, demand for project loans is unlikely to be very high this year.
After announcing State Bank of India’s results for the second quarter, chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had observed that it could be a while before demand for credit picked up meaningfully.
Demand for retail loans had been fairly subdued in the festive season, bankers said. With liquidity ample, banks have been lending even to AA-rated corporates at the base rate.
The base rates of most banks are in the region of 10-10.25%. Some firms have tapped the bond market where AAA-rated firms can raise 10-year bonds at anywhere between 9.40% and 9.60%.

WGC ties up with IIM-A to set up Gold Policy Centre inAhmedabadGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
In a first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at development of an effective gold ecosystem in India, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) and the World Gold Council (WGC) on Wednesday announced the setting up of an India Gold Policy Centre.
According to a release, the objective of the gold centre is to develop insights into how the significant stocks of gold that India owns can be used to advance growth, employment, social inclusion and the economic wealth of the nation. The centre aims to conduct research that has a practical application and that the industry and all stakeholders can use.
Situated within the campus of IIMA, the centre is being set up with a financial grant from the WGC and will operate independently. The centre will commence its operations from December this year.
“As part of the initiative taken by IIMA to connect more closely with practice, and in line with our vision to contribute and reach out to industry, the gold centre will provide innovative solutions and insights for the gold industry through cutting-edge research,” said IIMA director Ashish Nanda.
“The research is intended to study the growth and development of the gold industry in India and globally. I am thankful to the World Gold Council for supporting this initiative,” he added.
The move is expected to help IIMA enhance its research environment. The management school has recently been engaging with different organisations and industry bodies to support and encourage research at the institute.
On its part, the WGC also believes there is a need for rigorous research on how gold can benefit our economy and society as a whole.
Commenting on the collaboration, Somasundaram PR, managing director (India), World Gold Council, said, “It is estimated that India holds around 22,000 tonne of gold valued at over $1 trillion. This historic asset can be used to enhance the nation’s prosperity by putting it to work for the economy, creating jobs, developing skills, generating exports and revenues. To develop gold’s potential, we need to understand gold’s role in the Indian economy, through high quality data, insights and research.”
“It is important that the centre is established by a highly respected academic body, so we approached the IIMA to establish a dedicated and exclusive ‘India Gold Policy Centre’. This will be a world class centre of excellence, conducting cutting-edge applied research on the Indian gold industry, providing analytics, data and pragmatic recommendations that can be used by all stakeholders. Our joint vision is that the centre will be the foremost provider of insights into the way in which gold contributes to our economy and our society,” he added.

Ebola vaccine from Glaxo passes early safety testOne shot or two? Many questions unresolved in Ebola vaccine race
By Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland, Reuters
University of Oxford
Scientists racing to develop vaccines against Ebola are trying to determine whether they can best fight the disease with a single injection or with two, a calculation that could determine how quickly and effectively a program can be rolled out.
Administering two vaccines, one after the other, would almost certainly give far greater protection than a single shot against a deadly virus that has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa this year.
8
But it would also make mass immunizations far more complicated in the worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where weak health systems have all but collapsed under the weight of the epidemic.
With the epidemic growing exponentially through much of 2014, the initial focus was on developing a single shot that could be tested and deployed as fast as possible.
Now, however, with disease transmission rates tailing off markedly in Liberia, there is more debate about a double vaccine program that would provide greater protection, even if it might take longer and be harder to implement.
Crucell has had an Ebola vaccine since 2006.

"There is now more and more talk about what can we do to prolong vaccine protection," said Ripley Ballou, head of Ebola research at GlaxoSmithKline, which has one of the leading vaccine candidates.
He still hopes a single-dose vaccine will be of use in the current outbreak, but also sees a need to evaluate the "prime-boost" approach of giving a first shot to stimulate the immune system, followed by a second booster a few weeks later.
Health officials in London and Washington, as well as non-profit groups like the Wellcome Trust that are also helping fund clinical trials, are liaising closely on the best way forward.
"We're trying to decide where it is best to put the money," said one senior government adviser.
A big Liberia trial, involving up to 30,000 participants, will test single shots of GSK's vaccine, a rival one from NewLink and Merck, and a placebo.
Although the Ebola slowdown in Liberia is clearly good news, it means the trial may not see enough new cases of disease to demonstrate the benefit of vaccination.
PRODUCTION CAPACITY
Other studies are starting to analyze the prime-boost approach. Johnson & Johnson expects to start testing its experimental shot with a booster developed by Denmark's Bavarian Nordic "very soon" and its chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, is convinced this is the right strategy.
"It is cumbersome, because you need two vaccines, but it is clear that you will get the best protection, both short and long term, from a prime-boost," he said.
A prime-boost vaccine will be more difficult to make in large quantities, since the booster component from Bavarian needs to be grown in chicken eggs, limiting supply. But past experience suggests it should pack more punch.
Tests of similar two-pronged vaccines in other diseases suggest the booster component can increase immune responses around 30-fold for the production of antibodies and up to 10-fold for the body's own disease-fighting T-cells - two of the key elements of the ability to fight off infection - said Adrian Hill, a vaccine expert at Oxford University's Jenner Institute.
That extra protection may be needed in West Africa, where infection with malaria could also depress people's immune systems, limiting the effectiveness of immunization.
In the end, the wide program of vaccine trials scheduled for the first half of 2015 may yield a variety of options, with some experts suggesting prime-boost may be particularly suited for healthcare workers facing regular high exposure and single shots the preferred choice for rapid containment of local cases.
So far, the only human data on how well Ebola vaccines might work comes from the United States and Europe, with GSK's shot proving safe and showing some efficacy, although not comprehensive protection. NewLink's experimental shot had no serious side effects but caused some mild fever.
With the epidemic still raging, tests are likely to try out combinations of vaccines in an opportunistic way. While their impact may not become clear until later next year, the lessons learned will still be valuable in responding to the next, inevitable, Ebola outbreak.
"This disease is going to be endemic in West Africa," said GSK's Ballou. "It's important for those countries either to have routine vaccination or a stockpile option."

Starting at minus oneWritten by Pratap Bhanu Mehta |
Posted: November 27, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 27, 2014 5:14 am
As expectations for reform soar, it is important to remind ourselves of the nature and magnitude of the challenge. There is much talk about second-generation reforms. But as one smart government official quipped: Forget second-generation reforms, India needs minus-one generation reforms. We don’t even know what we are facing. Political stability, the RBI’s determined effort to fight inflation (despite big business engaging in ideological obfuscation) and changing international circumstances have altered the mood. But the underlying rot is deep. Its surface has yet to be scratched. Too much energy is being expended on reforms that are besides the point, rather than on credible fundamentals.
Just imagine this. Structural regulatory uncertainty continues to affect about a quarter of India’s economy in sectors like mining, natural resources, any investment involving land. This has large indirect effects. There is always some uncertainty and dispute in an economy. But structural regulatory uncertainty basically means that a pricing mechanism has irrevocably broken down. You can have either a market mechanism or an administered price mechanism. The problem is that we do not have either that is credible.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was right to say in Australia that reform by stealth does not work. What it ended up creating was institutions that had neither the old certainties of state-set prices in areas like coal, nor fully developed markets. Add to this the fact that the legal landscape has now become incredibly complicated: The coal judgment, for example, does not just raise questions about the method of giving mining licences; it has implications for federalism and who should be issuing them. But we underestimate this fact. The regulatory web is now so tangled that you don’t quite know what will happen if you pull at one string. This history of regulatory reform in India, with a few exceptions, has ended up muddying the landscape rather than clarifying it.
Two of the most critical sectors for the economy, health and education, exhibit these characteristics. The single biggest mistake of the right to education, for instance, was to muddy the distinction between public and private. Instead of saying let the public do its job and the private its function, we now have a regulatory system than distorts both irretrievably. And now it is proving near impossible to set the system right. The health sector is a combination of laissez faire and half-baked regulatory interventions. And each attempt to reform the system makes it more vulnerable. There is no reliable measure of inflation in these two sectors either, which probably has a greater effect on the rest of the economy than we realise.
All factors of production still face pricing and structural uncertainty. Add to this the quiet chaos in the financial system. The Indian banking system was not good at assessing projects or pricing risk. Or rather, what it was continued…

Cyber Monday
Support your local retailers especially this Saturday, merchants urge.
A blue mat at the Dick Pond Athletics store in Hoffman Estates implores customers to "Shop Small." In Wicker Park, Futurgarb on Saturday will offer 20 percent off its clothing and accessories, as well as cupcakes and mimosas. Across the street, Emma, a clothing boutique, will give customers participating in a Small Business Saturday Night event 15 percent off each purchase.
Tucked between the hype of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Small Business Saturday urges shoppers to take a detour from national chain stores to support local companies.
"We were thrilled when Small Business Saturday came around because we finally got our day in the spotlight, especially with Black Friday giving so much attention to the Big Boxes," said Samantha Pond, general manager of Dick Pond Athletics, which was started by her father in Carol Stream 45 years ago. "Small Business Saturday changes the public focus to small, family businesses like ours."
Dick Pond Athletics made sure to open its new running store in Hoffman Estates on Monday, in time for the holiday shopping kickoff this weekend.

The company makes a point of putting up Small Business Saturday signage in its five suburban Chicago stores, tweets and posts Facebook messages about it and will e-mail about 20,000 customers to remind them of the day, said Pond, adding she sees an increase in sales and traffic volume at the stores each Small Business Saturday. Nick Hurley, co-manager of the Hoffman Estates store, plans on giving "Shop Small" tote bags to the store's first 10 customers on Saturday and has Small Business Saturday buttons and stickers for other shoppers.
The day, launched by American Express five years ago, is gaining momentum, said Janey Whiteside, senior vice president of American Express OPEN, which focuses on small businesses.
As an incentive to shoppers to patronize small businesses, American Express offers a rebate to a limited number of cardholders who register their cards, with a $10 statement credit for a purchase of $10 or more at a qualifying small business, up to $30 with the same card.
Last year, shoppers spent $5.7 billion with independent merchants on Small Business Saturday, up from $5.5 billion the previous year, according to the National Federation of Independent Business and American Express. This year, American Express is piloting a program in Wicker Park, as well as the Nolita neighborhood in New York and Upper Fillmore in San Francisco, called Small Business Saturday Night.
In Wicker Park, the evening runs from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at 19 local businesses. Shoppers can pick up passports at Free Range Office, a co-working space on North Avenue. At every business they shop, regardless of how they pay for their purchases, they'll receive stamps that will allow them a chance at a variety of gift cards and prizes. At the end, a band called Oshwa will close out the event at a party hosted by Jackson Junge Gallery.
Futurgarb, the apparel store, will roll over its Black Friday deal of 20 percent off all non-sale items on Saturday, and in addition to cupcakes and mimosas for customers, the staff will set up The Apuli Brothers to play for two hours in the store window.
"It's an awesome idea," said Linda McGuire, store manager at Futurgarb, whose brothers co-own the company. "Small and local really brings a lot to our community. How can you not like that? It brings people together."
At Emma across the street, "Holiday Sale" signs hang from the mannequins, and deals have already started on some clothing, but on Saturday the store will give passport holders 15 percent off their purchases.
Jenny Stites, a sales associate at Emma, acknowledges that small businesses may not be able to discount as heavily as national chains during the holidays but says "it's really important to support your local businesses. Go shop at your stores, spend the extra 10 percent and let it come back to you."
Caroline Carberry, 35, of Austin, who stopped to buy hats and a tie this week at Futurgarb while visiting her in-laws on Thanksgiving, said she prefers small businesses because of the merchandise selection, atmosphere and sense that her purchases go toward communities.
"I'll support local and small over big and corporate anytime," she said.
Pond says Dick Pond stores offer a level of customization, like gait analyses to fit runners with proper shoes and free community runs, that's often not available at large sporting goods stores.
Stites added that styles tend to be more unique at local boutiques, and she emphasized the importance of warm, personalized service.
"I feel like part of a family working here, and then I feel like I try to spread that to people who shop here, as well," she said. "The neighborhood is an extended family."

Online Grocers Come Up Trumps in India s E-Commerce BoomSpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
Mumbai: Put off by snarled city traffic and a shortage of parking, more Indians are shopping for groceries online, helping e-tailers like Bigbasket.com and Localbanya.com turn in profits while supermarkets are struggling.
The online grocers benefit from low overheads, as they store goods in warehouses outside big cities where commercial rents are sky-high. Some like Bigbasket.com can also charge more for certain items than traditional supermarkets, which means even more profits in a country where all food retailers enjoy margins as high as 20 percent on rice and other staples.
Bigbasket.com director Ganesh Krishnan said the company would turn a profit this year, just three years after it was set up. By contrast, analysts say supermarkets like More, owned by the Aditya Birla Group, and Reliance Industries Ltd's Reliance Fresh are struggling to attract enough customers to make a profit as they compete with the small neighbourhood stores where most people buy food. Both conglomerates declined to give figures for their supermarket operations.
"You can go shop at a Walmart or Tesco in the U.S. and U.K. and they have parking. You can take the shopping carts right up to your car, so it's smooth," Krishnan told Reuters. "In India, none of this exists."
Densely populated cities have proved attractive for web grocers in Asia. Analysts estimate online sales of fresh produce in China could quadruple to 40 billion yuan ($6.5 billion) in five years from about 11.5 billion yuan in 2013.
Overall, e-commerce is rapidly growing in India, fuelled by an expanding middle class and better web access, and the potential for online grocers in particular is huge.
Most food shopping in India is done in cramped groceries that offer limited variety. Urbanites also frequent supermarkets, but e-grocers are becoming more popular as more shoppers are willing to pay extra for the convenience of not dealing with traffic and parking problems.
Sales of food and groceries currently account for more than two-thirds of all retail sales, consultants Technopak say, and the value of these sales is expected to nearly double to $686 billion by 2020.
Investors are taking note. In September, Helion Ventures and Zodius Capital led a funding round that raised Rs 200 crore ($32.6 million) for Bigbasket.com. Rival Localbanya is also looking to raise a similar amount to expand nationwide, its co-founder Amit Bhartiya said.
By running their own delivery networks, and warehousing outside the city, e-grocers are better able to control costs: analysts say the operating costs of traditional supermarkets are higher when you factor in rent and utility bills, for example.
Bigbasket.com, which started out in December 2011, currently has about 220,000 active customers Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. It plans to launch in Pune, Delhi and Chennai in the next three months, highlighting just how quickly online grocers can grow compared to traditional supermarket chains.
"Where brick and mortar grocery in India fails to muster scale, online can do it very, very quickly just by the sheer opportunity of reaching a number of people with much less investment," said Harminder Sahni, managing director of consultants Wazir Advisors.

India-Focused Hedge Funds Up Over 40% This YearFund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
New York: Hedge funds invested in emerging markets have seen sharp declines this year, led by Russia and Latin America, but India stands out as a bright spot.
Industry data tracker HFR said declines in local currencies, such as in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, and falling oil prices have pressured performance.
Hedge funds invested in Russia dropped an average of 8.3 per cent net of fees in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date performance to negative 12 percent, according to data from HFR this week.
Total hedge fund capital invested in Russia fell to below $25 billion as of the end of the third quarter across approximately 170 hedge funds, given the Ukraine conflict, falling oil prices, steep declines in Russian equities and a record low for the Russian rouble.
"Falling foreign currency reserves, higher import costs and lower oil revenue have increased the EM risk paradigm into year end, resulting in greater macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, but also increased opportunity across emerging markets," said Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR.
Hedge funds invested in Latin America dropped an average of 5.4 per cent in the third quarter as the Brazilian real fell to a 10-year low against the U.S. dollar. Third-quarter losses offset gains from the first half of the year, bringing year-to-date performance through October to a decline of 3.5 percent.
The biggest winners so far this year are hedge funds invested in India.

New Delhi, Nov 27:  
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has revised upwards the target for opening of Jan Dhan accounts to 10 crore accounts by January 26 next year. The earlier target was pegged at 7.5 crore accounts.
The revised target would mean that one account will be opened for each household in the country, said an official release.
The Finance Minister has also told his officers that Aadhaar card numbers may also be seeded with the bank accounts.
This will help in directly transferring subsidies to the desired sections of society under the direct benefit transfer scheme, Jaitley said.
Jaitley was speaking while chairing the meeting of the Mission of Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in the Capital.
Till November 18, the number of PMJDY accounts opened stood at 7.64 crore.
Of the total 7.64 crore accounts, public sector banks had opened 6.15 crore accounts, regional rural banks (RRBs) had opened 1.28 crore accounts and private sector banks had opened 0.20 crore accounts.
Jaitley sought the private sector banks' active participation under the PMJDY.
So far, the total deposits mobilised under the 7.64 crore accounts stood at Rs 6,015 crore.
Of the 7.64 crore accounts, as many as 5.74 crore accounts were with 'zero-balance'.
Jaitley urged the bankers to make efforts to raise the deposit level in the zero-balance accounts through a financial literacy programme.
He stressed on the need to ensure transactions in these zero-balance accounts.
Jaitley wanted the dovetailing of various central and State government schemes in the PMJDY scheme, stating that this would
help increase transaction deposits in these accounts.
The Finance Minister also urged bankers to ensure availability and activation of RuPay cards issued under PMJDY.

Sebi rejigs supervision model;stricter checks on high-riskcostGold, silver dip on sluggish demand, weak global cues
To help it better regulate the marketplace and strengthen its surveillance system, regulator Sebi has decided to adopt a supervision model based on risk levels for various market entities including brokers and mutual funds.
Under the new model, various market entities would be divided into four groups — very low risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk — and the quantum of surveillance and number of inspections would increase as per the risk level.
This new supervision regime has been put in in place as per recommendations of an independent global consultant and the subsequent suggestions made by an internal Task Force at Sebi, while taking into account practices followed by many overseas regulators, a senior official said.
The move would help the existing surveillance system take care of most of the smaller offences, so that the investigation resources are utilised more effectively to tackle serious violations in the market place.
The new model would follow four distinct steps — assessing the risk posed by a market entity, assigning ‘risk and impact rating’ to it, determine the supervisory risk rating score and then adopt a suitable supervisory approach.
The overall risk profile of an entity would be computed as a function of two components — business or activity specific risk and the impact risk arising out of default or failure.
The supervisory approach based on risk levels is being implemented in a phased manner, the official said, while adding that the first step towards its implementation has been achieved with finalisation of a report in this regard that provides necessary guidance to the supervisory divisions to formulate policies for supervision and inspections in future.
Earlier in September, Chairman U K Sinha had said that Sebi was working on this risk-based supervision model while becoming the first financial sector regulator in the country to have done a study of its own regulatory impact.
The Sebi chief had further said that specific metrics would be put in place to determine the risk that every firm poses to the system and based on which enforcement actions can also be initiated.
While the existing supervision model followed by Sebi has been very effective, it was found that the approach was ‘loosely risk based’, where no formal risk ratings were assigned to regulated intermediaries and the current resource allocation approach did not allow for an assessment of risk concentration across all regulated intermediaries.
The new supervisory approach is based upon overall risk assessment of the intermediary rather than on individual factors such as turnover, complaints, penalties, etc.
“The total number of inspections per intermediary will increase and the new approach would involve a combination of comprehensive, thematic and off-site monitoring for inclusive supervision of the intermediaries,” the official said.
As supervision is an ongoing process and based on the experience gained, the concerned supervisory divisions can gradually scale up the risk elements as well as the supervisory actions, the official said.
The new model provides for a combination of onsite and offsite monitoring of the intermediaries by Sebi and its front-line regulators.
“The entities falling in high risk group will be subjected to stricter monitoring (offsite) and comprehensive inspection.
“Thematic inspections, as a supervisory tool, will be utilised for specific purposes, such as, verifying compliance with recently issued regulatory requirements, on references received from departments within Sebi and other regulatory bodies, or where a focused review of assessing compliance in a particular area of operations is needed,” he added.
“The supervisory risk rating scores for all intermediaries within the same class or type will be arranged in a descending order and divided into four distinct groups — high risk, medium risk, low risk and very low risk.
“Alternately, the grouping may also be done separately on risk rating scores and impact rating scores. Further, the entities may be divided into four groups equally or based on predetermined thresholds,” as per the proposed norms.
The new guidelines would also provide the procedure for determining the supervisory risk rating score for conglomerates and group companies that carry out multiple lines of regulated businesses.
The overall risk score for them would take into account factors like significance of their businesses in capital markets and the sub-score for each type of business activity carried out by the entity.
The system would identify specific risks posed by different business of an entity, such as credit risk, market risk and operational risk. These ‘risk parameters’ will be accompanied by the corresponding risk mitigating measures, termed as ‘control parameters’, which are mainly systems or procedures put in place to minimise risk.
Similarly, the impact parameters will be identified to reflect risks associated with impact of default or failure of an intermediary on the basis of size of operations of the intermediary, number of active clients, turnover, market share, etc.
The credit risk would take into account loans to group entities or related parties, debt levels, margins-related defaults and other issues.
The risk assessment templates have been developed for various market intermediaries, such as stock brokers, depository participants, mutual funds, custodians, merchant bankers, portfolio managers, registrars and transfer agents, credit rating agencies and investment advisers.
Risk and impact ratings would be assigned to each entity on a scale of 0-4, with zero rating being for those with completed absence of any risk parameters, and a score of four would indicate “Very high risk/ Very low compliance”.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is likely to impress upon RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan the need for a cut in interest rate when he meets him on Monday ahead of the Central bank’s bi-monthly monetary policy review.
With expectations of GDP growth moderating in the second quarter, the government is keen to give a fillip to the economy, particularly, when the inflation has come down to multi-year low.
Sources said Mr. Rajan will make the customary call on the Finance Minister on Monday, a day before he presents the policy.
Mr. Jaitley, they said, may nudge the Central bank chief to lower cost of capital to prop up growth.
RBI, which has kept policy rates unchanged for almost 10 months citing high inflation despite persistent demand from industry and government for a cut to boost economic activity, is slated to review monetary policy on December 2.
Sources said Mr. Jaitley, who is closely watching RBI moves, feels a rate cut will have positive impact on home and auto loans.
In an interview to PTI last week, Mr. Jaitley had expressed hope that the RBI will move in the direction of making the cost of capital reasonable to help perk up economy.
“The cost of the capital must be reasonable ... If you are unable to infuse liquidity or unable to provide capital which is cheaper then even if you have opened out (economy) that itself won’t be enough. So it is a chain of events which has to take place,” he had said.
”...it’s their (RBI) job to balance rates with inflation. I am sure they will do it competently. But the fact is this is the direction we have to take...we are slowly but surely moving in that direction,” he had said.
Inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index cooled to a 5-year low of 1.77 per cent in October driven by softening prices of fuel and food items. At the same time, retail inflation, based on Consumer Price Index, also eased to 5.52 per cent at end of October.

Fund raising via QIP surges to Rs 30 000 cr so far in2014SpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Indian firms have garnered about Rs 30,000 crore through the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) route in the first ten months of this year, much higher than Rs 12,634 crore raked up in the entire 2013.
Moreover, market experts believe that the fund raising through this route is likely to go up further as many companies have lined up with their plans.
According to latest update available with the market regulator Sebi, companies have mopped up Rs 29,582 crore through 33 QIP issues during January-October period of 2014.
There was a large gap between the capital raised through QIPs and funds garnered via other routes.
A total of Rs 4,733 crore was raked up through rights issue, while Rs 1,522 crore mopped up via initial public offerings (IPOs) during January-October period of the year.
Market experts said that return of investor confidence in the equity markets has encouraged some of the large firms to mop up funds through the QIP route.
Interestingly, most of the funds were raised through QIP issuances after the election verdict was announced in May, thus clearly showcasing the revival of investor sentiment, backed by a strong secondary market, experts said.
Among the firms which garnered funds via QIP segment this year included SBI, Yes Bank, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications.
Most of the funds were raised for expansion purpose and to support working capital requirements.
The fund raising was in line with the soaring markets where the benchmark Sensex gained around 32 per cent in the first ten months of the year.

BSE Sensex up 53 pts in choppy trade ahead of GDP data  RBIpolicySpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
In choppy trade, the benchmark Sensex today rose 53 points on the back of gains in shares of BHEL, Hindalco and Infosys ahead of quarterly GDP data release tomorrow and the RBI’s monetary policy review next week.
Besides, covering-up of short positions by speculators on expiry of monthly derivative contracts supported buying activity, brokers said.
The BSE Sensex after beginning higher at 28,397.80, struggled to maintain higher levels and slipped to intra-day low of 28,307.58. However, late buying by overseas funds and retail investors helped the index rebound and close with a gain of 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 28,438.91.
During the session, it touched a high of 28,498.30.
The gauge had gained 48.14 points yesterday.
Easing inflation and falling global crude oil prices, which plunged to four-year low as hopes for output cuts by OPEC faded, raised hopes of a rate cut by RBI at its December 2 monetary policy review, traders said.
Out of the 30-share index, stocks that closed with gains were led by BHEL, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Power, Hindalco, Infosys, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Cipla and Dr Reddy’s.

Dr Reddy s Says US Drug Regulator Raises Concerns About PlantSpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
Mumbai: Drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd has received a letter from the US Food and Drug administration highlighting concerns about its manufacturing plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the company said on Thursday.
Dr Reddy's said it received "inspectional observations" from the FDA after the agency's staff inspected the plant. It was not immediately clear what the observations referred to, and a spokeswoman for Dr Reddy's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The FDA typically lists such observations in a "Form 483", which outlines conditions or practices at a drug-making unit that may cause the products made there to be in violation of the FDA's standard production requirements.
Dr Reddy's said the plant makes drug ingredients, but the company does not currently have any "activity" there. The FDA's letter is not expected to have any material impact on the company's financial results, it added.
Dr Reddy's said it was "committed to" responding to the agency soon and will start implementing remedial measures immediately.

RBI to Keep Policy Rates Unchanged on December 2: Morgan StanleyRBI to Wait for 'Clearer Read' Before Cutting Rates in April-June
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank is likely to hold interest rates at its monetary policy review meeting on December 2 but is expected to lower them by 50 basis points next year, a Morgan Stanley report said on Thursday.
According to the global financial services major, the first rate cut by the RBI is likely to be in or at the latest by April 2015.
"We believe that the RBI is likely to keep policy rates on hold on December 2, we assign a very low probability to a rate cut in that meeting," Morgan Stanley said in a research note.
The global brokerage firm believes that the CPI inflation would decelerate supported by factors like moderation in rural wage growth, further reduction in fiscal deficit, sustained positive real deposit rates, lower global commodity prices and moderation in housing costs.
"We think the first rate cut is likely to be in the February monetary policy meeting or at the latest by April 2015," the report said, adding that "we expect the RBI to lower rates by 50 bps in 2015".
After the first quarter of 2015, the CPI inflation is expected to decelerate to 6 per cent by April 2015, earlier than the RBI's expectation of reaching the 6 per cent mark by January 2016, it said.
"We project CPI inflation to dip to around 4.5 per cent in November 2014 before edging up to around 6.4 per cent in 1Q 2015 as the favourable base effect recedes," the report said.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in the September review left all key rates unchanged citing continued risks to inflation and difficult external situation especially on the geopolitical front.

Cobrapost conducts sting op  says black money rampant in property deals across IndiaTigerair, Axis Bank to offer one-way free ticket from Singapore
At least 35 realty developers have been found to be willing to accept black money in property transactions with many suggesting payments abroad to evade the attention of Indian authorities, investigation portal Cobrapost claimed today.
These included many developers in and around New Delhi (NCR), as also some from other parts of the country including Mumbai, Cobrapost.com said while citing the findings of its 18-month-long sting operation conducted across nine states.
While releasing the transcripts and video recordings of its investigation at a press conference here, the portal said that executives from these companies, including some CEOs and CMDs, were ready to accept anywhere between 10-80 per cent of the property value in black money.
These 35 real estate companies are spread across the national capital, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
When contacted, some companies outrightly rejected the allegations that they accept black money in their property transactions, while a few others said that they have already taken action against the concerned executives.
The video clippings, which the portal said were recorded with spy cameras, showed conversations of senior executives from various companies with a person posing as a representative of a ‘prominent politician’, who was looking to convert black money into cash through substantial cash deals.
The portal said that most of these executives expressed willingness to accept money abroad through hawala channels, including in Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore and the US.
The findings of this investigation, named ‘Operation Black Ninja’, have come at a time when the government is making all efforts to bring back unaccounted money stashed by its citizens abroad.

TOPICS
The Reserve Bank is likely to keep key policy rates unchanged in the upcoming monetary policy review next week and may cut rate only next year, analysts at ratings agencies and brokerages said on Thursday.
Governor Raghuram Rajan will unveil the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review on December 2.
“We believe that RBI is likely to keep policy rates on hold on December 2. We assign a very low probability to a rate cut in that meeting,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.
Domestic rating agency Care Ratings too concurred the view, saying Mr. Rajan will go for a status quo on rates at next week’s policy review, even though inflation is trending down.
“While a rate cut would help to assuage sentiment, the RBI may choose to defer the decision for the next review,” Care said in a note.
Morgan Stanley said the key thing to be watched in the policy would be the central bank’s language regarding its comfort about achieving its inflation target according to its pre-guided glide path, and in turn, the implications of timing of the first rate cut.
The Reserve Bank has set a glide path of retail inflation or CPI at 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
The consumer price inflation is on downward trajectory largely due to base effects and the RBI will see through it.
The CPI inflation cooled to 5.52 per cent for October, a multi-year low considering that it had been hovering at the double-digit mark for a long time. The RBI is targeting to get the CPI at 8 per cent by next January and down to 6 per cent by January 2016.
With inflation coming down, calls for a rate cut have been growing stronger. Those pitching for a rate cut include corporate chieftains as well as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who wants to deliver results on growth.
Care Ratings said the decline in inflation for five consecutive months “poses a strong case” for a rate cut, but reiterated that this is due to the base effect.
Factors like Agriculture Ministry’s forecast of a lower kharif crop output due to poor monsoon will put a pressure on inflation, Care said. The average CPI inflation this fiscal, from April to October, stands at high of 7.4 per cent.
Apart from these two factors, depreciation in the rupee driven largely by changes in dollar-euro combination is also something which the RBI will be looking at, it said.
In the last 15 months that he has been at the helm at RBI, Mr. Rajan has hiked rates thrice citing inflation and has repeatedly flagged price rise as a major concern.
The Morgan Stanley report says, “We think the first rate cut is likely to be in the February monetary policy meeting or at the latest by April 2015.”
During 2015, the report sees 50 basis points rate cut.
The American brokerage expects CPI inflation to dip to around 4.5 per cent in November 2014 before edging up to around 6.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 as the favourable base effect recedes.
“After Q1 of 2015, we expect CPI inflation to decelerate to 6 per cent by April 2015 on a sustainable basis, earlier than the RBI’s expectation of reaching the 6 per cent mark by January 2016 and consensus outlook for Jan-Mar 2016,” the report said.
It said factors such as moderation in rural wage growth closer to nominal GDP growth, reduction in fiscal deficit, lower commodity prices, positive real deposit rates and moderation in housing costs would lead to deceleration in CPI inflation.

Mumbai, Nov 27:  
Notwithstanding the recent bickering between the former allies, the BJP today announced that it will start afresh a talk with Shiv Sena on the issue of the latter’s joining the four-week-old government in Maharashtra.
“From tomorrow, senior BJP leaders Dharmendra Pradhan and Chandrakant Patil will hold talks with Sena leaders,” Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters here.
“It is not only the feeling of BJP and Sena workers, but also that of the people of Maharashtra that Sena join the government,” Fadnavis said.
“BJP also wants that Sena join the government. We fully favour this,” he said.
“We fought the recent Assembly elections separately, but we were also together for 25 years. Sena is also part of our government at the Centre,” he said.
“Pradhan and Patil will start talks with Sena. They have been given full authority to deal with any issue. If needed, they will consult me and the party leadership,” he said.
“I am confident that Shiv Sena will join the State government soon,” Fadnavis said.
So far, there were only reports of back channel talks between Shiv Sena and BJP, but Fadnavis today formally announced that talks will be back on track.
There were reports of a deal being reached between BJP president Amit Shah and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and of Sena likely to get 10 berths in the Fadnavis government, with at least four of Cabinet rank, but there was no confirmation of the same.
In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs, while the Shiv Sena is the second largest party with 63 legislators.

Over 400 ceasefire violations along IB  LoC between August and November: GovtBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: November 27, 2014 6:09 pm
There were 363 ceasefire violations along the International Border and 61 on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan between August and November 17, the government told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
In a written reply, Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said that government continues to take all necessary steps to safeguard India’s territorial integrity and safety and security of people.
He was answering a question about instances of violation of ceasefire by Pakistan during past three months and the response of the governments of the countries to it.
“All such violations are taken up with Pakistani authorities through the established mechanisms of hotlines, flag meetings, weekly talks between the Directorate Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs), as well as through diplomatic channels,” the minister, a former Army Chief, said.
He said that it has been repeatedly emphasised to Pakistan, including at the highest level, the need for it to uphold the sanctity of the LoC and the IB in Jammu and Kashmir as its obligation emanating from the Simla Agreement and Lahore Declaration.
The minister also recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the UNGA on September 27 underlined Pakistan’s responsibility in creating an appropriate atmosphere for a constructive and substantive bilateral engagement, which requires a peaceful environment without the shadow of terrorism.

RBI Releases Final Rules for Payments, Small Finance Banks Licenses

Banks Asked to Cover Jan Dhan Accounts, RuPay Cards Gap
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued on Thursday final guidelines for companies seeking to set up so-called payments banks and small finance banks in a bid to expand banking services to more people and small businesses.
Payments banks can accept deposits and remittances but cannot provide loans. Small finance banks are aimed at lending to "unserved and underserved sections including small business units", the RBI said.
Large state-run entities and business houses will not be allowed to set up small finance banks, which will have to comply with statutory reserve requirements.
Companies will have to apply by January 16 next year for licences in both categories, and the central bank said it would consider more applications at a later stage.

Quadruple amputee undergoes arms transplants  thanks hospital and donors familyBy Amy Ellis Nutt November 27 Follow amyellisnutt
Will Lautzenheizer, a quadruple amputee following a streptococcal infection, received a double arm transplant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. (Reuters)
Last month quadruple amputee Will Lautzenheiser received the gift of a lifetime: two new arms. An anonymous donation had been made to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and three years after losing his limbs to deadly bacterial infection, the former professor of film production and screenwriting underwent a double arm transplant.
On Tuesday, Lautzenheiser, 40, appeared at a press conference in Boston, his arms partially encased in plaster casts and splints, to thank the surgeons, nurses and staff of Brigham and Women's, as well as the donor.
"This person who is anonymous to me will always be as close to me as my own skin," he said. "It's really an incredible gift."
In September 2011 Lautzenheiser was already in organ failure when doctors at a hospital in Montana, where the young professor had just begun to teach,figured out what was causing the severe pain in his legs: Group A streptococcus. Toxic shock syndrome was shutting down his organs and a rampant necrotizing fasciitis was wantonly killing his muscles, tissue and skin. The only way to stop the infection was to cut it out. To save Lautzenheiser, surgeons amputated all four of his limbs, the left arm above the elbow, the right arm below the elbow, and both legs below the knee.
The Massachusetts native never thought he'd hold his partner or his niece or anyone else in his arms again, but last month after a nearly 9-hour operation that involved 45 medical personnel including 13 surgeons, Lautzenheiser was wheeled out of the operating room with two new arms.
"It's life-changing," he said at Tuesday's news conference.
Lautzenheiser had given up his career as a filmmaker. While learning to walk again with prosthetic legs, he began a new one as a club comedian, though because he performs from a wheelchair, he tells audiences he calls himself a "sit-down comic."
Although the donor's family wished to remain anonymous, they issued a statement on Tuesday, wishing Lautzenheiser well:
"Our son gave the best hugs," the family said. "We pray that you make a wonderful recovery and that your loved ones will be able to enjoy your warm embrace."
 

Direct selling sales growth falls to 4.3%economy (general)
Sales growth of the direct selling sector slowed to 4.3 per cent in 2013-14 from 12.2 per cent in the previous fiscal due to issues such as regulatory bottlenecks plaguing the industry.
According to a report by the Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) and the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gross sales touched Rs.7,472.2 crore during the year under review against Rs.7,164.1 crore in the previous year.
“Over the recent years, the sales growth of the industry had registered deceleration. The direct selling industry has registered a growth rate of about 4.3 per cent in 2013-14 as against the growth rate of 12.2 per cent of 2012-13, 22 per cent of 2011-12 and 24 per cent of 2009-10,” the report said.
IDSA Secretary-General Chavi Hemanth said the sector marked a significant decline in its overall growth this year due to regulatory bottlenecks.
Products related to healthcare/wellness contributed the lion’s share of 44 per cent in sales, followed by cosmetic, beauty and personal care (33 per cent), home ware and home improvement products (12 per cent) and consumer and household durables (6 per cent).
Total tax
The report said total tax paid by IDSA members amounted to Rs.1,063.10 crore in 2013-14.
It members include Amway India, Oriflame, Avon Beauty Products and Tupperware India.
Major challenges
Elaborating on the challenges for the sector, the report said, “The first and foremost are the activities of fly-by-night operators, who are operating under the garb of direct selling business. Another big challenge is absence of Central guidelines and regulations for the industry.”

Why Indians Are Investing in US PropertiesYou are here: Home Industries
US Realty Market Emerges as Investment Destination for Indians
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 27, 2014 20:15 (IST)
Banks Asked to Cover Jan Dhan Accounts, RuPay Cards Gap
Mumbai: With the US market emerging as an attractive investment destination, there is a growing interest from Indians to buy properties there, property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) said.
According to a report published by the US National Association of Realtors, buyers from India purchased residential properties in the US estimated at $5.8 billion in value during the one-year period ending March 2014.
This investment magnitude recorded a growth of around 6 per cent over 2013.
The report also said Indians spent $459,028 or Rs 2.81 crore on an average to buy properties across cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Dallas, and New York.
"This is definitely an interesting finding. Indian high networth individuals (HNIs) who have obtained American citizenship and are settled there have several reasons for investing in properties in the US.
Apart from India's long-standing love affair with the country, many Indians who have become naturalised US citizens have business interests as well as families in major American cities," JLL chairman and country head Anuj Puri said in a statement.
He noted that after the steep post-Lehman downturn, countless investors had been able to snap up properties in American cities at unbelievably low prices, and these investments are seeing handsome returns now that the US real estate market is reviving.
The Reserve Bank of India has recently increased the ceiling on outward remittances for individuals to buy overseas property under the Liberalised Remittances Scheme (LRS) to $1,25,000 from $75,000.
"This enhanced investment limit is a small but important window. For example, a married couple can now together buy a small property in a US suburb if they have the inclination to do so. Previously, real estate as an option was entirely withdrawn from the LRS scheme and the limit purview," Mr Puri explained.
He further said that since quite a few apartments in the US are currently held by institutional investors who had bought them during crisis from distressed sellers, it is easy for a foreign buyer to make such deals with such institutions rather than with individual US house owners.

Twitter starts tracking which other apps are on its users  phonesRide-hailing service Lyft launched a new feature called Driver Destination on Tuesday that lets Lyft drivers input a route to a destination and only receive ride requests from passengers close to that route who are heading in the same direction. ( Tracey Lien )
Twitter says it is collecting only a list of the apps installed on the user’s Android or iOS device, not data from inside the apps. That means the company would know you have, say, ride-sharing app Lyft, but it wouldn’t know where you’re being driven, how you pay for the rides or whether you’re using Lyft at all.
A prompt will notify each user before the data collection begins, Twitter says.
To opt out, turn off the “Tailor Twitter based on my apps” feature by following the directions posted at https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172069 .

He s The Only Indian in This  Top CEOs  ListBanks Asked to Cover Jan Dhan Accounts, RuPay Cards Gap
MasterCard president and CEO, Ajay Singh Banga is the only Indian in Fortune's '2014's Top People in Business' list.
Mr Banga, who studied economics at Delhi University's St. Stephen's College and received his MBA from IIM, Ahmedabad ranked number 28 in the list. The Pune-born CEO spent 13 years of his working life with Nestle India before moving to PepsiCo, Citigroup and eventually MasterCard which he joined in 2009.
"Sometimes it's about being in the right place at the right time. For MasterCard, that very well could come in the form of Apple Pay, which may finally break the barrier between consumers and mobile payment. MasterCard and Banga could benefit from increased transactions using mobile phones," Fortune said.
The list was topped by Google CEO Larry Page.
The other Indian-origin person to make it to the list was Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at number 38. Mr Nadella is an American citizen. He studied engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka, before moving to the US to pursue higher studies.
"Financial results, including 12-month and three-year growth in profits and revenues, figured prominently in our analysis. We also factored in company stock performance and total shareholder returns over the same periods. Nonfinancial elements, like business influence, leadership style, and strategic initiatives, played a part in our evaluation as well," Fortune said.
Apple CEO Tim Cook featured second in the rankings, followed by Gilead CEO John Martin, to round off the top three. The list featured the top 50 CEOs of 2014.

India Moving Towards Tax Friendly Regime: Finance Minister JaitleyRBI to Wait for 'Clearer Read' Before Cutting Rates in April-June
New Delhi: With an aim of improving the environment for investments, India is moving towards a tax friendly regime to correct the image which had become "bad" over the years, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today.
"Our tax system has to be friendly with tax payers and that is what we are trying to do step by step," he said, replying to a debate on black money in the Lok Sabha.
Advocating a tax structure which discourages evasion, he said there was a misconception that high tax rates lead to the higher revenues.
"High tax rates do not necessarily mean more revenue collection... The direct and indirect tax rates have to be brought to reasonable level so that the basket increases and there is no incentive for evasion," Mr Jaitley said.
The government, he said, should not lose out of revenues.
"Those who have to pay taxes must pay taxes. Those who do not have to pay taxes, merely by raising demands does not serve purpose as they get stuck up in courts... We cannot allow tax evasion or avoidance,"Mr Jaitley said.
He further said there was a time when India had very high tax rates and the country's growth rate was mocked at as "Hindu rate of growth".
Referring to the steps being taken by the government to unearth black money, Mr Jaitley said government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list and efforts are on to complete the tax assessment by March 31, 2015.
He also said the prosecution has already been launched in several cases, cases would be filed every week, and names would become public.
"When media comes to know it will note that there are influential people in the list (of foreign account holders)," Mr Jaitley said.

NSE offers discount for currency futures  equity option tradesNSE offers discount for currency futures, equity option trades
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 27:  
Faced with growing competition from rival BSE, leading bourse National Stock Exchange (NSE) today announced discounts of up to 50 per cent in transaction charges for trading on its currency derivatives platform and in equity options segment.
Besides, NSE has also announced a liquidity enhancement scheme for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on its indices.
The third major player in this segment, MCX—SX had also tweaked its transaction charges for futures contracts traded on its currency derivatives platform earlier this month.
NSE’s decision comes days ahead of BSE beginning to impose charges for currency futures trade with effect from December 1, after exempting such trades from any transaction levy for about a year.
NSE’s discounts of 30—50 per cent in transaction charges for currency futures trade would also be applicable from December 1 and would continue for two months as of now.
In equity options, NSE will give a flat concession of 40 per cent in the transaction charges levied on the incremental billable volume, or Premium value, above Rs 750 crores in a month for a period of 2 months beginning December 1.
Incidentally, BSE has clocked higher volumes than NSE in equity options segment in some recent days. In currency derivatives, NSE is the largest exchange, while BSE has now overtaken MCX—SX as the second largest player.
NSE said that the proposed discounts are part of its effort to improve the liquidity in the currency futures and equity options segments and to align with the feedback received from the market.
As per capital markets regulator SEBI’s latest monthly bulletin, the turnover of currency derivatives at BSE increased by 22.6 per cent to Rs 1,41,170 crore in September this year from Rs 1,15,127 crore in the previous month.
This assumes significance as BSE began currency derivatives trade in November 2013 itself and it has overtaken MCX—SX as the second largest exchange in this segment with a market share of about 30 per cent currently.
According to SEBI, monthly turnover of currency derivatives at NSE increased by 9 per cent to Rs 2,85,236 crore in September, from Rs 2,61,636 crore in August 2014, while that of MCX—SX fell by 8.6 per cent to Rs 57,590 crore in the same month.
The turnover at the fourth exchange USE in this segment also rose by 14.2 per cent to Rs 9,370 crore in September, over the previous month, making MCX—SX the only exchange to witness a decline.
While the turnover at BSE has almost doubled from Rs 72,000 crore in April this year, in case of MCX—SX it has marginally fallen from Rs 59,000 crore in the first month of 2014—15.
In case of the largest bourse NSE also, the turnover has risen considerably from Rs 1,55,000 crore in April 2014.

SAARC nations sign energy deal  salvage summitDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
SAARC countries today managed to salvage their summit by agreeing to a last-minute deal to trade electricity among them after Pakistan torpedoed proposals backed by India and other nations of the bloc for greater regional connectivity.
Before the SAARC summit concluded here, Foreign Ministers of all the eight countries signed the framework agreement on cooperation in power sector which will ensure electricity trading through grid connectivity but the two pacts on motor vehicle and railways could not be inked following resistance by Pakistan.
Pakistan had opposed the energy pact citing non- completion of internal process but finally agreed to sign it after heads of states and governments took up the matter with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at a retreat session in a resort in Dhulikhel, a tourist paradise near the Nepalese capital.
SAARC chair and Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala announced at the concluding session that three months time has been fixed for according approval to the connectivity pacts which will encourage people-to-people contact and movement of goods.
At the end of the two-day SAARC summit, which took place after a gap of three years, a ‘Kathmandu Declaration’ was adopted which said the leaders recognised that after nearly 30 years of its existence, it was time to “reinvigorate” SAARC’s regional cooperation and “revitalise” the bloc as an effective vehicle to fulfill the developmental aspirations of the people.
Describing the summit as “successful”, India’s External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said there were some “difficulties” yesterday which were resolved in a “graduated” manner.
He said the Indian side returns “satisfied” with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “first successful SAARC Summit”.
The declaration said the leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations and underlined the need for effective cooperation among the member states to combat them.
“They (SAARC leaders) directed respective authorities to ensure full and effective implementation of the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism,” the declaration said.
Thanking the leaders for giving the opportunity to host the next SAARC Summit in Islamabad, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said, “The 18th SAARC summit has reaffirmed our resolve to create an inclusive, just, equitable partnership of peace, development and prosperity under the platform of SAARC.”
“We must adopt a realistic, pragmatic and step-by-step approach towards solution of issues which will open up new channel of cooperation,” he said.
The SAARC member countries are India, the Maldives,  Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan.
The two-day SAARC Summit was attended by Presidents of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.
After the opening day yesterday, the leaders went for a three-hour long retreat at Dhulikhel near here before attending the concluding session.
The summit declaration identified trade as a key area with leaders renewing their commitment to achieve South Asian Economic Union (SAEU) in a phased and planned manner through a free trade area, a customs union, a common market, and a common economic and monetary union.
The SAARC also directed SAFTA Ministerial Council and SAFTA Committee of Experts to accelerate free trade in goods and services in the region by putting into operation simplified and transparent rules of origin, trade facilitation and removing technical barriers to trade.
To facilitate increased trade, the SAARC leaders favoured streamlining and simplification of customs procedures, elimination of non-tariff and para-tariff barriers and smooth and efficient transit and transport facilities.
They also called for early operationalisation of SATIS (SAARC Agreement on Trade in Services) by finalising the schedule of commitments.
The leaders also agreed to strengthen the Social Window of the SAARC Development Fund (SDF) and operationalise its Economic Window and Infrastructure Window at the earliest for effective implementation of regional and sub-regional projects.
Expressing strong determination to deepen regional integration for peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia, the leaders stressed on intensifying cooperation in trade, investment, finance, energy, security, infrastructure, connectivity and culture as well as implementing projects in a result-oriented and time-bound manner.
On the connectivity pacts, the declaration said it was agreed to hold a meeting of the transport ministers within three months in order to finalise the agreements for approval.
“They (SAARC leaders) renewed their commitment to substantially enhance regional connectivity in a seamless manner through building and upgrading roads, railways, waterways infrastructure, energy grids, communications and air links to ensure smooth cross-border flow of goods, services, capital, technology and people,” the declaration said.
“The leaders emphasised the need for linking South Asia with contiguous regions, including Central Asia, and beyond by all modes of connectivity and directed relevant authorities to initiate national, regional and sub regional measures and necessary arrangements,” it said.
The SAARC leaders also directed the relevant SAARC bodies and mechanisms to identify regional and sub-regional projects in the area of power generation, transmission and power trade, including hydropower, natural gas, solar, wind and bio-fuel.
They also called for implementing them with high priority with a view to meet the increasing demand for power in the region.
The eight-member regional bloc directed its concerned committee to engage observer countries into “productive and demand-driven” projects in priority areas, increasing the engagement level with them.

The FSLRC report is seriously flawedThe FSLRC report is seriously flawed
SS TARAPORE
Is that surprising, given that it was caught in the clash between the UPA and the RBI?
November 27, 2014:  
The Prime Minister’s Office has sought a status report on implementation of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) report which was submitted in March 2013.
The need for revamping the legislative framework for the financial sector is undeniable but there are serious hazards in hasty implementation.
The major flaw is that the report is a by-product of open conflict between the erstwhile UPA government and regulators, particularly the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The leitmotif of the report is to scrap all existing financial sector legislation and subject the entire financial system to a single Indian Financial Code, ostensibly to provide for better governance and accountability.
In the process, the report sets out a single organisational structure which is then applied to all institutions. In the process the FSLRC centralises power in the Ministry of Finance.
The report and the financial code go against the fundamental theme of the NDA government of maximum governance with minimum government.
Rather than strengthening and rationalising the present regulatory framework, the report uses iconoclastic fervor to destroy time-tested systems by throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
The approach is “Delhi knows best”, in contrast to Yashwant Sinha’s statement that “Delhi knows nothing”.
Monetary policy framework
The FSLRC report rightly points out that there should be a primary objective of monetary policy and only after this is attained could there be subsidiary objectives.
While recommending the setting up of a monetary policy committee (MPC), the report errs in recommending a seven-member MPC consisting of two RBI executives and five external members appointed by the government.
Moreover, a government official would be a non-voting member with a right to be heard.
It is too well known what happens when ‘Big Brother’ is watching. Since external members would be in the majority, accountability would be diluted.
The FSLRC provides for a veto for the governor which then reduces the MPC to the same status as the present Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy.
If, instead, the Urjit Patel Committee recommendation is followed, there would be three RBI executives and two external members; this would put accountability squarely with the executives. Under such a model there should not be a veto for the governor.
It is essential that there is an agreement between the government and the RBI wherein the objectives are set out by the government and the RBI should have total independence in the deployment of the instruments. The agreement should be put in the public domain and any changes in it should, likewise, be in the public domain.
Public debt management
It is pertinent to recall that the need for an independent public debt management agency (PDMA) was first mooted in an RBI report by the Narasimham Advisory Group on Transparency of Monetary and Other Financial Policies in 2000 and it was stressed that a prerequisite would be fiscal consolidation.
The FSLRC does not think it necessary to undertake fiscal consolidation as a prerequisite for an independent PDMA. The FSLRC envisages that in the management of the PDMA, there would be a member from the RBI.
It is further specified that it would be incumbent on the chairman to ensure that the decisions of the PDMA are unanimous and if perchance there is dissent, the dissenting member would be required to make a written public statement. The FSLRC stance appears to sanctify bullying by Big Brother.
The purpose of an independent PDMA is to separate monetary policy from the government’s debt management and this would require that the RBI’s open market operations (OMO) are not a tool for ensuring that the government’s borrowing programme is undertaken with indirect support from the RBI; such an arrangement would go against the spirit of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.
The OMO of the RBI should be essentially a monetary policy instrument and not a tool for ensuring that the government is able to borrow unlimited amounts at low rates of interest.
The FSLRC proposal would make monetary policy subservient to the PDMA.
Repayments sidestepped
The FSLRC sidesteps the issue of repayment of the government debt. The way the present system works, the government budgets for a net borrowing programme and it is assumed that the gross borrowing would ensure that the repayment would be made. In other words, the government borrowing is a Ponzi.
The Ministry of Finance, on September 30, 2014, set up a task force to work out the roadmap for setting up a PDMA and the work is to be completed in a year.
Since fiscal consolidation is not a prerequisite for setting up a PDMA it would be a sure way of inviting chaos in the management of public debt.
The other recommendations on a unified financial regulatory authority, the resolution corporation, the appellate tribunal and the redress agency need separate examination.

The tax wars of EuropeThe tax wars of Europe
VIDYA RAM
The ‘Luxemburg Leaks’ is a disturbing pointer to the urgent need to check EU’s tax haven conundrum
November 27, 2014:  
Earlier this month, the tiny EU state of Luxembourg found itself at the centre of global controversy as details of the ultra-favourable tax deals it struck with over 340 multinational companies, including PepsiCo, Ikea and FedEx (so far no Indian firms have been named), emerged as the result of what have come to be known as the “Luxembourg Leaks” — some 28,000 pages of documents obtained and analysed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a network of 185 investigative journalists across the world.
While Luxembourg has long been known for its light-touch tax regime, the scale of a system under which foreign companies were able to escape billions in tax dollars, paying as little as 1 per cent tax through Advance Tax Agreements, negotiated by PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the client, was startling to many.
Awkward deals
The leaks were particularly revealing in two significant ways says Professor Ronen Palan, co-author of Tax Havens: How Globalization Really Works. “We now know that the four accounting firms are at the heart of tax avoidance,” he said during a telephone interview. “We have thought they were at the heart of it but here you have evidence of it,” he said.
The “totally unacceptable” revelations about the systematic use of pre-negotiated advance tax agreements to enable firms to be offered effectively near-zero rates of tax in exchange for investment was also noteworthy, says Professor Palan.
The Lux Leaks have proved particularly awkward for Jean Claude Juncker, who took over as president of the European Commission at the start of November. Many of the “comfort” agreements had been struck during his tenure as prime minister of Luxembourg between 1995 and 2013.
Could a leader who had helped companies cut their tax bills at the cost of other sovereign states — and to the benefit of Luxembourg’s coffers — be the right person to lead the EU, a region where many states remain under pressure to maintain tough austerity regimes while facing high levels of unemployment and faltering growth?
Luxembourg has undoubtedly benefited from its attractiveness to MNCs — the OECD estimates that the 500,000-person strong state has the highest economic output per capita of any country in the world — at $112,473 a person in 2013 (Britain’s, for example, is less than half this figure).
It is all the more awkward for Juncker, who, according to the ICIJ, pledged to put “some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape,” in a speech in July before he took over the presidency.
“Europe’s problem is that states such as Luxembourg have put tax competition at the heart of their growth strategy,” says John Christensen, director of the international research and advocacy group, the Tax Justice Network Ltd, who argues that “war” rather than “competition” is a more accurate description. “These are tax wars where one county is using its tax sovereignty to undermine the tax sovereignty of another.”
He points out that this undermines the premise the European project. “The whole purpose of regional free trade areas is to allow capital to move to where it is most productive but here capital is being subsidized to move to where tax conditions are most favourable.”
Just can’t control
The Lux Leaks have also highlighted the current limitations on the EU’s ability to challenge the growth of what are effectively tax havens in its midst. The EU’s powerful economic and financial reach does not extend to the taxation of individuals and corporations, over which power remains in the hands of domestic governments — and there are no rules that could curb a state’s ability to attract investment from overseas through a favourable tax regime.
While a Code of Conduct for Business taxation was set out in 1997, encouraging member states to roll back existing “harmful tax competition” measures and refrain from bringing in new ones, it is non-binding and has done little to restrain from governments from acting solely in national interests.
The most powerful tools that the EU has to tackle sweetheart tax deals are those that enable it to curb state aid: while the EU permits state aid in certain situations (for example it allowed some states to help out banks in deep trouble during the financial crisis) it is mostly illegal for countries to use “taxpayer-funded resources to provide assistance to one or more organisations in a way that gives advantage over others.”
It is currently using its state aid rules to investigate tax agreements struck between Ireland and Apple, the Netherlands and Starbucks and Fiat Finance and Luxembourg. Whether its inquiry will be extended in the wake of the latest Luxembourg revelations remains to be seen.
There have also been measures to bring in transparency, particularly when it comes to the taxation of individuals. Earlier this year, Luxembourg and Austria agreed to join in the scheme for the automatic sharing of information on interest income across the region, set up over a decade ago.
For transparency
There are moves to increase the transparency for corporates too, though, as Palan points out transparency will only change matters to a limited degree, given that often companies are only too willing to accept that they use loophole, pointing to the fact that they are entirely legal.
While Europe does not have a monopoly on tax havens, tackling those within it is particularly important in the global battle for tax justice, given the huge advantages EU membership bestows on such states and their ability to attract funds.
Palan points out that states such as Luxembourg offer the political stability that many look for (and which many tiny island tax havens may lack) as well as the externalisation of costs for matters such as currency or security. Crucially, as the case of Juncker has shown, it gives them a powerful voice globally in determining tax policy.
Still campaigners for change are optimistic. Christensen points to progress such as the Netherland’s decision to review its double taxation agreements with developing nations following criticisms that these often enabled companies to avoid tax, as an example of the impact public pressure can have and is having.
“The gradualist approach of organisations such as the G20 and the EU have so far failed — and anger is increasing — not just about the lack of investment but the skewing of growth and massive concentration of wealth. The political pressure for change is huge,” he says.

Needed  a Saarc financial market platformNeeded, a Saarc financial market platform
Gopal K Agarwal
Fitting in: A common front would be good for regional economy GrAl/shutterstock.com
This will create a regional financial hub and is a win-win for governments, investors and intermediaries
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation was set up in 1985 with the belief that cooperative action among the member countries would usher in an era of shared prosperity.
Thirty years down the road, it is now widely accepted that Saarc has failed to achieve the objectives for which it was set up as a result of which the organisation does not carry much heft at the international level. This, however, is expected to change with the current government’s focus on its immediate neighbourhood, most importantly Saarc. It is believed that India will lead the charge to change the organisation’s hitherto insipid performance.
Economic integration between member countries is a prerequisite for a strong and vibrant Saarc. Not much headway has been made in intra-regional trade despite the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta) and South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (Sapta). Intra-regional trade hovers at around 4-6 per cent. It is in this context that the ‘Integrated Financial Market Platform for Saarc Countries’ is important.
This needs initiatives on several fronts, the first and foremost being the creation of an integrated financial market platform. This initiative has to be taken up at the government level. As the name suggests, the Integrated Financial Market Platform would be an exchange where companies of the member countries would list their shares. The platform would provide companies an option to reach out to a much larger number of potential investors and provide them with a more diversified stock owning option.
Facilitating flow
India has the most sophisticated financial market in the Saarc region with world class regulation and effective compliance. The markets of other member countries are plagued by a multitude of problems, lack of liquidity being one of them. An integrated platform would enable investors to invest in their own domestic companies with less risk as the shares would be more liquid and the listed companies better regulated.
This set-up would have its own independent trading, clearing and settlement platforms, professional management and risk management practices. It would facilitate easier intra-regional flow of capital.
India manages to attract significant foreign portfolio investments, but the accruing to India from the proposed platform would not be any less compared to other member countries. Therefore the initiative has to be looked at through a politico-strategic prism too. The platform would necessitate a settlement mechanism which might lead to the emergence of the Indian rupee as a preferred mode of transaction in the Saarc region.
Other Saarc countries not only have a small financial market, they are poorly regulated as well. Harmonisation of regulatory standards and uniformity in enforcement of rules and regulations would benefit these countries greatly. The purpose of the platform would be to make the capital market of member countries more efficient and serve their development needs more effectively.
Combined clearing, settlement and risk management corporations can be promoted, with equity participation by member countries. Here the role of the regulator and self-regulatory organisation (SRO) of the respective countries is very important, including the central banks. They can also form part of the equity ownership of these corporations.
A federation of market intermediaries association, that is, the South Asian Securities Association (SASA) needs to be created. SASA would be a federation of brokers’ associations in the member countries. It would formalise and institutionalise a process of interaction among members to share best practices and try to achieve harmonisation of rules and regulations pertaining to their sector. The sector regulators would meanwhile enter into an agreement with one another to recognise a market participant registered in any member country to be eligible to participate in any other member country and in this integrated trading platform.
Special economic zone
To give further fillip to the concept, a special economic zone can be set up in India, developed on the lines of Global Financial Hub, housing offices and all intermediaries such as brokers, banks, exchanges, regulators, corporations and technological infrastructure for connectivity, technology, software and hardware vendors, and so on.
This will lead to several beneficial outcomes, including harmonisation of regulatory standards, rules and regulations, a freer flow of capital and investment among member countries and doing away with compulsory registration/licensing of financial market participant in order to operate in a member country.
It will also lead to an increase in financial intermediation, increase in the saving ratio, development of niche financial markets, lower cost of borrowing for companies and governments, and will provide investors with wider investment options both in terms of number of products and risk-return profile. Other benefits include increased financial literacy, specialised financial product development and sharing of knowledge and expertise.
Challenges include overcoming the fear of capital flight from smaller countries to better regulated and better managed financial markets, and opposition to an integrated platform from vested interest profiteering from the current fragmented and inefficient market. Managing currency settlements will also need to be suitably worked out.

Strict watch on CP fundsBusiness Line: Twenty years ago today
Strict watch on CP funds
Tweet
The Reserve Bank of India is considering strict monitoring of end-use of money that is raised by different companies by floating commercial paper (CP), according to banking sources. A similar monitoring is also believed to be in the offing to ensure proper utilisation of bridge loans by commercial banks. The RBI, it might be noted, has already clamped restrictions on bridge loans to finance companies… it is certain that the RBI will not allow money being raised by way of CP or provided by way of bridge loans to be utilised for unproductive or speculative purposes and thus fuel inflation.
TPL plans to enter insurance sector
Tamil Nadu Petroproducts Ltd (TPL), a company of the M. A. Chidambaram group, is planning to enter the insurance sector and the business of refining petroleum. The company is seeking shareholders permission to enhance authorised share capital from the present Rs. 100 crores to Rs. 200 crores, and also to buy back its own shares when the law permits the companies to do so.
Cellular tenders may be clubbed with basic services
The Ministry of Telecommunications might delay the proposed tender for cellular mobile phone service in the 18 telecom circles and club it with the tender for basic service. Though tenders for each service may be treated as independent of each other, the Ministry might bow to the industry’s demand to allow one company to be a total communication provider in an area. This, in effect, means that the company which gets the licence for a telecom circle to operate basic service might also be allowed to be one of the two among the cellular service providers in the same circle.

Global giants looking for investment in mining, says Vedanta CEO
Santosh Patnaik
mining
Mining giants are enthusiastic at the ‘Made in India’ call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and call for a re-look at the approach by the government to various mining proposals to make it self-sufficient in metal consumption, Vedanta Resources CEO Tom Albanese said here on Thursday.
Speaking to this correspondent on the sidelines of a three-day conference of the International Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminium Society (IBAAS) here, Mr. Albanese said the industry was in favour of time-bound action with a comprehensive policy in place to encourage foreign direct investment into the mining sector and encourage value addition to manufacture more import substitutes.
“Mr. Modi’s initiatives have generated tremendous enthusiasm among investors from the United States, China, Australia, Canada and other countries,” he said.
Mr. Albanese, who earlier served as CEO of Rio Tinto, said the controversies over bauxite mining were ‘unwarranted’ as eco-friendly technologies were available to explore the reserves in a sustainable manner. “We want to contribute immensely to the stakeholders by providing job opportunities and developing the periphery. We have the best technologies available and only the best practices will be followed even in disposal of red mud and reusing it,” he said.
By promoting value addition, the domestic aluminium sector, placed fifth in the world, had the potential to grow to $210-250 billion industry, he said, advocating dedicated industrial parks for aluminium complexes.
He said together with 250 billion tonne of coal reserves and rich bauxite deposits in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, the aluminium industry could prevent drain of foreign exchange if value addition of aluminium products was promoted in a big way for aerospace, defence, shipping and other core sectors.
The per capita aluminium consumption in India is only 1.7 to 1.8 kg. “India’s metal consumption is one-tenth of China. If metal production and consumption are increased, India has the potentiality to double its per capita GDP in the next 10 to 15 years,” he stated.

India Post order to boost Ricoh India businessUpdated: November 27, 2014 22:22 IST
India Post order to boost Ricoh India business
Indrani Dutta
company information
The task involves modernising 1.29 lakh rural post offices, which would be automated and loaded with software, enabling these outlets to become vehicles for financial inclusion.
Ricoh India, hitherto best known for its imaging solutions, is betting big on the Rs.1,370-crore order it has recently sealed with India Post, saying that this will propel it to a different league altogether.
Tokyo-based Ricoh Co holds 73.6 per cent of the Indian entity’s equity with the balance being held by the public.
Talking to The Hindu, Ricoh India Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer Manoj Kumar said: “This is the largest ever border for Ricoh global. We expect this to become a reference point for us in other countries.” The task involves modernising 1.29 lakh rural post offices, which would be automated and loaded with software, enabling these outlets to become vehicles for financial inclusion.
He said the major chunk of the business flowing out of the India Post order would come in the first two years although the profits accruing from it would be spread over five years. “The project is close to our heart, and we are keen to do it well. It will allow the rural masses to avail themselves of banking services and also avail of social benefits of the government.”
Pointing that that Ricoh was now projecting itself more as a total IT and imaging solutions company, Mr Kumar said: “Ricoh was now projecting itself as a company which provides the A to Z of IT solutions, which also includes imaging.”
The share of IT solutions in Ricoh’s turnover, now about 45 per cent, would steadily grow, he said adding that the company planned to leverage its strength in offering imaging solutions to get an edge over existing IT companies.
With a Rs.1,047-crore turnover in 2013-14, Ricoh India has now a one per cent share in its parent company’s turnover against 0.1 per cent five years ago. “We are targeting a four time jump by March, 2017,” he said, adding that there was a huge untapped potential in India which was increasing as sectors such as e-retailing were expanding.
Mr. Kumar was here to launch two new products — a five-colour printer and a wide-format graphics colour printer.

RBI allows banks to extend loan against long-term bondsbanking
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday said banks could extend loans to individuals against long-term bonds issued by them. This would “provide liquidity to retail investors who are invested in long-term bonds issued by banks for financing infrastructure and affordable housing”, RBI said in a notification to banks.
However, the RBI said that “boards of the banks should lay down a policy in this regard prescribing suitable margins, purpose of the loan and other safeguards.”
Further, such loans should be subject to a ceiling, say, Rs.10 lakh per borrower.

Wayne Burt scouts for petrochem, power firms
N. Anand
company information
Wayne Burt Capital, a deep value fund backed by U.S. and European PE funds, has set aside a seed capital of $100-150 million to acquire petrochemicals and power plants.
Company officials have short-listed two petrochemical firms in southern and western parts of the country, and a 160-MW coal-based power plant in Tamil Nadu.
Wayne Burt Group Chairman T. G. S. Mahesh said: “We are already in advanced stages of negotiation for acquiring the power plant that has been classified as non-performing asset by the bankers. We are negotiating with the Tamil Nadu government officials and the bankers to conclude the deal. The earlier promoter had already entered into a power purchase agreement with the State Government in 2012. All the approvals are in place. Details will be announced soon.”
Noting that the group had invested over $1 billion in oil as well as gas, petrochemicals and aerospace manufacturing, he said the group was looking for a critical mass to attain Rs.2,000 crore turnover in the petrochemical sector by 2018.
The recently-acquired Cetex Petrochemicals would also register Rs.1,000 crore turnover by 2018, and the group was scouting for one or two firms to fill the gap.
“It will cost roughly Rs.700 crore to set up a new power plant. We are planning to buy it at a lower price. Out of the planned investment of Rs.600-900 crore, a majority of it will be invested in the first buy,” he said.

Cars are the black sheep of the industry‘Cars are the black sheep of the industry’

RE60
Rajiv Bajaj says carmakers have it all wrong on the quadricycle
Since it was first unveiled at the Delhi Auto Expo in early 2012, Bajaj Auto’s quadricycle has become a subject of intense debate. For those expecting to see the ultra-low cost car originally planned with Renault-Nissan, the RE60 was an anticlimax. However, its manufacturer was categorical that this was the best option for those keen on graduating from the traditional three-wheeled autorickshaw.
Some carmakers and two-wheeler companies did not think so and heated discussions followed before the Government gave the go-ahead for the launch of the quadricycle in October this year. However, there have been petitions filed in the courts of Delhi, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh challenging this order which means the RE60 will just have to wait longer before it makes its debut.
Behind the scenes
Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, thinks there is more to the issue than meets the eye. The three petitions are nearly identical to the last letter which seems to suggest that the motivations emanate from a common source. Now, only Karnataka that has to hear the petition which has been dismissed by the other two courts.
“We are hoping for a quick solution since matters can sometimes linger forever. This is an issue that is simple to the point of being absurd,” says Bajaj. From his point of view, the company is creating a new vehicle category that has the potential to do well. “Considering that nobody has any issues with the safety of 2/3-wheelers, I definitely believe the RE60 is a lot safer,” he says.
The constant debate comparing this offering to a car raises his hackles. “The RE60 is not a car just because it has four wheels. To consider this aspect alone is stupid especially when you look at other parameters like weight, size and speed,” Bajaj says.
Four-wheel drive
The RE60 generates about 20hp which hardly qualifies it as a car more so when mass commuter bikes and compact cars comfortably belt out 10hp and 50hp each. “The fact that it has a door, seatbelt and steering wheel does not make it a car by any stretch of imagination, he states.
According to Bajaj, while the RE60 is superior in fuel economy and emissions, the difference lies in the fact that cars need to meet a particular crash requirement (frontal at 50 kmph) whereas this is not mandatory in quadricycles. This is because these four-wheelers are restricted in power and torque with speeds confined to 70 kmph which Bajaj says is more than adequate for intra-city use. By the end of the day, the purpose of a 4-wheeler is distinct from cars in terms of fuel economy and emissions. As he has already reiterated in the recent past, anyone using 2/3-wheelers can move to the quadricycle. “Cars are a different play compared to this puny thing. Crash norms make the car beefier and heavier, affecting emissions and mileage as a result,” he had said.
In his view, Indian 2/3-wheelers are way ahead of European norms in mileage and emissions while the same cannot be said of cars which are some years behind. This is borne by the fact that millions of bikes make their ways across the world with Bajaj Auto heading the list. “Cars are the black sheep of the industry,” he declares.
Stalling tactic
According to Bajaj, people creating this comparison are deliberately resorting to delaying tactics in the hope that they will have their own competing products ready. This, he says, is a classic case of “selfish corporate” behaviour. “At one level, why should my rivals be gracious to give me an inch? I can completely understand this. What baffles me though is why the Government and courts are taking so long on the issue,” he says.
Equally, Bajaj does not understand why the RE60 is not being allowed to operate in the personal space. Once it finally gets the go-ahead for its commercial applications, the company plans to appeal and get this “fallacious argument” suspended. “In principle, it should not be denied to the personal buyer and this restriction must go,” he adds.
And while the company is hoping for the court to quickly give the go-ahead to the RE60 in India, Bajaj admits that it cannot wait forever.
“As much as we would like to see it debut here first, we will have to press the button beyond a point and look for other geographies,” he says.
A brand new market, like Thailand, has shown tremendous interest in the product which could replace its traditional three-wheeler taxi, the tuk-tuk. Both existing and new markets across the world have a lot of potential, Bajaj says.
In an earlier interview, he had said that developing the RE60 was a sign of his credibility and belief that logic would prevail. “I know India is the only nation not to support this project. It is a pity that we have been able to innovate (the RE60) and yet its benefits will be reaped by other countries,” he said.

A weekend in the valley of the White MountainsA weekend in the valley of the White Mountains
S Muralidhar
Picture perfect: The best part of the stretch before reaching Dharamshala was a section of the road that cut through a pine forest. S MURALIDHAR
For a wintry getaway, drive to the Kangra valley
The lure of the mountains is a constant even when the weather is not oppressive in the plains. And there is no better way to fully soak-in the beauty of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas than to head out on a road-trip.
So, earlier this month when an opportunity to drive up to Dharamshala in the Kangra Valley of Himachal Pradesh came up, we naturally grabbed it. For weekend trippers looking to get a break from the noise and pollution of the city, a drive in this lower fringe of the Dhauladhar range in Himachal can be a refreshing break.
To explore the region made famous by the Tibetan settlement in McLeod Ganj, the options include flying into the Gaggal airport, also known as the Kangra airport. But, we chose the longer route up to the hills by starting our drive from Amritsar. And the car that we chose for the road-trip was the Nissan Terrano.
The plan was to clock about 5 to 6 hours of driving including the lunch stop, spend the night at the elegant Taragarh Palace in Palampur and head further up into the mountains the next day.
Starting out from Amritsar airport and weaving through a few narrow lanes on the fringe of town, we quickly hit national highway 15 (NH15) leading up to Batala and Gurdaspur. The highway is perfect for cruising with its wide, well-marked lanes and sparse traffic. On either side of the highway are sugarcane and wheat fields many of them being harvested. The odd-combine harvester moving slowly on the tolled highway is the only irritant on an otherwise easy-breezy stretch of road that extends to nearly 100 kms of our journey.
Highway to bliss
The Terrano we were driving was the XV variant with the 1.5-litre dCi diesel engine in its higher state of tune. Offering upto 110 PS of peak power with most of it being available from about 3,000 rpm, the Terrano overtakes and cruises with ease on the highway. Later, as we start the climb to Palampur, the ample torque of 248 Nm comes in handy providing enough pulling power to handle the winding roads and hair-pin bends for the two passengers and some equipment in the car. We were up nearly 3,500 feet into the mountainside in a couple of hours.
The next morning, we were up early and with the Dhauladhar mountains peeping out of the clouds behind the Taragarh Palace in Kangra Valley, our expectations for the day were rising too. The drive up to Dharamshala is a steady climb and you cross quite a few narrow bridges, some of which were originally built nearly 100 years ago. These one-lane wide bridges have been built over small rivulets that empty into the Maharana Pratap sagar lake. Traffic is either chaotic or organised into alternating streams of vehicles depending on whether there is a traffic cop or a volunteer at hand to regulate movement across the bridge.
Zen in the air
The air gets crispier and the views become more spectacular as we head up to Dharamshala. The best part of the stretch before we reach town was a section of the road that cut through a pine forest. We drive past Dharamshala, and head to the Norbulingka Tibetan Institute. Set up by the Dalai Lama and meant to be a replica of the original Norbulingka Monastery in Tibet, the one in Dharamshala now attempts to preserve the culture and identity of the Tibetan community that has settled in the region for the past three decades.
The centre is now into teaching, training and preserving the rare Tibetan traditional arts like wood-carving, Thangka painting, appliqué Thangka and metal sculpture work. Also within the compound of the Institute is the Seat of Happiness Temple with the 4-metre tall gilded Sakhyamuni Buddha as its deity. The temple is set amidst a Japanese-style Koi pond.
The rest of the morning was spent savouring baked delicacies at some of the innumerable cafes and bakeries in the area. Carrot cake and quiches are particularly popular amongst the tourists. Later, we set out to drive up to McLeod Ganj and the Terano was put through its toughest test on some of the steepest and narrowest of lanes that we have driven on. We took the shortcut by mistake, but it turned out to be a choice that threw up new experiences.
Once we arrived at Mc Leod Ganj, the town’s main street is so narrow that even the relatively compact Terrano seemed quite big and out of place there. Packed with roadside stalls selling fruit, food, books and Tibetan trinkets, pedestrians rule here, vehicles are usually unwelcome guests. But, the drive up is well worth it once you set yourself down in one of the rooftop restaurants with the snow-capped White range (literally what the Dhauladhar Mountains are called) in front of you, as you dig into succulent momos and hot chai. Now, that is a weekend in the hills you’ll want to experience.

Diesel cars improve in quality  JD Power studyDiesel cars improve in quality – JD Power study
Our Bureau
Tweet
 
In the past five years, sales numbers aren’t the only improvements with respect to diesel vehicles in India – overall quality too, has also improved.
This was stated in the the J.D. Power 2014 India Initial Quality Study (IQS) Study released recently, which says that the number of problems new-vehicle owners are reporting with their diesel vehicles have decreased significantly.
According to the statement, the study is based on the problems that owners might experience with their new vehicles, during the first two to six months of ownership and examines more than 200 problem symptoms covering eight vehicle categories - engine and transmission; vehicle exterior; driving experience; HVAC; features, controls and displays; vehicle interior; seats; and audio, entertainment and navigation. All problems are summarized as the number of problems per 100 vehicles (PP100). Lower PP100 scores indicate a lower rate of problem incidence and higher initial quality.
 The study’s key findings state that the entry compact has seen an improvement of 48 PP100 in 2014, as compared to 2013, while the MUV/ MPV segment has improved by 25 PP100. The SUV segment too has improved by 20 PP100.
The study also takes in owners’ accounts, and 79 per cent of owners who claim to have experienced fewer problems than expected, say that they intend to keep their vehicles for 5 years or more.
As for the owners who got more problems than expected, 58 per cent of them say that they will retain the car for the same period.
The vehicle owners, who face fewer problems than expected, are also more likely to recommend the same car to their friends or families.
The press release also stated that Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai have two models each that rank highest in their respective segments.
The Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 tops the entry compact segment with 97 PP100, and the Maruti Suzuki Swift leads the premium compact segment with 78 PP100. In the compact segment, The Hyundai i10 ranks highest with 84 PP100, while the entry midsize segment sees the Hyundai Xcent on top with 86 PP100.

Shades of India shining: Amit Shah says  extraordinary  Modi govt has made common man s life easierDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Lauding the Narendra Modi-led NDA government for its “historic” and “extraordinary” achievements in just six months, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah today said its government has not just made the life of the common man easier but also laid the foundation of a strong India.
Amit Shah also attacked Congress accusing it of making baseless allegations in its bid to tarnish the government’s image and said a party that had ruled the country for 60 years and “throttled democracy” and “pushed the people towards poverty has no right to question” the NDA rule on its achievements in a short span of time.
Complimenting the government on completion of six-months in office, Shah claimed it has taken many steps to fulfil the promises made ahead of polls.
“The NDA government has made historic achievements in a short period of six months…. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team has made extra-ordinary achievements. Due to steps taken by the government, the lives of common man has not only just become easy but a foundation of a strong India has been laid,” Shah said in a statement.
The BJP chief listed a host of achievements of Modi regime including steps to control price rise and inflation, check corruption, generate employment opportunities and steps taken to bring back black money besides working as “Team India” for taking the nation forward.
He also listed the steps for a clean India, improve infrastructure, focus on rural hinterland and improving life of people there, besides steps taken in the interest of youth, women and the elderly.
Hitting out at Congress, Shah charged “the party which despite ruling the nation for 60 years deprived the country from development, forced the people to live in penury, put shackles of unemployment in the hands of youth, tried to strangulate democracy, the same party is now seeking an account of six months of rule.”
He said “an exploitative, repressive and undemocratic party has no right to ask about the account of six months rule of BJP government.”

Arun Jaitley hints at changes in laws to repatriate blackmoneyDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today hinted in Lok Sabha at the government considering amending the anti-money laundering and Income Tax laws to get back the black money stashed abroad, admitting that there are weaknesses in them.
While making it clear that there was a need for tax-friendly regime with reasonable taxes, he said there was also need to put the fear of law into the offenders.
This could be done by providing for criminal prosecution and seizing of assets in India of those whose money is stashed abroad illegally so that the money comes back, he said.
Dissatisfied with the Minister’s reply to the two-day debate on the black money issue, opposition Congress and TMC members walked out saying the government has failed to fulfil its promise of bringing back the black money in 100 days.
“I admit that there are weaknesses in our law… When the money is caught, we need to bring it back. I know that even SIT is worried about it.
The I-T Act has no jurisdiction over those outside (India),” Jaitley said.
He said there was need for power to confiscate the assets in India of those who have been found to be in possession of black money abroad.
“This can be done through changes either in the I-T Act or money laundering act… I have studied the (prevention of) money laundering act.
There are weaknesses in that also. Probably we have to change that,” he said.
The Minister said the UN Convention has such a provision. “We have to strike fear of criminal prosecution in them so that their money is brought back.. We can continue the political debate on time line for bringing back the black money, but we must understand the procedures involved in it,” he told members.
During the debate, Jaitley also said India was moving towards a tax-friendly regime to correct the “bad” image among investors. In the past few years, India got a bad name from the world of investment that “you are not a tax-friendly regime”.
” Our tax system has to be friendly to tax payers, both procedurally and otherwise. And that is exactly what step by step we are trying to do. The taxation should be reasonable so that the government expenses are met, tax base widened and tax evaders don’t have incentive.
“Those who have to pay taxes must pay taxes. We cannot allow either evasion or avoidance and those who are not liable to pay taxes, by merely raising demand, we cannot generate more taxes. Such taxes then get stuck up in courts.

Hughes’s demise is a tragedy that is so uncommon that you are rendered speechless, writes Nirmal Shekar
Sport is one of life’s most appealing stairways to immortality. Stripped of its tribal context, it is all about life at its resplendent best; all about beauty; all about everything that turns our stultifyingly mundane work-a-day life into something rich with meaning and purpose, something that offers us a chance to soar to the empyrean on the shoulders of gifted young men and women who appear at once immortal and indestructible.
It is because of this that sport is the exact opposite of death; it is because of this that great athletes offer us life-enhancing experiences time and time again.
All of this, despite the fact that as a metaphor death is ever-present in sport — never far away. Sudden death; death overs; life or death game; slaughter of the innocents; massacre of the meek… it goes on and on.
Certainly, sportswriters deal with death almost as often as obituary writers; the difference is that harmless, high-adrenaline, tight-rope-walking, multi-megawatt sporting death is not death at all, but something that contributes hugely to sport’s enduring appeal and its seat-edge thrills.
Yet, there are times when something goes so horribly wrong in sport that you come to realise the sheer impotence of language itself in the face of its monstrosity. The Australian batsman Phil Hughes’s demise is a tragedy that is so uncommon in the entire palette of sporting experience that you are momentarily rendered speechless.
What can you say about a 25-year-old dying as a consequence of doing what he loved doing the most in a non-body contact sport? That it was a freak accident? That it was something that once again reminds us about the hidden dangers of the gentleman’s game? Or, was it merely a case of random cruelty of fate?
Two decades ago, sitting in a quiet corner of a fashionable, upmarket Italian restaurant in London’s West End, a great athlete — one of the finest in his sport, and among the handful of all-time-greats I’ve had the good fortune to know — told me something that seemed to capture the very essence of what I am trying to convey in this column.
“You know why I love this whole bloody business? You know why I will miss it when I retire?” he asked after a couple of glasses of expensive red wine.
He then paused. After a long silence, he said, “The greatest thrill [in playing the sport he played] is in experiencing death without really dying. There is nothing quite like it.”
Riveting spectacle
Of course, sportsmen die a thousand deaths every passing season, and live to tell the tale. It is the very essence of the business of sport, something woven into its narrative; and very often the reason why sport is such a riveting spectacle.
In sport, in different ways, but surely not for different reasons, performers and spectators alike seek ‘death’ and revel in its glory, in the searing intensity of the moment.
This is precisely why, ironically, both the athlete and the viewer are most alive during ‘death’. For death means life at its most exalted level. It is a moment when thoughts freeze, jaws drop, eyes open wide — a moment of supreme wonder when the performer, the performance and the audience are in some sort of communion. It is as transcendental a moment as you might experience in a purely material universe without having to seek recourse to the mumbo-jumbo of the supernatural realm.
And this is precisely why sport has a spontaneity that might be entirely lacking in the theatrical performance of a play. You know what happens to King Lear and Macbeth before it all unravels on the stage. But sport doesn’t surrender its climactic secrets quite as easily.
This is all very well until harsh, brutal reality hits you in the head like a hard hammer blow. For right up until that moment, we have been living in a sort of fantasy world, choosing to keep death — as in end of life — conveniently at a safe distance.
In the end, truth becomes the greatest mortal enemy of the great joy we have been seeking in sport. And what a shattered, deluded lot we turn into once we come face to face with bitter truth!
Then again, ever since the legendary Greek messenger/ runner Pheidippides collapsed and died in Athens in 490 BCE after conveying the good news of the Greek victory over the marauding Persians, athletes and death have inhabited the same neighbourhood, so to say.
“I don’t want my children to become too fond of me,” said the Italian Formula One driver Albert Ascari, world champion in 1952 and 1953 and going for his third straight title in 1954.
“I may not come back some day and they’ll suffer less if I keep them a bit at arm’s length,” he said. He couldn’t have been more prescient. He lost his life on the Monza track a year later.
But Formula One, right up until the peerless Ayrton Senna’s death at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994, had never been a stranger to death; nor indeed extreme sports such as sky surfing, mountain boarding and speed skiing.
“Motor racing is dangerous. But what is danger?” asked the Formula One driver Mike Hawthorn in 1958.
“Climbing a mountain is dangerous. Crossing a road is dangerous. One cannot frame regulations to make everything safe,” he said philosophically. He died a few weeks later on track.
Different ball-game
But then, cricket is a whole different ball-game and death might have been the last thing on Phil Hughes’s mind when he stepped out of the pavilion at Sydney on Tuesday.
Yet, it is time now to acknowledge that not even cricket is as safe a sport as we might have imagined it was 72 hours ago.
RIP Hughsey.

WTO clinches first global trade deal in its history: easier customs rulesComments
Ending months of deadlock, the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday ratified a global deal to ease customs rules, making it the first agreement in the multi-lateral trade body’s history.

The deal was adopted by 160 member countries barely a fortnight after India and the United States resolved a major dispute over food subsidies, paving the way to remove a major irritant in adopting the trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make global trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
The agreement means the WTO will introduce new standards for customs checks and border procedures. Proponents say this will streamline the flow of trade around the world, adding as much as $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the world economy.
“It’s all agreed,” a WTO official said outside the closed-door WTO meeting in Geneva.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future on “uncertain ground.”
India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains would be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But due to the manner in which the support is calculated at prices of nearly three decades ago, many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
India said this would affect its food security programme and food grain procurement through minimum support prices.
As part of the agreement, till such time the WTO members find a permanent solution on a formula to cap food stockpiling by government agencies for welfare schemes, no punitive measures will be pressed on countries for breaching the subsidy cap.
The roadmap for a permanent solution is expected by next year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama’s personal intervention had helped India and the US resolve the row and get moving on the talks, US Trade Representative Michael Froman said earlier this week.
The reform package adopted on Thursday was agreed at a WTO meeting in Bali last December.

  Will Introduce GST Bill in Current Parliament SessionBanks Asked to Cover Jan Dhan Accounts, RuPay Cards Gap
New Delhi: Government will bring the much- awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, in the current session of Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday.
He also said the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) was under the consideration of the government but did not say when it would be brought to Parliament.
Replying to a debate on black money in the Lok Sabha, he said the meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on the Goods and Services Tax will be called soon.
"As far as GST is concerned we have arrived at broad consensus, there are some issues. The next meeting of the Empowered Committee has been called very shortly," he said.
He, however, did not elaborate on the pending issues.
"I am confident that we will try and arrive at a consensus and possibly introduce Bill in this session itself. That's my endeavour and I hope I succeed," Mr Jaitley said.
The government proposes to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related with the new indirect tax regime.
The GST aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as state level.
On the DTC, the Finance Minister said the code was drafted by the previous UPA government and is under consideration of this government.
"DTC is under our consideration," he said.
DTC proposes to overhaul of the six-decade old Income Tax Act in its present shape and make tax system simpler.
The draft DTC has undergone many changes since being first proposed by the then Finance Minister P Chidambaram in 2009.
A Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance made further changes and suggested income brackets of Rs 3-10 lakh, Rs 10-20 lakh and Rs 20 lakh and above that should be taxed at 10, 20 and 30 per cent respectively.
On corporate tax, it recommended that the rate be retained at 30 per cent.

Supreme Court Nod to DLF for Rs 100 Crore Deposit Towards Rs 630 Crore Fine
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 27, 2014 23:23 (IST)
SpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
New Delhi: Real estate major DLF was on Thursday allowed to deposit Rs 100 crore towards Rs 630 crore fine slapped on it by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for allegedly resorting to unfair business practices.
A bench headed by Justice A R Dave allowed the request after DLF's counsel said, "We will deposit Rs 100 crore more today with the Registry".
Earlier, the company had deposited Rs 50 crore as per the August 27 order within three weeks. The court had said the Registry will be at liberty to invest it in any of the nationalised banks.
DLF has also moved the apex court last week expressing difficulty in meeting the November 26 deadline to deposit Rs 630 crore as a pre-condition to entertain its appeal.
It had sought six months' time to comply with the direction. But the bench asked it to deposit Rs 50 crore within three weeks and the rest Rs 580 crore in the next three months, that is before November 27.
The DLF's application will come for hearing tomorrow.
The real estate company has sought more time for depositing rest of the amount claiming that it was in serious financial difficulty, which was aggravated by SEBI's decision to ban the company and six of its senior officials from accessing the capital markets for three years for an alleged non-disclosure in the 2007 IPO filing.
DLF has offered to pledge land in lieu of the outstanding amount and said its land would remain pledged till it deposited the money in the apex court's registry.
The apex court on August 27 had said the total amount should be deposited within three months with its Registry pending the outcome of the appeal filed by DLF against May 19 order of Competition Appellate Tribunal upholding the penalty of Rs 630 crore imposed by the CCI.
The bench had said so far as the interest on the amount was concerned it has to be determined as per the November 9, 2011 order of the CCI that was fixed at 9 per cent.
It had also directed DLF to file a fresh undertaking that in the event of dismissal of the appeal it will pay such amount as directed by the court.
The apex court had adjourned the hearing by admitting DLF's appeal in which Haryana government, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) are parties along with the residents' association on whose plea the competition watchdog had imposed the penalty on the company.
The CCI in 2011 had found DLF violating fair trade norms and imposed a fine of Rs 630 crore on it following a complaint by Belaire Owners' Association in Gurgaon.
It was in May 2010 that the buyer's association had complained against DLF.

Khaitan & Co has acted as domestic legal counsel to the issue and Dorsey & Whitney LLP acted at international legal counsel to the book running lead managers, the company said.
Ceat on November 24 opened its QIP and fixed the floor price at Rs 930.53 per equity share.
"The floor price in respect of the aforesaid QIP, based on the pricing formula as prescribed under Regulation 85(1) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations is Rs 930.53 per equity share," Ceat said in BSE filing.
Last month, the company said its Board of Directors have approved an investment of Rs 420 crore for setting up a plant for manufacture of 2-3 wheeler tyres with a capacity of 120 metric tonnes per day.
In same month, company has approved an investment of Rs 50 crore for implementing a project for manufacture of speciality tyres (which includes off- the-road tyres) through a subsidiary company.

Software Industry Largest Creator of Jobs: Narayana MurthySpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
Bengaluru: Bullish on growth of the Indian software industry, technology czar N R Narayana Murthy has equated the country's success in this segment with China's emergence as 'the factory of the world'.
He also said that software industry has overtaken PSUs as biggest job creator in the country with about 32 lakh-strong workforce and further addition of two lakh new jobs a year.
"Today TCS, Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro add more high quality and more highly disposable income based jobs in India than any other company has done in the last hundred years," said Mr Murthy, who had founded Infosys with five others in 1981.
"The software industry in India employs about 3.2 million professionals and adds about 2,00,000 jobs every year. Therefore this industry has replaced the public sector as the largest creator of jobs," Mr Murthy said at the Commonwealth Science Conference here.
He recently stepped down as non-executive chairman of Infosys, known as the bellwether of Indian IT industry.
"Such jobs have stimulated the Indian economy in a significant manner; our youngsters buy vehicle, they buy home, they go on vacation, they shop in super markets and they go to restaurant."
"It is estimated that this industry creates three jobs in secondary and tertiary sectors of our economy for every direct job that has been created by this industry," Mr Murthy added.
He said the software industry has boosted the international image of India like no other sector.
"Wherever you go in the developed world there is a new respect for India thanks to the Indian software industry. India has gained reputation as the software development centre of the world much like China's reputation as the factory of the world."
"Many influential authors all over the world have told me that our industry is an important reason for India being bracketed with the enormously successful China," he said.
He also also said the software industry is expected to grow between 12 and 14 per cent during the next five years.
"This is the only industry from India that has introduced innovation in the developed market, no other company from India has contributed something like this to the developed market," Mr Murthy said.
Emergence of Indian software industry heralded a new confidence, a new mindset and a new paradigm in Indian business, Mr Murthy said.
"For the first time in the history of this country in three hundred years the country felt that it had arrived on the international business scene," he said.
Speaking about the industry's contribution to the country's exports and foreign exchange, he said, "Thanks to this industry the country is in a strong balance of payment position in spite of oil prices rocketing."
Meanwhile, Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said science and technology had to be an integral part of the economic agenda for companies to really invest and believe in science and technology as the future of their economic prosperity.
"It is extremely important for us to be serious about it rather than just taking note of it," she added.
Pointing out that regulatory complexity as uncertainty was the big deterrent to people investing in scientific ventures, she said, "This is something we really need to focus on to make sure that the regulatory ease for not just doing business, but to innovate is actually something that we need to focus on."
She also said that there was lack of Intellectual Property-oriented culture in the country's academic research institutes, adding, "This is something we really need to focus on because IP is going to be extremely important in innovation cycle."
The Biocon chief said the way forward is really about thrust on science and technology, making science and technology a very important economic agenda; financial autonomy and freedom to operate for academic research and meritocracy in government research institutions, among others.
"We also need to frame science and technology policy," Ms Mazumdar- Shaw added.

Despite controversy  Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel calls the troops on ThanksgivingBy Dan Lamothe November 27 Follow @danlamothe

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, following a whirlwind few days in which he resigned as Pentagon chief, carried through on a holiday tradition of his on Thursday: Making phone calls to a handful of U.S. service members who are overseas.
Hagel made the phone calls from his home in Northern Virginia, four days after President Obama announced Hagel’s resignation, a Pentagon official said. The secretary was not available for media interviews, but wanted to wish the troops a Happy Thanksgiving despite the recent controversy , the official said. He has quietly made phone calls to rank-and-file troops on holidays throughout his tenure in the Pentagon.
Hagel called a Marine in Liberia, a soldier in Afghanistan, an Air Force pilot in Kuwait and a sailor aboard the USS O’Kane, a Navy destroyer, the official said. They were selected by their services to take the call.
“With everything going on with him, him even taking the time out of his day to call was awesome,” said Marine Sgt. Matthew S. Ohler, 24, who has been in Liberia since the summer maintaining MV-22B Osprey aircraft, which are being used to ferry medical supplies around as part of the effort to control the Ebola virus.
“It shows what an awesome person is, even that he would take the time to talk to us,” Ohler said in a phone interview. “He was more interested in what I was doing than what he was doing, and considering I like football, he wanted to talk about that.”
Army 1st Lt. Darrel J. Guthrie II, 24, said in a phone call from Jalalabad, Afghanistan, that he appreciated that Hagel, a former Army infantry squad leader in Vietnam, wanted to know about his experiences on deployment, but didn’t ask too many questions about being in combat. Guthrie has been under fire several times, including during an attack on his unit this month involving suicide bombers, he said.
“It’s not necessarily the most enjoyable things to talk about,” Guthrie said. “He was really good about asking about it briefly, but not prying too deeply.”
The other two to take calls were Air Force Capt. Derek Van De Wege, 27, a C-17 pilot at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, and Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Ruddana P. Skipper, 24.
Skipper’s ship, the O’Kane, is in the Persian Gulf. Van De Wege has been flying airdrop missions in support of the U.S. mission in Iraq, delivering food, water and other supplies.

Private property and the PilgrimsBy Ilya Somin November 27
There is much to be thankful for on Thanksgiving. One lesson of the holiday that we should try not to forget is how the Pilgrims were saved from starvation and misery by private property rights. Economist Benjamin Powell summarizes the story here :
Many people believe that after suffering through a severe winter, the Pilgrims’ food shortages were resolved the following spring when the Native Americans taught them to plant corn and a Thanksgiving celebration resulted. In fact, the pilgrims continued to face chronic food shortages for three years until the harvest of 1623. Bad weather or lack of farming knowledge did not cause the pilgrims’ shortages. Bad economic incentives did.
In 1620 Plymouth Plantation was founded with a system of communal property rights. Food and supplies were held in common and then distributed based on equality and need as determined by Plantation officials. People received the same rations whether or not they contributed to producing the food, and residents were forbidden from producing their own food. Governor William Bradford, in his 1647 history, Of Plymouth Plantation, wrote that this system was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. The problem was that “young men, that were most able and fit for labour, did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men’s wives and children without any recompense.” Because of the poor incentives, little food was produced.
Faced with potential starvation in the spring of 1623, the colony decided to implement a new economic system. Every family was assigned a private parcel of land. They could then keep all they grew for themselves….
This change, Bradford wrote, had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been. Giving people economic incentives changed their behavior….
Once the Pilgrims in the Plymouth Plantation abandoned their communal economic system and adopted one with greater individual property rights, they never again faced the starvation and food shortages of the first three years. It was only after allowing greater property rights that they could feast without worrying that famine was just around the corner.
For a more detailed account of the Pilgrims’ transition to private property, see here . In my 2010 post on this subject, I explained why the lessons of the Pilgrims’ experience with property rights are in no way vitiated by the fact that the Plymouth Plantation was a corporation.
Happy Thanksgiving to all!

Happy Thanksgiving from the FoundersBy Will Baude November 27
Happy Thanksgiving to our readers! I posted this last year , but since I’m teaching a seminar on constitutional interpretation outside of the courts in January, this seems appropriate again. Here are competing Thanskgiving wishes from ex-Presidents Washington and Jefferson:
General Washington :
Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor . . .
Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be … that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions– to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually–to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed–to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord–To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and us–and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.
Mr. Jefferson :
I consider the government of the U S. as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises. This results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment, or free exercise, of religion, but from that also which reserves to the states the powers not delegated to the U.S. Certainly no power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the general government. It must then rest with the states, as far as it can be in any human authority.
But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe a day of fasting & prayer. That is, that I should indirectly assume to the U.S. an authority over religious exercises which the Constitution has directly precluded them from. It must be meant too that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it; not indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription perhaps in public opinion.
And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation the less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed? I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct it’s exercises, it’s discipline, or it’s doctrines; nor of the religious societies that the general government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting & prayer are religious exercises. The enjoining them an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises, & the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the constitution has deposited it.
I am aware that the practice of my predecessors may be quoted. But I have ever believed that the example of state executives led to the assumption of that authority by the general government, without due examination, which would have discovered that what might be a right in a state government, was a violation of that right when assumed by another. Be this as it may, every one must act according to the dictates of his own reason, & mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the President of the U S. and no authority to direct the religious exercises of his constituents.

Fries at mass? The McMass group wants to put McDonald's in a church
Would you be more inclined to go to church if services came with a Big Mac and a side of fries? That's the idea behind McMass , a group whose goal is to put a McDonald's franchise in a church. 
The group, led by Paul Di Lucca, a creative director at the church branding agency Lux Dei design, has launched a page on the  IndieGoGo  crowdfunding site. He's looking to raise $1 million to build the first McDonald's church.

The $1 million will go toward purchasing a franchise and construction. The group is currently looking for a church to partner with.  
"It's time for churches to engage with entrepreneurship," writes the group. "By combining a church and a McDonald's we can create a self-sustaining, community-engaged, popular church, and an unparalleled McDonald's restaurant."
At the time of this writing, the group had raised $79. 

Rupee weakens 3 paise vs dollar to end at 61.87  snaps 2-day riseComments
In dull trade, Indian rupee on Thursday snapped its two-day rise and fell back by three paise to end at 61.87 against the Greenback on month-end dollar demand from importers.
The rupee had fallen to 61.92 levels intra-day but positive cues from local equities and sustained capital inflows helped it to cut losses, forex dealers said.
There was caution in the foreign exchange market ahead of quarterly GDP data release on Saturday and the RBI's monetary policy review next week, they added.
At the Interbank Forex market, the domestic currency resumed better at 61.81 a dollar from last close of 61.84.
Later, it was trapped in a narrow range of 61.80 and 61.9225 before concluding at 61.87, a fall of three paise or 0.05%.
In the previous two days, it had risen by ten paise or 0.16% while trading in a tight range.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday rose by 52.72 points, or 0.19%. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $35.65 million on Wednesday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was up by 0.20% against its major six global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said: "Not much movement was seen in the USD/INR pair. The pair is likely to trade range bound as investors are trading cautiously and are waiting for the credit policy due next month, which will help them to gauge the markets."
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.50 to 62.40, he added.

Trinamool slams SBI s $1-bn loan to Adani groupComments
The Trinamool Congress on Thursday objected to government-owned State Bank of India (SBI) sanctioning $1 billion as loan to the Adani group's coal project in Australia and called it "crony capitalism".

Derek O'Brien, the party's MP, raised the issue during Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha and said SBI had signed an MoU pledging a loan though five international banks had refused to fund the Adani project in Queensland state. Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays had declined loans citing decline in coal mining in Australia, coal prices falling by 50% and environmental issues, he said.
"What prompted SBI to lend" to Adani, said O'Brien. The MP claimed that coal minister Piyush Goyal has stated that coal imports to India will end in 2-3 years, but Adani's Australia project is to export two-thirds of its output to India.
The loan, which would be one of the largest extended by an Indian bank for an overseas project, was announced when  group chairman Gautam Adani was in Brisbane with a business delegation for the G20 summit, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended.
Without naming Gautam Adani, O'Brien said: "this gentleman was with the prime minister every day". The loan was committed over a breakfast meeting attended by Modi, Adani and SBI's chairperson, he said. Adani was in the business delegation when Prime Minister visited United States, Japan and Australia. "It gives bad impression," he said.
The TMC leader said he had no problem with government being business-friendly but "we have problem regarding crony
capitalism."
 
Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said there were 20 people in the business delegation that went to
Australia. "Adani is not Quattrochi (with whom business cannot be done)," he remarked, referring to Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi who was sought by Indian authorities in connection with the Bofors gun scandal.
Naidu said the member had every right to raise the issue about a loan extended by SBI to a corporate house but "taking
name of Prime Minister is highly objectionable".
Left, Congress and Samajwadi Party associated themselves with the issue raised by the TMC member.

The pair, whose Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) is one of the top private charities in the world, have been feuding over a family fortune judges say tops $1.3 billion.
American-born Cooper-Hohn, 49, had sought half the assets. But 48-year-old Hohn, who runs his TCI hedge fund, offered a quarter, arguing that he had made a special contribution to their wealth during a 17-year marriage. They have four children, including triplets.
A spokeswoman for Cooper-Hohn was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for one of Hohn's legal firms could not immediately confirm the settlement.

Part of pension money may have to be invested in robust infra fundsComments
In a move that could boost the fund-starved infrastructure sector, the government is examining the possibility of making it mandatory for a portion of pension or retirement monies accumulated under the pension regulatory body to be invested in infrastructure projects with AA ratings.
While the government proposed that pension and insurance companies, apart from provident funds, be allowed to trade directly in debt funds, the regulator — Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) — has had reservations on this.
The infrastructure sector needs investments of over $1 trillion during the 12th Plan period (2012–17).
The regulator recently set up a committee to re-examine the investment guidelines for these bodies, and to carve out fresh norms that would enable pension money to flow into new and “lucrative” instruments — which could include infrastructure bonds floated by banks and infrastructure debt funds.
A committee under India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd chairman Santosh B Nayar, which recently submitted a report to the finance ministry on financing the power sector, too recommended that PFRDA direct a part of the fund into the infrastructure sector.
“In view of the huge funding requirement of the infrastructure sector, it is essential to channelise long-term funds from insurance and pension funds into infrastructure ... PFRDA may advice the provident funds to invest at least some portion of their investments in AA rated papers of infrastructure SPVs,” the report, which the finance ministry is examining, said.
“The idea is to promote pension products... now this is retirement money, so we understand that it is critical to ensure that they are invested in safe and lucrative instruments and at the same time we need to understand how this has to be directed towards infrastructure as the sector needs a push,” a senior government official  told HT
Pension fund managers are registered under the PFRDA, from SBI, UTI, LIC, Kotak Mahindra, Reliance Capital, ICICI Prudential, HDFC  and DSP BlackRock among others.

Xiaomi plans to set up e-com platform in IndiaComments
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi plans to set up its own e-commerce platform in India to sell its devices and accessories and is also looking at possibilities to assemble phones here in the future.
Xiaomi exclusively sells its devices globally through online flash sales. In India, it has partnered with Flipkart to sell its devices, the Mi3 and Redmi 1S smartphones.
Xiaomi, which entered India just three months ago, has sold 500,000 units up till now.
“E-commerce is core to us. We will continue to sell phones with Flipkart for a long time. But we are also looking at having our own e-commerce platform to sell our products,” said Manu Jain, operations head, Xiaomi India and hopes to get it ready by 2015.
At the same time, it is exploring options to start assembling phones in the country. “We are only exploring that right now (third party assembly). The entire ecosystem needs to be in place for that. We will have to study regulations, taxation related issues as well. So there is no timeline for when we will start assembling here,” he said.
Xiaomi’s devices are assembled by Foxconn, which also makes smartphones for Apple and Blackberry, in China.

Fag-end buying in select bluechips lifts Sensex by 53 pointsComments
Rising for the second day, benchmark Sensex on Thursday closed up by 53 points at 28,438.91 and the Nifty rose over 18 points to settle at 8,494.20 on fag-end buying in select bluechips, amid expiry of monthly derivative contracts.
Trading was choppy on Thursday with investors adopting a cautious stance ahead of quarterly GDP data release on Friday and the much-awaited RBI's policy review next week.
Rise in Infosys, HUL, TCS, ICICI Bank, BHEL, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Dr Reddy's and Hindalco mainly drove Sensex higher.
Sustained capital inflows amid firm European cues also supported the positive trend, traders said. Second-line stocks outperformed the Sensex on good buying by retail investors.
The BSE-Smallcap and the BSE-Midcap indices rose by 0.55% and 0.51% respectively. The BSE 30-share Sensex resumed nearly stable and moved in a range of over 190 points before settling at 28,438.91, a gain of 52.72 points or 0.19%.
The wide-based 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE rose further by 18.45 points, or 0.22%, to end at 8,494.20. "Benchmarks were seen ending marginally on the positive side amid excessive volatility on F&O expiry day.
Investors also opted to remain on the sidelines ahead of the release of July-September economic growth data on Friday.... However, losses remained capped as investors were seen buying positions in IT, power and healthcare stocks," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Fall in the global crude oil prices to four-year low also boosted the market sentiment as India imports nearly 80% of its oil requirements.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors bought shares worth net Rs. 181.46 crore on Thursday as per provisional data.
In the overseas markets, Asian stocks closed mixed. Key indices in China, South Korea and Taiwan finished higher while from Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore settled lower.
European markets were trading firm in their late morning deals ahead of a speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. The DAX was up by 0.70% and the FTSE by 0.23% while French index CAC was closed on Friday.

Telcos  supermarket chains  bigbiz can start payments banksTelcos, supermarket chains, bigbiz can start payments banks
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 27, 2014

The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday defined fresh rules that will allow a host of new businesses such as mobile phone companies, super-market chains and pre-payment card issuers to set up specialised banks offering limited financial services.
The move is part of India’s broad strategy to widen banking access in a country where nearly 4 out of 10 adults do not have a bank account.
In August, the government launched the Jan Dhan Yojana, an ambitious initiative to end “financial untouchability” setting a target to opening 75 million accounts by January. Late on Wednesday, this target was raised to 100 million accounts.
Under the rules that RBI has announced, mobile telephone companies, super-market chains and prepaid payment card issuers will be eligible set up a payments bank, which can receive deposits and remittances, but cannot lend.
Existing micro-finance institutions, non-banking finance companies and local area banks will be able to convert to small finance banks, the RBI said in its guidelines, calling in applications by January 16.
It could consider more applications at a later stage.
Small finance banks are aimed at giving loans to “unserved and underserved sections” including small business units, small and marginal farmers, and micro and small industries, the Bank said.
“The financial inclusion agenda has received a significant boost with the issuance of these guidelines,” said Aman Bhargava, director, financial services advisory, Grant Thronton India. “The basic objective is to extend the range of financial services to the hitherto unbanked which were forced to rely on non-regulated means — money lenders, chit funds, cash transfers etc.”
RBI said a small finance bank will be eligible to transit into a universal bank subject to several conditions such as its track record as a small finance bank, minimum paid-up capital norms applicable to universal banks plus RBI due diligence.
Resident individuals or professionals with at least 10 years of experience in banking and finance and societies and companies owned by Indian residents will also be allowed to set up small finance banks, RBI said.
Large state-run institutions and big businesses have been barred from setting up small finance banks to ensure that these specialise in lending to small businesses and the poor.
The minimum paid-up equity capital for these has been set at Rs. 100 crore, and promoters’ minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital at 40%.
Payments banks can offer payments and remittance services and distribute products such as mutual funds and insurance. They can also issue ATM and debit cards, but not credit cards.
An external advisory committee, which will include bankers, chartered accountants, finance professionals, among other eminent professionals will evaluate the applications. RBI will take the final decision to issue an in-principle approval, which will be valid for 18 months.
Earlier this year, RBI awarded licences to Bandhan Financial and IDFC to start full-scale banks.

Analyst Corner: APTEL ruling positive for GSPL &GAILSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
In another setback for gas regulator PNGRB (Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board), in its tariff dispute with GSPL, the appellate tribunal (APTEL) has overwhelmingly ruled in favour of GSPL.
APTEL has said that PNGRB’s tariff order had a fatal deficiency, and has set aside the tariff order.  Highlighting that a 12% post-tax return on capital employed (as permitted in regulations) is in the interest of all stakeholders, it has asked PNGRB to re-work the tariff orders.
We think PNGRB will be more liberal now in re-working the tariff, and believe 10-15% tariff upsides are easily likely for both GAIL/GSPL. With APTEL emphasising that a 12% post-tax ROCE is important and in the interest of all stakeholders, we think PNGRB will be forced to re-look at the entire tariff setting exercise, and will likely be more liberal.
While it is too early to determine the extent of tariff increases, we think overall 10-15% tariff increases are like for both GAIL and GSPL. On our estimates, a 10% increase in tariff would increase: GSPL’s FY16F EPS and fair value by 12-14%; and GAIL’s FY16F EPS and fair value by 6-7%.
In addition, there will likely be retroactive gains, as the re-worked tariff orders will apply from the date the existing orders were made applicable.
For several of GAIL’s key pipelines, current provisional tariff orders were applied from Nov-2008. Thus, retroactive gains will be for a longer period and likely higher.

In year of highs  some make itlargeSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
The magnificent rally in the market this year has spawned several  ‘large cap’ companies, reports Devangi Gandhi in Mumbai. Even as India’s market cap is within touching distance of the R100-lakh-crore milestone, an increasing number of ‘mid caps’ have graduated to become ‘large caps’.
The reverse is also happening — Jaiprakash Associates and Bhushan Steel, which were mid-caps in 2013, are now small caps while Jindal Steel and Power, which was a large-cap stock, has now become a mid-cap stock. Stocks like DLF and Cairn India have also lost value — more than R3,000 crore and R10,000 crore, respectively. Of the BSE 500 universe, as many as 18 stocks have grown to become largecaps in 2014 with the market value of nearly a third of these having doubled.
Even as the market continues to touch new highs this year, the unprecedented rally has spawned many a ‘large-cap’ company. While India’s market cap is now within touching distance of the R100-lakh-crore milestone, an increasing number of ‘mid caps’ have graduated to ‘large caps’.
The reverse is true as well. While Jaiprakash Associates and Bhushan Steel, which were mid caps in 2013, are now small caps, Jindal Steel & Power has turned into a mid-cap stock from being a large cap.
DLF and Cairn India have also lost value — more than R3,000 crore and R10,000 crore, respectively.
In the BSE 500 universe, as many as 18 stocks have grown into large caps in 2014 with the market value of nearly a third of these having doubled. Amid an overall improvement in the m-cap profile of the Indian equity market, the mid-cap and small-cap universes have also expanded with the addition of 46 and 64 companies, respectively. Jaiprakash Associates and Bhushan Steel, which are struggling for one reason or another have lost  41% and 79%, respectively.
For the compilation, we considered stocks with market-cap of more than or equal to R25,000 crore and less than R1 lakh crore as large caps. Stocks with market value of less than R25,000 crore, but greater than or equal to R8,000 crore were grouped as mid caps. The small-cap category included scrips that hold market value anywhere between R2,000 crore and R8,000 crore.
The compilation shows that stocks from auto, financial & banking and pharma space witnessed an improvement in their m-cap profile with a total of 10 companies that turned into large caps belonging to them.
Eicher Motors, Motherson Sumi and Aurobindo Pharma led the list of entrants into the large-cap club with an addition of more than R20,000 crore to their respective market-cap. Eicher Motors, which is expected to see robust earnings growth in two of its business segments over the next two years, saw its market-cap jump three times to R38,897 crore.
Recently, MSCI-included Motnerson Sumi and Sundaram Fastners in its Standard India index and Small-Cap index, respectively. Bharat Forge, Ashok Leyland and TVS Motors were some other auto stocks that saw an upgrade in their profile.
In the banking and financial space, stocks like PNB, IDFC and Power Finance corporation restored their large-cap status while IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank emerged as new entrants, with a two third and 100% gains in its market value to R38,066 crore and R29,107 crore, respectively.
The Street’s distinct preference for private sector banks over their public sector counterparts due to superior asset quality was reasserted by the increase in market value of private sector banks in the bluechip category. While ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and SBI all surpassed the m-cap milestone of R2 lakh crore, SBI made the maximum addition of R1 lakh crore among any listed company this year. Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki and HCL Tech touched their highest market values this year as they emerged as the newest blue chips in the BSE 500 universe.
Among blue chips, the market value of TCS and ONGC, the two most valued companies of India, transcended to boost m-cap of more than R3 lakh crore and R5 lakh crore, in that order.
While India is the best performing global equity market this year with the benchmark Sensex yielding 34%, the combined market value of Indian companies has increased by $457 billion to $1.60 trillion. Thanks to a strong revival in investor sentiment,  India claimed the ninth spot in the world market-cap ranking, replacing Switzerland in early September 2014.

Paper industry seeks duty-free import ofwoodGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
With domestic supply of wood and bamboo falling short of meeting the growing raw material requirement of the paper industry, the Indian Paper Manufacturers Association (IPMA) has asked the government to allow duty-free import of wood logs, chips and bamboo.
Currently, import of wood logs and chips attract total customs duty of 9.4% and bamboo attracts a duty of 36.1%.
According to IPMA, raw material demand for the paper industry is around 11 million tonne per annum and demand for wood is expected to rise to 15 million tonne by 2024-25. In 2013-14, about a million tonne of wood and bamboo was imported as domestic production was not able to match the raw material requirement. “With no dedicated enabling policy in the country for industrial plantation, the price of wood has gone up by more than 60% in 2013-14 and more than doubled in three years,” a statement by IPMA said.
At present, domestic paper production is estimated at the 11.38 million tonne, of which around 0.53 million tonne is exported. At the same time, domestic consumption of paper is about 13.10 million tonne, of which  around 2.25 million tonne is imported. “The domestic paper industry is at a significant disadvantage for it has no access to captive plantation to manage raw material cost, while global players have in-built advantage of conducive production plantation policies and ability to procure wood locally at favourable cost,” the industry body has written to the finance ministry.
The raw material, wood and pulp, constitutes 35-40% of the cost of paper production.
According to Rohit Pandit, secretary general, IPMA, the paper industry’s proposal for allocation of degraded forest land for growing pulpable wood has not made headway. “Industry driven ‘social-agro forestry’ falls short of meeting the growing requirements of wood and therefore imports have become inevitable,” he noted.
IPMA has also asked for an increase in peak rate of customs duty on import of paper and paper board as China is saddled with excess capacities as major markets such as US and the European Union have imposed anti-dumping duties on paper imports from Beijing.
The industry body has stated that China and other South east Asian countries  find India an attractive outlet for dumping excess inventory.
Per capita paper consumption in India is around 11 kg annually, while the global average is 56 kg. Domestic per capita paper consumption is projected to increase to at least 17 kg by 2024-25.

Maharashtra co-op sugar mills influxGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
The recent announcement by Maharashtra cooperation minister Chandrakant Patil to consider reducing the 25-km distance between sugar mills has sent alarm bells ringing among cooperative mills. Millers fear the move could lead to a scramble for cane and unfair competition between cooperative and private factories.
According to the minister, the proposed relaxation in distance between two sugar factories will increase competition and promote entry of the private sector in the sugar industry, thus enabling sugar factories to become professional to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP), which is mandatory, to sugarcane growers.
The Maharashtra State Co-Operative Sugar Factories Federation has appealed to the government to hold consultations before taking a formal decision in this regard. “There has been no formal communication from the government on this issue yet. However, should this happen, there will be more competition for cane and more private mills will end up being established,” Sanjeev Babar, MD of the factories federation, said.
The previous Congress-NCP government had raised the mandatory minimum aerial distance from 15 km to 25 km to avoid poaching and to help secure sufficient cane area for individual factories.
According to Babar, the federation had approached the Rangarajan committee on this issue a couple of years ago, explaining the rationale behind retaining the distance between two mills. The sugar industry in Maharashtra has given 100% assurance to farmers for purchasing their produce on a long-term basis. Every designated mill is obligated to purchase from cane farmers within the cane reservation area, and conversely, farmers are bound to sell to the mill. “A formal notification is yet to come from the government and the federation will urge it to hold consultations before taking any final decision,” Babar said.
Balasaheb Patil of Sahayadri Sahakar Sakhar Karkhana says the decision can be taken by the Centre and not the state. However, should this happen, the cooperative movement in Maharashtra may die in 10-12 years, he said.
Maharashtra’s sugar sector has some 179 registered cooperative and 65 private factories. Nearly 200 proposals from the private sector to establish sugar units are reportedly pending with the state sugar commissionerate for clearance. The state contributes a third of India’s sugar output.
KV Deshmukh, an industry observer, said that since the government has stopped giving share capital for the formation of cooperative mills, there will be more private mills in the state and cooperative mills could suffer in the bargain. Yogesh Pande, founder president, Maharashtra State Sugar Brokers Association, says reducing the distance between two mills will force millers to concentrate  on better quality.
“Marketing and branding will be a new task for millers and farmers will have the option to sell cane since the current system binds the farmer to sell cane to mills in the designated area,” he said. “New sugar mills with modern technology will also come up,” he added.
Meanwhile, the government has decided to approach the Centre for a R2,100 crore relief package for millers.

Turmeric prices seen firming up on lower arrivals  good festivedemandGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
Turmeric prices are seen firming up due to lower arrivals in the market and good festive demand. Traders feel the market may have moved up further but for the lower quality of the commodity on sale. India is the largest turmeric producer with 75-80% of global production and demand for the commodity has been increasing rapidly from the medicinal and cosmetic industry.
“Turmeric prices are expected to move higher in the near term on expectation of festive demand and on reports of shortage of good quality stocks which dampened trading activities in a few markets,” Vinod TP of broking firm Geofin Comtrade said.
“Delay in sowing due to El Nino effect that beat the monsoon prospects earlier prompted farmers to plant fewer crop in major producing states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Due to lower returns, growers turned their focus to other short-term crops,” he added. But Vinod believes a good carryover stock is likely to pressure prices.
N Raveendran, national consultant of National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), said the new crop will be lower by 20% from the previous crop and almost 30% lower than the normal crop. “The market is expected to firm up in the coming days due to lower supply. The new crop and the carryover stock may not be enough to meet total requirements of the year,” he added.
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University reports that price of quality turmeric will  hover around R6,800 to R7,200 per quintal in December and is expected to increase in February. The expected export demand, demand from North India and the crop position is likely to provide good support to the market, Raveendran added.
Angel Commodities reports that crop in Nizamabad and Maharashtra might be 12-13% lower, which may support prices. “Lower level buying interest and limited arrivals may support the price. Inventory of turmeric at Erode is  around 20-22 lakh bags as compared to 27 lakh bags last month and in Nizamabad it stands at around 6.5 lakh bags,” Angel sources said. Turmeric exports during April-July 2014 are seen higher by 34 % in both volume and value.

Cotton corporation to step up MSP ops thisseasonGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) intends to step up MSP operations this season. The corporation is targeting a procurement of 6 million bales worth R12,000 crore this year as prices in the majority of cotton growing states have fallen below the minimum selling price, BK Mishra, MD of CCI, told FE.
Last year, CCI procured R80 crore worth of cotton. For the season of 2012-13, it procured cotton only from Andhra Pradesh and there was no reason for procurement in the season prior to this year, he said.
CCI procured a record R14,000 crore worth of cotton in the season of 2008-09 when it purchased 90 lakh bales. For procurement of R12,000 crore this year, it has made arrangements with a consortium of 14 banks led by Bank of Baroda for fundraising. CCI is expected to buy 60 lakh bales (of 170 kg each) of cotton across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Currently, it has an inventory of eight lakh bales.
The government has fixed an MSP of R3,750 a quintal for medium staple cotton and R4,050 for long staple cotton for the 2014-15 season. Cotton Association of India (CAI) estimates output at 40.55 million bales this year, a marginal decline from 40.73 million last year (this is an October-September year). Of that, CCI plans to buy six million bales from the open market.
Mishra said cotton supplies from farmers this season have fallen by 19% so far. “Farmers are holding on to their crop in Maharashtra and Gujarat. In Maharashtra, since Parliament’s winter session is in progress, they are hoping for some succour from the government. In Gujarat, the farmers are in good financial health and so have the capacity to hold,” Mishra explained. “Till date, we have bought 1 million bales in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and a small quantity in Madhya Pradesh,” he said.
This year, the number of states coming under MSP operations has increased — Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Gujarat and MP are new additions to the MSP operation list.
CCI plans to offload its inventory over 15 months depending on market conditions.
Mishra said that going by the current price trend and future forecasts, it is unlikely the corporation would look at the overseas market this season. India’s cotton output is estimated to touch 40 million bales against 37 million bales recorded last year. Cotton exports from India have almost come to a standstill, with domestic prices ruling five cents above the global market. China, which imported 50% of the 12 million bales shipped by India last year, is cutting down on shipments.
National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) is also expected to begin MSP operations soon.
Mishra said Nafed has begun modalities with the Centre for seeking funds. The funds are expected to be routed through the CCI, he added, saying paperwork is in progress. Nafed is expected to procure some 28 lakh bales this season and has opened 15-20 centres through its agencies.
For the first time in five years, Maharashtra State Cooperative Cotton Growers Federation had to begin cotton procurement in Maharashtra under CCI. Every year, the federation procures cotton as an agency under Nafed. However, this season, the credit borrowing limit of Nafed has been exhausted.
Dhiren N Sheth, president, Cotton Association of India, said cotton production, which was 15.80 million bales in 2001-02, has more than doubled and is estimated at 40.55 million bales of 170 kg each during 2014-15. The acreage under cotton in India has increased to 12.65 million hectares during 2014-15 and India now has a share of 37% of the world’s total cotton acreage.

Equities find FII favour  debt a shadebehindSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
After drawing 18-94% lesser foreign institutional investors (FII) inflows vis-a-vis debt markets in the last six months, equity markets on course to draw a bigger share of FII flows in the month of November.
FIIs bought $1.8-billion worth of equities in November so far, while they pumped in $1.7 billion in debt markets in the same period.
On Thursday, as per provisional data on the exchanges, FIIs bought another $64.95 million worth of shares. Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought $55.22 million worth of equities.
Experts attribute the shift to a risk-on sentiment to the Parliament session and the monetary policy. “FIIs want to see strong policy action and expect the Winter Session to yield some positive results. Apart from that, there is also the view that the conditions are ripe for the RBI governor to cut the interest rates,” said UR Bhat, director at Dalton Capital Advisors.
“As RBI gets more comfortable with inflation and the government deficit declines, they will be in a position to consider a relatively accommodative monetary policy, leading to better liquidity, lower deposit costs and faster growth,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.
YTD, FII investments in equity markets stand at $15.76 billion, while in debt markets they have pumped more than $24 billion.
Foreign brokerages believe earnings momentum will drive the markets in the coming days.  “The growth recovery will likely sustain current valuations, especially as it starts manifesting in both macro and micro data points. Unlike last three years, we expect consensus earnings growth estimates of 15%+ for FY16 and FY17 to be met,” the Swiss brokerage UBS said in a note.

Amid an overall improvement in the m-cap profile of the Indian equity market, the mid-cap and small-cap universes have also expanded with the addition of 46 and 64 companies, respectively. Jaiprakash Associates and Bhushan Steel, which are struggling for one reason or another have lost  41% and 79%, respectively.
For the compilation, we considered stocks with market-cap of more than or equal to R25,000 crore and less than R1 lakh crore as large caps. Stocks with market value of less than R25,000 crore, but greater than or equal to R8,000 crore were grouped as mid caps. The small-cap category included scrips that hold market value anywhere between R2,000 crore and R8,000 crore.
The compilation shows that stocks from auto, financial & banking and pharma space witnessed an improvement in their m-cap profile with a total of 10 companies that turned into large caps belonging to them.
Eicher Motors, Motherson Sumi and Aurobindo Pharma led the list of entrants into the large-cap club with an addition of more than R20,000 crore to their respective market-cap. Eicher Motors, which is expected to see robust earnings growth in two of its business segments over the next two years, saw its market-cap jump three times to R38,897 crore.
Recently, MSCI-included Motnerson Sumi and Sundaram Fastners in its Standard India index and Small-Cap index, respectively. Bharat Forge, Ashok Leyland and TVS Motors were some other auto stocks that saw an upgrade in their profile.
In the banking and financial space, stocks like PNB, IDFC and Power Finance corporation restored their large-cap status while IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank emerged as new entrants, with a two third and 100% gains in its market value to R38,066 crore and R29,107 crore, respectively.
The Street’s distinct preference for private sector banks over their public sector counterparts due to superior asset quality was reasserted by the increase in market value of private sector banks in the bluechip category. While ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and SBI all surpassed the m-cap milestone of R2 lakh crore, SBI made the maximum addition of R1 lakh crore among any listed company this year. Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki and HCL Tech touched their highest market values this year as they emerged as the newest blue chips in the BSE 500 universe.
Among blue chips, the market value of TCS and ONGC, the two most valued companies of India, transcended to boost m-cap of more than R3 lakh crore and R5 lakh crore, in that order.
While India is the best performing global equity market this year with the benchmark Sensex yielding 34%, the combined market value of Indian companies has increased by $457 billion to $1.60 trillion. Thanks to a strong revival in investor sentiment,  India claimed the ninth spot in the world market-cap ranking, replacing Switzerland in early September 2014.

Tax cafe: Taxability of car discountsWill cheap gas last?
In the recent Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) stay order, Maruti Suzuki has been ordered to pay a pre-deposit of R150 crore against the excise duty demand of R240.57 crore. The allegation by the revenue authorities was that the promotional discounts offered by Maruti dealers to the end-customers should be added back to the transaction value by the company and excise duty be paid.
The arguments extended by the revenue authorities were that these promotional discounts are factored in the dealer margin. The company supports the dealer by compensating a portion of these discounts offered to the end-customers. These expenses are in the nature of advertising and selling expenses per se, and the company has used its dealership arrangement to pass on these promotional discounts to the end-customer.
Hence, these promotional expenses, if not incurred by the dealer, ought to have been spent by the company. Hence, these promotional discounts should be added back to the transaction value.
The Supreme Court clearly laid down the principle of allowability of discount in the Union of India and others vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd, and the Union of India vs Madras Rubber Factory Ltd and Others. It held that for the purpose of valuation, discounts by whatever name called, would be deductible from the assessable value. The circular no 354/2000-TRU also stated that “if in any transaction, a discount is allowed on declared price of any goods and actually passed on to the buyer of the goods as per common practice, the question of including the amount of discount in the transaction value does not arise. The only condition is that the discounts offered should have been known at the time of removal of goods from the factory gate. In the auto sector, these are called wholesale discounts and passed on, in the invoice itself.”
However, any discount which is passed on by the dealer to the end-customer out of his margin is called retail discount. If these retail discounts are met by the dealer out of his dealer margin or partly reimbursed by the company, then would these amount to “an additional consideration in money value flowing back from buyer to seller.” We can agree to this logic, if these expenses are paid as additional consideration by the dealer to the company. Alternatively, if the company claims these as part of discount while discharging its excise duty liability on the transaction value, then it can be a legitimate demand.
Further, the revenue authorities contend that the transaction value states that “any amount that the buyer is liable to pay to, or on behalf of, the assessee, by reason of, or in connection with the sale, whether payable at the time of the sale or at any other time, including, but not limited to, any amount charged for, or to make provision for, advertising or publicity, marketing and selling organisation expenses, storage, outward handling, servicing, warranty, commission or any other matter…”
This is interpreted to mean that any expenses incurred by the dealer out of his dealer margin shall be deemed to have been spent on behalf of the company and form part of the additional consideration.
It is totally irrelevant to argue that the discounts given by the dealer are with the knowledge of the company or will the dealer incur these discounts out of his margin without having any underlying arrangement with the company. These look like notional thoughts and not an established fact in money terms, to have flown back to the company, either directly or indirectly.
The company has paid excise duties on a higher price only factoring the wholesale discounts and not claimed on these retail discounts offered to the end-customers. Then where is the revenue leakage and what is the allegation of the revenue authorities.
Are we trying to interpret badly the Section 4 of the Central Excise Act to define “transaction value” to include expenses of the seller as additional consideration? Are we coining a new levy called the Expenditure Excise Duty (EED)?
The logic and reasoning of the order of CESTAT also flies in the face of another Supreme Court judgment in the Philips case as reported in 1997 (91) ELT 540, wherein the Court ruled that “it seems to us clear that the advertisement which the dealer was required to make at its own cost benefited in equal degree the appellant and the dealer and that for this reason the cost of such advertisement was borne half and half by the appellant and the dealer. Making a deduction out of the trade discount on this account was, therefore, uncalled for.” Every discount offered by the manufacturer to the dealer is necessarily towards the better marketing of the product and that is no reason to hold that the discount is not an admissible deduction for excise purposes. The faulty prima facie reasoning of CESTAT would lead to a situation where the cars are assessed to excise duty on an MRP basis, even though the cars are not notified for MRP-based assessment under Section 4A of the Central Excise Act.
The settled legal maxim is that what cannot be done directly cannot be allowed to be done indirectly. Offering of discounts to the dealers and simultaneously requiring the dealers to incur certain obligations either towards services, marketing and publicity are not a taboo either legally or commercially.
Now, since this is only a stay order of CESTAT, this has no persuasive value when the main appeal is heard on merits. Let us hope that, going forward, such imaginations do not enter the minds of appellate authorities.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Editorial: As good as it getsDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
With the US third quarter GDP rising from the 3.5% the advance estimate talked of to 3.9% in the second estimate, the economy is growing at a scorching pace. Indeed, with the second quarter’s 4.6% growth, the US hasn’t had this kind of growth in more than a decade. If you leave out the unusual first quarter of this year when growth contracted 2.1% due to an unusually cold winter, the US has had no negative quarter since the beginning of 2011, underscoring the point that the 2008 recession is firmly in the past. The latest quarter’s growth, it is important to keep in mind, has taken place despite inventories contributing negatively to growth. And while exports growth has halved—from 11.1% in Q2 to 4.9% in Q3—due to the exceptionally strong dollar, this has also helped contain imports; on a net basis, exports contributed 0.8 percentage points to Q3 growth, up from a negative 0.34 percentage point contribution in the previous quarter.
While the US is expected to remain robust—the OECD’s latest estimate puts US growth at 3.1% in 2015 versus a likely 2.2% in 2014—the rest of the developed world continues to pose a serious challenge. Though the OECD is looking at euro area growth picking up to 1.1% in 2015, up from a likely 0.8% in 2014—euro area PMI has been above 50 for more than a year now—the fact is the euro crisis is far from over. Even the OECD’s own estimates of when output would finally reach the level it was in 2008 keep getting pushed forward—in November 2010, it was estimated this would happen by mid-2012; by November 2011, this was pushed forward to the beginning of 2014, and the latest estimate is this will take place only by mid-2016. The extremely low growth, in turn, has meant a backlash against reforms and, unfortunately, the ECB is still not in a position to undertake US-style ambitious bond purchases. While Japan remains mired in crisis, the fact that China’s central bank has cut rates for the fourth time in the year indicates the pressure the economy is facing.
All of this has large implications for India since, between them, Europe and China account for around 30% of India’s export basket; indeed, the slowing of India’s exports basket is directly related to the global uncertainty. The flip side is that with non-US central banks creating enough liquidity—Kotak estimates a $1.7 trillion increase in the size of the G-4 central bank balance sheets by the end of 2016—India will continue to attract FII flows; at $39.1 billion so far, they are marginally lower than the peak of $39.4 billion in 2010 when India was growing just shy of 9%.

Columns: What to do about populismWill cheap gas last?
A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of populism. In Britain, France, Italy and Spain—and in smaller countries such as Greece—the old political order is facing challenges from populist movements, whether of the right or the left. Of the major European Union economies, only Germany is largely untouched, although the rise of the anti-euro party AfD has become a cause for political concern.
Last week saw the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a right-wing populist party, win its second seat in the British parliament via a by-election. Podemos, a Spanish left-wing populist group whose name means “we can,” is leading in the opinion polls despite being founded less than a year ago. In France, the right-wing Front National leader Marine Le Pen is now considered a serious contender for the 2017 presidential election, while in Italy the hard-to-categorise Five Star Movement is a force to be reckoned with.
With the exception of Greece, where the radical left Syriza movement may take control of the government if there is an election next year, none of the populist groups is close to power. But if the traditional parties continue to fail the people for another electoral cycle, the populists could storm the barricades.
The establishment has a lot to answer for. In some countries, it has been corrupt. In others, it has merely had its nose in the trough, enjoying the fruits of public office. Everywhere, politicians have spent inordinate amounts of energy spinning stories so they can hang onto power rather than solving problems. They have lost touch with their electorates.
However, the cures proposed by the populists are worse than the disease. UKIP wants to pull Britain out of the European Union. The Front National wants to destroy the EU. The Five Star Movement wants to yank Italy out of the euro. Podemos wants to audit part of the national debt before writing it off. Syriza wants to write off half of Greece’s debts.
Such policies, if ever implemented, would create a new set of economic crises. Policies such as pulling out of the EU would involve losing full access to its single market. Abandoning the euro, disastrous though it has been, or unilateral debt write-offs would lead to bank runs and capital controls. The armies of the unemployed would rise, not fall.
Populism is good at tapping into discontent but it comes up with bad, superficial solutions. That, indeed, is perhaps the most appropriate definition of the phenomenon.
But what is the best way of tackling the spectre? Action is needed on two fronts. First, Europe needs to fix its economy. The economic malaise throughout the eurozone is not the only factor behind the rise of populism. But it has certainly fuelled it—and will continue to unless it is addressed.
A grand bargain involving national governments, the European Central Bank and the European Commission is desperately needed. Governments have to press ahead with structural reforms to improve the “supply side”; the ECB has to loosen monetary policy further to boost demand and get inflation up to its target; and the commission needs to come up with an ambitious EU-wide investment programme to give the economy a fiscal boost.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, is due to present his investment programme this week. In theory, with interest rates so low, it should be possible to come up with something that moves the needle. But it is unclear whether Germany, which has a huge sway over EU policy, would agree.
But even if the economy is fixed, that won’t be the end of populism. Look at Britain, where growth is strong but so is UKIP. The lack of integrity in politics is the second big factor fuelling populism.
This is borne out by research by two British academics, Will Jennings and Gerry Stoker. In a recent essay, as part of a series on populism published by the Policy Network, a UK think tank, they summarised the mood of the electorate as follows: “What emerges is a sense of being failed by a political class that lacks the competence and strength of character to follow the right policy options and, above all, is regarded as too short-termist, media-obsessed and in cahoots with the rich and powerful to provide leadership in the public interest.”
There are similar feelings across Europe. But what can be done to re-establish trust with the people and put integrity in politics centre stage?
As Hopi Sen, another author in the Policy Network’s series of essays, puts it: “Politics after a crash is like a faithless boyfriend… Does a loud pledge of loyalty… mean much in that situation?”
There is, admittedly, no easy solution. But part of it, certainly, has to be zero tolerance towards corruption and cheating. Part of it, too, should be to acknowledge the failings of politics while not, as Sen puts it, pretending that politics can cure every ill.
New faces would also help. One of the things that the electorate doesn’t like about the current generation of politicians is that many of them have spent virtually their entire adult lives climbing the greasy pole and are so compromised by the experience that it is hard for them to look clean.
Ideally, new parties of the centre would be formed with politicians who are not tarnished by the old style of politics but equally not purveyors of populist non-solutions. There has not yet, though, been much sign of these emerging.
European politicians have to both display integrity and show they can be effective. Otherwise, they will continue to tremble at the rise of populism.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Columns: Facing the bubble economyWill cheap gas last?
British Prime Minister David Cameron recently did a blunt and glum assessment of the global economy. In an article published last week in Britain’s Guardian newspaper, he wrote, “Six years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees, red warning lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy. As I met world leaders at the G20 in Brisbane, the problems were plain to see.”
The gloomy predictions come at a time when equity markets are at an all-time high. S&P500 is currently at 2064, more than three times its level compared to 683 in March 2009. Similarly, Dow Jones Industrial Average is now at around 17,685 as against 6,626 in March 2009. The UK’s FTSE 100 is a mere 250 points away from its highest-ever level reached in 1999. Equity markets have witnessed a sustained bull run in the last five years. It is easy to mistake this for an economic recovery if one believes that everything is fine and dandy in the world as long as stock markets are going up. This surmise could lull most world leaders into their comfort zones and they can easily take their eyes off the ball, spending with abandon like the good old days before 2007. So, it takes some courage and cheek to go against the tide and make a contrarian forecast, like the British Prime Minister has done. I, for one, have long been a staunch critic of the so-called economic recovery in the United States and Europe. My suspicion is that inflated stock prices are due to the Fed’s intense quantitative easing (QE) programme and near-zero interest rates. If stock markets decrease from hereon, it has to be because of an interest rate hike ‘not engineered by the Fed’.
Cameron’s warning is useful not just for the world leaders but also for the man on the street for a couple of reasons. First, it brings some reality back to the markets that risks exist. Ebola, Russia, ISIS, Middle-East tension, a stagnant eurozone and a recession in Japan should be sending shivers down the market’s spine. However, investors find it remarkably easy when markets are booming to look the other way around, as risks start to build up. So, just because the S&P 500, Dow Jones or FTSE 100 is creeping closer to record highs does not mean that all is well in the world. Second, the next couple of years could see even more risks accumulate, so we shouldn’t take 2014’s performance for granted. In fact, things can get to boiling point and then explode, causing market carnage.
As we near the end of 2014, clouds are gathering on the horizon. The Fed is planning to hike interest rates for the first time since 2007. If oil prices continue to fall, then we could see oil producers start to halt production, which could cause a price shock when we least expect it. Even if oil producers don’t try to engineer an oil price rise, there are risks to the economy since hidden inflation is rife in the western world. A significant reduction in purchasing power of dollars and euros in the US and Europe because of higher money supply could trigger economic meltdown, as the British Prime Minister seems to suggest.
And David Cameron is not the only one sounding the alarm when it comes to bubbles. Recently, a group of Deutsche Bank economic strategists wrote in their research report that the sovereign bond market is facing a bubble and is already experiencing quite a bit of frothiness because the risk-return trade-offs are skewed in favour of the governments. The concern is that the bond markets have nowhere else to go to because it’s already in the hands of governments and central banks. I have felt for some time that the ultimate bubble, when we look back a few years from now, is going to be sovereign debt, both US and other, because it is way below any kind of reversion to the mean of interest rates. If you look at where the US 10-year has averaged in the last three decades before the crisis, it has been north of 6%. If it reverts back to that level at some point, there will be terrible losses in the long-term Treasury market, and those will probably be accentuated in other areas of fixed income.
Even Fed Chair Janet Yellen has concurred that stocks are in a bubble, but noted that the Fed wouldn’t raise rates in order to burst them. She was quick to pass on the buck to the financial regulatory bodies for bringing about stability to markets rather than monetary policy, although it’s the Fed’s artificial rates and money printing that’s producing bubbles.
My concern is that there is nowhere left for this bubble to go given that it is now in the hands of the lenders of last resort—governments and central banks with regulators ensuring other large captive buyers. Although I imagine that this bubble needs to be maintained to ensure the solvency of the current financial system, the best-case scenario is that it slowly pops over time via negative real returns for bondholders. The worst-case scenario can be worse than what David Cameron predicts.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Dithering socialistsWritten by Ashutosh |
Posted: November 28, 2014 2:05 am
It isn’t surprising to see the remnants of a socialist movement trying to regroup. The coming together of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar under one umbrella, their efforts to merge their respective parties into one, are not new. This has been done before. They merged and disintegrated like dreams with such silken ease that by now, they have it down to an art form. Recently, Lalu Prasad and Kumar, who fought each other for decades, suddenly came together like old brothers lost in a mela. This regrouping, though, is a purely opportunistic alliance, born out of the survival instinct, to save themselves from decimation and to stop the BJP from coming to power in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This is a pathetic tale of egotistical politicians, and the diminution of a movement once known as the most powerful political force other than the Congress. Socialist politicians have let down this country and are solely responsible for the rise of communal forces.
Just after Independence, the great socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia, in the words of Madhu Limaye, “hoped for the emergence of a two-party system and he thought that socialists would form the main opposition to the Congress in such a two-party system”. Limaye writes that even B.R. Ambedkar had expected the Congress to decay in later years. He thought that socialists would gather strength and present it with a formidable challenge. At the same time, Ashok Mehta, another stalwart of the socialist movement, had also boasted that “the socialist party is the second biggest party in India, that is, it is the principal opposition party in the country. It enjoys more support than all other opposition parties put together. The only organised nationwide alternative to the Congress party is the socialist party”. This was also when the rightwing RSS was down and people did not attach much importance to their ideology. The RSS was reeling under the guilt of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and had lost much of its support base due to the ban imposed by Sardar Patel, the then home minister.
Since then, both streams of politics have travelled in different directions. The socialists who dreamt of replacing the Congress as the principal party of India today fight for survival and hardly deserve the label of “socialists”. They are divided into many groups and can at best be thought of as caste parties. Yadav and Prasad, two of the brightest Lohia followers, are Yadav leaders. Kumar is a Kurmi leader. The RSS, on the other hand, has grown in stature and acceptability and its political wing, the BJP, now occupies the central space in Indian politics. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the BJP is winning one state after another. One can naturally ask what went wrong with the continued…

Jaitley hints at changes in laws
pti
economy (general)
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday hinted in the Lok Sabha that the government was considering amending the anti-money laundering and Income Tax laws to get back the black money stashed away abroad, admitting that there were weaknesses in them.
While making it clear that there was a need for tax-friendly regime with reasonable taxes, he said there was also need to put the fear of law into offenders.
This could be done by providing for criminal prosecution and seizing of assets in India of those whose money was stashed away abroad illegally so that the money came back, he said.
Dissatisfied with the Minister’s reply to the two-day debate on the black money issue, Opposition Congress and TMC members walked out saying the government had failed to fulfil its promise of bringing back the black money in 100 days.
“I admit that there are weaknesses in our law ... When the money is caught, we need to bring it back. I know that even SIT is worried about it. The I-T Act has no jurisdiction over those outside [India],” Mr. Jaitley said.
He said there was need for power to confiscate the assets in India of those who had been found to be in possession of black money abroad.
“This can be done through changes either in the I-T Act or money laundering Act ... I have studied the [prevention of] money laundering act. There are weaknesses in that also. Probably we have to change that,” he said.
The Minister said the U.N. Convention had such a provision.
“We have to strike fear of criminal prosecution in them so that their money is brought back. We can continue the political debate on time line for bringing back the black money, but we must understand the procedures involved in it,” he told members.
During the debate, Mr. Jaitley also said India was moving towards a tax-friendly regime to correct the “bad” image among investors. In the past few years, India got a bad name from the world of investment that “you are not a tax-friendly regime.”
“Our tax system has to be friendly to tax payers, both procedurally and otherwise.”

Scots To Get New Powers After Failed Independence ReferendumScots To Get New Powers After Failed Independence Referendum

LONDON (AP) — Britain's main political parties agreed Thursday to grant Scotland new tax and spending powers to fulfill a promise of greater autonomy made as politicians scrambled to persuade Scots to reject independence in a recent referendum.
The plans are unlikely to satisfy hard-core Scottish nationalists, but could have far-reaching consequences, taking Britain toward a looser, more federated state.
In a Sept. 18 referendum, 55 percent of Scottish voters opted to remain in the United Kingdom, while 45 percent voted to leave.
Since then a commission of politicians from Scotland and the rest of Britain has been thrashing out proposals to fulfill the promise made by anti-independence forces in the final weeks of the campaign, as polls showed rising support for separation.
A plan published Thursday would give the Edinburgh-based Scottish parliament, established in 1999, the power to set income tax rates and keep the revenue in Scottish coffers. Scotland would also gain new control over welfare spending.
Prime Minister David Cameron said the proposals kept a promise he'd made during the referendum campaign, "that a No vote did not mean no change."
But John Swinney, deputy leader of Scotland's pro-independence administration, said the powers fell short of what Scottish people wanted.
"Under these proposals, less than 30 percent of our taxes will be set in Scotland and less than 20 percent of welfare spending will be devolved to Scotland," he said.
The proposals will be introduced as legislation in Parliament in January.
They could open a constitutional can of worms, boosting calls for other British regions, and even major cities, also to be given tax-raising powers.
Cameron also promised to introduce a contentious proposal for "English votes for English laws." It is intended to address a quirk of Britain's political system that means Scottish lawmakers in the House of Commons can vote on policies that only affect England.

Car Sales Fueled by Bigger and Longer Car Loanscar sales fueled by bigger and longer car loans
Black Friday cheat sheet: Your guide to the salesBy Sarah Halzack November 26 Follow @sarahhalzack
After grappling with a lack of innovation in the industry, toy makers respond with playthings that work with apps or interact with gadgets like iPads, allowing more customization and creativity. (AP)
Shoppers, on your mark:  The long weekend of Black Friday sales is practically upon us.  Here’s a roundup of information that should help you navigate the sales, whether you’re hitting the mall or shopping on a tablet in your living room.
 When do the big sales start?
If you’re asking this question, you’re already a little bit behind the deal-nabbing curve.  Many holiday sales are already underway. Wal-Mart cut prices on 20,000 items way back on Nov. 1. Staples began its Black Friday sale on Nov. 16.  The Disney Store began offering its Black Friday prices on Monday.
But still, some fresh deals are poised to arrive on Thursday and Friday.  Here’s when some of the big sales kick off.  We’ve linked to each retailer’s Black Friday Web hub so you can get an idea of what kind of items and promotions they’ll be offering.

Thursday
12 a.m.  As soon as the clock strikes midnight, online sales start at Wal-Mart  and other large retailers.
6 a.m.   Kmart is the first big-box retailer to open its physical stores.
6 p.m.  The next wave of big-box retailers opens its doors: Target , Macy’s , Sears and Kohl’s .
8 p.m.  Wal-Mart is staggering its deals this year, so look for its big electronics event to kick off at this time.  (The promotions available earlier, at 6 p.m., are mostly focused on toys and home goods.)
10 p.m. to midnight.  Many major malls nationwide and specialty apparel stores will open somewhere in this time frame.  There’s plenty of variation from mall to mall and store to store, so check in with your local shopping center to know what to expect.
Friday
1 a.m.  Best Buy and some other retailers close up shop for the night instead of staying open continuously through Friday evening.  They’ve found that there’s not much shopping action in the wee hours of the morning, so it doesn’t make sense to keep the stores staffed during that time.
6 a.m.  Another round of new deals launches at stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart.
8 a.m.   Best Buy reopens.
Throughout the morning:  Major retailers who stayed closed on Thanksgiving, including Nordstrom and Costco, will open their doors.
Anything I need to know before I open my wallet?
Retailers are still going to be competing intensely on price .
You should be ready for Elsa-mania .
Relax.   Your vision of Black Friday anarchy is outdated .
Retailers are in a bigger-than-ever shipping battle this year, and that’s creating new conveniences for you.
Not sure what tech gifts should be on your list? The Post has you covered .

Opening in the ValleyWritten by H S Panag |

THE high voter turnout in the first phase of elections in Jammu and Kashmir is hopefully indicative of the trend and provides a great opportunity for the Centre and the incoming state government to revamp political and military strategy. But military strategy must flow out of political strategy and not vice versa.
Two recent cases have put AFSPA back in the firing line. Earlier this month, two civilians were killed when soldiers fired at their car — a clear overreaction —  when it failed to stop at a roadblock in Budgam. The GOC-in-C, Northern Command, has since apologised for the incident and a court of inquiry has indicted nine soldiers, recommending court martial proceedings.
Also, the court martial in the Machil case of April 2010 was concluded this September, though it only made headlines in November. Five army personnel, including the commanding officer of the unit, were cashiered or dismissed from service and awarded life imprisonment. The media coverage has implied that these cases are special, that most past instances of human rights violations have been brushed under the carpet by invoking AFSPA. But in fact, over the years, more than a hundred court martials have been held by the army in cases of human rights violations, with sentences ranging from dismissal to life imprisonment. The army’s track record in investigating and punishing human rights violations has been exemplary.
The Machil encounter was an open-and-shut case of rogue behaviour. By the end of May 2010, investigations had prima facie established that it was fake. This led to violent protests, to which security forces had to respond, which led to yet more violent protests — 112 civilians died between June and September. After initial denials, the army ordered a court of inquiry. By the end of December 2010, it was concluded that the case warranted disciplinary action against the accused. This delay was a serious lapse on the part of the brigade and division commanders. Most senior commanders can tell if an encounter is genuine. Its circumstances, the number of rounds fired, casualties, the type/ condition of weapons recovered, police and intelligence reports and press coverage leave little room for doubt. In Machil, the unit stood by its story, but the higher commanders were also complicit in trying to safeguard the reputation of the unit, the formation and the army.
After being mired in jurisdiction-related issues, the cases against the personnel were finally handed over to the army in March 2013. It took another year for investigations and six continued…

Where the frontline is key to the bottomlineIn some states, teacher salaries account for as much as 90 per cent of the education budget. These high salary costs might be worth it if they resulted in high quality education.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly promised India “maximum governance”. But to get there, the high costs and ineffectiveness of frontline service providers need to be addressed. Take elementary school teachers, for instance.
“Complete rest in comfortable conditions” is the description a rather candid elementary education cluster resource centre coordinator (CRCC) in Bihar gave his own job. And it’s not just him, it is also how the CRCC describes teaching from a government teacher’s perspective: “a government (that is, a comfortable) job”. This CRCC — responsible for academic support to teachers in 15-20 government schools — concludes: “The same teacher is likely to work harder and with greater effort in a private school.” What he doesn’t point out is that less effort comes with much higher pay but much lower student learning.
This CRCC’s experience in Bihar resonates with recent research on the state of India’s elementary education system. Nearly every empirical study on teachers in India shows that government teachers command high salaries. Significantly higher, as Geeta Kingdon’s work in Uttar Pradesh shows, than private sector teachers. In UP, government teachers earn 20 times more than private sector counterparts. But, rather than working harder and better, evidence shows that government teachers are often missing in action. Karthik Muralidharan’s 2014 study estimates an absence rate of 23.6 per cent. And when they are present, they spend much of their day engaged in non-teaching activities, or teaching with little professional competence, and exercise little effort.
But even as research on government teachers has highlighted the “comfortable conditions” under which they work, the full extent of the implications of these high wages and low levels of performance can only be judged through an analysis of the costs this imposes both on the learning achievement of children and on fiscal health.
The starting point for any discussion on efficiency is the distinction between “accounting cost” and “economic cost.” The “accounting cost” is what the government spends on budget. The “economic cost” is the lowest possible cost at which services of a particular quantity and quality can be obtained. Wasteful expenditure can be included on government books as an “accounting cost”, but the excess over economic cost is conceptually not a “cost” but a “subsidy.”
To estimate the “accounting” and “economic” costs of a year of schooling, we draw on a data compiled by Accountability Initiative. These estimates show that in 2011-12 the accounting cost of education was Rs 14,615 per schooling year per student in a government school. The cost of sending a student continued…

Nationwide air ambulance project set to take offDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
India will soon have a nationwide air ambulance service which could turn out to be affordable for common people with a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 or an insurance cover.
Helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS), which is common in developed countries, is expected to kick off in India in the last quarter of 2015, with three companies — Aviators Air Rescue Pvt Ltd, an Indian operator, Air Medical Group Holdings Inc, an air medical provider in the US and Airbus Helicopters — signing a tripartitie agreement.
To start with, the proposed HEMS will begin operations from South India, using three Airbus Helicopters-built EC135 T3/P3 helicopters operated by Aviators. “More such helicopters are expected to be phased in during 2016 for expanded nationwide coverage. We expect to cover the entire country within three years as we are adding at least even helicopters per year,” said Arun Sharma, managing director of Aviators Air Rescue.
“This service will be affordable to a person drawing a monthly salary of Rs 15,000-20,000. It’s very affordable and we are putting our final touches to the numbers,” Sharma told The Indian Express. “Each helicopter will be operated by two pilots and two medical crew. This service will be available nationwide with at least one helicopter covering the state,” he said.
Sharma said the company is in discussions with insurance companies to make it affordable to common people. “There will be a premium to avail such a service. The service is affordable without insurance in its current offering,” Sharma said.
He said in this first phase, there will be seven helicopters with a total investment of approximately $60 million. “We will tie up with hospitals and discussions are in the final stages,” he said.
What can really make the HEMS popular and affordable will be the availability of insurance coverage for using such facilities. “One simple possibility is to give such emergency cover add-on cover to health and PA policies. The add-on cover is possible with life insurance policies. Yes, there will be extra premium for the add-on cover but it may not be significant,” said former IRDA Member (life) KK Srinivasan.
The project has selected EC135 T3/P3 helicopter made by Airbus. “With the support of Airbus Helicopters and Air Medical Group Holdings which are leaders in their respective fields, Aviators will provide top-notch air medical services,” Sharma said.

A HIGH-STEPPING THANKSGIVING TALE or: How Cul de Sacs Richard Thompson got a toehold in the world of humor-column writing(Sketch by Michael “Canvas” Cavna/The Washington Post)
 
THIS WEEK, the illustrious and artistically diverse career of Richard Thompson is receiving renewed celebration in a beautiful career-retrospective book. The expansive look at the art of the “Cul de Sac” creator, titled (no doubt after much authorial hand-wringing) “The Art of Richard Thompson,” largely spotlights the Virginia-based cartoonist’s humorous illustration and paintings. At one point in the book, readers are treated to Thompson’s immense gifts as strictly a prose writer. I could diagram at least three-dozen reasons why Thompson is a deft and knowing humor writer, but instead, you should enjoy this yarn for yourself.
The premise and purpose of Thompson’s column was this: In November of 2002, the cartoonist was providing the weekly artwork to accompany Gene Weingarten’s Post Magazine humor column. On a comedic whim, the two men decided to trade places. And Thompson, if nothing else, had far more space to fill.
When I re-read Thompson’s column this week, I was struck by just how hilarious it was. And I felt kind of guilty, enjoying the surrogate as much as I did. That is, until I heard Weingarten himself declare that this was one of the funniest columns in the history of “Below the Beltway.”
So without further ado or to-do, here is Thompson’s Thanksgiving tale:
OOO
This week, Gene Weingarten and I will be switching places. I am usually the cartoonist for this column, but this week I will write and he will draw. It’s an experiment in adaptability, the belief at the Post being that not only is no one indispensable, but all are equally interchangeable. Next week I get a shot at Charles Krauthammer’s column and Gene gets the Animal Watch report.
I had hoped to write something like Gene would, a piece of depth and power that holds the cold mirror of satire up to the dirty face of humanity, and maybe work in some jokes about barfing dogs. Except I don’t have any dogs; there are some cats around here but all they do is eat so much string that it comes out their rears, like flossing. But there’s nothing funny about that. It’s sad, really.
So I thought I’d try another Gene thing, maybe just stand on a street corner and ask passersby a Gene question like, “Do you have a stupid name?” Except I live in the suburbs and the only people on the street corner were some kids in orange vesty things, either school crossing guards or tiny utility workers. And both their names were Jason, so that went nowhere.
So instead, in keeping with the holiday season and the columnist’s mandate to write about his own puny life, I decided to do a Thanksgiving column about me.
Ten years ago this very week, my wife, Amy, and I were about to celebrate our first Thanksgiving as a married couple. We were going to serve a large feast on our new plates on our new table in our new home for as many of our extended families as could make it. The night before Thanksgiving, we went to a bar with friends and we had a most festive and enjoyable time, I personally enjoying it more than anyone else. When we got home, in hopes of continuing my festively enjoyable tune, I started dancing around like Fred Astaire would if Fred Astaire danced in his socks.
Our house was old and strangely shaped and it was heated by radiators, big iron monsters, all coils and ribs and flanges, the kind of fixture that would give sensitive children nightmares. I, as Fred Astaire would not, executed a kick that planted my foot squarely into the radiator in the hall, good and hard.
Amy, seeing me suddenly rolling around on the floor, thought I was still enjoying myself, until I pulled my sock off. One toe was bent completely back, and since it was the middle one, it looked like my foot was giving me the toe, if you know what I mean. It was indescribably funny, in a silent-film-comedy-trauma way. And it hurt like “the dickens.” The dickens is when the entire output of Charles Dickens — all fifteen hardbound novels plus journalism, letters and ephemera — is simultaneously dropped from a height and hits you.
The folks at the emergency room were extremely helpful and didn’t laugh and didn’t yell at me when I did some doughnuts with the wheelchair and knocked over the IV stand. But the nurse on duty did tell me an awful story about when he was in the Navy and won a $300 bet that he couldn’t pull all the hairs off the top of his foot with tweezers without screaming. And they gave me some Tylenol 3, the kind with codeine, the kind that comes with the warning that not everybody reacts well to codeine.
So that is how I ended up at the head of our table the next day, Thanksgiving Day, with my mangled foot elevated on another chair, presiding over our first Thanksgiving feast. And that is when, not ten minutes into the meal, I found out I was one of the people who reacts badly to codeine. And it was Amy who quickly handed me a bowl, the family one that matched our new plates and was fortunately empty, for me to react badly in.
It’s been ten years. The toe’s still there, of course, though it’s still bent a little funny. The house is gone, or at least so renovated it’s unrecognizable, and good riddance; it was an asbestos-clad eyesore and a menace.
Somehow, subsequent family holidays have never quite matched the First Thanksgiving for intensity of emotion, not the Christmas of the Flaming Oven Mitt, or the Other Thanksgiving When the Fireplace Blew Up, or that Day or Two Before Easter When We Had to Evacuate Because of a Carbon Monoxide Leak That Almost Killed Everybody.
The only downside is that, ever since I broke my toe that night. I’ve been forced to draw with my hands.

When State Line is gone, could it become home to more pollution?
Over the last several weeks, drivers coming over the Skyway have watched as State Line is being dismantled pie
During its 83 years of operation, State Line Power Station was one of the top polluters in the Chicago area.
Now it's being torn down, but some environmentalists fear that the site could become the site of another form of pollution — petcoke, a form of refinery waste.
"Community members are concerned that they may have traded one environmental polluter for another" said the Delta Institute, a Chicago-based nonprofit sustainability organization which has studied the site's redevelopment.
  Open link
The State Line plant has been purchased by a company with the same principals as Beemsterboer Slag, which recently opted to sell its storage terminal along the Calumet River at 106th Street rather than continue to fight a series of lawsuits and regulatory actions filed against the company by city, state and federal officials over massive piles of petcoke it stored on Chicago's Southeast Side.
The Beemsterboers could not be reached for comment.
Over the last several weeks, drivers coming over the Skyway have watched as the plant is being dismantled piece by piece.

A new life for coal plants0
Built in 1905 to generate power for a 55-acre Sears complex, the site sat vacant until 2009 when it was redeveloped into an environmentally certified Henry Ford Academy charter school known as "Power House High," with about 1,000 students from pre-kindergarten to high school. The site also includes a community center and housing.
Seaholm power plant
Austin, Texas. Stopped operating as coal plant: 1989
A local activist group pressured the city to close the plant, once Austin's main source of electricity. It was redeveloped in 2006. The city lent $27.5 million to five local companies to work together on the $130 million project. When complete in 2015, the development will include a 22-story hotel and apartments, retail, restaurants, an acre of green space and community spaces.
Elk River generation station
Elk River, Minn. Stopped operating as coal plant: 1989
Elk River, built in 1950, has been a coal plant, an oil-fired plant and a nuclear plant. In 1989, it was converted into a waste-to-energy facility called Great River Energy. The plant diverts 300,000 tons of municipal solid waste from landfills each year. Under Minnesota law, it is considered a renewable source of energy and is owned by one of the largest customer-owned cooperatives in the nation.
Potomac River generating station
Alexandria, Va. Stopped operating as a coal plant: 2012
The shutdown of this 514-megawatt plant, formerly owned by Gen-On (acquired by NRG Energy), was largely the result of a community campaign known as "Gen-Off" led by several environmental groups. The plant has been demolished to make away for a new development called Potomac River Green, a $450 million project by the nonprofit American Clean Skies Foundation in collaboration with the city. The plan calls for riverfront green space, residential housing, retail and community spaces by 2018.

Asian equity markets were mixed on Friday on the back of weak economic data but airline stocks outperformed as oil prices extended their slide.
Brent crude hovered near a four-year low hit on Thursday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided not to cut oil production.
October data from Japan before the market open showed consumer price inflation (CPI) slowing to its lowest level in a year and household spending down for a seventh straight month. Meanwhile, South Korean industrial output unexpectedly declined 1.6 percent on month in October, missing forecasts for a 0.8 percent gain.
The absence of a US lead also damped sentiment. Wall Street was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and will reopen on Friday for a shortened session.

Thomas Jefferson on seeking Gods favorBy Eugene Volokh November 27 Follow @volokhc
Will Baude’s post , quoting Washington’s Thanksgiving proclamation and Jefferson’s message criticizing such Presidential proclamations, reminded me of this passage from Jefferson’s Second Inaugural Address:
I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land, and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence, and our riper years with his wisdom and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join with me in supplications, that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do, shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.
I think Jefferson’s position in making this statement could certainly be reconciled with his position regarding Thanksgiving proclamations. Still, I think it’s worthwhile for us to remember — and especially those of us who, like me, are not religious — that even Jefferson (who was somewhat unusual in his reticence to use religion in public life) was quite willing to include religious messages in his public statements as President, or in state legislation such as his Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom:
Whereas, Almighty God hath created the mind free;
That all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens, or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and therefore are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, who being Lord, both of body and mind yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do, …
There may be justification for a legal rule excluding religious symbolism or text from government speech, whether the addresses of individual officials, albeit on governmental occasions such as inaugurations, or the statements of state legislatures. (Will didn’t advocate such a rule, but of course many people have.) But I don’t think Jefferson’s actual practice does much to support that position.
Eugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.

Rahul Gandhi visits slums  warns government against demolition driveAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi yesterday visited the Rangpuri Pahadi slums in the city and warned the Centre against further such move, saying “if they want to use the bulldozer again, let them drive it over my body”.
Vowing to fight for the poor who were left homeless after Tuesday’s demolition drive, Rahul said, “What is happening here is completely wrong and the Congress party is not going to leave this issue. They have won this time, but if they want to use the bulldozer again, let them drive it over my body.”
The Congress Vice President reached the Rangpuri Pahadi slums on the southern edge of Vasant Kunj, where demolition of around 900 housing units has rendered thousands homeless, around 8 PM and spent around half-an-hour with the residents and listened to their woes.
“Winter is here. It is getting colder these days and the poor people have been picked up and thrown out of their homes. They were not given any warning. This is being done by the government here, the Congress party will fight for the poor,” he told reporters amid a near-stampede like situation in Rangpuri Pahadi slums.
The Congress vice president’s visit to the area came on a day when the issue reverberated in Parliament.
Raising the issue in Rajya Sabha, CPI(M) member T N Seema said 2,000 children have been thrown out in the cold due to the drive. “Securing trees are important but is it more important than human lives,” she said, urging the government to immediately stop the demolition drive.
Around 900 jhuggis were demolished on Tuesday by Revenue and Forest departments at Rangpuri hills of Vasant Kunj area of south Delhi. The drive, which was carried out by a district task force, left many homeless in the capital’s harsh winter.
A senior Delhi government official had said the drive was part of an effort to restore forest areas.
The people, however claimed that they have been living in the area for decades and they even had documentation such as Aadhar, Voter ID and Ration card.

OPEC holds output cut despite price slumpOPEC decides against output cut despite price slump
George Jahn     Vienna   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 10:24 IST

Reflecting its lessening oil clout, OPEC has decided to keep its output target on hold and sit out falling crude prices that will likely spiral even lower as a result.
Oil prices fell sharply on the news. Even though the decision was largely expected, it showed the once-powerful cartel is losing the power to push up markets to its own advantage.
OPEC has traditionally relied on output cuts to regulate supply and prices. But it appeared to realise on Thursday that with cheap crude in oversupply, a reduction would only cut into OPEC's share of the market without a lasting boost in prices and with others outside the cartel making up the difference.
Instead, the move to maintain a production target of 30 million barrels a day appeared to reflect acceptance of the Saudi view within OPEC that short-term pain had to be accepted for later gain.
The Saudis and their Gulf allies hope to put economic pressure on rival producers in the US, which need higher prices to break even. In the long term, that could help reaffirm OPEC's dominance of the oil market.
It would also be good news for consumers and oil-importing nations.
The global price plunged $5 to a four-year low of $72.76 a barrel. As recently as June it was around $115.
Oil ministers had come to Thursday's meeting facing two unpalatable choices: Cut their production from 30 million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices and see OPEC's market share fall, or do nothing in hopes of riding out the crisis.
Paring output may not have been very effective because supply from non-OPEC countries, like the US, remains high. Also, discipline within the 12-member organization is lax and overproduction by some members would have cut into the effectiveness of any production cut.
In any case, OPEC could have not afforded to scale back production by more than 1 million barrels a day - too little to make a sizable dent in supply.
OPEC Secretary General Abdullah Al-Badry suggested all members were on board with the decision to stick to the present output level, telling reporters "the ministers are happy."
"I see no nagging from consumers, no nagging from producers," he told reporters.
In fact, the decision once again appeared to reflect Saudi Arabia's clout over less powerful OPEC rivals.
By opposing an output cut, Saudi Arabia appears to be hoping to drive prices below the level at which shale oil production is economical. Experts say shale oil production turns too costly at the $60 a barrel level.
"When it comes to the raw decision-making, that is left to the unofficial leader, Saudi Arabia," said Alfa Energy chairman John Hall.
Accounting for about a third of OPEC output, the Saudis can weather lower prices because their coffers are well-padded and its production costs are relatively low.
But poorer OPEC members like Venezuela and Nigeria need levels close to $100 or above to fund national budgets. Saudi rival Iran is suffering, too, with the price drop adding to huge revenue losses due to sanctions on its crude sales imposed over its nuclear program.
If sanctions were to be lifted as part of a nuclear agreement next year, Iran still would need prices close to $140 a barrel to finance the government budget. Crude export revenues finance more than 50 percent of the government's outlays.
In the case of Venezuela, the International Monetary Fund says it needs to sell oil at around $120 a barrel to avoid the threat of national bankruptcy. Bank of America estimates that for every dollar that oil prices drop, the state loses $770 million in net revenue over a year. That puts revenue $12 billion a year below peak levels even if current prices don't fall further.
Nigeria also needs a stronger market to flourish. Analysts say the government has organized its 2015 budget around an oil price of $78 a barrel based on production of 2.4 million barrels a day - but the country is pumping only about 2 million barrels a day.
Angola, Ecuador and other OPEC members with limited production may also suffer - but not so Saudi Arabia's wealthy allies Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.
Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said the "OPEC decision was not entirely what we wanted," and analysts suggested that others share that view.
"I think you're going to see additional tension between the OPEC ranks," said Jamie Webster, senior director of crude oil markets at IHS consultants.

Sensex, Nifty Soar to Record Highs on Falling Brent Crude Prices
NDTV | Updated On: November 28, 2014 16:18 (IST)
Fund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
The Sensex ended at a record high on Friday tracking the sharp fall in the price of Brent crude. The 30-scrip index gained 255 points to settle at 28,694 while the Nifty finished at 8,588.25, up 94 points from Thursday's close.
(Also read: BSE's market cap hits Rs 1 lakh crore )
Brent crude fell towards $72 a barrel on Friday, close to a four-year low, after 12-member cartel OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices. OPEC's decision marked a "watershed" for oil markets, Barclays analysts said in a note. ( Read the full story here )
India is dependent on imports for 75-80 per cent of its domestic energy requirements and crude oil accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the country's import bill. The fall in crude prices, therefore, translates in to huge foreign exchange savings for the country. ( Read: Petrol below Rs 60/litre? )
Falling oil prices also lower the government's subsidy payout towards selling LPG and kerosene at below-market prices, leading to narrowing of the fiscal deficit.
Global brokerage Nomura says every $10 per barrel fall in oil price can boost India's GDP growth by around 0.1 percentage points, lower consumer inflation by about 0.2 per cent and improve current account balance by 0.5 per cent of GDP.
Friday's rally is a testimony of the big positives India is set to accrue from falling oil prices.
Independent analyst Sanjeev Bhasin told NDTV that oil below $70 could trigger another bout of buying in stocks as investors take out money from oil and gold and increases exposure to equities.
Oil marketing companies were the big gainers on Friday. State-run BPCL (745.85, +3.58%) was among the top Nifty gainers. Banks gained on hopes of lower fiscal deficit. ICICI Bank (1,754.60, +1.88%) and State Bank of India (321.45, +5.10%) were among the top Nifty gainers.
Airline stocks surged on hopes of lower aviation turbine fuel and Jet Airways (322.05, +19.99%) and SpiceJet (18.24, +18.36%) were the big gainers today.
In intraday trade, the Sensex hit a record high of 28,822, while the Nifty hit its all-time high of 8,617. Indian stock markets have gained over 30 per cent year-to-date on account of huge foreign fund flows. Overseas investors continued their buying spree for the sixth straight session. They bought shares worth Rs 390 crore on Thursday.
Big data point today:
Markets may witness some choppiness ahead of the release of economic growth data later on Friday. India's economic growth probably slowed to 5.1 per cent in the July-September quarter from a year ago, but economists polled by Reuters doubted whether that would be enough to persuade the central bank to cut interest rates next week.

Brent Near 4-Year Low After OPEC Decides Against Output CutAsian Stocks Mostly Lower as Oil Hits New Troughs
London: Brent crude fell to a fresh four-year low under $72 per barrel on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided not to cut output, a move investors said would leave oil markets heavily oversupplied.
Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of OPEC for output reductions on Thursday, triggering a rout in oil markets.
The sell-off continued on Friday with Brent reaching a low of $71.12, its weakest since July 2010. By 0945 GMT (3:15 p.m. in India), Brent had recovered a little to trade around $71.90, down 68 cents.
US crude oil hit a low of $67.75 a barrel on Friday, its lowest since May 2010 and down from Wednesday's close of $73.69. US financial markets were closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving.
"Welcome to the new world of oil," said Michael Wittner, senior oil analyst at French bank Societe Generale. "Saudi Arabia and OPEC will no longer be the mechanism to balance the market, they have relinquished that role."
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," he added.
Brent was headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
It has lost more than a third of its value since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America has helped create an oil glut at a time of sluggish global economic growth.
"The market is looking for a new paradigm, a new range to settle into. Where that is, is anybody's guess. It could be $60, $70, or maybe even $80 a barrel," said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
"We think somewhere between $70 and $80 a barrel is probably about right. But we shall see."
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, he said.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

New Delhi: Ratings agency ICRA on Thursday upgraded by a notch rating of Rs 3,210-crore loan facility given to Jet Airways based on improvement in cash flows.
The rating agency has upgraded the long-term rating assigned to the Rs 3,210 crore, fund-based bank facilities of Jet Airways to [ICRA]BB from [ICRA]C, a statement said.
"The rating upgrade takes into account the improvement in the liquidity and credit profile of the company, arising from improved operating performance as well as support from its strategic partner-Etihad Airways PJSC," it said.
The ratings reflect the strategic initiatives being planned by Jet Airways together with its strategic partner in reshaping its business so as to enable it to return to sustainable profitability and improve cash flows, it said.
This strategic alliance between the two airlines is expected to be mutually beneficial across all areas, including network growth, operational synergies and cost improvement through maintenance contract renegotiations, leasing of spare aircraft, procurement of fuel and other services etc. resulting in cost savings for both the airlines, it said.

Nepal media critical of Narendra Modi s bilateral political engagementAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s advice to Nepal’s warring political parties on the Constitution-making process was criticised by the media here which termed it as “breaching of diplomatic norms”.
Critical comments appeared in some of Nepal’s national newspapers regarding  Narendra Modi’s advice to political parties on the long-delayed drafting of the country’s constitution.
During his bilateral engagements with Nepalese political leaders,  Narendra Modi had urged them to forge consensus to draft the constitution and asked them not to delay the process and meet the January 22 deadline.
“The Prime Minister’s (Modi’s) advice to forge consensus among political parties to write a constitution seems to be directed against the ruling alliances, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, which are making attempts to write the statute through majority votes,” the Kantipur national daily said in an editorial.
Narendra Modi’s call for promulgating the constitution within the January 22 deadline seems to be another pressure tactic against the opposition parties including the Unified CPN-Maoist and the Madhesi parties, the daily said.
Narendra Modi had advised political parties not to make decision on the basis of majority, which undermines the procedure specified in Nepal’s Interim Constitution, the daily said, terming it as an attempt to breach diplomatic norms.
The UCPN-Maoist-led alliance, which is against adopting democratic procedure in writing the Constitution, has been encouraged by Modi’s remarks, according to another national daily Nagarik.
However, it is true that the Constitution should be acceptable to all sides as prescribed by Modi, the daily admitted in its editorial.
The talks initiated by Modi with the leaders of various political parties in Nepal may be termed as the beginning of a new kind of diplomacy of the southern neighbour, adds the daily.
Narendra Modi seems to have shown more concern for the internal politics of Nepal this time as compared to what he had done during his first visit to the country, it said.

Telangana unveils new industrial policy frameworkAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Nearly six months after Telangana was born, the state government yesterday unveiled a new industrial policy framework promising rationalisation of taxes and offering incentives, eyeing up to 5 per cent higher manufacturing sector growth than national average.
“Innovate in Telangana, Invest in Telangana, Incorporate in Telangana” would be the motto of industrialisation in the state, the government said.
The vision for the new state’s industrialisation is ‘Research to Innovation; Innovation to Industry; Industry to Prosperity’.
“It is strongly believed that with the new industrial policy in place, a growth rate of 4-5 per cent greater than the national growth rate in the manufacturing sector can be achieved,” the policy document said.
To supplement Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH) and encourage innovation and incubation, the government would create a Research to Market Fund (RMF) to encourage entrepreneurial activity.
It would provide a matching contribution of up to Rs 100 crore to RMF for amounts contributed by private venture capitalists and angel investors.
The state government would remove and revise archaic and outdated laws that adversely impact industry and industrialisation.
The government noted that distortions in tax structure lead to evasion of taxes and clandestine transport of industrial inputs and outputs to neighbouring states, which may have advantageous tax rates.
“To address this problem, inter-state tax rationalisation on industrial inputs and outputs with states like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be brought within a short span of time,” the policy said.
There would be enhanced incentive packages for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, physically handicapped and women entrepreneurs.
Mega projects with an investment of over Rs 200 crore in plant and machinery or employment above 1,000 people will receive tailor-made incentives in addition to standard large- category industry incentives, it was stated.
The government would consider providing incentives to entrepreneurs in areas like stamp duty reimbursement, land cost rebate, land conversion cost and power cost reimbursement, under its T-IDEA (Telangana State Industrial Development and Entrepreneur Advancement) incentive scheme.
“The cornerstone of the policy would be zero graft and zero tolerance to corruption, and the decision-making in all Departments in Telangana will be transparent. Department heads will be held responsible for all acts of omission and commission by staff under their jurisdiction,” it said.
An online and help-desk grievance redressal system would be put in place where entrepreneurs will be encouraged to report instances of corruption or any delay in approvals.
Timely and strict disciplinary action would be taken against those employees who violate the parameters of the industrial policy framework.
The policy will make special provisions for SME and micro sectors, including making available adequate number of smaller plots in industrial parks for them.
Unveiling the policy in the Assembly, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the new framework intended to provide a business regulatory environment “where doing business would be as easy as shaking hands”.
“Innovation and technology will drive the industries of Telangana,” he added.
The thrust areas identified by the Government include life sciences (including bulk drugs and formulations), IT hardware, precision engineering (including aerospace, aviation and defence), food processing, automobiles, textiles and apparel, plastics, gems and jewellery.
Simultaneously, a Bill was also introduced in the Assembly to enact the Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-certification System (TS-iPASS) that would be a “single window without grills” for clearing all investment proposals.
The Bill was passed late in the evening after certain amendments proposed by the Opposition parties were rejected by the House.
The new legislation would bestow a “right to single window clearance” for all applicants, on the lines of the Right to Information, the Chief Minister, who also holds the Industries portfolio, said.
“The government is determined to create an ecosystem in which the ease of doing business in the state matches and even exceeds the best global standards.
“We are aware that offering a hassle-free system is considered to be of the highest priority by industrialists, and accordingly the Government will implement a very effective industrial clearance system that will go beyond the traditional single window system.”
As part of the policy, the Government would launch initiatives like T-PRIDE (Telangana State Programme for Rapid Incubation of Dalit Entrepreneurs), T-HART (Telangana State Handicrafts and Artisans Revival with Technology), T-ASSIST (Accelerated SSI Skills Training) and T-IDEA (Industrial Development and Entrepreneur Advancement).
The Chief Minister said a land bank of 30 lakh acres was available in the state, while 2.5 lakh to 2.75 lakh acres can be used for industrial activity.
Referring to the prevailing power crisis, Rao said there was a shortage of 800-1200 MW at present but the state would get 2,200 MW in the next two years. “We will set up a separate power distribution company for industries once we overcome the shortfall.”
In large industrial parks, the Government would facilitate setting up of private merchant power plants with 300-500 MW capacity, he said.
The Chief Minister said Hyderabad-Warangal, Hyderabad- Nagpur and Hyderabad-Bengaluru industrial corridors would be developed in the first phase.
In the second phase, Hyderabad-Mancherial, Hyderabad- Nalgonda and Hyderabad-Khammam industrial corridors would be developed along the national and state highways.
Opposition parties Congress, Telugu Desam, BJP and others welcomed the new policy and extended support to the Government.

Rupee down 6 paise against US dollar  at 61.93Forex Update: Rupee closes at 9-mth low of 62.03 on sustained dollar demand

Bucking the strong trend in stocks, the Indian rupee on Friday tumbled 16 paise to close at almost nine-month low of 62.03 against the greenback following sustained dollar demand from importers, including oil firms.
The rupee was also under pressure after government data showed that fiscal deficit touched 89.6 per cent of the Budget Estimates for 2014-15 to cross Rs 4.75 lakh crore at the end of October.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced lower at 61.93 a dollar from previous close of 61.87. It tried to recover by touching intra-day high of 61.8775.
Later, it met with strong resistance on heavy month-end dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners, and fell back to a low of 62.0725. It finally concluded at 62.03, showing a fall of 16 paise or 0.26 per cent.
Previously, it had closed at 62.04 on March 3, 2014.
Stocks continued their upward sprint for the third straight session on Friday with benchmark BSE Sensex galloping 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty surging 94.05 points to 8,588.25 as tumbling oil prices strengthened the case for a rate cut by the RBI next week.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) injected $119.41 million on Thursday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was up by 0.14 per cent against its major global rivals.
Veracity Group CEO Pramit Brahmbhatt said: "Rupee traded weak today taking cues from the dollar demand from oil importers though local equities traded strong. The trading range for the spot $/INR pair is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40." .
In the forward market, premia moved down further on sustained receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April dipped to 190-192 paise from last close of 194.5-196.5 paise.
Forward contracts maturing in October, 2015, also dropped to 402-404 paise from 411.5-413.5 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.9736 and for the Euro at 77.1633.
The rupee recovered slightly against the pound to 97.34 from Thursday's close of 97.48 and also rebounded to 52.48 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.66.
It, however, declined further to 77.29 per euro from 77.18.

Tax relief beyond Dec to give a fillip to auto sectorDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
The concessional lower excise duty on cars, motor cycles and small commercial vehicles is likely to get a further extension as part of the Narendra Modi government’s efforts to revive the manufacturing sector. The move will act as a significant fillip for automakers who are yet to see any significant improvement in sales.
The sop, as per an announcement in Budget FY15, is to expire by December 31.
“Car sales are down. The government could extend tax relief to the auto sector beyond December 31,” said a source in the government.
If extended, small cars, scooters, motor cycles and commercial vehicles will continue to attract 8% excise duty, mid-segment cars will bear
20% duty, while sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and large cars will attract 24% duty.
These products were bearing four to six percentage points higher duty prior to February 17, 2014 when the tax was slashed by the previous UPA regime for a period up to June 30. In the last week of June, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an extension up to this year end.
The minister said then that continuation of the concessional duty would benefit the economy and therefore the revenue loss in the short term could be made up in the long term. The government expected the car makers to pass on the benefit of duty concessions to consumers and show positive growth response in the subsequent months.
Most carmakers, however, did not cut prices across the board but chose to give record discounts on select low-selling models. They also passed on the duty cut benefit by way of delaying their impending price increase decisions in the hope of an increase in demand. This strategy helped them preserve margins.
Passenger vehicle sales, which includes cars, utility vehicles and vans, had recovered in May this year after the growth fell to over a decade’s low. But after five consecutive months of growth till September, domestic passenger vehicle sales shocked most with a 7.5% year-on-year drop in October to 2.21 lakh units. This was especially disappointing since October was a festival month with both Diwali and the Navratras.
Industry executives now expect car sales to show up to a 5% rise this fiscal (FY15), with a bigger jump coming next year (FY16) as overall economic growth takes a more firm footing and consumer confidence makes a stronger comeback.
The signs are already there in terms of increased footfalls at showrooms, yet converting them to purchases has proved a challenge.
Sumit Sawhney, country chief executive officer and managing director for Renault operations in India, said the industry had welcomed the announcement about six months ago to maintain the reduction in excise duty.
“I think the government should continue to do so going forward as well. Taking a long term view, the government has to have a unified excise duty structure and further reduce the duty. Indian auto industry has been going through a rough patch lately and this move will provide the necessary impetus to the industry,” said Sawhney.

Chivas  United Spirits may bury hatchet over Tribute trademarkTigerair, Axis Bank to offer one-way free ticket from Singapore
The battle between liquor majors Chivas Holdings and United Spirits over the trademark ‘Tribute’ seems to be heading for an amicable settlement with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) suggesting the two companies to explore the possibility of ending the litigation.
Agreeing, in-principle, to the proposal put forth by IPAB, the counsels for both parties sought time to come back after consulting the respective companies.
The liquor majors locked horns when Chivas, which has ‘Royal Salute Tribute to Honour’ scotch whisky brand, had moved IPAB with a rectification petition against United Spirits’ Tribute whisky mark, in order to have their brand in the market with the ‘Tribute’ tagline.
United Spirits, in which Diageo, the world’s largest distiller, recently acquired a controlling stake, opposed the move while Chivas argued that the brand of the company is an international one and,hence, it has to be marketed in India.
The IPAB bench said that as both the parties have agreed to arrive at an amicable settlement of the dispute, the matter has been adjourned to March 5.
IPAB, while hearing the case, suggested that since the Chivas brand is of premium class, United Spirits needn’t worry about its presence — its whisky falls under a different class.
According to registry documents, USL had registered the mark ‘Tribute’ under Class 33 of the trademark (alcoholic beverages) proposed to be used for its whisky. On the other hand, Chivas Holdings uses the word ‘Tribute’ in its premium scotch whisky brand ‘Royal Salute A Tribute to Honour’ and ‘Royal Salute The Diamond Tribute.’
The counsel for Chivas argued that while the trademark has been registered for several years, USL had not put the mark into use and, hence, it has to be removed from the registry.
However, the counsel for United Spirits submitted that the company had registered the trademark to use it for its whisky products and had recently renewed the same in order to use it in near future.

Indian Oil planning Rs 20 000-crore petrochem complex in OdishaTigerair, Axis Bank to offer one-way free ticket from Singapore
India’s largest refiner and oil marketing company, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), is conducting feasibility studies to set up a petrochemical complex at Paradip in Odisha for R20,000 crore, said Debasis Sen, director (planning & business development) at the government-owned firm.
The petrochemical complex would be built in the vicinity of the company’s to-be-commissioned 15-million-tonne-per-annum (mtpa) greenfield refinery at Paradip, which is likley to be ready in FY16.
Sen told FE that the petrochemical complex would be in addition to the already announced R3,150-crore poly propylene project at the same location. On November 16, minister of state (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, laid the foundation stone for the unit in the port city of Paradip.
“We are currently doing feasibility studies on the molecules, which I cannot disclose due to trade secrets. The work on the petrochemical complex would start after the refinery is commissioned,” the director said.
In a petrochemical complex, ethylene derivate complex is used to manufacture value-added products such as mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Monoethylene glycol has a wide range of uses, from making polyester chips, PET bottles and industrial yarn to coolants, paints and wire enamels, among others.
The PSU firm saw revenues from the petrochemical business grow 38% in the second quarter of FY15 to R5,343.04 crore from R3,874.73 crore in the same quarter last year. IOC targets to aggressively increase market share in the petrochemical business. In FY14, it garnered R18,125.73 crore from the segment.
Currently, Reliance Industries generates maximum revenue from petrochemical production. In the July-September quarter of the current fiscal, its revenues from the segment were R24,932 crore. In FY14, RIL made R96,465 crore from the petrochemical segment.
Natural gas transporting and marketing company GAIL (India) is another manufacturer of petrochemicals. It recorded revenues of R1,281.41 crore for the business in the second quarter of FY15. In FY14, GAIL reported R4,537.2-crore revenues from the petrochemical segment.
IOC, in its endeavour to diversify and grow as an integrated energy company, has made the petrochemical business one of the priorities,
Sen explained.
The industry’s structural oversupply and increased exports from China will keep Asian refining margins under pressure over the next 12-18 months, Moody’s said in a report released on Thursday.
According to Moody’s, Asian refiners will see aggregate Ebitda grow by around 5% through 2015, with the higher output of refined oil products more than offsetting the impact of weak refining margins on earnings.
China will continue to fuel demand for refined products in Asia, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years amid softer economic trends.
Moody’s expects Chinese demand for refined oil products to increase by 3-5% in 2015, compared to 5-10% over 2010-12.

FM hints at changing tax laws to discourage evasionFM Arun Jaitley for friendly taxes to discourage evasion
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 16:15 IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Photo: PTI)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said tax rates should be brought down to reasonable levels to get rid of rampant instances of evasion and to improve the environment for investments.
"Our tax system has to be friendly for tax payers and that is what we are trying to do step-by-step," Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on black money.
Advocating a tax structure which discourages evasion, he said there was a misconception that high tax rates lead to higher revenues.
"High tax rates do not necessarily mean more revenue collection... direct and indirect tax rates have to be brought to reasonable levels so that the basket increases and there is no incentive for tax evasion," Jaitley said. The minister added there was a time when India had very high tax rates, and the country's growth rate was mocked as 'Hindu rate of growth'.
Referring to steps being taken by the cen- tral government to unearth and bring black money stashed abroad, Jaitley said the government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list and efforts are on to complete tax assessment by March 31, 2015. He also said that prose- cution has already been launched in several cases while the cases would be filed every week, and names would be made public.
"When the media comes to know (names of black money holders), it will note that there are influential people in the list (of foreign account holders)," Jaitley said. Members of the Congress and the Trinamool Congress, however, were not sat- isfied with the finance minister's assur- ance and staged a walkout.
Asserting that the government would have to move carefully, he said that those pushing for immediate disclosure of names would be indirectly helping black money account holders as the latter would be alerted.
"Some account holders have already withdrawn money (from offshore illegal accounts)... We necessarily do not need to show bravado and adventurism," he told Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who wanted to know if money was still deposited in accounts abroad after reports of withdrawal of money from about 18 illegal accounts in Liechtenstein. Jaitley said,
"In the last few years, as an economy, we got a bad name from the world of investment for not being a tax- friendly regime." While giving an overview about treaties India has signed with various countries to deal with the black money, the finance minister hinted at changing laws as he accepted weaknesses in them. "I admit that there is a weak- ness in law. If the black money stashed abroad has to come, how will it come? Even the SIT is worried about this," Jaitley said, while answering a question on how soon could the black money be brought back.
Meanwhile in the Rajya Sabha, the government allayed apprehensions over continuance or dilution of MNREGA scheme launched by the previous UPA government, and said all necessary funds had already been released for the welfare scheme.
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said.

AMU V-C writes to HRD Minister Smriti Irani  warns BJP event on campus may spark unrestWritten by Hamza Khan | Lucknow |
Posted: November 28, 2014 1:22 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 7:15 pm
AMU has warned of “massive student unrest” and a “probability of communal conflagration” if “certain elements” proceed with their plans of celebrating Raja Mahendra Pratap Day on the campus on December 1, the Jat King’s birth anniversary.
In a letter to Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani, Vice-Chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Zameer Uddin Shah, without naming the BJP , which has called for the celebrations, or the ruling SP, which has opposed it, said the “political gamesmanship” being played out “has potential for serious trouble”.
“In view of the threat of disturbance from these people, claiming to be affiliated to various political parties/outfits, another political outfit opposing them joined the fray and announced that they would not allow the rally to be held. This political gamesmanship, if allowed to proceed, has potential for serious trouble,” Shah’s letter reads.
A row had erupted soon after UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai announced that he will celebrate the “Jat King’s” birth anniversary on AMU campus. He had claimed that the Raja donated land for the varsity.
Varsity spokesperson Rahat Abrar, meanwhile, said: “Now, AMU will not organise the programme on the campus at all.”
AMU Student’s Union, which had earlier supported the decision to organise the programme at Tikonia Ground, too has said it will not allow “the BJP or the RSS” to hold any programme inside the campus on December 1.

Let us curb welfare for migrants or risk British E.U. exit: David CameronUpdated: November 28, 2014 23:10 IST
U.K. to reduce migrant numbers

immigration
In his much-anticipated speech on migration, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron has set out a raft of measures to reduce the number of migrants — especially from the European Union — coming to the U.K.
His speech comes a day after the release of figures which suggest that net migration in 2014 is now 16,000 higher than what it was when the coalition government was formed in 2010. This has thrown completely off track the Conservative Party’s promise to bring down annual migration levels to the “tens of thousands.”
Claiming that in the 30 years up to 2004, long-term migrants to the U.K. was eight million people whereas in the last seven years a further four million migrants entered, Mr. Cameron promised to create the “toughest system in the EU for dealing with abuse of free movement.”
Mr. Cameron said the measure would include, “stronger powers to deport criminals”; tougher and longer re-entry bans for those “who abuse free movement including beggars, rough sleepers, fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages”; ending the “fraud of sham marriages” which allows any EU migrant to bring in a spouse automatically; and enforcing a rule whereby a jobseeker from the EU must have a job offer in hand to claim benefits.
Mr. Cameron said the British taxpayer supported a typical EU jobseeker with £600 a month but did not substantiate his claim.
Job requirement
The U.K. has already scrapped housing benefit for EU jobseekers, and has limited benefits claims to three months for EU migrants who do not have a job. Around 40 per cent of those arriving in the U.K. do not have work, and they will be asked to leave if they do not find work in six months, Mr. Cameron said.
Going further, Mr. Cameron promised “overhauling our welfare system” with a new benefit called Universal Credit that will replace existing ones. Alongside its introduction, he promised to pass a new EU-compatible law that prevents EU jobseekers from claiming benefits. “So instead of £600, they will get nothing,” he said.
Those who claim tax credits, child benefit and social housing must have lived and contributed in the U.K. for four years. Likening the U.K.’s national welfare system as a “national club”, Mr. Cameron said “It cannot be right that migrants can turn up and claim full rights to this club straightaway.”
Claiming that the U.K.’s economic recovery and its “generous welfare system” were the reason for it becoming the “jobs factory” for the Eurozone countries that are still grappling with soaring unemployment.

Iran s Supreme Leader Not Opposed To Nuke Talks ExtensionIran's Supreme Leader Khamenei Not Opposed To Extension Of Nuclear Talks

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's top leader on Thursday said he would not stand in the way of continued nuclear negotiations with world powers and would accept a "fair" agreement, but vowed not to bow to bullying by the United States.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke on Iranian state television, saying "I am not opposed to the extension of the talks, for the same reason that I wasn't opposed to the talks per se."
Khamenei said Washington frequently changes its stances toward Iran in the talks because of its domestic problems, a reference to differences between President Obama and Republicans who now control the U.S. Congress.
"They raise a word today. The other they withdraw from it, because of domestic problems," said Khamenei.
He said Iran would accept a fair and sensible outcome of the talks, but would not be intimidated.
"We accept rational words; we accept fair and sensible agreements. But if there are bullying and excessive demands, no we won't accept. The Islamic Republic from top to bottom and neither the people nor the authorities will accept such remarks," he said.
Referring to the waning popularity of President Obama, low turnout in the recent congressional election and racial protests in Ferguson, Missouri, Khamenei said, "The U.S. leaders need a big victory," to overcome their domestic problems.
Khamenei has the final say on all Iranian matters of state.
Iran and the major powers agreed Monday to decide by March 1 about what steps must be taken and on what schedule. A final deal is meant to follow four months later.
The Western powers suspect that Iran's nuclear research has a military dimension, but Tehran continues to insist the program is peaceful, focusing on power generation and medical research.

In a new milestone, the total market capitalisation of all listed firms at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today hit a record high of Rs 100 trillion — marking ten-times rise in Indian stock markets’ investor wealth in little over a decade.
The landmark level was reached in early morning trade when the market capitalisation (m-cap) rose to Rs 100.01 lakh crore, but slipped marginally below this level at the close of trading hours.
At the end of the day, the total market value of all BSE listed companies stood at Rs 99,81,572 crore — which was less than 0.2 per cent away from the Rs 100-trillion level, as benchmark Sensex continued its record rally with a gain of over 255 points.
BSE is among the world’s ten largest exchanges in terms of market value, while it is the largest globally for number of firms listed on its platform. It has over 4,000 actively traded companies and nearly 2.7 crore investors trade on it.
Terming this milestone as a reflection of India’s potential as a new age powerhouse, BSE CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan said, “We believe India will use capital market mechanism more over the period to help do wealth creation and job creation.”
In the US dollar terms, the BSE market cap now stands at over USD 1.6 trillion and it has added more than USD 500 billion (Rs 29 lakh crore) this year itself.
The total market capitalisation has more than doubled in the last five years from Rs 50 lakh crore in 2009, while it has grown ten-times since first scaling Rs 10 lakh crore level in 2003.
The Sensex has gained 7,268.23 points or 34.33 per cent so far this year. Continuing its dream-rally, the index hit its all-time high of 28,822.37 today.
The 30 Sensex companies alone, which are among the biggest companies in the country, now account for nearly 50 per cent or about Rs 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
This includes TCS, the country’s most valued firm and the only entity to have a market value of over Rs 5 lakh crore, followed by state-run ONGC and private sector behemoth Reliance Industries with market caps of over Rs 3 lakh crore each.
Those commanding market cap of over Rs 2 lakh crore include ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank and Coal India Ltd.
Besides, HUL, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, L&T, Wipro, Tata Motors, HCL Tech, NTPC, HCL Tech and Axis Bank have market cap of over Rs 1 lakh crore each.
Of the overall stock market wealth, promoters command nearly 50 per cent share, while foreign investors own close to 20 per cent and the rest is shared between institutional and retail investors from India.
Chauhan said he was confident that many such milestones would be reached by the Indian markets in times to come.
UBS’ India CEO Aashish Kamat also said the new landmark cements India’s place further as a growing world economic power. “I believe this gets India to roughly 2.5 per cent of the world market cap and the 9th largest equity market globally.”
He added: “If the new government delivers on the economic front then once can see India rise further, given not too many countries are showing the growth/investment potential.”
JP Morgan India CEO Kalpana Morparia said: “Our equity markets now rank among the top 10 in the world in terms of size and it is a matter of time before we make it to the top five.”
According to Sanjay Kumar Singh, CEO of BNP Paribas Securities India, “Although this landmark number seems colossal in itself, when you compare it with GDP, the market cap and GDP ratio is still only at 86 per cent – just marginally above the 10 year average of 80 per cent.”
He said: “With the GDP widely anticipated to grow consistently over the next few years on the back of expected reforms and as the economic cycle turns for the better, the market cap is likely to sustain this growth trend.
“We, therefore, see no reason to worry about the market getting top heavy. India continues to be a long term story and with the actions of various central banks ensuring ample liquidity, India will continue to attract a fair share of flows.”

Behind Google s Europe woes  American accentsProperty portal Housing.com raises $90 mn from SoftBank Group, Falcon Edge, others
When EU politicians call for the break-up of Google, it can sound like sour grapes, the anti-American backlash of an ageing Europe envious, and fearful, of the wealth and growing power of young U.S. tech giants.
But should any American take time on Thanksgiving to scoff at Thursday’s non-binding vote in the European Parliament, when lawmakers may urge European Union (EU) regulators to get tough with the search engine Goliath, they should know that behind the European Union antitrust probe of Google stand not only Europeans but U.S. competitors.
Indeed, to many in Brussels it is Google’s fellow Americans – such as Microsoft, Expedia and TripAdvisor – whose complaints and big-money lobbying have driven a four-year-old investigation by the powerful European Commission into whether Google abuses its dominance of Internet searches to push favoured Web sites.
“The American companies are using the European Commission as a battleground among themselves,” a senior EU official told Reuters. “They are the ones coming to us with complaints.
“They are the ones who are not happy when rivals present concessions and say these are not enough.”
U.S. companies like Microsoft, hit by a $700-million fine last year for foisting its flagging Explorer browser on PC buyers, are well aware of the Commission’s power in the world’s biggest economic bloc. It also may seem more aggressive than its counterpart in Washington, which last year dropped its own case inquiry into Google, concluding the firm had not broken rules.
Three attempts it made to reach a settlement were turned down by  European Union (EU) competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who agreed with Google’s rivals that concessions it offered to avoid a fine of up to $5 billion were not enough. The case is now in the hands of Margrethe Vestager, who succeeded Almunia this month.
U.S. tech firms “are all playing on a little playing field”, said Bert Foer, head of Washington think-tank the American Antitrust Institute. “Naturally they’re going to move fastest and farthest in jurisdictions that have more favourable laws.
“While there’s not a whole lot of difference between American antitrust law and European antitrust law, there is a difference in enforcement style and aggressiveness right now. So it’s not surprising that a lot of the fight is over there. And it’s not surprising that a lot of the companies are American.”
“It’s simply not about one side of the ocean against the other,” said Thomas Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of London law firm Clifford Chance. He is advising FairSearch, a group of firms including Microsoft, Oracle and Twenga in their complaint against Google with the European Commission.
“Never has a competition case brought together such a geographical or industrial breadth of concerned parties. There’s just never been anything like it,” said Vinje. “Probably never has any company exerted so much power on so many key markets.”
That is not to say that there is no anti-U.S. animus in Europe, among the public and some politicians. It is a fact Google, which declined comment for this article, highlights in portraying itself at times as caught in Transatlantic crossfire.
Last year’s revelations of U.S. spying on the digital doings of Europeans, including even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heightened mistrust of U.S. power in the digital world – though Europeans still use Google overwhelmingly to search the Web.
Google suffered a setback this year when the EU supreme court upheld a “right to be forgotten”, ordering it to block links to information if people request it. It also faces legal challenges over copyright fees, led notably by German publishers, and over a variety of privacy concerns.
Underscoring a sense of siege following the drafting of the resolution in the European Parliament, the U.S. mission to the EU in Brussels issued a statement appealing for objectivity so that the antitrust case was not “politicised”.
Vinje, however, said talk of anti-Americanism was overdone and accused Google executives of “pushing the line that its troubles are driven by anti-U.S. sentiments in Europe” to gloss over what he said were real concerns about its business.
Antitrust lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid at the Brussels office of Spanish firm Garrigues said the legal troubles of Google, and other U.S. firms, simply reflected their global success: “It is mainly because in most cases U.S. firms are the allegedly dominant players worldwide. I wish more European firms were in a position to be subject to similar investigations in the U.S.”
Michael Marelus, at the Brussels office of Anglo-American law firm DLA Piper which is not directly involved in the Google case, also played down the political elements of the EU inquiry:
“Politics is clearly and heavily involved in any statement made by the European Parliament and very much so in the parliament’s call to consider unbundling Google,” he said.
“It would however be unfair to say that U.S. companies are being targeted as such … It seems that parliament is taking an aggressive stand in considering unbundling Google in the hope of ultimately obtaining a more realistic commitment from it.”
The resolution, being debated in parliament on Wednesday, was proposed by a German conservative and Spanish liberal. While the legislature has no power in the matter, and it does not single out Google by name, the call for the Commission to consider separating searches from other services is intended to increase pressure on antitrust chief Vestager to act quickly.
A Danish liberal, she has sole power to decide and has kept her own counsel. Fellow commissioners with roles in the digital market have given mixed signals, voicing concern about monopoly  but also rejecting a break-up.
Backed by members of the main centre-right and centre-left parties, the resolution was expected to pass on Thursday in a vote scheduled after noon (1100 GMT).

Game Review:  Super Smash Bros.  makes brutality adorableProperty portal Housing.com raises $90 mn from SoftBank Group, Falcon Edge, others
Every few years, Nintendo rounds up its most popular characters, like Mario, Donkey Kong and Pikachu, and has them beat the daylights out of each other. It’s not exactly blood sport – there are no spine-shattering, ”Mortal Kombat”-style fatalities, and everyone walks away smiling. Only Nintendo could make bare-knuckle brawling cute.
”Super Smash Bros. for Wii U” (Nintendo, $59.99) continues that bizarre balancing act between adorable and brutal. Like most fighting games, it’s a snooze to play alone but a delight to play with friends.
The initial 49-character roster includes familiar challengers like Link and Kirby, new fighters like the ”Wii Fit” trainer and Little Mac from ”Punch-Out,” and even a few non-Nintendo ringers like Pac-Man and Sonic the Hedgehog. You can also fight as your Mii avatar, armed with a gun, a sword or just your fists.
The core brawling is simple enough that anyone can pick up a controller and join in. One button lets you punch opponents or pick up useful items, like a baseball bat or a healing spell. A second button unleashes special attacks that vary by character: Mario can throw fireballs, Link can shoot arrows and Yoshi can inhale enemies and then spit them out in eggs. Once you get the basics down, you can spend hours figuring out which combinations of buttons yield the most damaging attacks.
Each melee takes place on a two-dimensional field of floating platforms, with backgrounds inspired by classic games dating all the way back to ”Donkey Kong.” The goal of each fight, which lasts just a few minutes, is to weaken your rival enough so your next punch sends him or her flying off the platforms.
The new ”Smash Bros.” lets up to eight people leap into the fray. I found that a little too chaotic; it’s hard to keep track of your own fighter when so many are jumping around. Four-player brawls feel just right, providing enough action to keep everyone busy without making anyone squint.
Nintendo has built in plenty of variations to the core game. Event matches and special orders force you to win brawls with certain restrictions, such as time limits or more aggressive opponents. Smash Tour is a board game in which you collect characters to face off in a final series of fights. You can even build your own battle arenas.
And then there’s amiibo ($12.99 each), Nintendo’s new line of character figurines. When you place a Mario amiibo, for example, on the Wii U GamePad, you can train him to fight in different styles or boost his stats with equipment won in-game. You don’t directly control that character, but you can enlist him to fight by your side.
”Smash Bros.” remains one of Nintendo’s best party franchises. Sure, you can compete online, but you’ll miss out on all the laughter that results from gathering friends for virtual fisticuffs in your living room. Three stars out of four.

Oren has developed a niche in drilling fluidsStory
In Full Flow
The company has emerged as one of the few companies globally that makes all the fluids required for drilling of oil and gas wells.
Fluid dynamics: Oren Founder and CMD Rizwan Ahmad (Photo: Jaison G)
CATEGORY: Global Business Excellence (Mid-sized Companies)
Consider this: One of every 20 wells drilled globally to explore oil and gas pours fluids made by Chennai's Oren Hydrocarbons. Drilling operations for oil and gas are extremely sensitive and require many fluids, from lubrication to chemicals, even to test the mud. Oren makes100-odd chemicals and other fluids required for the process.
Started in 1990, Oren has over the years developed a niche in drilling fluids. The company's founder and CMD, Rizwan Ahmad, a geologist who earlier worked with French company Geo Services, says his company is one of the very few globally that makes all the fluids required for drilling of oil and gas wells, a fiercely competitive market worth $11 billion.
In the BT-YES Bank Emerging Companies Excellence Awards, Oren was adjudged the best emerging company in terms of global excellence - in the mid-sized companies category - for its operations in 12 countries including the US and Canada, and in West Asia. According to Ahmad, Oren has a strategic partnership with global major Schlumberger, and also has similar tie-ups with Halliburton, Chinese company CNPC, and Canadian company Qmax, among others.
Ahmad says his company globally faces competition from European, Chinese and North American players, which compete not only in quality but in prices as well. The biggest competition comes from manufacturers such as Italian company Lamberti, which competes with Oren in 24 product categories but largely in the European market. In addition, US-based Chemstar International and Radiagreen are pushing Oren in the North American market, and Kazakh company Sun Drilling and Chinese major Li Hong also compete with Oren.
"We have a competitive edge because we have a manufacturing facility near a port," he says. The company has a 13,500-sq. ft warehouse inside Chennai Port, and two storage areas of 30,000 sq. ft close to the port. It has manufacturing facilities in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat in India. Globally, it has manufacturing plants in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Egypt and Iraq.
Ahmad says the global drilling fuel market will grow to $12.5 billion by 2018 and, obviously, he wants a big chunk of that pie. His other goal: garner the knowledge to make chemicals and fluids for shale rock fracking, a process of fracturing dense rock to extract oil and gas.

Brent near 4 year low after OPEC decides against output cut

(Brent crude had fallen 13…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude held above $72 a barrel on Friday after hitting a new four year low earlier in the day after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for output reductions, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 38 cents at $72.20 a barrel at 0806 GMT, after plummeting $5.17 to close at $72.58 on Thursday. It earlier fell $1.46 in trading on Friday to touch $71.12, its weakest since July 2010.
Brent is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent this month.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, of Thursday's fall.
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.79 from Wednesday's closing to $68.90 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75. US markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

NEW YORK – An enormous, seemingly never-ending crowd streamed throughout Macy's Herald Square Thursday night in what was likely a record shopping night for the store.
CEO Terry Lundgren estimated more than 15,000 people showed up at Macy's historic flagship store for what has become one of the most popular shopping days of the holiday season – Thanksgiving – which is more than the store has ever seen.
Shoppers crowded around designer handbag displays, where in some cases bags were chaotically thrown into piles as customers picked through them. They flooded the escalators and covered practically every square foot of the store, not a single floor tile wasted.
The store, the largest department store in the world, is a harbinger of the holiday season as it serves as the main backdrop to the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the setting of the Christmas classic Miracle on 34th Street.

Holiday shopping takes off: Early birds gobble up deals
Cashmere sweaters were on sale for $39.99 – "I think I'm losing money on that," Lundgren joked – and shoe department discounts made it one of the busiest sections of the store, with employees walking around with shoe boxes piled three to five high. Some customers were trying boots on standing up for lack of seating.
Many shoppers were visiting from out of town or overseas, curious about the hype behind what's become an American tradition or wanting to take part in a quintessentially New York event.
Standing outside the doors before the store opened, Ashley Ritchie said she'd been waiting for two hours. "I don't know what I'm here for, I'm just here," said Ritchie, who is visiting New York from Australia. She said she's never participated in Black Friday sales and was told to come check out the scene by family.
Fabienne Schmid, 36, from Lucerne, Switzerland, stopped in with her boyfriend while in town for the weekend.
"It's part of Thanksgiving, it's part of New York," said Schmid, who used to live in the city.
She said she needed new winter boots but wasn't sure she'd have the patience to bear the crowd much longer.
"I probably won't stick around that long," she said. "It's pure craziness."

Macy's opened at 6 p.m. this year, a decision Lundgren says he was unsure about making at first but says quickly proved a success as a steady stream of thousands coming through the main entrance still hadn't dissipated 45 minutes into the night.
"This year it's definitely taking people much longer to get through the front doors," he said. "Obviously the customers wanted us to open at six-o-clock based on the incredible traffic we're having in this store."
By 7 p.m., many customers had already taken refuge on the couches and chairs located throughout the store. The Starbucks on the mezzanine level was packed with shoppers resting and charging their phones.
Skip Black Friday lines, here are the best deals
Brenda Rickenbacker, from Akron, Ohio, was browsing ornaments and other holiday decor on the 9th floor, where fewer people had ventured. She attended the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade earlier Thursday and wanted to come out shopping, "to kind of enjoy the festivities with everyone."
"I've never done this before," she said. "Usually, I'm home cooking. I think it's a lot of fun."
At this store in particular, customers are likely drawn for the discounts just as much as the experience.
"Thanksgiving and Macy's are just kind of synonymous with one another," Lundgren said. "(There's) extraordinary diversity among our customers here tonight. I think that's part of what New York City is all about but Macy's is certainly where people come when they come to New York City."

For Vodafone  Big Relief in Rs 3 200-Crore Tax CaseSpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
The government has decided that it will not appeal against telecom giant Vodafone's victory in the Bombay High Court last month, which said the company does not owe taxes of Rs 3,200 crore for allegedly underpricing shares of a subsidiary in a rights issue to its parent.
Separately, Vodafone is contesting a more than $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) tax demand over its acquisition of Indian mobile operations in 2007 from Hutchison Whampoa.
Vodafone, the biggest foreign corporate investor in India, has been caught in a string of tax disputes since it entered the country seven years ago, hoping to tap the world's second biggest mobile phone market by customer numbers. Vodafone's treatment, seen by many investors as heavy-handed, has fuelled debate over India's unpredictable rules and regulations.
In the Bombay High Court, India's tax office had accused Vodafone India Services Private Ltd - a unit of the group - of under-pricing shares in a rights issue to its parent, and had demanded tax for two financial years to March 2011. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, the government's top lawyer, has recommended that the tax department should not challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court.
Transfer pricing is the value at which companies trade products, services or assets between units in different countries - a regular part of doing business for a multinational, but a practice which tax authorities often feel can be exploited.
Rules require all cross-border transactions between group companies to be valued at arm's length - or as if the transaction was with an unrelated company.
Several other multinationals, including IBM Corp, are fighting transfer-pricing cases in India. Tax claims on foreign firms in the past year has been a major concern for investors.
The lure of India's growing market, however, has continued to attract Vodafone. This year it spent $1.7 billion or over Rs 10,000 crore to fully own its main Indian unit, Vodafone India Ltd, which is the nation's No. 2 mobile phone carrier. Vodafone India bought radio airwaves worth more than $3 billion (over Rs 18,000 crore) in a government auction in February to beef up services.

Don't play politics at an educational institution, AMU VC to Centre against BJP's proposed event

Aligarh: A fresh controversy is brewing in the Aligarh Muslim University where the varsity authorities and Bharatiya Janata Party have got into a war of words over a piece of land.
BJP has asked the university to celebrate the birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap, a freedom fighter, who according to them had donated land to AMU. A meeting between the MU Vice Chancellor Zameeruddin Shah and the leaders of BJP and student wing ABVP took place on Thursday in this concern.
The AMU has rejected the claims made by BJP and has approached the Union HRD Ministry to prevent politics from trickling into the matter. "From last several days, BJP elements are threatening that they will celebrate Raja Ji's birthday at AMU gate that has potential to create communal tension in the university and I don't want student to suffer. The said land was on land deed and it was not gifted, but we recognized Raja Ji's contributions. I have written to HRD Minister on this issue. We don't want tension; maintaining law and order is my priority," the VC said.
#aligarh muslim university #amu #vc #bjp
"We do not have any records of the king donating land to the university. He gave some land to a school which after the Supreme Court verdict came down to us," added AMU professor Mohammad Abrar.
Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani, however, said that she was yet to receive a letter from the varsity. "As of last night I have not received any such letter," she said.
Meanwhile, the BJP is not in a mood to accept AMU's stand. It is adamant on celebrating the Raja Mahendra Pratap's birth anniversary in the university campus. "If the VC celebrates the anniversary of the king, we welcome it. Otherwise, our party will celebrate the anniversary inside the AMU campus. AMU must celebrate anniversary of the person who donate it land," BJP leader Satish Gautam said.

Our Bureau/PTI

Mumbai, Nov 28:  
The rupee breached the 62 per dollar mark and was trading weak at 62.05 at 4.35 pm local time on sustained demand for greenback from importers.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Rupee falls below 62... 62.25 looks likely to be tested ahead of RBI meeting on Tuesday</p>— Gurumurthy K (@gurukmurthy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gurukmurthy/status/538269499506446337">November 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

After opening marginally weak at 61.90 against the previous close of 61.87, the rupee hovered in the range of 61.87 and 62.10 in the evening trade.
Forex dealers said that apart from heavy dollar demand from importers, the dollar's gains against other currencies overseas dampened the rupee sentiment.
The rupee had lost 3 paise to end at 61.87 against the greenback in yesterday’s trade on month-end dollar demand from importers.
Meanwhile, the BSE benchmark Sensex surged 255.08 points to 28,693.99 at the closing trade.

Infosys outperforms TCS for first time in five yearsTigerair, Axis Bank to offer one-way free ticket from Singapore
Shares of IT major Infosys touched a record high on Thursday, defying a streak of under-performance it maintained with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) since 2010. After rallying to a new intraday high of R4,377, Infosys ended the session at a record R4,366.90, up R69.25 or 1.61%.
On the back of year-to-date gains of 25%, Infosys has outdone TCS in the year-to-date performance, for the first time in five years.  While the appointment of Vishal Sikka as the CEO in mid-June rekindled optimism on Infosys, the decline in the momentum of TCS stock after its September quarter numbers failed to meet street expectations, have also helped the former bridge the gap.
While TCS was boasting year-to-date returns of 27% in early October, better than Sensex gains at the time, post  Q2 results the stock gave away some of these gains. While at 3.9%, the sequential constant currency growth reported by Infosys was viewed as healthy, TCS’ q-o-q revenue growth of 4.6% was considered a miss, especially because the latter was consistently beating consensus expectations on the topline. Not surprisingly, foreign brokerages like Deutsche and CIMB upgraded Infosys post Q2 numbers.
Even as the street expect details of the organization structure and  the newly-laid strategy by Sikka, the rally in Infosys stock has narrowed the valuation gap it maintained with TCS to an eight month low. The IT major currently trades at one-year forward price to earnings multiple of 18.86 while TCS commands a PE ratio of 21.52. However, given that Infosys is already trading way above the consensus 12-month target price of R4231.7, a section of the street has started to view it as an expensive counter. Recently Societe General downgraded Infosys to ‘sell’ from ‘hold’.

Bajaj Auto dn 2%; UBS downgrades stock to sell on firm USD
In response to the currency devaluation in Nigeria, Bajaj Auto has hiked its product prices slightly
Post your opinion here
 
Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  Bajaj Auto were down close to 2 percent at Rs 2599 on concerns that a strong dollar could hurt operating margins of exports.
Yesterday Nigeria devalued its currency by 10 percent to make up for falling revenues due to weak crude oil prices, and also hiked interest rates. In response, Bajaj Auto has hiked its product prices in that market . Nigeria is a major export market for Bajaj Auto, accounting for nearly 35 percent of its revenues. 
Brokerage house Emkay Global feels higher vehicle prices and interest rate will 'somewhat' impact demand in Nigeria. At the same time, the devaluation would also impact Bajaj's competition as well may not hurt Bajaj’s market share, the brokerage said.
Brokerage house UBS is more negative about the development and downgraded its rating on the stock to 'sell', citing risk to export margins.
"We see downside risk to export margins as the currencies of Bajaj's key importing countries, Nigeria and Columbia, have depreciated sharply against the US dollar in the past three months," the UBS note said.
The brokerage has cut FY16(estimated)  EBITDA margin by 150 basis points to 20.1 percent and FY16E EPS by 3 percent.

Berger braces for good Q3To benefit from decline in freight costs on account of fall in diesel prices.
Abhijit Roy
MD
Berger Paints
Abhijit Roy, Managing Director, Berger Paints in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke about the likely benefit of fall in crude prices for the company going forward.
According to him it is very difficult to pin point the drop of oil price impact immediately but it is sure to impact some of the raw material prices which are used for oil paints and so that will see an immediate drop. It will be passed on to the customers in a short timeframe.
However the other elements of raw material and derivatives like emulsion which is used in water paints will have a lagged effect, so the impact will be seen in fourth quarter and not the third quarter, he said.
The benefit of slide in diesel prices to have positive impact on freight costs.
 
So far the company has derived 1.2-1.3% EBITDA to sales benefit from the drop in crude, he added.
According to him the gross margins will see an expansion if the crude prices and dollar levels sustain.
On the demand front he said there has been no significant change on industrial side but decorative paint volumes will continue to grow at double-digits.
Below is the transcript of Abhijit Roy\\'s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: It’s been great times for paint companies like yours considering the amount of fall that we have seen in crude prices but can you quantify for us how much will every dollar fall in crude prices or every barrel fall in crude prices impact your margins and your earnings per share (EPS) as well?
A: There are two areas in which it has an impact – (1) on the raw material prices and some of the raw material prices like the solvents which are used for oil based paints, those will drop immediately as per the crude prices drop because that’s passed on normally within a very short timeframe.
The other elements of the raw materials and the derivatives like emulsion which are used on water based paints – that has a lag-ffect and it will probably come into the fourth quarter and not immediately in this quarter.
Therefore, it is very difficult to pinpoint when the oil drops what will be the impact immediately because a part of it comes in this quarter and the rest of it will flow into the next quarter. (2) The other element which is likely to impact us is the freight cost reduction which might happen because diesel prices going down. So that is also an impact which will be beneficial for us.
Latha: Can you quantify it in terms of what you have already seen in the third quarter?
A: About 1.2 to 1.3 percent EBITDA to sales – that’s the benefit that we have got.
Latha: Let me look at it differently – your gross margins improved by 160 bps year-on-year in Q2, what is your estimate for Q3 and Q4?
A: If the prices hold through and if the dollar holds these levels then it will move up further. The gross margin expansion that you saw in Q2 was not so much on account of the raw material price drop but more on account of the mix change which happened and some of the industrial businesses which were struggling earlier started showing signs of little bit of revival both in terms of price and in terms of volume. So that is why the gross margin expansion took place.
The third quarter expansion – a part of it will be the benefit coming in to the industrial business and also other decorative business also but most of it will come now from the raw material and freight advantage.
Latha: Your gross margins were at 41.2 percent in Q2 and since you said 1.2 percentage points, should we expect 42.4 as of now for Q3?
A: That is right.
Sonia: Also on operating profit margins (OPMs) which were at about 11.5 percent, by the end of the second half of the year where do you see them stand and also if you can give us a slightly longer term view. On an average if crude prices have trended lower by the end of FY16 what kind of a margin profile Berger Paints will stand at?
A: This is a very difficult question to answer because the operating profit does not depend only on the crude prices remaining stable or dropping because normally history would show that we tend to pass on these benefits to customers to drive up volumes.
Operating margins depends on essentially four factors, the topline, the cost that we are able to control non essential cost. The raw material cost of course is a factor, which is very important and the mix which we have. All factors come into play, so it’s very difficult to isolate one.

Mediaman  Veena Malik case inks chill in PakAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
The 26-year prison term to four persons including the owner of Pakistan’s biggest media group under the “deeply flawed” blasphemy laws will have a chilling effect on freedom of expression, a leading rights group has said.
“This sentence will have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Pakistan. It is appalling that someone should be sent to prison for decades over a TV programme,” said David Griffiths, Amnesty International’s Deputy Asia Pacific Director.
Griffiths said the “judgment shows how Pakistan’s deeply flawed blasphemy laws have become another tool to silence media.”
Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, owner of Geo and Jang group, was handed down the prison term in absentia for allowing the broadcast of a “blasphemous programme” by Geo TV in May.
Actor Veena Malik and her husband Asad Bashir were sentenced for participating in the programme in which a religious song was played while they re-enacted their wedding. TV host Shaista Wahidi was also sentenced for 26 years.
Geo TV has had tense relationships with Pakistani authorities and was temporarily taken off air earlier this year following the blasphemy allegations.
It has been locked in a standoff with authorities after its main anchor Hamid Mir in April accused the Inter-Services Intelligence of being behind an assassination attempt on him.
Amnesty said: “There are also serious concerns about the fairness of this trial as the defendants were sentenced in absentia and never had the opportunity to answer the charges in court.”
Rahman is based outside Pakistan, while Malik and Bashir fled the country after receiving death threats when the blasphemy allegations were first levelled against them.
Amnesty has urged Pakistan to reform the laws as a matter of urgency to provide effective safeguards against their abuse, with a view to their eventual repeal.

Jet Airways shares ride high  up 14% on rating upgrade by ICRAGold, silver dip on sluggish demand, weak global cues
Shares of Jet Airways surged 20 per cent today following drop in crude oil prices and ICRA upgrading the rating on a Rs 3,210-crore loan facility.
Jet Airways’ scrip zoomed 19.99 per cent to settle at Rs 322.05, its upper circuit limit at the BSE.
At the NSE, it soared 19.99 per cent to end at Rs 322.65.
On the volume front, 27.73 lakh shares of the company changed hands at the BSE, while over one crore shares were traded at the NSE during the day.
The ratings agency has upgraded the long-term rating assigned to the Rs 3,210 crore, fund-based bank facilities of Jet Airways to [ICRA]BB from [ICRA]C, a statement had said yesterday.
“The rating upgrade takes into account the improvement in the liquidity and credit profile of the company, arising from improved operating performance as well as support from its strategic partnerâ€“Etihad Airways PJSC,” it said.
Brent crude oil contracts for January settlement were trading around USD 72/barrel, the lowest level since August 2010. Falling oil price is good news for India, which imports 80 per cent of its requirements. This will also help the country narrow its Current Account Deficit.
Fuel costs account for a chunk of airline expenses and falling oil price is likely to provide relief, say experts.
Meanwhile, similar buying was seen in the shares of another listed airline SpiceJet that surged 18.36 per cent to Rs 18.24 aided by decline in crude oil prices.
In terms of volume, 408.90 lakh shares of the company were traded at the BSE.

AAP collects Rs 91 lakh from Arvind Kejriwal s fund-raiser dinnerDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal hosted a Rs 20,000 per plate dinner for young professionals, diamond merchants and bankers here kick-starting the party’s fund-raising campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections.
“We collected Rs 91 lakh from the fund-raiser dinner last night. Rs 36 lakh were collected from donor passes, Rs 36 lakh was through cheque donation from those who came and our volunteers collected Rs 21 lakh,” AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said here today.
“The next fundraiser will be in Bengaluru. We are impressed with the response to our fund-raiser drive,” she said.
With online donations, AAP is looking to raise funds differently to take on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is relying on ‘brand Modi’.
“The Mumbai dinner had space for a maximum of 200 donors, mostly our supporters. Most of those who attended were young professionals, some diamond merchants and a few directors from Bollywood,” she said.
AAP’s Maharashtra unit has a target of raising Rs 5 crore over the next two months through reach-out drives,” she said.
In the run-up to this year’s Lok Sabha elections, Arvind Kejriwal had in March hosted a fund-raising dinner in Bengaluru inviting criticism from Congress which questioned whether the AAP leader who then also charged Rs 20,000 per person for having a meal with him could claim to represent the common man.
“Kejriwal has appealed people to donate for the party,” Menon said.
To encourage donations, AAP is tweeting online donors’ names with the hashtag #IFundHonestPolitics.
After the Delhi Assembly elections in December 2013, the party has so far received donations from over a lakh donors. The maximum money has come from Maharashtra, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Considering plan to cut stake in PSU banks to 52%: GovtGovt says considering plan to cut stake in PSU banks to 52 per cent

The government is considering a plan to reduce stakes in state-run banks to 52 per cent that could enable it to raise about Rs 891.2 billion ($14.39 billion), Minister of State (Finance) Jayant Sinha said on Friday.
The government holds stakes ranging from 56 per cent to 84 per cent in the state-run banks that account for 70 per cent of India's total outstanding loans of about $1 trillion.
"The reduction of government of India share in equity capital of PSBs (public sector banks) to 52 per cent will enable mobilisation of about 891.20 billion rupees," Sinha said in a written statement.
He said the stake sale will enable the government to scale back its budgetary support for the banks.
India's 26 state-run banks, which include State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda need as much as $60 billion in new capital over the next few years to meet upcoming global regulations and to build a buffer against rising bad loans.
According to the central bank's estimates, the government would need to inject as much as Rs 2.4 trillion into state-owned banks by end March 2019 to meet capital requirements including Basel III, provisioning for asset quality, and additional risks.
Officials in the finance ministry say the federal cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to take a final decision on the issue of stake sale soon.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is concerned about mounting bad assets of the state-run banks - estimated at Rs 2.16 trillion at the end of previous fiscal year - has promised to take steps to improve their performance.

Oil prices slump after OPEC decides not to cut outputBrent crude prices near 4-year low after OPEC decides not to cut oil production

Brent crude oil prices held above US $72 a barrel on Friday, close to a four-year low touched in the previous session after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided against cutting oil production to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the cartel for output reductions, led to a retreat in oil prices on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia and OPEC had "relinquished" their role to balance the market from the supply side, Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday.
"Instead, the market itself - prices, in other words - will be the mechanism to rebalance the market. We cannot overstate what a dramatic and fundamental change this is for the oil market," the analysts said.
Brent crude was down 9 cents at US $72.49 a barrel at 10:16 am, after plummeting US $5.17 in the previous session to close at US $72.58. Earlier on Thursday, the fuel had touched its weakest since July 2010 at US $71.25 a barrel.
Oil prices are headed for their steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15 per cent in November this year.
Brent has lost nearly 40 per cent since June, falling from above US $115 a barrel as increasing shale output in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
"I think traders realised in looking at the fundamentals that they haven't really changed," said Phin Ziebell, oil analyst at National Australia Bank, said of Thursday's fall.
US crude for January delivery plunged US $4.78 from Wednesday's to US $68.91 a barrel, after earlier dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at US $67.75. US markets were shut on Thursday on account of Thanksgiving day.
US crude has shed almost 15 per cent in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to US $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year. If prices remained low, Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day of production, Sechin said.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning for output cuts until oil prices rebounded to US $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November that could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) will auction investment limits for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in government debt securities worth Rs 3,161 crore on Monday as foreign investors remain bullish on domestic markets.
The auction is being held after aggregate overseas investments in government debt securities on Thursday reached Rs 1,21,271 crore, which is 97.46 per cent of total permitted limit of Rs 1,24,432 crore.
As per capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) guidelines, the unutilised debt investment limits for FIIs need to be auctioned on an exchange platform when the aggregate investments of all overseas investors reach or breach 90 per cent of the investment limit.
These include FIIs , Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and QFIs (Qualified Institutional Investors).
Accordingly, live bidding for auction of the currently unutilised debt investment limits worth Rs 3,161 crore would be conducted on NSE's e-Bid platform on December 1.
As per the current norms, foreign investors are allowed to invest up to US $25 billion (Rs 1,24,432 crore) in government debt securities through auction route, while the cap currently stands at US $5 billion (Rs 29,137 crore) for government debt bonds through 'on tap' route.
While the limit in the first category has been exhausted by over 97 per cent, the second category is also already used by nearly 84 per cent.
Overseas investors are allowed to invest further US $5.5 billion in treasury bills, out of which nearly 14 per cent is used as of now.
In corporate debt, the upper cap currently stands at US $51 billion and nearly 57 per cent of this limit has been exhausted by the foreign investors.
The overall investment cap for debt securities currently stands at US $81 billion (Rs 3,97,892 crore), which also includes US $two billion for commercial papers and US $5 billion for credit enhanced bonds.
Out of this overall limit, the total investments and limits acquired by foreign investors currently stands at Rs 2,83,984 crore which is over 71 per cent of the permitted limits.
The last such auction was conducted on the EbidXchange platform of  Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on November 10, when debt securities worth  Rs 1,488 crore was over-subscribed by nearly four-fold and received bids  worth Rs 5,664 crore.
A total of 83 bids were received, out of which 28 were declared successful on November 10.
Almost  all such auctions have received robust response in the recent times and  have got over-subscribed by multiple times, reflecting a huge demand  among foreign investors for government debt securities in the domestic  markets.

As market value of Bombay Stock Exchange-listed firms crossed the Rs 100-trillion landmark, the bourse said it is a reflection of the country's potential as a new age powerhouse and many more such milestones can be achieved in times to come.
"It is also significant that it has happened after highly successful tour of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Nepal for SAARC, Australia for G20, Myanmar and Fiji," BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan told PTI.
"India and the BSE reached a significant milestone today. It is a reflection of the potential of India as a new age powerhouse," Chauhan said on this landmark achievement.
Measured in terms of total market capitalisation of all listed companies on BSE, the overall investor wealth in the domestic stock market rose to Rs 100.01 lakh crore at 10:05 am on Friday as the benchmark BSE index Sensex surged by over 300 points in its sustained record rally.
"This achievement is a reflection of India's growth potential as seen from the foreign investor's perspective as well as the competitiveness of Indian entrepreneurs to manage world class organisations," teh BSE MD added.
The 30 Sensex firms alone, which are among the biggest companies in the country, now account for nearly 50 per cent or about Rs 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
"It has taken India and BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs 100 lakh crore market capitalisation. However, given India's potential, India should be able to achieve multiple times Rs 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in times to come," Chauhan said.
The total market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore-mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003, while it has doubled from about Rs 50 lakh crore five years ago in 2009.

Stocks continued their upward sprint for the third straight session on Friday with benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)Sensex galloping 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty surging 94.05 points to 8,588.25 as tumbling oil prices strengthened the case for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next week.
Brent crude oil contracts for January settlement were trading around $72/barrel, the lowest level since August 2010. Falling oil price is good news for India, which imports 80 per cent of its requirements. This will also help the country narrow its Current Account Deficit (CAD).
Stocks related to oil like oil marketing companies, airlines, paint makers attracted heavy buying interest.
Shares of banks, automobile makers and realty firms spurted on rising hopes of a rate cut on December 2.
Besides, select NBFCs saw heavy investor interest after RBI yesterday unveiled final guidelines for small finance banks and payments banks.
All eyes are now on quarterly GDP data to be released later on Friday.
The BSE 30-share Sensex resumed better and shot up to log new life time high of 28,822.37. It shed some gains on weak European cues but nevertheless settled at yet another closing peak of 28,693.99, up 255.08 points or 0.90 per cent.
In three days, the index has gained over 355 points.
Similarly, the broader 50-issue NSE Nifty also flared up by 94.05 points, or 1.11 per cent, to register fresh closing peak of 8,588.25. It also hit new intra-trade peak of 8,617.
"Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC's decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week," said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, total investor wealth in Indian stock market intra-day today hit a record high above Rs 100 lakh crore. It settled at over Rs 99,81,550 crore at close, up by over Rs 87,550 crore from Thursday's levels.

State Bank of India (SBI) shares gained 3.9 per cent to hit the highest level since November 2010.
ICICI Bank 's stock climbed up by 2.3 per cent, while shares of Bank of Baroda were trading 4.7 per cent higher.
According to a Reuters poll, the country's GDP growth is likely to slow down to 5.1 per cent, but a rate cut by the apex bank is not expected yet.

Heavy security blanket put in place for PM Narendra Modi s rally in J&KBy: Press Trust of India | Udhampur |
Posted: November 28, 2014 12:10 pm | Updated: November 28, 2014 12:11 pm
Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally, a multi-tier security has been put in place in Udhampur in view of the terrorist attack that left ten people, including three civilians, dead.

Bomb kills 5 Nigerian troops; Boko Haram suspectedBy: Reuters | Yola |
Posted: November 29, 2014 1:10 am | Updated: November 29, 2014 10:45 am
Gunmen set off three bombs and opened fire on worshippers at the central mosque in north Nigeria’s biggest city Kano, killing at least 65 people on Friday, witnesses and police said, in an attack that bore the hallmarks of Islamist Boko Haram militants.
“These people have bombed the mosque. I am face to face with people screaming,” said Chijjani Usman, a local reporter who had gone to the mosque in the old city to pray.
The mosque is next to the palace of the emir of Kano, the second highest Islamic authority in Africa’s most populous country, although the emir himself, former central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, was not present.
No one immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on Boko Haram, a Sunni jihadist movement fighting to revive a medieval Islamic caliphate in the region.
Boko Haram regards the traditional Islamic religious authorities in Nigeria with disdain, considering them a corrupt, self-serving elite that is too close to the secular government.
The insurgents have killed thousands in gun and bomb attacks on churches, schools, police stations, military bases, government buildings and mosques that do not share their radical ideology.
At least 65 people died on Friday, deputy police commissioner Sanusi N Lemo told reporters in Kano. “Three bombs were planted in the courtyard to the mosque and they went off simultaneously,” a security source who declined to be named said.
“After multiple explosions, they also opened fire. I cannot tell you the casualties because we all ran away,” added a member of staff at the palace.
Angry youths blocked the mosque’s gates to police, who had to disperse them with tear gas to gain entry.
The insurgency has forced more than one million people to flee during its campaign focused on Nigeria’s northeast, the Red Cross told reporters on Friday, an increase on a September UN refugee agency estimate of 700,000.
Islamic leaders sometimes shy away from direct criticism of Boko Haram for fear of reprisals. But Kano’s emir Sanusi, angered by atrocities such as the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok in April, has been increasingly vocal.
He was quoted in the local press as calling on Nigerians this month to defend themselves against Boko Haram. During a broadcast recitation of the Koran he was reported to have said:
“These people, when they attack towns, they kill boys and enslave girls. People must stand resolute … They should acquire what they can to defend themselves. People must not wait for soldiers to protect them.”
Persistent insecurity is dogging President Goodluck Jonathan’s campaign for re-election to a second term in February 2015.

Two Filipinos and an Indonesian convicted in 2002 bombingBy: Associated Press | Manila |
Posted: November 28, 2014 11:11 am
A Philippine court has convicted an Indonesian militant and two Filipino extremists for their role in a 2002 mall bombing that killed at least 12 people and signaled the start of the alliance of two of Southeast Asia’s most violent terrorist groups.
Judge Leili Cruz-Suarez said in her ruling on Thursday that Jul Kifli from Indonesia and Abu Sayyaf militants Ahmad Jekeron and Yacob Basug were “guilty beyond reasonable doubt” of staging the April 21, 2002, bombing that also wounded dozens of people at the Fitmart shopping mall in the southern port city of General Santos.
State prosecutor Aristotle Reyes, who initially handled the case, said the convictions would serve as a deterrent to terrorism and complement military actions to defeat the resilient militants. A former Abu Sayyaf militant and key witness, Abu Hamdie, said the bombing was the first joint attack by the Abu Sayyaf and the Indonesia-based terror network Jemaah Islamiyah.
He said the Abu Sayyaf was looking for a diversion to fend off a military offensive at the time, and Jemaah Islamiyah “wanted to show off their bomb-making prowess.” With the help of Filipino militants, including notorious bombing suspect Basit Usman, Jul Kifli manufactured the powerful bomb and placed it near the entrance of the mall. The bomb was remotely detonated with a cellphone call made by Jekeron, Hamdie said.
“He uttered a short prayer then dialed the cellphone number given by Jul Kifli,” he said. Usman, who is also wanted by the U.S. government for several, deadly bombings, remains at large. Indonesian Ibrahim Ali and Abu Sayyaf militants Arman Ameruddin and Ikram Ameruddin were acquitted in the trial.
The Abu Sayyaf was founded in 1991 in the south, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic country and scene of rebellions for a separate Muslim homeland. Washington considers the Abu Sayyaf, which currently has about 400 armed fighters split into about six factions, as a terrorist group.
A U.S.-backed offensive has weakened and largely isolated the Abu Sayyaf, but it has endured by turning to ransom kidnappings and extortion. It currently holds about a dozen hostages.

(Stocks surged after Brent…)
NEW DELHI: Airline stocks such as Jet Airways, SpiceJet surged in trade on Friday, after Brent crude oil plunged as much as $6.50 a barrel, and US crude dropped by nearly as much, posting their steepest one-day falls since 2011.
Brent crude oil prices came under pressure after OPEC decided against cutting output despite a huge oversupply in world markets. Benchmark Brent futures were down by $5.20 a barrel at $72.55, after hitting a four-year low of $71.25 earlier in the session.
Reacting to the news, Jet Airways surged as much as 19.99 per cent to touch its intraday high of Rs 322.05, while SpiceJet rallied as much as 7 per cent to hit its intraday high of Rs 16.50.
Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is linked to international crude oil prices. ATF or jet fuel constitutes about 40 per cent of airlines' operating cost. Hence, a fall in ATF price prices will improve profitability and margins.
At 09:40 a.m.; Jet Airways was trading 12.6 per cent higher at Rs 302.40. It hit a low of Rs 286.30 and a high of Rs 302 in trade today.
SpiceJet was trading 5.7 per cent higher at Rs 16.30. It hit a low of Rs 15.80 and a high of Rs 16.50 in trade today.

Black Friday deals: Be a smart online shopper todayComments
It's the big date you just cannot afford to forget. And you don't have to be a hardcore shopaholic to feel that adrenaline rush. The annual shopping extravaganza, called Black Friday, is 28th November, and it promises some of the most outlandishly cheap deals the click of a mouse. Big screen TV’s for less than $300 (Rs 18,000), designer bags at 40% discounts, and SLR cameras at the price of cheap point-and-click ones are only a few examples.
But for Indian shopaholics here is one big issue though: These deals are mostly available only in the US. Therefore getting access to these deals means reliance on a relative residing there. But the advent of online shopping and global shipping services means you too now be part of this shopping madness.
Here are a few useful tips and hacks to help you get your hands on the best ‘Black Friday’ deals
1. Cyber Monday: While ‘Black Friday’ is the marquee shopping day when retail stores offer big discounts, don’t lose hope if you miss out. Some of the best deals of the week, especially on electronics, are available on ‘Cyber Monday’ (1st December). Most importantly ‘Cyber Monday’ deals are exclusive to online stores like Amazon and eBay which makes it’s easier to order.
2. Global Shipping: Try to make your purchases from site that offer shipping to India. Sites such as Amazon US, eBay and Newegg ship most of their goods to India and will be upfront with the cost of shipping and customs before you check out. This ensures some degree of safeguard against loss or steep customs on arrival.
3. Package forwarding services: Now try as hard as you might, many items on sale simply won’t offer worldwide shipping. But there is a work around for this: Try package forwarding services who get the product delivered to their local warehouse and then ship it on their own to customers abroad. Mind you, these services are not free and require you to provide ID and other documents. You can choose services offered by banks like MyUS(HDFC), Borderlinx (Citibank), Global eShop(ICICI) or use third party services like ShopNShip and Viabox.
4. Shipping and customs:  Always take shipping and customs into account before you make the purchase. In some cases it will be cheaper to buy locally than order from the US if shipping and customs are steep. The best way to deal with this is to pick a shipping service that’ll charge for customs up front and will clear it from customs if need be.

Automakers aren't being left out of the Black Friday rush.
Chevrolet, Buick and BMW are among the brands offering sales deals on new cars. And taking advantage of them should be easy, at least when it come to weather: It's looking relatively good for Friday everywhere except the upper Midwest and Northwest.
•Chevrolet is offering 0% financing and $1,000 cash back on a number of models, including its Silverado pickups.
• Buick is promoting its Black Friday sale on social media, including 20% off on 2014 and 2015 LaCrosse models.
• BMW is offering a big Black Friday promotion focused on financing deals.
"Black Friday represents one of the hottest shopping days in America, and new-car shopping is no exception," says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, in a statement. "There are amazing deals on new cars right now as the calendar year comes to a close."
Among the best deals, Kelley Blue Book says, are a 36-month lease on a Cadillac ATS at $299 a month with $749 due at signing -- not bad on a car KBB says has a "fair" purchase price of $32,138. There's also a 39-month lease on a $22,224 Mazda6 sedan at $189 a month and $1,989 due at signing.
Buyers can usually get a better deal by focusing on 2014 models, which dealers are anxious to clear out to make way for the 2015s.
Others are expecting Black Friday will pay off when it comes to November sales.
"Car sales will remain elevated in November in large part because of Black Friday," says Edmunds.com Senior Analyst Jessica Caldwell, in a statement. "In recent years both car shoppers and car dealers have turned toward Black Friday as an opportunity to dive into the holiday shopping season."
If you miss the deals, another car shopping site, TrueCar.com, says there will be even steeper discounts on New Year's Eve.
Shoppers who venture to the car lots or malls will generally find good weather Friday in most major metro areas. But .  Schneider Electric, which provides forecasts for weather-sensitive businesses like airports and utilities, says watch out in  the upper Midwest and Northwest.
Some of the dicier places include:
Duluth, Minn.: 2 inches of snow.
Green Bay, Wis., 1-2 inches of snow.
Milwaukee, Wis.: 1 inches of snow.
Grand Rapids, Mich.: 1-2 inches of snow
Traverse City, Mich.: 1-2 inches of snow
Portland, Ore.: Rain much of the day.
Eureka, CA: Rain much of the day.
Olympia, WA: Rain much of the day.
Cut Bank, Mont.: Snow developing and turning much colder.

Jet Airways, BPCL, Maruti Suzuki Jump on Falling Oil Prices
NDTV | Updated On: November 28, 2014 10:14 (IST)
Fund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
The BSE Sensex and Nifty surged to record highs on Friday as Brent crude prices headed towards $70 per barrel. Gains were broad-based with all sectors rising in morning trade. However, sectors that directly benefit from falling oil prices witnessed strong buying interest today.
Here are Friday's outperformers,
1) BPCL: The state-run oil marketing company jumped nearly 5 per cent and was the top gainer on the Nifty. Other OMCs also rose sharply. HPCL jumped nearly 6 per cent, while Indian Oil Corp advanced 4 per cent. Oil refiners stand to gain most from falling prices as under recoveries from selling LPG and kerosene at below-market prices will come down significantly.
2) Jet Airways jumped over 10 per cent in morning trade. Its rival SpiceJet soared nearly 5 per cent. Domestic carriers surged on hopes that falling crude prices would lead to sharp cuts in prices of aviation turbine fuel, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of their operation cost.
3) State Bank of India jumped over 3 per cent. The Bank Nifty traded 2.3 per cent higher as against 1.1 per cent gain in the broader Nifty. Falling oil prices will narrow India's fiscal deficit. This will positively impact bond prices and lead to treasury gains for banks. State-run Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank were also among the top five Nifty gainers today.
4) Maruti Suzuki rose nearly 2 per cent on hopes that falling Brent crude would lead to lower petrol and diesel prices, which are now de-controlled. Manufacturers such as Hero MotoCorp also gained on hopes of higher demand for two-wheelers.
5) Apollo Tyres surged 5 per cent on hopes of further decline in rubber prices, which are near multi-year lows. Price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent, by the prevailing global price of crude oil. Demand from auto companies are also expected to accelerate fuelling gains in tyre stocks. Goodyear India jumped 4 per cent.

Why Jet Airways Shares Are Up 20% Today
NDTV | Updated On: November 28, 2014 18:10 (IST)
Fund Mop-up by Private Companies From Debt Placement Rises 36%
Shares of Jet Airways surged nearly 20 per cent on Friday after ICRA upgraded rating of Rs 3,210 crore loan facility given to the company based on improvement in cash flows.
The ratings agency has upgraded the long-term rating assigned to the Rs 3,210 crore, fund-based bank facilities of Jet Airways to [ICRA]BB from [ICRA]C, a statement had said yesterday.
"The rating upgrade takes into account the improvement in the liquidity and credit profile of the company, arising from improved operating performance as well as support from its strategic partner-Etihad Airways PJSC," it said.
Brent crude oil prices which headed towards $70 per barrel also boosted sentiment in the airline stocks. Traders expect falling crude prices would lead to sharp cuts in prices of aviation turbine fuel, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of their operating cost. Shares in SpiceJet also traded with over 10 per cent gains.
Shares in Jet Airways ended 20 per cent higher at Rs 322.65 apiece on NSE, outperforming the Nifty which ended1.11 per cent higher.

Mkt in strong bull run; see one bout of correction before Budget: IIFL08:00 am
The Indian equity market is in a strong bull phase and is looking good at the current levels, Nirmal Jain, chairman, IIFL said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. The valuation of Indian market is fair at the current levels , he said. However, he foresees one bout of correction before Budget.
Meanwhile, the decline in global crude price is likely to benefit paint and tyre companies, he said. On the macro front, it will have a broader positive impact on the India economy and will help soften inflation levels, he added.
Sharing his expectations from December 2 monetary policy, Jain said that the RBI will take into account recent dynamic global developments. He sees 50-60 percent chance of rate cut on Tuesday.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Nirmal Jain's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We are seeing a near 40 percent year-to-date (Y-T-D) gain, what is this index looking like to you as they stay at all time highs, is there still much more juice left over a 12 months period?
A: This is a bull market. In a bull market pendulum swings from the pessimism to exuberance and optimism. I think we are coming to a level where valuations are already reasonable now but a bull market can take it further higher. It is very difficult to guess how much higher but even at these levels, one should hold on. Whether you increase your allocation of equity or not is a difficult question to answer, but at least the markets can rise -- they may not rise as much they have risen in last few months and not at the same pace but still I would say that valuations are fair. Now they are not attractive, they are cheap, they are fair and markets are looking good.
Sonia: Between three of these pockets or among three of these pockets that benefit from falling crude prices which one looks like a lucrative option now, oil marketing companies (OMCs), paint companies, tyre companies, would you allocate fresh money to either of these pockets?
A: I think paints and tyre companies will definitely benefit. In case of tyre, rubber prices have been low for quite some time. So I would definitely allocate more money to these sectors. Having said this, may paint companies are already quoting at rich valuations but still I would say that they do benefit from this but there is an indirect benefit, which brings down inflation, which will result in interest rates coming down and the rate cut will be imminent whether it happens a couple of months later. So this will also benefit not only banks but all other sectors where the debt is high and interest cost is high like capital goods or infrastructure and all those. So it will have a broader impact on the economy in the market.
Latha: You think from hereon, there is still a bigger outperformance in the midcaps or like Vibhav Kapoor of IL&FS you think it has run up a lot, you would rather wait for recovery?
A: In case of midcap, you cannot make a statement which holds true for -- when you talk about midcaps, you talk about 500 stocks. So there are some stocks where there is value left and they will probably outperform the largecap and broader indices. There are some stocks which will run up and will be very volatile and in fact, may not give returns comparable to the indices. So I think midcap will be a heterogeneous sector in terms of valuations and performance. So you have to do a bottom-up stock picking in midcap but if you do that, there will be good stocks still that can outperform the rest of the markets.
Sonia: Vibhav Kapoor was telling us that there are some chances that we could see a rte cut on December 2 policy, how hopeful are you?
A: I would say now everyday situation is changing. Brent coming to USD 75 per barrel was unthinkable. Even politically things have improved. So I would say that there is a fair chance, I would say that at least 50-60 percent chance I would give that the rate cut would happen and it is logical, it is something which ought to happen and I think governor will take cognisance of all new developments that have happened.
Latha: Do you think the markets will take it very badly if the governor didn’t cut but sounded reasonably more positive on inflation being reined in?
A: I think there maybe a small impact, markets will not bother too much about it for two reasons one is there is very little transmissions. Regardless of rate cut, interest rates are coming down, deposit rates are coming down, lending rates are coming down. What will rate cut do -- in fact, it reduces cost of government because the government is the largest borrower, it also basically have an impact on the currency and the G-Sec so I think rate cut will have an impact but more sentimental. So I don’t think the major impact of the rate cut doesn’t happen to last too long, there are more compelling factors for the market including crude oil prices, FII flows and other things.
Sonia: A couple of weeks back or a week back, a lot of people believe that perhaps in the first part of the new year, we could be in for a correction. Given that things have changed overnight, are you getting a sense that any major correction is ruled out before the budget?
A: Correction will happen, it can happen with any trigger. So I don’t think correction is ruled out because if market has run up in one way, it has to correct. So what it does is that even if it is a very flimsy or lame excuse, market will take that to correct but the correction maybe very short-lived. Budget is still two-three months away so there will be one correction.

A Supreme Court order scrapping most coal extraction permits given to companies would have a likely impact of Rs 964.84 billion (USD 15.6 billion) on state-run lenders, the junior finance minister told parliament on Friday.
The government had deduced the impact of the cancellation of the so-called coal block allotments on banks due to likely stoppage of power production, Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to a lawmaker question on bad loans for state banks due to the verdict.
It was, however, not clear whether he was referring to an increase in bad loans or loan exposure of banks to affected companies.

Bankers and analysts have previously said it was difficult to quantify the increase in bad loans as the scrapped coal blocks will be returned after March and as all the loans to the affected companies may not turn sour.
Sinha said bad loans of state lenders were a provisional 5.32 percent of total loans as of end-September, while that of private sector lenders was a provisional 2.04 percent.
Bad loans of state banks in coal industry was 0.23 percent as of end-September, while for private banks it was 0.22 percent.

New Delhi: The alleged killing of 39 Indians in Iraq by terrorists of Islamic State was taken up in the Rajya Sabha on Friday after a section of media recently reported about it.

"My sources have told me that they are alive," Swaraj told the House.
#rajya sabha #indians #iraq #sushma swaraj
One Harjit Singh, who managed to escape the custody of Islamic State reportedly claimed that all his fellow countrymen were killed by the terrorists. "On one side there is a claim made by Harjeet Singh, and on the other side are six of my sources who tell me that the 39 Indians are alive. Let the House tell me- should I accept Harjeet's version or go ahead with the search of Indians based on inputs from my source," Swaraj said.
When the House asked the Minister to consult Harjit on the situation in Iraq, Swaraj said that he was the most vulnerable of all the people, adding that he was safe in government's preventive care. She added that she had met the affected families at least five times.
She rounded up her statement in the House saying, "The day I get a single, solid evidence to collaborate what Harjit is saying, I will inform the House, but I am going by what my sources are saying right now."

Syrian Electronic Army hackers force message on websites via GigyaNov 28, 2014 at 11:06am IST
Syrian Electronic Army hackers force message on websites via Gigya

Los Angeles: A US firm that helps connect more than 700 companies with customers through social media says a Syrian group hacked the company's web address to upload a message to other websites.
Gigya CEO Patrick Salyer outlined what happened in a blog published Thursday.
At around 6:45 AM Eastern Time, the company discovered "sporadic failures with access to our service," Salyer wrote.

#syrian electronic army #gigya #hackers #online security
The executive said hackers had rerouted Internet traffic from Gigya's website to an outside computer server. That server generated a message to visitors that their site had been hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army.
Published reports noted the message appeared on websites for several UK newspapers, CNBC and the National Hockey League.
The message also showed up briefly on some retail sites just as they prepared for the biggest shopping day of the year on Friday. The National Retail Federation did not immediately comment Thursday.
Still, the issue appeared to be resolved quickly.
The hackers rerouted Gigya's web traffic by tweaking the WHOIS record of gigya.com so that it would point visitors to the outside server. The registry entry was fixed about an hour after the company detected the breach, Salyer said.
Even so, the executive sought to reassure the company's clients.
"To be absolutely clear: Neither Gigya's platform itself nor any user, administrator or operational data has been compromised and was never at risk of being compromised," he wrote.
The Syrian Electronic Army aligns itself with Syrian President Bashar Assad. It has previously taken credit for hacking media sites like E! Online and the BBC.

Thanksgiving Day shopping all about the bargains1
Online sales were up 12 percent Thursday evening compared with last year, and smartphones played an increasingly large role in shopping, according to IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark. Mobile traffic accounted for almost half of all online traffic and mobile sales accounted for 30 percent of all online sales, both numbers up about 26 percent from last year, IBM said.
While the average online order value was flat, people were buying more items per order, suggesting they are becoming more savvy at using online coupons and rebates to get the best bargains, it said.
White, a student at Lane College in Tennessee who was back in town for the holiday, had things besides shopping on his mind. He was wondering whether he should participate in the swelling calls to boycott Black Friday shopping as a way to protest a Missouri grand jury's decision on Monday not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.
The boycott campaign, which encourages people to protest with their wallets, has been catching fire on social media, with the hashtags #NotOneDime, #BlackoutFriday and #BlackoutBlackFriday.
"My peers were saying we should boycott it," White said. "But I don't know what (good) it's going to do."
But on Thursday, at least, there didn't seem to be any dampening of the shopping spirit that Charlie O'Shea could see. O'Shea, a vice president at Moody's Investment Service, does a loop of stores in Northern New Jersey every year, and he said he's noticed lines getting longer as stores open earlier, with most people vying for tablets and TVs. He expects the race to start earlier and earlier to continue.
"If you want to be in this game, you've got to open when your competitors are open or you're not giving (consumers) a choice," O'Shea said.
While the current Thanksgiving Day trend seems to be a matter of retailers keeping up with their competitors, one retail expert wonders whether retailers will think it worthwhile ultimately, given the higher salaries they have to pay to employees who work on Thanksgiving Day and the steep discounts they offer.
"I'm thinking that eventually the profit numbers are going to have to decide," said Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based company that analyzes in-store shopping patterns.
Although major big-box stores have gotten on the Thanksgiving Day bandwagon, plenty of retailers remain closed.
That was a disappointment for the Olson family, which was visiting Chicago from Traverse City, Mich. Sue and Duce Olson and their two kids, 9-year-old Aidan and 7-year-old Sophie, had planned their day around visiting Water Tower Place in the evening, which for the first time opened at 6 p.m. Thursday.
But while the line stretched long to get into Macy's, most of the other stores in the mall were closed, including American Girl Place and The Lego Store, a major frustration for Sophie.
How did they plan to spend the evening instead?
"Probably listen to more whining and take a taxi back to the hotel," Sue Olson said.

5 Positive Things Around The World To Be Thankful Forreddit
The year 2014 has been marred by crisis and unrest across the globe, with tragedy, war and disease dominating the headlines. While bad news often has overshadowed the good, there nevertheless has been positive change.
This year has seen efforts by individuals and organizations dedicated to helping others. There have been peaceful transitions of democracy in places unthinkable not long ago, and tangible change that has made life better for countless people.
The WorldPost presents a roundup of global events that you can be thankful for.
1. Congo Is Now Ebola-Free
While health workers and aid agencies urgently try to contain the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, many miles away, the central African nation of Congo has been in an Ebola battle of its own . The Congo outbreak, involving a different subtype of the virus than the one thought to have originated in Guinea, claimed dozens of lives since its emergence in August.
That outbreak is now over , as brave efforts from local authorities and quick reaction led the World Health Organization to declare Congo officially Ebola-free on Nov. 21.

2. Hope For Democracy In The Birthplace Of The Arab Spring
Tunisia recently held presidential elections , set to continue in a second-round runoff to select a final winner. The North African nation’s presidential vote is notable because it’s the first free and fair one in its history.
More than three years ago, Tunisia’s revolution spread into a wider Arab uprising, leaving an indelible mark across the Middle East and North Africa. Today, hopes for greater democratic freedoms in these countries have largely been dashed, as states have returned to autocracy, put down demonstrations, or descended into all-out war. Tunisia and its recent elections are the exception, and the hope for peace and stable democracy remains cautiously optimistic.

3. Gay Marriage Is On The Rise
A recent report by Pew Research Center found that a “growing number of governments around the world are considering whether to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriages.”
That change is reflected in the United States as well, where 32 states are now issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The fight for equality is gaining ground.

4. Polio Has Been Eradicated In India
Once a worldwide scourge, polio is now only endemic in three countries -- Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. The latest nation to be declared free of the disease was India, which as CNN explains , was home to nearly half of the world’s cases as recently as 2009.
Along with 10 other countries, India was certified to be officially polio-free by the WHO in March. This marks a triumph by health workers over titanic development challenges posed by the virulent infectious disease .

5. A Big Change In China
This month, China made a huge policy change that affects the world. A climate agreement between the United States and China caps the Asian nation's carbon emissions at their 2030 peak.
The agreement signals hope for the future of international climate negotiations, at a time when pressure is mounting for states to make tangible efforts to address climate change.

Market cap of BSE listed companies crosses landmark 100 lakh croreMarket cap of BSE listed companies crosses landmark 100 lakh crore
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 28, 2014 11:32 IST
Asia's first exchange & fastest stock exchange, BSE has reached yet another landmark today by crossing a milestone in terms of its market capitalisation.
 
 
India's market capitalisation as represented by listed companies on BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) reached historic Rs. 100 lakh crore mark today for the first time. Asia's first exchange & fastest stock exchange, BSE has reached yet another landmark today by crossing a milestone in terms of its market capitalisation.
 
On this landmark moment, Ashish Kumar Chauhan, MD & CEO, BSE said, "India and BSE reached a significant milestone today. ?It is a reflection on the potential of India as a new age powerhouse. It is also significant that it has happened after highly successful tour of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Nepal for SAARC, Australia for G20, Myanmar and Fiji.  This achievement is a reflection of India's growth potential as seen from the foreign investor's perspective as well as the competitiveness of Indian entrepreneurs to manage world class organisations." 
 
 "It has taken India and BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs 100 lakh crores market capitalisation. However given India's potential, India should be able to achieve multiple times Rs 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in time to come. In that sense India has a long way to go on the path of   job creation and wealth creation" Mr. Chauhan added
 
BSE in its endeavor to bring transparency and accuracy to the market has taken several initiatives and has been increasing its market share both in cash and derivatives segment. It has also gained leadership in many other products like BSE SME platform, BSE Star MF and many more.
 
BSE has acted as a catalyst in helping India create 100 lakh crore market capitalisations. We believe India will use capital market mechanism more over the period to help India do wealth creation and job creation.  Chauhan added "BSE believes India can create 1.5 crore new jobs every year for next 20 years aggregating to 30 crore jobs using entrepreneurial energy of Indian youth. BSE will continue to act as the catalyst for wealth creation and job creation in time to come. It has taken India and BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs 100 lakh crores market capitalisation. However given India's potential, India should be able to achieve multiple times Rs 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in time to come.  
 
BSE received close to 46.5 crore orders, on September 16, 2014 highest ever number of order received in a day in the history of BSE. BSE has also increased its market share due to its faster technology which it introduced in April 2014. BSE launched its equity trading platform software 'BOLT Plus'.  The BSE trading system (Bolt Plus) is based on T7, the global trading architecture of Deutsche Bourse AG. One of the key features of the system is its response time of approximately 200 micro seconds, making it the fastest trading platform in the country.

State banks to take $15.6-bn hit on coal verdictManoj Kumar and Devidutta Tripathy        Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 15:00 IST
A Supreme Court order scrapping most coal extraction permits given to companies would have a likely impact of Rs 96,484 crore ($15.6 billion) on state-run lenders, state finance minister told Parliament on Friday.
The government had deduced the impact of the cancellation of the so-called coal block allotments on banks due to likely stoppage of power production, Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to a lawmaker question on bad loans for state banks due to the verdict.
It was, however, not clear whether he was referring to an increase in bad loans or loan exposure of banks to affected companies.
Bankers and analysts have previously said it was difficult to quantify the increase in bad loans as the scrapped coal blocks will be returned after March and as all the loans to the affected companies may not turn sour.
Sinha said bad loans of state lenders were a provisional 5.32 per cent of total loans as of end-September, while that of private sector lenders was a provisional 2.04 per cent.
Bad loans of state banks in coal industry was 0.23 per cent as of end-September, while for private banks it was 0.22 per cent.

There is  good buzz  around biz ecosystem: SitharamanThere is 'good buzz' around business ecosystem, says Nirmala Sitharaman
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 13:55 IST
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
Noting that steps were being taken to improve the overall business environment, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said there is generally good buzz around the ecosystem after the new government came to power.
Sitharaman, who also holds industry portfoiio, said IIP (Index of Industrial Production) saw a growth of 2.8 per cent during the April-September period of current fiscal, after falling for the past three years.
"There is a positive movement after the decline. Hope the trajectory of growth will keep going", she told the Lok Sabha during the Question Hour.
Noting that government is taking various steps to improve the ease of doing business and stimulate industrial production, Sitharaman said that now, there is generally good buzz around the ecosystem. Before growing 2.8 per cent in latest April-September period, IIP had seen negative growth of 0.1 per cent in 2013-14 period.
It fell to 1.1 per cent in 2012-13 period from 2.9 per cent seen in 2011-12 period.
For the creation of a conducive business environment, the government is constantly simplifying and rationalising the processes and procedures for boosting investor sentiment, simplifying FDI policy and correcting the inverted duty structure, she said.
Besides, the government has launched the e-biz mission mode project under the national e-governance plan and also the 'Make In India' programme.
The growth of manufacturing sector during the last three fiscal years has declined continuously, eventually recording marginally negative growth in 2013-14 and the growth of capital goods has been negative during the same years.
However, growth of manufacturing sector and capital goods has registered modest recovery during the first half of the current fiscal year, Sitharaman said.
Admitting that industrial growth numbers were not happy news for the country, Sitharaman said the situation is improving.
She said moderation in domestic demand, build up of inflationary pressure in recent past, increase in input costs and slowdown in other economies were among the reasons for decline in industrial growth.
Responding to a query on whether government is looking into the reasons for fall in industrial production, the Minister replied in the negative and said the figures come as statistical information.

At Rs 20 000 per plate  Arvind Kejriwal s AAP fund-raiser turns cash machine to foil  brand ModiDisinvestment: Govt eyes fatter share sale kitty in 2015; gets Rs 18k cr in 2014
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal hosted a Rs 20,000 per plate dinner for young professionals, diamond merchants and bankers here kick-starting the party’s fund-raising campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections.
“We collected Rs 91 lakh from the fund-raiser dinner last night. Rs 36 lakh were collected from donor passes, Rs 36 lakh was through cheque donation from those who came and our volunteers collected Rs 21 lakh,” AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said here today.
“The next fundraiser will be in Bengaluru. We are impressed with the response to our fund-raiser drive,” she said.
With online donations, AAP is looking to raise funds differently to take on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is relying on ‘brand Modi’.
“The Mumbai dinner had space for a maximum of 200 donors, mostly our supporters. Most of those who attended were young professionals, some diamond merchants and a few directors from Bollywood,” she said.
AAP’s Maharashtra unit has a target of raising Rs 5 crore over the next two months through reach-out drives,” she said.
In the run-up to this year’s Lok Sabha elections, Arvind Kejriwal had in March hosted a fund-raising dinner in Bengaluru inviting criticism from Congress which questioned whether the AAP leader who then also charged Rs 20,000 per person for having a meal with him could claim to represent the common man.
“Kejriwal has appealed people to donate for the party,” Menon said.
To encourage donations, AAP is tweeting online donors’ names with the hashtag #IFundHonestPolitics.
After the Delhi Assembly elections in December 2013, the party has so far received donations from over a lakh donors. The maximum money has come from Maharashtra, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Users turning to WeChat  WhatsApp to reach friends: SurveyProperty portal Housing.com raises $90 mn from SoftBank Group, Falcon Edge, others
An increasing number of people are now using mobile messaging apps like WeChat and WhatsApp to communicate with their friends rather than using social networking platforms such as Facebook and Google+, according to GlobalWebIndex (GWI) Research.
While social networking is one of the fastest rising online activities — up 187 per cent globally and 242 per cent in Asia Pacific region — the gap between users with accounts and those actively using is significant.
GWI surveyed about 42,000 respondents in the Asia Pacific region, including 5,000 respondents in India during the year.
According to GWI, 83 per cent Internet users had Facebook accounts, but only 47 per cent actively used the website.
In India, 93 per cent said they had a Facebook account but only 48 per cent had active usage.
Also, the number of global users using Facebook to message a friend has continued to decline from 512 million in Q1 2013 to 402 million in Q4 2013 to 313 million in Q3 2014.
About 28 per cent of respondents from India said they “logged in to see what’s happening without posting/commenting on anything myself” on Facebook, Twitter (23 per cent) and Google+ (21 per cent).
At the same time, number of people using mobile messaging services has increased from 446 million in Q1 2013 to 538 million in Q4 2013 and 616 million in Q3 2014.
Respondents said they were not interested in using Facebook like before, they were bored or generally spending less time on social networks as top reasons for using the world’s largest social networking lesser.
According to GWI, the top reasons for this surge in usage includes messaging apps being free (45 per cent), being quicker than using social networks or text messages to speak to people (41 per cent) and lots of friends using them (41 per cent).
In Asia Pacific, WeChat was the dominant messaging app (337 million), WhatsApp led the pack in India.
“Mobile messaging tools have experienced substantial growth during this recent period, particularly amongst the younger generation. Social networks are now being treated more passively, the number of people messaging friends on social networks is now declining,” GlobalWebIndex Head of Trends Jason Mander told reporters here.
People are now seeing mobile messaging apps as a more efficient way to communicate, he added.
“In the last year, the Indian mobile messaging audience grew by 113 per cent, we expect the number of mobile messaging users to continue to grow in the coming quarters,” he said.
He added that smartphones are vital to Internet users in India, where 79 per cent of the online population own a smartphone.
“The users of mobile messengers are young, affluent and highly active online,” Mander said.

How Flipkart  Amazon & Snapdeal changed the lives of thousands of small bizmenHow online marketplaces are changing the lives of thousands of merchants

(The ability to reach out…)
From garages in Mumbai to sari shops in Varanasi, thousands of manufacturers and traders are today tapping a rapidly growing online retail market in India thanks to marketplaces like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon.
The ability to reach out to a nationwide market and lower costs are ensuring a sharp increase in sales for the over 80,000 merchants who sell just on these portals. A survey conducted by research firm Spire Research and Consulting this year showed that for offline retailers selling online, the latter is contributing up to 50% of overall sales.
Next year the online retail market is expected to reach $6 billion (over Rs 37,000 crore) in size. The online multi-category stores are responsible for almost 90% of the sales online, according to industry estimates, which means a bulk of this $6 billion will flow into bank accounts of merchants. No wonder then that online retail is changing the lives of thousands of merchants.
"Five years ago I did not have a job, now my apparel business has grown 15-fold and I am targeting over Rs 1 crore in sales," said Mumbai-based Saumya Gupta, 26, whose apparel brand Ten On Ten sells only through online sites like Flipkart and Snapdeal. There are challenges of course. Inability to increase production capacity at the same pace as demand, issue of returns, and lack of infrastructure are just some of the worries that are tempering merchants' optimism about the sector.
"There are now thousands of sellers in each category, so competition is growing," said Karan Chugh, owner of ethnic wear retail firm Florence Clothing from Surat. But for merchants, like the following six, online retail has meant success and a growth in ambition.
Rahul Agrawal, Chandrakala Enterprisess
Rahul Agrawal did not want to run his family business of distributing Banarasi saris and dress materials the traditional way. After graduating from IIT-Mumbai in 2009, Agrawal worked for a financial research firm in Delhi and then started an online games retailer in 2012. Running the games business helped him realise the potential of India's online retail market.
"With the games site, we faced challenges of procurement, but our sari business already had a strong procurement network," said Agrawal. He gave up his stake in the games business and moved back to Varanasi in 2013 to run the three-decade-old Chandrakala Enterprises. In September that year, he started selling his Banarasi saris on sites like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.
"Online is now contributing to about 25% of our business and could overtake our offline trade within the next two years," said Agrawal, 29. While issues like the inability of weavers to expand production rapidly remain, Agrawal is happy with his decision.
"I would have had to eventually take over the family business but thanks to online retail I am having fun," said Agrawal, who is targeting sales of at least Rs 16 crore this fiscal from online sales.
Yogesh Wadhwa, DMP Carrycases
Yogesh Wadhwa's eight-year-old business of manufacturing laptop bags for original equipment manufacturers ran into rough weather about two years ago when companies like Samsung and Sony decided to stop making laptops. Wadhwa decided to launch his own brand of bags and luggage, Bleu.
"The conventional route would have required a lot of investments, so we thought of going online," said Wadhwa, 43, who started retailing on Amazon about 10 months back. "We put up 10 designs one day and by next morning it was sold out. We realised we had a winner."
Around the time of launching on Amazon, he sold about 1,000 pieces of a toiletry kit on Groupon in one day. "I realised, apart from low prices, customers are attracted to products that are not easily available offline," said Wadhwa.
DMP sells about 150 products on regular days across most major online portals and is targeting about Rs 4 crore online sales this fiscal. "If I had to do this offline I would not have been able to do that without a heavier infusion of capital," said Wadhwa. "We are a totally debt-free company."
Karan Chugh, Florence Clothing
Karan Chugh's family has been running an apparel manufacturing and wholesale business, Majestic Silk, in Surat since 1960 and the family diversified into retail in 2007.
It was when Chugh, 25, started shopping online that he decided to retail the mass market Florence brand of saris and dress materials online.
"The idea was to explore," recalled Chugh, who started with Snapdeal in 2012 and now sells on most top marketplaces. In the first month, Florence sold Rs 5 lakh worth of products, but Chugh could see the steady ramp up in orders.
Within a few months, Chugh started Silk Bazaar, a more premium range priced up to Rs 30,000, just for the online market. With online retail accounting for over 70% of the company's overall sales, he has cut back offline operations from 30 stores to five. He also operates shop-in-shops in Vishal Megamart and at More.

UDHAMPUR (J&K): Pakistani rangers today violated ceasefire by resorting to brief firing along the international border in Jammu's Arnia sub-sector, just hours after it was hit by a terror strike.
"There was a few rounds of firing from Pakistani side on our positions in Pital border outpost area in Arnia sub-sector today," a senior BSF officer said.
BSF troops, however, observed calm and did not retaliate, he said, adding, there were no reports of any casualty.
In a terror strike on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jammu, militants wearing combat uniform attacked two army bunkers close to border in Arnia yesterday leaving 11 people including three civilians and as many army men dead in a fierce gun battle with security forces.
Modi is due to address a rally today in Udhampur district, which is 100 km from Arnia. The attack also coincided with the SAARC summit in Kathmandu attended by Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif .

As shale dream fades  guar growers chase new...As the shale dream fades, India's guar growers chase new markets

Guar gum
(India was in an enviable…)
MUMBAI: Sitting in his village in the desert state of Rajasthan, Sehdev Bishnoi worries that oil firms a world away in the United States will buy less of his guar in future, ending a short-lived boom that helped him and other Indian farmers out of poverty.
Food firms are also buyers and the sector is likely to take more this year as traders scout out new markets, but it will be hard to match the impact made by oil industry demand in recent years.
Drillers use the gum derived from guar, also known as cluster beans, for hydraulic fracturing and many poor farmers switched crops to ride the US shale boom.
Guar gum exports had been ticking along at around 200,000 tonnes a year until 2009/10, but as US frackers stocked up, shipments jumped to a record of about 700,000 tonnes in the financial year to March 2012. Prices jumped tenfold.
India was in an enviable position, with around 80 per cent of the guar market. Its guar seed output has almost tripled in the past three years to 3 million tonnes.
However, its crop can be unreliable due to swings in monsoon rains, and oilfield service firms such as Halliburton started developing more reliable alternatives, with predictable results: guar seed prices have slumped 47 per cent to 4,900 rupees ($79.112) per 100 kg since May 2013.
"I'll make a loss at these prices because production costs have gone up but prices are so low," said Bishnoi, whose state produces about 80 per cent of India's guar seed output.
A collapse in oil prices to four-year lows has added to the anguish.
"This is worrying everyone. Below $75 per barrel it's not profitable for the fracking companies to continue operations," said BD Agarwal, managing director of Vikas WSP, an exporter of guar gum in Rajasthan.
No wonder that Indian farmers and traders are scrambling to find other markets, with the food industry the best bet.
FOOD AND TEXTILES
At the moment, about 60 per cent of the flour-like gum obtained after milling guar is used in shale drilling to raise the viscosity of proppants, materials that are forced into shale fractures to enlarge them so that oil and gas can be extracted.
  The food industry is already the second-biggest buyer. Guar gum acts as a stabiliser in sauces and noodles and prevents the formation of ice crystals in frozen desserts such as ice cream.
Guar is also used by the textile industry as a thickening agent for printing dyes and its by-products are used as high-protein cattle feed. It takes 3 kg of guar seeds to make 1 kg of guar gum.
Traders are hoping the drop in prices will encourage more food firms to pick up guar gum rather than alternatives such as locust bean gum, derived from the seeds of the carob tree.
"Demand from oil firms has come down due to rising use of alternatives such as slickwater and other things, but inquiries from food companies have improved at lower prices," said Purshottam Hissaria, an exporter in Jodhpur.
Guar gum consumption by food companies in the fiscal year to March is likely to rise 13 per cent to 35,000 tonnes, said Sohan Jain, an exporter of food-grade gum mainly to Europe.
With the food industry taking up some of the slack from the oil sector, albeit at much lower prices, India's guar gum exports this fiscal year may be slightly higher than the 475,000 tonnes shipped last year, Hissaria said.
Even so, farmers such as Bishnoi are considering their options.
"Guar has not remained as profitable as it was a few years ago," he said. "Next year I will sow some other crop."

World s biggest animal sacrifice fair begins in Nepalprint
Gadhimai Mela, the world's biggest animal fair held once every five years, began at Bariyarpur in Bara district of Nepal bordering Bihar on Friday.
Thousands of buffaloes, mostly calves, were sacrificed at an enclosed field close to the temple of Goddess Gadhimai, a Hindu deity, believed by devotees to grant wishes if they sacrifice animals and birds.
But unlike previous occasions, the total number of sacrifices is expected to be much lesser this time due to efforts by animal rights activists and a ban on bringing animals to the fair from India.
Every five years, the world’s largest animal sacrifice takes place at the Gadhimai Temple in Nepal. The month-long festival has raised controversy due to the large number of animals killed – up to 500,000 over two days. (AP Photo)
Sacrifices at the fair began on Thursday night with 'pancha bali'---where five animals—a pig, pigeons, duck, hen and rat were offered to the goddess by the priest of the temple.
The sacrifice of buffaloes began early on Friday morning where hundreds of locals armed with swords, machetes and khukuris started the mass killing.
Hundreds of thousands of devotees from all over Nepal and from neighbouring India are converging at the site and many have brought animals are birds along to offer the goddess.
"Over 1300 police personnel have been deployed near the temple to manage the smooth flow of devotees. Routine checking is also being conducted," said a local police officer.
The ritual continues for two days and on the second day goats are sacrificed. Devotees and residents of villages near the temple sacrifice rats, pigeons, ducks, hens and goats themselves.
Nearly 25,000 buffaloes were killed during the 2009 fair, but there is no data on the total number of animals and birds sacrificed. Some estimate it to be around 500,000.
This year due to efforts of animal rights activists to spread awareness and make people desist from offering animals and birds to appease the goddess, the figure is expected to be much less.
"Besides faith there is a network of vested interests who want to promote the killings to earn profits," Indian activist Swami Agnivesh who is camping near to temple to stop the sacrifices told a Nepali news channel.

Last month India's Supreme Court directed the government to enforce a ban on illegal entry of animals to Nepal especially for the Gadhimai Mela.
Usually nearly 70% of the buffaloes and goats sacrificed at the fair come from India. But enforcement of the ban has led to drop in figures.
It was estimated that nearly 5,000 buffaloes were sacrificed within few hours on Friday morning. The killings will continue on Saturday.
A news report says nearly 125,000 goats have been sold in local markets near the temple in the past three months. They will be sacrificed on Saturday.

HC allows Delhi schools to set guidelines for nursery admissionsNursery relief at last, HC gives schools more say
Soibam Rocky Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014

Holding out hope that nursery admissions this time round won’t be the mess they were last year, the Delhi high court on Friday empowered private unaided schools in the Capital to fix their own criteria, quashing last year’s government-mandated points-based system.
The court also restored the 20% management quota followed by schools before it was scrapped last year. With admission season just around the corner, the verdict effectively gives private schools “maximum autonomy in day-to-day administration, including right to admit students”.
The Delhi government plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, leading to apprehension of protracted litigation and, thereby, of a repeat of last year’s chaos.
In 2013, schools had reluctantly followed lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung’s points-based system that earmarked a massive 70 points for neighbourhood, 20 for siblings and 5 for alumni while doing away with the management quota. Five points for inter-state transfer cases was later scrapped by the government after parents went to court against it.
Various schools and parents had challenged the L-G’s guidelines in court, triggering a messy fight with more than 15 petitions filed. The admission season, which starts in January and concludes by March 31, had dragged on till May-end and the academic year had started from July instead of April. The L-G had defended his decision then, calling it an effort to end “commercialisation of education”.
However, the high court on Friday said Jung’s actions were “neither procedurally proper nor rational”. In his verdict, Justice Manmohan pointed out that the government did not submit any document or material to show schools were indulging in any malpractice.
The court also said that by awarding 70 out of 95 points for neighbourhood, the L-G’s guidelines had placed “undue emphasis on location of residence of a child over which she/he has no control”.
“This court is unable to appreciate that a student’s educational fate can be relegated to his position on a map,” the judgment read.
It added that by awarding five points for siblings studying in the same school, the guidelines placed an only child at a disadvantage.
The court said that the power to choose a school has to rest primarily with the parents and not the administration, and opined that “by increasing parental choice and granting schools the autonomy to admit students, the accountability of private schools can be ensured”.
For now, private schools can go back to the ‘flexible’ pre-2013 system of admission. This means they can fix their own criteria and the quantum of points to go with them. A school can choose to retain or omit the neighbourhood criteria, for instance.

WTO deal clinched without any compromise  says SitharamanWTO deal clinched without any compromise, says Sitharaman
BS Reporter | New Delhi Nov 28, 2014 01:37 PM IST
Minister of State (independent charge) for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman today said decision to extend the food secuirty 'Peace Clause', one of the main demands of the government, was taken at the World Trade Organization (WTO) without any compromise.
"WTO deal clinched without any concession or compromise.WTO deal to ensure India continues with its policy to provide minimum support price (MSP) to farmers," Sitharaman told Lok Sabha today.
The WTO, at a special meeting of the General Council, signed the much-awaited Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) while simultaneously clarifying the ambiguity on the so-called 'Peace Clause' for food stockpiling.
India had been insisting on clarifying the deal that was reached in Bali last year on the food security 'Peace Clause'. The Bharatiya Janta Party government that came to power in May this year, had demanded that the 'Peace Clause' be extended until a permanent solution to the food stocks issue is achieved.
"WTO deal allows a mechanism for developing nations like India to continue with public stockholding programme without any challenge," added Sitharaman.
The 'Peace Clause' or interim measure to the issue will not only immune India from legal challenges but will also give the freedom to subsidise the farmers without being restricted by the prescribed WTO limit.
On the other hand, the TFA, which is now up for ratification, is the first such multilateral deal reached in the history of WTO. The deal is expected to inject $1 trillion into the global economy while creating 21 million jobs by way of reduction in transactions costs and easing of global customs rules.
"WTO is back on track. We have delivered today on a promise we made in Bali. Now let's make it count ... On public stockholding we are committed to following an accelerated timeframe," said WTO director general  Roberto Azevêdo on Thursday.

Ten stocks with over 50% gains you should holdStory
The 50% club
We bring you best stocks among those that have risen more than 50% since the new government took over at the Centre.

If you were invested in the right stocks when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the 2014 general elections, you would have made big gains . For instance, since the election results were announced on May 16, the IFB Industries stock has made investors richer by roughly four times by rising 381%. It is followed by Indo Count Industries (up 340%), Kirloskar Brothers Investment (330%), TVS Srichakra (307%) and Syncom Formulations (288%).
The BSE Sensex, the BSE Midcap index and the BSE Smallcap index rose 16%, 30% and 42%, respectively, after the results till November 11. There are 770 stocks in these indices. Out of these, 645 have risen after the results, of which 42% have returned over 50% during the period.
"Whenever a large number of stocks move sharply, it is generally due to change in sentiment and momentum. Such movement may not be justified by fundamentals."
KUNJ BANSAL
Executive Director and Chief Investment officer, Centrum Wealth Management
Vaibhav Agrawal, vice president, research, Angel Broking, says, "Many stocks rose mainly due to low valuations. There was also the sentiment built by the coming to power of a BJP-led government." Kunj Bansal, executive director and chief investment officer, Centrum Wealth Management, says, "Whenever a large number of stocks move sharply in a short period, it is generally due to change in sentiment and momentum. Such movements may not be justified by immediate improvement in fundamentals. The initial part of the current bull run was one such occasion."
Many market experts are predicting a multi-year bull run. Alex Mathews, research head, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, says, "Valuations in India are higher than that of the MSCI emerging market index. But investors are still preferring Indian stocks as the rally can go on for many years."

BUY OR SELL?
If you plan to sell a stock because it has risen sharply in the last few months, wait. The decision to sell/hold should be based on whether the company has a good business model and not the rise in price.
"Investors must buy stocks of companies with strong governance norms. It is not advisable to book profit in a stock just because it has risen 50% as it may still be reasonably valued," says Mathews.
Sampath Reddy, chief investment officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, says, "Each stock has to be viewed on its own merit. While some may rise further, some may have run ahead of fundamentals. Overall, we are positive about India's economic growth, which should lead to a rise in corporate earnings."
We speak to experts to find out 10 stocks out of those that have risen over 50% since May 16 that are still worth holding.
"Many stocks rose so much mainly due to low valuations. There was also the sentiment built by the coming to power of a Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre."

Vice President, Research, Angel Broking
INSECTICIDES (INDIA)
The company is in the business of formulation and manufacture of pesticides. Its stock rose 200% to Rs 824 between May 16 and November 11. In 2013-14, net profit was Rs 39.94 crore, up 13.09% from Rs 35.32 crore in 2012-13. It was Rs 8.5 crore in 2006-07.
"We believe the stock can touch Rs 1,006 in the next few quarters. The reasons are the company's flexible business model, good earnings growth, rising sales in the high-margin molecules segment and increase in free cash flow. We foresee 33% a year earnings per share growth between 2013-14 and 2016-17," says Vivek Kumar, research analyst (pharma & agro chemicals), institutional equity, SBICAP Securities.
KITEX GARMENTS
The company makes garments for exports. The stock rose 62.6% to Rs 135.17 from the start of the year till May 15. After the May 16 election results, it rose another 173% till November 11. Kitex reported a net profit of Rs 5,737 crore in 2013-14, 95.29% more than Rs 29.37 crore in 2012-13. "Green shoots are visible in textiles & apparel businesses due to faster growth in the US and the euro zone. Kitex, a big player in the infant segment, may gain from these factors as many frontline stores are keen to stock up its products," says Mathews of Geojit BNP Paribas.
RAMCO SYSTEMS
Ramco, which delivers enterprise software and services, has a history of disappointing shareholders. In the last six financial years, it has made profit in just one (2010-11).

Govt sources say Indians kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq still alive; efforts on to trace them: SushmaSwarajBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: November 29, 2014 12:20 am | Updated: November 29, 2014 1:42 am
The government on Friday told Parliament it was continuing its search for 39 Indians abducted by the Islamic State in Iraq six months ago despite claims by one who escaped that the others had been killed.
Making a statement in both Houses — the matter was raised by Congress members Jyotiraditya Scindia in Lok Sabha and Anand Sharma in Rajya Sabha — External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the government had received information from six sources, including the Red Crescent, that the Indians abducted in Mosul in June were alive.
She said there were discrepancies in the account of Harjeet Masih, the Indian who escaped and claimed that the remaining 39 had been killed — this was first  reported in August by The Indian Express, which had earlier highlighted the fears and plight of the families of the abducted men. Swaraj referred to the reports during the course of her statement to the House.
Masih’s version, narrated by two Bangladeshi workers on an ABP News programme on Thursday night, prompted the minister to clarify the position in Parliament on Friday.
“The Bangladeshis were only quoting Masih, there is nothing new in this. It is hearsay… While we have no direct contact with the group on the ground, at least six sources have told us that they (abducted Indians) are alive. Now should we believe Masih’s version and discontinue the search or continue our efforts to trace them because there are others who say they are alive? I will go with the second option,” she said.
Rejecting the Congress charge that the government was “misleading” the House, Swaraj said the matter was extremely sensitive and secrecy had to be maintained to make any headway in the search. She said a former envoy to the region, deputed to ASEAN, was told to head back and use his contacts to boost the search operation. “I ask for updates everyday.”
To a query on the whereabouts of Harjeet Masih, she said he is in the protective care of the government which believes he faces a threat in view of his escape. She said the search operation in and around Mosul is not easy since “the group that controls the area (Islamic State) has no government while the government of the country has no control over the area”.
As Swaraj made her statement in both Houses, members across parties paid rapt attention, most in agreement with what the government was doing to trace the abducted Indians.

Pakistan violates ceasefire along international border inArniaBy: Press Trust of India | Udhampur |
Posted: November 28, 2014 2:11 pm
Pakistani rangers on Thursday violated ceasefire by resorting to brief firing along the international border in Jammu’s Arnia sub-sector, just hours after it was hit by a terror strike. “
There was a few rounds of firing from Pakistani side on our positions in Pital border outpost area in Arnia sub-sector today,” a senior BSF officer said. BSF troops, however, observed calm and did not retaliate, he said, adding, there were no reports of any casualty.
In a terror strike on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jammu, militants wearing combat uniform attacked two army bunkers close to border in Arnia on Thursday leaving 11 people including three civilians and as many army men dead in a fierce gun battle with security forces.
Modi addressed a rally on Friday in Udhampur district, which is 100 km from Arnia. The attack also coincided with the SAARC summit in Kathmandu attended by Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif.

After OPEC refuses to act  rouble hits all-time low | China shares at 2-yr highMoscow
(At 0709 GMT, the rouble was…)
MOSCOW: Russian assets sank early on Friday, with the rouble and shares hitting new lows, as oil prices collapsed after OPEC decided to leave its output targets unchanged despite a heavily oversupplied market.
At 0745 GMT, the rouble had recovered slightly but was still around 1.3 per cent weaker than the previous close at 49.28 roubles per dollar and 0.8 per cent weaker against the euro at 61.39 roubles per euro.
Earlier it hit an all-time low of 49.90 versus the dollar.
The dollar-denominated RTS index was 2.7 per cent lower at 979 points, after earlier hitting a five-year low of 969 points, while the rouble-denominated MICEX index was flat at 1,532 points.
Brent crude was last trading at around $71.70 a barrel after falling as much as $6.50 a barrel a day earlier, when the OPEC oil producer group made known its decision not to cut output.
"Yesterday's rouble drop has more legs amid a negative outlook on crude," Maxim Korovin, a forex analyst at VTB Capital bank in Moscow , said in a note.
Oil and gas account for around two-thirds of Russian exports, making the rouble and other Russian assets sensitive to changes in the oil price.
Korovin highlighted the current fragility of the Russian FX market, observing that the rouble was swinging sharply as small purchases of foreign currency moved the market.
Russia's central bank let the rouble float earlier this month after spending over $70 billion defending the currency this year. The bank has warned, however, that it could still carry out large, ad hoc interventions to defend the rouble if threats to financial stability emerge.
On Friday, the rouble was down over 30 per cent against the dollar this year, making it the worst-performing emerging- market currency.

India well-positioned to attract investments...Ajay S Shriram
(While it is still early days,…)
SINGAPORE: India is well-positioned to attract investments from the likes of Japan, US, Europe and even China given its geographical location, size of domestic market and relatively lower cost structure, a Singapore minister said today.
"The development priorities and economic agenda of the new Indian Government (also) present interesting possibilities for partnership with Singapore," said S Iswaran, the Second Minister for Trade and Industry at a symposium on business prospects in India.
While it is still early days, the new government has announced several key initiatives, such as 'Make in India', Swachh Bharat and smart cities, he said.
He highlighted growing confidence in India underlining Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong leadership ushering in "an era of political stability, certainty and growth in India".
Iswaran pointed out the five decades of good diplomatic relations between Singapore and India.
"We look forward to elevating the Singapore-India relationship to greater heights and through different modalities of collaboration at the Centre and also in the states."
Singapore and India will celebrate five decades of bilateral diplomatic relations next year, which also marks the country's 50 years of independence.
Addressing around 300 delegates at the Singapore-India Business Symposium, Iswaran re-emphasized Singapore's interest in contributing to India's mission to develop smart and sustainable cities.
"We have been requested by the Indian Government to share our experience in urbanization and city development," he said, adding, Singapore's public and private sectors could make a meaningful contribution from the experience gained over the five decades in developing the city state.
"We are, therefore, actively considering how best to work with the central government on its 'Smart Cities' initiative, and also with states like the new Andhra Pradesh on its Capital City project.
"This engagement will also enable Singapore businesses to participate in downstream needs and opportunities in areas such as township development, industrial and IT parks, as well as utilities such as water and power," he said.
The minister also saw India's important role in Asia Pacific.
"Looking beyond the bilateral relationship, Singapore has always championed and supported India's integration into the broader region," he said.
Iswaran sees India connected to 16 countries through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is under negotiations involving 10 countries in South East Asia as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
"Given the scale and composition of the RCEP market, it is of particular significance to India, as it is one of the largest exporters of services, and its aim is to boost its share of merchandise exports through manufacturing," he said.
"A high-quality RCEP will therefore be of significant value to India's manufacturing ambition, and I look forward to India's active involvement in this important regional integration effort," he added.
The symposium was attended by the Core Group from the Confederation of Indian Industries led by the President Ajay S Shriram .

DLF Gets Some Relief From Supreme Court; Stock Rises
NDTV | Updated On: November 28, 2014 16:43 (IST)
SpiceJet Allowed to Take Bookings Till March 31 by Regulator
The Supreme Court on Friday gave some relief to DLF, by allowing it to pay the Rs 630-crore fine slapped by the Competition Commission of India on the real-estate major in instalments.
DLF has been permitted by the top court to pay Rs 75 crore every month from January towards the competition regulator fine for allegedly resorting to unfair business practices and violating trade norms. DLF has already paid Rs 150 crore and the remaining Rs 480 crore will now be paid in instalments.
The stock rose nearly 5 per cent after the news, to an intra-day high of Rs 155, before correcting itself and slightly underperforming the broader BSE Realty index. The DLF scrip ended 0.81 per cent up at Rs 149.35 on the BSE.
DLF had moved the Supreme Court last week expressing difficulty in meeting the November 26 deadline to pay the Rs 630-crore fine.
DLF had earlier told the top court that it was in serious financial difficulty, which was aggravated by market regulator SEBI's (Securities and Exchange Board of India) decision to ban the company and six of its senior officials from accessing the capital markets for three years for an alleged non-disclosure in the 2007 IPO (initial public offer) filing.

GDP Data May Show Weakening Growth in Q2: 10 FactsThe government will release the economic growth data for the July to September quarter on Friday. Economists say India's growth likely slowed down between July and September, which will be a setback for the government.
Here are 10 things to know about the important data point:
1) India's GDP likely grew at 5.1 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter (Reuters poll), sharply lower than 5.7 per cent in the June quarter, which was also the fastest pace of economic growth in 10 quarters.
2) A sharp slowdown in industrial growth likely impacted GDP growth during the September quarter, analysts say. Factory output averaged just 1.1 per cent between July to September as compared to the 4.6 per cent between April and June.
3) Slower government spending, exports and agricultural output may have weighed on growth. "These were the three reasons why the numbers overshot our expectations for the first quarter. And none of the three are expected to be supportive significantly for the next quarter," said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at ING Vysya Bank.
4) Lack of reforms in the construction and manufacturing sectors hit capital investment in the country, analysts say. Reforms related to land acquisition, labour, coal and power sector are expected to be taken up in the current session of Parliament.
5) Capital-heavy sectors have overcapacity and there is no urgent need to invest in new plant or machinery, analysts say. Capacity utilisation fell to about 70 per cent in the June quarter from nearly 85 per cent three years earlier.
6) In September, credit growth hit a 13-year low, an indication of low demand and overcapacity in the economy.
7) If the data confirms a slowdown, it will be a big setback for the new government, which took credit for higher growth in the first quarter.
8) Citing weak growth, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is likely to ask the Reserve Bank of India for a rate cut as soon as next week.
9) A nearly unanimous majority, however, expect Governor Raghuram Rajan to keep the repo rate unchanged at 8 per cent next week. The RBI has maintained that sustained government progress is needed to revive "the animal spirits" in corporate investment.
10) The slowdown in economic growth is unlikely to impact stock markets, which are trading at record highs. Analysts say GDP data is a lag indicator of the economy and markets have already factored in a 5 per cent growth in the September quarter.

Govt to take small expense cut to meet deficit target: ICRA
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Aditi Nayar, Economist, ICRA, said the fiscal deficit numbers for April to October period is only slightly higher on a year-on-year basis and there is nothing to get worried about it.
Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
The market is now awaiting the second quarter GDP data, expected Friday evening. A CNBC-TV18 poll shows that experts expect the pace of growth to slide from 5.7 percent to 5 percent .
According to government sources, the fiscal deficit in the April-October period stands at Rs 4.75 lakh crore, which is 90 percent of the FY15 target.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Aditi Nayar, Economist, ICRA , said the fiscal deficit numbers for April to October period is only slightly higher on a year-on-year basis and there is nothing to get worried about it.
However, she feels that going ahead the revenue buoyancy may get hinged on how much funds are garnered through either the telecom spectrum auctions or disinvestment, which is yet to take off.
“We are not very clear whether the targets will be met or exceeded. Thus, in that sense, we need to watch out for these things going ahead,” Nayar said.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitely has indicated towards a cut in expenses. Nayar feels that the government may take some small expenditure cuts to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP.
“I don’t expect the size of it (expenditure cut) to be alarming because we have already got some beneficial tailwinds coming through the 10 percent cut in non-planned expenditure,” she said adding that it would be important to see where the expenditure cuts happen.

Govt successful at WTO without compromise: SitharamanCommerce Minister says govt successful at WTO without compromising on stockpiling issue
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 15:04 IST
Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
The country has won a major victory at Geneva with the World Trade Organization (WTO) accommodating its food security demands in a historic worldwide trade reform deal, which the government said was clinched without any conditions or concessions.
Making a suo moto statement on Friday in Lok Sabha on the trade agreement clinched at the WTO meeting at Geneva on Thursday night, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said besides accepting its concerns on public stockholding, the deal by the WTO allows the country to continue with its policy to provide minimum support price to farmers.
"We have accomplished this without any concessions, compromise or new conditions," the commerce minister said, adding that the deal vindicated the principal stand the government had taken on food security.
The agreement, Sitharaman said, provides for continuing the "minimum support price policy which is a lifeline for millions of our low income resource poor farmer. It is also critical for food security in India and in countries which have similar policies".
As per the agreement reached on Thursday, the WTO nations have committed to ease customs norms to facilitate trade and also agreed to extend the 'peace clause' till a permanent solution is found regarding its foodgrain stock piling.
This is the first major trade pact reached by WTO ever since it came into existence in 1995.
Stating that the Centre stood firm on its food security concerns, she said it was able resolve differences with the US earlier in November and persuade it to accept the government's stand.
This paved way for the WTO deal, which had been in limbo for nearly two decades.

8 cr people opened bank accounts under Jan D...Arun Jaitley
(The Finance Minister said…)
NEW DELHI: Nearly eight crore people have opened bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and government is hopeful that ten crore people will be covered under the scheme by January 26 next year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told Lok Sabha today.
Jaitley said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the launching of PMJDY on August 15, 2014 and a target to cover 7.5 crore household by January 26, 2015 has been set.
"Government's target is to cover 7.5 crore household by January 26 and that means our target is to ensure opening of account by 10 crore people. About a day or two ago, 7.98 crore people have opened their accounts and we hope that by January 26, ten crore people will be able to open the account," he said during Question Hour.
The Finance Minister said government's target was not villages only but cover every household of every village under the PMJDY .
"Besides, we are trying to open ATM if not a branch in every area and also want to cover every village through business correspondent. Through this way, we want to expand the banking network in the country," he said.
Jaitley said government will ensure that no one takes wrong advantage of the scheme which is targeted at the weaker sections of the society.
The Finance Minister said the beneficiaries would get a RuPay Debit card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs one lakh. In addition, there is life insurance cover of Rs 30,000 to those people who open their accounts for the first time and meet other eligibility conditions of the scheme.
"The card holder would also get overdraft facility of Rs 5,000 depending on the repaying capacity of the customer. These are incentives and we have reached the target due to the incentives," he said.
Jaitley said life and accident cover is for everyone and that is the right of the customer. In case of other benefits, like loan, banks have been asked to take a liberal approach.
PMJDY envisages universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension.
In case of migrant labourers and others, the simplified KYC norms of RBI require only one proof of address (either current or permanent) while opening a bank account or while undergoing periodic updation.
"Banks have been directed to preferably use Aadhar enabled e-KYC facility in order to open the accounts of all beneficiaries including migrant workers and illiterate persons who have Aadhar numbers," Jaitley said.

Sensex makes history; experts see it at 33 000 in a year | Top betsIndian stock market makes history! Experts see Sensex rallying to 33000 in 12 months

BSE
NEW DELHI: India's market capitalization, as represented by the listed companies on the BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange), reached the Rs 100-lakh crore mark intraday on Friday.
Riding on the Modi wave and easy global liquidity, benchmark indices managed to outpace most of its emerging market peers and indices across the globe so far in the year 2014.
The benchmark index has rallied over 36 per cent in the same period and is on its way to hit its next crucial psychological level of 29000.
The total market cap of all BSE-listed companies had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003, while it has doubled from about Rs 50 lakh crore five years ago in 2009, PTI quoted.
On this landmark moment, Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD & CEO, BSE, said, "India and BSE have reached a significant milestone today. It is a reflection on the potential of India as a new age powerhouse."
"It has taken India and the BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs 100-lakh crore market capitalisation. However, given India's potential, India should be able to achieve multiple times Rs 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in time to come," he said in a note.
For the year, the BSE Sensex has rallied over 7600 points to touch the record levels of over 28000 and the rally may well stretch till 33000 in the next six-twelve months, say analysts. Tracking the momentum, they see the 50-share Nifty index hovering around 10-11k in the same period.
"After experiencing a great rally so far this year, the Indian markets still have plenty of room for a substantial move from the current levels," says Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.
"While talking about the next target for the Indian equity markets in the next 6-12 months, we are expecting the Nifty to test the level of 9800-10000 and for Sensex we are expecting the level of 32600-33000," he adds.
Most analysts at top brokerage firms expect that the economic uptick in India would propel business prospects, which means a meaningful turnaround in financials and cyclicals and a possible rerating of market multiples.
 
Chris Wood, managing director and equity strategist of CLSA, is of the view that the Sensex (the world's best-performing index so far in 2014) will touch 40,000 in a matter of time if the investment cycle turns. He also said he would increase his weightage on India if the market dips from the current levels.
Experts say that no bull market is complete without corrections and the dip can happen in our market as well. But, "as long as we are make high highs and higher lows, those dips should be used to enter the markets as the broader trend remains intact," he said.
"We are in a bull market and the market can have intermittent corrections, but one should hold on to stocks with at least three-year perspective and the bull market can take you to a level which is exuberance and optimism more than what it is justified," says Nirmal Jain, Chairman, IIFL Group.
"If you ask analysts, they will say that valuations are in the 17-18 range or between 18 and 20, which is not extraordinary for India's growth. So from these levels also, once you hold on, not worry about minor corrections that are bound to happen and at the same time, not get carried away by rallies which are sudden and surprising like today's," he adds.
One important factor which is fuelling this confidence among the investor community across the globe is the fact that the macro situation in India is much better than most of the emerging market peers -- stable currency, expectations of pro-growth reforms by the Modi government and revival of investment cycle.
"The Asia Pacific and GEM investors already know the India story well and are currently about 40-50 per cent 'overweight' on India. However, we met several investors with international mandates looking at India afresh - looking into the long-term structural nature of the story," CLSA said in a note.
"Global / international fund managers have taken a while to appreciate the India story evident in YTD portfolio inflows of US$16bn - lower than US$18bn average over the last three years - in a year that has been a watershed year for Indian politics," added the report.
Considering the overall situation of falling crude prices and control over domestic inflation, analysts predict a strong growth in the earnings in the coming quarters, which will give further boost to markets. So the rally is here to stay!
"We are asking investors to put in more money because the good news is just beginning in the sense that for the first half we have some improvement in the economic activity and growth. But if things were to move the way they are, if the economy picks up to 6.5%-7%, corporate earnings can grow at about 17 to 18% for next two to three years," says Dhirendra Tiwari, Head of Research, Antique Stock Broking.
"The Indian market still is very reasonably priced. I would say, between 16 and 17 times, depending on the earnings estimates which are somewhere in between the peak and the bottom. So if you look at the market per se, there is some meaningful upside left in the next 12 to 15 months. There of course would be volatility in between," he adds.

(The Bank Nifty has surged…)
MUMBAI: Shares of public sector banks , which were top gainers in early trade, extended intraday rally after the finance ministry announced plans to sell stake in them.
Jayant Sinha, Minister of state, Finance Ministry said the government is considering cutting stake in PSU banks to 52 per cent. If implement, the government will be able to raise Rs 89,120 crore through stake sale.
The Bank Nifty has surged to new highs as fall in bond yields raised hopes of rate cuts and government's comments of stake sale.
The 10-year bond yield eased from 8.11 per cent in the morning to 8.07 per cent.
According to analysts, large as well as some of the midcap PSU banks will be in the limelight for next 12 to 15-month timeframe.
"PSU banks broadly are still cheap if you look at the valuations. The catalysts were awaited. The key catalyst is the reduction in interest rates, which is more likely now than in the past. So that is one aspect," said Dhirendra Tiwari, Head of Research, Antique Stock Broking.
"The other aspect, which is very important to notice, is the credit recovery. With the economic activity picking up a little bit, one can expect the demand for credit also to go up to, may be industry wide, 18 to 20 per cent. These two factors are very-very important for re-rating of the PSU banks," he added.
At 12:45 p.m.; the PSU Bank Nifty was up 5.20 per cent to 4,255.75. It hit a high of 4,279 in trade till now.
Syndicate Bank (up 6.88 per cent), Bank of Baroda (up 6.78 per cent), Punjab National Bank (up 6.28 per cent), Canara Bank (up 6.09 per cent), Bank of India (up 5.31 per cent) and SBI (up 4.71 per cent) were the top PSU Bank Nifty gainers.

Petrol and diesel prices may fallPetrol and diesel prices may fall after crude hits low
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014

Petrol and diesel are likely to turn cheaper in India as global oil prices slumped to four-year lows of around $70 a barrel on Thursday after OPEC — a  group of major oil supplying countries — decided against cutting back production.

India imports nearly two-thirds of its crude oil requirement. The sharp fall in global crude prices will cut companies’ import bills,  enabling them to reduce retail prices of petrol and diesel.
Domestic oil industry sources said petrol prices could fall below Rs. 60 a litre in the coming weeks, if the slide in global crude prices continues to follow the current pattern.
Lower fuel costs will aid the government’s efforts to keep inflation low and stable.
India’s retail inflation fell to a three-year low of 5.52% in October while the wholesale inflation rate plunged to a five-year low of 1.77%, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.
Lower inflation, in turn, could prompt the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates and nudge banks to lower home loan EMIs.
“If the slide in oil prices continues, we can expect petrol prices to drop below Rs. 60 a litre from around Rs. 65 presently (in Delhi),” said the chairman of a leading oil company seeking anonymity.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel of 12 oil producing nations that controls 40% of the world’s oil output, in a five-hour meeting in Vienna decided not to reduce production, despite a 30% fall in oil prices since June.
Since August, petrol has turned cheaper by Rs. 9.36 a litre in six price cuts, while diesel prices have been cut by Rs. 5.62 a litre since October.
Petrol now cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 71.91 in Mumbai. Diesel, India’s most consumed fuel, costs Rs. 53.35 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 61.04 in Mumbai. Prices vary between states due to local levies.
Softer crude prices will also bolster the government’s plans to tame inflation and curtail fuel subsidies. A lower subsidy bill will help contain fiscal deficit — a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Being the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, India imports around 190 million tonnes of crude oil a year at $145 billion, or more than a third of its total import bill. With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore.

Kalyan youth Areeb Majeed escapes from ISIS  returns to Mumbai from TurkeyIS recruit from Kalyan arrested after return to Mumbai

Six months after he left his suburban Mumbai home to join Islamic State militants, 22-year-old Areeb Majeed returned from West Asia on Friday and was being questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), officials said.
Hindustan Times was the first to report that Areeb, earlier thought to have been killed in an air strike, was alive and had called his father, Dr Ijaz Majeed, seeking help to return from Turkey.
Facebook page that appears to have been set up by Areeb Majeed.
“I am yet to meet him or contact him. I will first offer Friday prayers and then plan how to meet my son,” Dr Majeed said.
Sources say Areeb landed at Mumbai international airport at 5:15am and was immediately taken into custody by NIA officials.
Areeb and three other young men – Fahad Shaikh, Saheem Tanki and Amaan Tandel —from Kalyan in Maharashtra’s Thane district went to Iraq in May to join the jihadi group, investigators said. How Areeb managed to escape and go to Turkey is still unknown.
According to police, the four engineering students – radicalised over the internet – flew to Baghdad as part of a group of 22 pilgrims visiting religious shrines in Iraq. But intelligence agencies later intercepted phone calls where the men were crying and asking their families to seek the government’s help for their return.
On August 26, Saheem called up Dr Majeed and told him that his son had become a “martyr”, and Pakistan-based terrorist group Anwar-ul-Tawhid declared Areeb’s martyrdom on its now-defunct website.
Maharashtra’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which earlier questioned the youngsters’ relatives, is also in touch with the NIA over Areeb’s return, sources said.
Intelligence and security officials have warned that the Islamic State is trying to indoctrinate and recruit young volunteers online from India – home to the world’s second-largest Muslim population.
However, national security adviser Ajit Doval said at this month's HT Leadership Summit that no more than 10 Indian Muslims had gone to join IS militants in Iraq and Syria.

Piecing together the events that led to the attack, sources in the security establishment said all the four terrorists had entered India from across the Indo-Pak border during the intervening night of November 26 and 27 and were hiding behind a culvert when they were spotted by Territorial Army personnel.
A fierce gunbattle then ensued and the terrorists who were in combat fatigues later entered two abandoned bunkers and remained holed up before three of them were neutralised.
Security officials suspected that the militants wanted to carry out a sensational strike in the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir to coincide with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held a poll rally in Udhampur on Friday. The venue of the rally was about 100 km from Arnia.
On November 26, Pakistani rangers had fired on some posts in Arnia sector and by the time the troops could retaliate, the four militants are believed to have infiltrated into the state, official sources said. BSF, which guards the International Border(IB), maintains there was no sign of infiltration.
The five civilians who died also included two people who had tried to flee from the car, in which they were travelling, when it got caught in the cross-fire between militants and security personnel.

BJP event at AMU may spark communal unrest  warns V-CFresh trouble brews in AMU over BJP event

Aligarh Muslim University vice chancellor on Friday wrote to Human resource development (HRD) minister Smriti Irani, warning of "communal conflagration" if the BJP goes ahead with plans to mark the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap in the varsity premises.
Without naming the BJP in his letter, vice chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah said if "certain elements" go ahead with their plans to hold a demonstration at AMU on December 1, "it could lead to massive student unrest at the campus".
The debate started after some BJP leaders decided to hold a demonstration on the campus on the birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap, an alumnus of AMU, whose family was closely associated with Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of the institution.
"Some elements are threatening to hold a demonstration on the grounds that Raja Mahendra Pratap donated large tracts of land for establishment of AMU and should be honoured accordingly," the vice chancellor's letter said.
"We have always acknowledged that the Raja did lease 3.04 acres of land to AMU in 1929 at a rate of Rs. 2/- per annum. We are proud of this freedom fighter. However, there were a large number of other donors and the main campus of the AMU was built on a land procured from the British government originally belonging to the Aligarh cantonment," he said.
Some local and state BJP leaders had recently claimed that AMU was built on land donated by Raja Mahendra Pratap but AMU authorities "failed to acknowledge his contribution".
The vice chancellor said that in order to defuse the situation, they had agreed to hold a joint celebration on Raja's birth anniversary
"On November 25, at the instance of some ex-servicemen of this district, who offered to mediate, I held a meeting with representatives of some outfits who are threatening to hold the demonstration.The idea was to defuse the situation and we agreed to hold a joint celebration of the Raja's anniversary".
However, the decision to observe the anniversary has now been revoked due to reports that there are internal differences within the group which was holding the protest, he said.

No proof Indians abducted by IS in Iraq are dead: Sushma'Govt believes Indians abducted by IS are alive'

Braving attack from the Opposition, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament on Friday that government believed the 39 Indians held hostage by ISIS in Iraq were still alive.
Distancing from a report that these Indians held in captivity in Mosul, may have been killed, the minister made similar statements in both the Houses, asserting that there was no proof to confirm the report.
“On the one hand there is one source about which there is no confirmation. Six different sources have informed the government that they have not been killed” she said after Congress deputy in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, raised the matter and his party colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia took the matter up in Lok Sabha.
“Our prayers and hopes are alive. Our search for their safe release is on....It is my duty and responsibility to keep the hope of tracing them alive and bring them home safely," Swaraj said.
Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, Scindia accused Swaraj of "misleading" the House and said that the government had failed to protect the workers. “If the reports about their being killed long back are correct, then the government has misled the people and Parliament," he said.
"The government is responsible. Earlier, the House was told that the release of the 40 workers would come as an Eid gift,” Scindia added.
“If this was known, then why this was not told in the House and why assurances were given to the families of those abducted,” Sharma asked in the Rajya Sabha.
NDA ally SAD also wanted clarity on the issue. BSP chief Mayawati, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, TMC member Derek O'Obrien, SP member Jaya Bachchan also expressed concern over the report in the RS. Parties including CPI(M) and Aam Aadmi Party supported Scindia in the Lok Sabha.

Police were called to Tesco at Silverburn in the Pollok area of Glasgow about 11:45 GMT on Thursday after staff reported scuffles among several customers .
The store was closed for a period, and footage from the scene shows shoppers shoving each other as they attempt to grab items from trolleys.
Police were also called to the Tesco in Kingsway, Dundee, to help with crowd control.
The footage shows people leaping over barriers and struggling to get hold of cut-price coffee machines and televisions
Avon and Somerset Police said they were called after scuffles in the queue at Tesco in Brislington, Bristol, at about midnight.
The BBC's Zoe Conway tweeted a picture of a woman on her knees with the words: "Customers knocked to the ground in the rush at Asda Wembley #BlackFriday."

Police were called to Tesco in Stretford, where a woman was injured by a falling television
Jamie Hook was buying food at Tesco in Stretford on Thursday night when he said "the screaming started".
"I looked at the massive crowd to see people climbing over shelves and displays, staff running for cover, fights breaking out, stock flying through air, people breaking through carrying televisions - and this was before the sale had even started," he said.
"The lady on the till I was at was in tears, terrified of it all, but she was under orders to close her till to go and help crowd control."
Ross Lewis was at one of the stores participating in Black Friday in Cardiff. He said people fought to get hold of television sets.
"People were biting each other, pinching, punching, kicking - it was just absolutely horrendous, it was so, so bad."
Asda in Wembley was one of many UK supermarkets where Black Friday deals led to chaotic scenes
Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, expressed his frustration via his Twitter account about the amount of Black Friday-related work being asked of his officers.
In a statement, he also said he was "disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty".
"Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations - much of which is preventable," he said.
"We just ask these stores to work with us to reduce the demands on policing and reduce the risks of disorder and crime."
A Tesco spokesman said: "Over 600 Tesco stores have Black Friday offers available in store.
"In the interest of customer safety a small number of these stores contacted police last night to help control crowds safely and stores are now trading normally."
Black Friday - historically the big sales day in America that follows the Thanksgiving holiday - has been adopted by an increasing number of shops in the UK.
The websites of several retailers, including Tesco, Argos and John Lewis, crashed earlier due to the number of shoppers trying to access them.
Despite its website problems, John Lewis said it was forecasting record online sales by the end of Friday. It said Apple's iPad mini and a discounted food processor were its fastest-selling products in early sales.
Currys said it experienced "astonishing" online demand overnight, with a "pre-planned queuing system" operating.
Many retailers have been advertising Black Friday deals, with Tesco offering discounts of up to 70%.

Ahluwalia Contracts eyes 20-25% growth in FY16 FY17Kota is our sole build-operate-transfer (BOT) project. In the next two months time, we hope to launch it.
Shobhit Uppal
Deputy MD
Ahluwalia Contracts
Shobhit Uppal, Deputy Managing Director,  Ahluwalia Contracts from sidelines of Religare Capital Markets midcap conference spoke to CNBC-TV18 on the outlook for the company going forward.
He is confident of the company meeting its topline target of Rs 1100 crore for FY15 and growing at 20-25% for FY16-FY17 backed by new orders from the public sector covered with escalation clause. The company has already completed 90% of the old low margins orders, said Uppal.
The net order book for the company stands at Rs 3500 crore dividedly equally between public and private. And orders from the private sector are likely to pick up over the next 6-12 months, he added.
On the execution front, he said the pace of execution on the public side has picked up but is still slow on the private sector side because of liquidity issues.  
The company sees re-development and smart cities as future growth drivers.
Below is the transcript of Shobhit Uppal's interview with Reema Tendulkar and Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18.
Ekta: Can you give us a sense in terms of what your order books stand at at this point in time and has execution of the order book picked up and your outlook for the second half?
A: Our net order book stands at Rs 3,500 crore and the break up is 50:50. 50 percent is private and 50 percent is public sector. The execution has picked up on the public side. We are seeing more orders coming in and also the pace of execution has also picked up in the last six months.
As far as the private sector is concerned, it continues to be hit by liquidity issues and the execution is slow. As far as the next half of this financial year is concerned, we are on target to meet our plans to have our topline of about Rs 1,100 crore and the first six months we have closed at a profit of about Rs 34 crore and we hope to maintain this in the next six months.
Reema: This Rs 1,100 crore target is for FY15 or FY16 on your revenues?
A: Yes, it is FY15. Over the next two years that is FY15 and FY16, we plan to grow at the same pace which is about 20-25 percent.
Reema: Can you tell us what the margins on the new orders are, at what range?
A: These are double digit margins at about 12-13 percent.
Ekta: I wanted to touch upon the margin bit a little more, we do understand that your operational performance saw strong turnaround in Q2 where it came in at around 11-12 percent versus a negative margin in the same quarter last year and EBITDA loss, we do understand that it might have been pushed up by legacy order so it could have been a one-time, could you just give us a sense on what the margin picture looks like in the coming quarters and whether the previous quarter was in fact an aberration?
A: No, in fact if you see both the last two quarters, we have maintained a net profit of about 7 percent and as I said earlier we aim to maintain this. This is largely due to the fact that the new orders that we won in the public sector - they are all coming in with the escalation clauses where we are not hit with the market volatility and as I said earlier, the margins are better. The old legacy contracts - 90 percent of those contracts we have finished. So they are less of a burden and 10 percent which is left that also we will finish in the next six months.
Reema: What is the difference in margins between your public as well as private orders; can you quantify that on an average?
A: As things stand today, there is very little new work in the private sector primarily on account of the liquidity issues, the margins in the government sector are better at 12-13 percent but once the private sector picks up, which I feel will pick up in another six months to one year then the margins will be similar in the private sector also.
Ekta: Can you give us a sense in terms of what the redevelopment orders in the NCR region looks like for you? Is that a big opportunity?
A: It is an opportunity which is still developing. There has been a large tender or a series of tenders, which were floated by NBCC which is a redevelopment of Kidwai Nagar. We were one of the bidders, though not successful bidders but what we are seeing with such government project management companies like NBCC, that there are more such orders on the way not only at the centre but also in states. So yes, going forward, this along with smart cities will be potential order book consolidation for us.
Ekta: A rough size?
A: It is very difficult to comment on the size as of now but just to clarify further, as I said the government activity has picked up and picking up orders in the future, I don’t think is a problem. We are in a state to pick and choose now.
Reema: If you do an Rs 1,100 crore revenue in FY15 that turns out to be about 15 percent growth for the full year if you look at it on a year-on-year basis is that the kind of growth, 15 percent growth that you expect even in FY16 or do you think given the pick up growth could be higher maybe 20-25 percent for FY16 revenues?
A: We are targeting a 20-25 percent growth in FY16 and FY17. It can be as I said -- orders are not a constraint, it can be higher but we are deliberately keeping our targets conservative as of now.
Ekta: Can you give us some update on your Kota project?
A: Kota is our sole build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, which is ready for launch. The building is completed and about 40-45 percent of it is leased out so in the next two months time, we hope to launch it.
Reema: Any fund raising that the company requires, what does the balance sheet currently stand at or any debt that you are looking to raise?
A: Not at the moment because as I said earlier, our growth targets are conservative and we aim to use a lot of surplus infrastructure that we already have.

Implications of a stronger dollar: CARE Ratings
CARE Ratings has come out with its analysis of the trend of a strengthening dollar and its implications.
Post your opinion here
 
Analysis of the trend of a strengthening dollar and its implications by CARE Ratings
The strengthening of the USD in recent times has caused some element of volatility in the currency markets. From $ 1.37 per euro in December when the first tranche of tapering began to $ 1.36 in January, the dollar fell to a low of $ 1.38 in April, after which it has been strengthening quite rapidly, with acceleration in September, October and November, where it has come below the mark of $ 1.30/euro. The average level of $ 1.25 for November compares well with the levels attained prior to the financial crisis.
Impact on other currencies
While the movement of the currency for any country is dependent on the various factors that affect the balance of payments, there is prima facie reason to believe that some part of the movement can be explained by the stronger dollar. It should be mentioned here that domestic factors have also influenced such movements like the Russian ruble being affected by the Ukraine imbroglio. The table below gives the rate of change of the currency with respect to the dollar over April ‘14, after when the dollar started strengthening.
Lower cost of oil among other import items-
Given that other components of the external account like import of oil has benefited partly due to the strong dollar (The price of oil gets calibrated to the dollar and when the dollar falls, the price of oil increases and vice-versa) there would be some countervailing force to stabilize the rupee.
The implication is that while the RBI has brought about order in the balance of payments and several components like imports, ECB flows, and FII funds, it would also have to constantly monitor changes in the external account on account of such changes in the currency value.
Given that this strengthening of the dollar is synchronous with the US recovery and likely increase in interest rates, it does need to be watched carefully.

My Request to Local Businesses: Keep Complainingreddit
As CEO of a digital marketing company, I know all too well that local businesses are NOT happy with the online marketing industry as a whole. I've heard the complaints: "online marketing companies lack transparency," "they overpromise," "they're expensive and don't deliver ROI." My response to local businesses?  Keep complaining! (Please).
The online marketing industry realizes it has to make changes and its members are working hard to address the criticisms from our customers in the local business community. But I want to hear more complaints, because if local businesses continue to be vocal about their issues, we can respond more quickly and effectively. So, as we work to effect change, I'm asking local businesses to hold us accountable to these expectations:
Clarity and Comprehension
The men and women that make up local business communities everywhere are electricians, dentists, lawyers, realtors, etc. whose expertise is rooted in their individual sectors, not in marketing. It's time-consuming and difficult running a business 24x7, and though local business men and women may be interested in teaching themselves about online marketing, they usually don't have the time to do so.
Local businesses should expect clarity from online marketing providers. They should count on vendors to provide a detailed explanation of online marketing offerings and how those solutions can work to drive sales. Vendors should describe their services in plain language, not technical jargon. Most local businesses don't know why it's important to "optimize website metadata." Vendors should explain what that really means and why a business needs it. Online marketing companies should also differentiate their offerings. A quick web search will turn up dozens of digital marketing companies with "all-in-one" solutions. I can tell you first hand, we don't all offer the very same thing.
Goal-Based Campaigns
Businesses should expect vendors to sit down with them, learn about their objectives and needs, and set campaign goals based on those needs. Online marketing is an ongoing investment, but businesses don't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars annually for a campaign that will grow leads and sales. Vendors should explain how campaigns can vary based on objectives, location, type of business and media mix. In some instances, digital marketing requires businesses to spend a minimum amount on services -- such as SEO, display or lead management -- in order to achieve any measurable results. Local businesses should expect vendors to explain when and why a particular methodology (such as search) is a poor choice given the business' budget limitations. If an online marketing provider can't offer alternative solutions to meet the desired result, he or she should provide the local business with referrals to a provider that can.
Transparency and Measurement
Today's online marketing providers have tools that can provide rich data, and businesses should expect that information to be used at the outset of a campaign to establish baselines for performance, and then be revisited for comparisons and recommendations. Local businesses spend their hard-earned profits on marketing to gain customers and increase revenue. Businesses should expect online marketing vendors to offer real-time reports that provide complete transparency into how their investments are performing. These reports should give insights into campaign results, the types of leads campaigns are generating and whether or not the leads convert into customers. (Some vendors are now able to also provide the source of those leads -- calls, emails, forms, chats--as well as cost per lead.)
An Industry Effort
The online marketing industry knows it needs to focus more on what local businesses truly value: offerings that are more easily understood, more transparent and more measurable. As vendors work to address these issues they'll continue to look for feedback from local businesses around what's working and what isn't. And in the meantime, I encourage local businesses to keep complaining!

Badaun girls committed suicide  werent murdered: CBIPrint
NEW DELHI: Images of two girls found hanging from a tree earlier this year in Badaun, a village in Uttar Pradesh, ignited worldwide outrage over crimes against women in India and kick-started a prolonged investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
But after five months of probing, the CBI concluded that the deaths were a case of suicide and not of gang-rape and murder as previously thought.
 
The CBI was quoted by international news agency AFP saying: 'Based on 40 scientific reports, CBI has concluded that the two minor girls had not been raped and murdered as had been alleged in the (initial police report).'
 
The girls' families have alleged that they were raped and lynched by men from a higher caste after going into the fields at night to relieve themselves because their homes did not have toilets, highlighting the sore lack of toilets in millions of homes across India.
 
CBI director Ranjit Sinha's told the Hindustan Times: 'Yes, we have cracked the Badaun case. Our probe found that the two girls had committed suicide and weren’t murdered. The local police had erroneously conducted their probe along the lines that the sisters were killed.'
 
The CBI also said that the girls committed suicide because their families did not approve to their friendship with a villager.
 
On May 27, two young Dalit girls were found hanging from a mango tree.
 
The girls had gone to relieve themselves in nearby fields on the night of the incident. When they didn't return, the families alerted the police but they refused to follow up.
 
Former chief minister Mayawati slammed the CBI report alleging that the investigation was done in a hurry. She further said that a thorough probe will be conducted and guilty will be punished after BSP will be voted to power.
 
Meanwhile, Delhi Commission for Women chief Barkha Shukla said that the CBI should revisit the report, and the culprits must be punished.
 
"Earlier when this incident had taken place then the CBI had only submitted the report that the girls have been raped and hanged to the tree after being murdered. It's a very sensitive case and what happened to those two girls, I think CBI should investigate the case again, as many times it happens that they might have missed some point," said Shukla.

ThyssenKrupp develops rope free elevator system `Multi’
G Naga Sridhar
Tweet
Essen (Germany), Nov 28:  
ThyssenKrupp Elevator AG has come up with a rope-free multi cabin elevator system which can cut short, long waits for elevators in high rise buildings.
And, you can use an elevator not only for vertical travel but also for horizontal movement.
Presenting the new technology to international media here on Thursday, it's Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman Andreas Schierenbeck said the new system, christened as MULTI, was based on linear motor technology.
This will allow several cabins in the same shaft to move vertically and horizontally.
In simpler terms, the design is similar to metro rail as it could incorporate several self-propelled elevator cabins per shaft running in a loop.
There can be continuous passenger transportation in multiple cabins reducing the waiting time, the CEO said.
A recent project done by the students of Columbia university found that office workers in New York City spent a cumulative time of 16.6 years waiting for elevators and 5.9 years inside them!
The Multi would increase the shaft transport capacity by up to 50 per cent.
Its technology was based on the concept of Twin elevator system launched in 2003 by ThyssenKrupp but includes new features such as light-weight materials and a linear drive.
From the architecture point of view, unconventional shapes and designs are possible as an elevator cabin can take-off vertically but can switch over to horizontal motion if needed.
According to Patrick Bass, Head of R&D, ThyssenKrupp Elevator, the Multi elevators can increase usable area in a building up to 25 per cent.
This also translates into 'significant' savings in construction costs as well as likely spurt in rent revenues from increased usable space.
Multi has the same energy efficiency of conventional elevator systems and power peak loads can be reduced by up to 60 per cent, Bass claimed.
The ideal building height for Multi elevator installation starts at 300 metres. "But the system is not constrained by a building's height," he added.
ThyssenKrupp is building a new test tower for proper certification environment and to launch the product in the market. This would be completed in 2016.
When asked on target markets, Schierenbeck told Business Line: "It could be India, China and entire world." The size of global elevator market was estimated at 46 billion Euros in 2013 with an annual growth of over 5 per cent. It is expected to grow further with the equivalent of a one million people city is being built every day.

SFIO  ED begin probe on ICAI membersSaradha: SFIO, ED seek probe on ICAI members

Kolkata, Nov 28:  
The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have approached the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) for looking into the professional misconduct of its members, engaged in financial accounting and auditing in various Saradha group outfits.
The institute president, K Raghu, confirmed to reporters here on Friday that ICAI was in touch with the investigators on the issue.
"We need to have detailed information before the start of proceedings against our members. The investigating agencies are yet to furnish details regarding the outfits and their alleged transactions involving money collection and laundering.''
According to sources, the investigating agencies had a recent interaction with the institute on Saradha chit fund issue.
Apart from misconduct, related quasi judicial actions such as cancellation of membership or a penalty of maximum of Rs 5 lakh, ICAI also helps investigators in forensic audit to unearth and pinpoint financial frauds and irregularities.
The institute maintains a panel of forensic accounting and audit experts. In the case of Satyam probe, the institute had suggested the name of such experts to the investigators.
Ragu, however, said investigators had not asked for such help as yet in the Saradha case.
The central investigation agencies along with Securities Exchange Board India (SEBI) are now probing around six of several hundred unauthorised money collection outfits in the eastern part of the country involving funds still to quantified fully. Investigation on Saradha, Rose Valley and ICore groups have proceeded to some extent so far.

Chennai, Nov 28:  
The North-East monsoon has destroyed crops in over 53,000 acres, 4,765 km of roads and led to the loss of 30 lives, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said here today.

As for Chennai, 3,070 spots in 797 roads were found affected, of which 2,025 had already been repaired, he said.
A total of 30 persons have died in rain-related incidents and relief has already been provided to them, he said, adding compensation for loss of cattle, partial and complete damage to houses was also being given.
He also said Ministers have been visiting affected areas and giving relief to the victims.

The Indian foundry industry has failed to reach great heights due to poor adoption of technology, Vikas Garg, President, Institute of Indian Foundrymen, and Managing Director, Forace Polymer, said.
Urging industry promoters to focus on upgrading the technology for future growth, he said: "3D (three dimensional) printing is going to be the future of manufacturing; when we move towards this, we will be able to make the product without a mould or casting. The Indian foundry sector lags behind in adoption of technology."
Garg was speaking at the inaugural session of the National Foundry Conclave.
This seventh edition of the conclave was organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Institute of Indian Foundrymen at Le Meridien in Coimbatore.
Talent retention
Besides technology, the sector also lags in retention of good talent, he said, and urged the participants to consider ESOP (Employee Stock Option) as this would ensure their commitment.
The sector will need to grow three times in the next 10 years to meet the demand of the manufacturing industry, he said, and stressed the importance of promoting indigenous technologies and collaborating with institutions like CSIR and IISc.
He further emphasised the need to look at consolidation to attract PE funds.
Skilled manpower
Delivering the special address, the Past Chairman of CII Southern Region, C R Swaminathan, said that the industry should look at creating skilled manpower for future growth. Creation of facilities for training and skill development would ensure supply of floor level workers, and grooming of supervisory and lower middle-level employees is equally important, he added.
The theme of the conclave was 'In pursuit of knowledge'.
More than 500 delegates attended this two-day conclave, which is organised once in two years.

NSE Nifty breaches 8 600 mark; BSE Sensex at new peak ahead of GDP dataSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Markets gained for the third straight session today with benchmark Sensex surging 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty rising 94.05 points to 8,588.25, led by banking and auto shares, as hopes of a rate cut by RBI brightened after oil prices tumbled to multi-year lows.
FII buying in bluechips and retail investors picking up midcap shares helped markets cement gains. All eyes are now on quarterly GDP data to be released later. Total investor wealth is within a sniffing distance of Rs 100 lakh crore.
The BSE 30-share barometer Sensex spurted by 255.08 points, or 0.90 per cent, to close at new high of 28,693.99. It broke previous peak 28,499.54 recorded on November 24. Intra-day, it touched a new high of 28,822.37, bettering previous lifetime high of 28,541.96 also hit on November 24.
The Sensex has now gained over 355 points three days.
Gainers in the 30-share Sensex included Tata Steel, Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Coal India, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC, Hindalco, HDFC, Wipro, ITC Ltd, Tata Power and RIL.
“Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC’s decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week,” said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty barometer topped the 8,600 mark for the first time to hit life-time high of 8,617.00. It finally settled 94.05 points, or 1.11 per cent, higher at record close of 8,588.25. Thus, it surpassed its earlier closing peak of 8,530.15 touched on November 24.
Banking was the front-runner ahead of RBI monetary policy review next week. SBI led gains by rising over 5 per cent. Others such as ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank also rose.
Globally, brent crude prices fell to trade at over four-year low of USD 71.21 per barrel in Asian trade. This boosted shares of OMCs, paint makers and airline companies.
Sectorally, BSE Banking index gained the most by rising 2.87 per cent, followed by Auto 1.95 per cent, Realty 1.65 per cent and Consumer Durables 1.16 per cent among others.
Mixed closing at other Asian markets and a lower opening in European markets also influenced trading sentiments here.
Foreign investors bought shares worth net Rs 389.73 crore yesterday, as per provisional data.
