Rarely-Seen Photos Spotlight The 1970s Social Scene Of South Side Chicagoreddit
To say it was a different time is putting it lightly.
In the 1970s on Chicago's South Side, revelers in their finest packed into nightclubs, dancing the night away to the soulful music of the era while knocking back a drink or three at now-extinct blues clubs like Perv's House, Pepper's Hideout and the High Chaparral.
No one captured the scene better than Chicago photographer Michael L. Abramson . What started as a simple student project during his time at the Illinois Institute of Technology ultimately earned him a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts and catapulted him into a career as a prolific freelance photographer.
While several of the Brassai -esque shots below might look familiar -- some were included in the Grammy-nominated LP set "Light on the South Side," which featured Abramson's photography alongside music from the era -- many are being shown to the public for the very first time thanks to a new exhibition co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Photography and the Columbia College Chicago Library .
The exhibition, titled "Pulse of the Night," comes three years after the photographer's death at the age of 62 but marks the first large-scale public show of his work since 1977.
Below, a preview of some of the work featured in "Pulse of the Night."

Business and the costs of independenceBusiness and the costs of Scottish independence
Ending the 300-year-old single market will raise prices and hit jobs
Business has finally entered the Scottish independence debate , kicked off the fence by narrowing opinion polls and panicked investors. Better late than never.
Scotland’s largest banks are reassuring their customers that – whatever the outcome – they will stay British, backed by the Bank of England, and if that means changing domicile, so be it . Supermarkets have warned of rising prices. A growing chorus of bosses is now urging the Scots to vote No. The future of Scottish business has become a battleground of the campaign.

Little guy gets last drink on House
What took them so long? Many companies clearly felt it politic to keep quiet, whether to avoid annoying customers and employees with strong views, or to dodge the rough edge of the nationalist leader Alex Salmond’s tongue. The clenched fist rhetoric of Jim Sillars’s “day of reckoning” speech – in which he threatened to renationalise BP – speaks to a virulent anti-business strand within the Yes camp.
Shocked into finding their voices, businesses have started explaining the cost of Mr Salmond’s dream. They should be still more explicit: pricier postage stamps, kettles or baked beans are not abstractions: they hurt.
The Yes campaign is riddled with economic uncertainties. No one knows what currency arrangements an independent state would adopt or whether it would be part of the EU .
The negotiations to decide the future of important Scottish business sectors, such as renewable energy and oil, will be complicated and acrimonious. No energy provider will invest more in Scotland without knowing whether UK consumers still want to buy their expensive power. The oil sector needs to know the future fiscal regime before drilling more in the North Sea. The Yes side’s contention that all will be well is based on blind assertion.
Now they have entered the fray, business chiefs need to hammer home the consequences of unravelling a British single market woven over three centuries – one whose importance to Scotland far exceeds any other. Some 70 per cent of Scotland’s external trade is with the rest of the UK – many times what it sends to the rest of the EU.
A new border will affect those who never stray over it. Take Royal Mail. Scotland is covered by the universal service provision that obliges the postal service to make deliveries at the same cost across the UK. With independence, this will go: meaning increased costs for businesses that use the post and a sting in the wallet for anyone mailing birthday cards to relatives down south.
At present many British retailers absorb the higher costs of doing business in Scotland to offer standardised prices. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of John Lewis, warned last week that this will end with independence. He is not alone: Asda and Marks and Spencer say the same. Groceries cost 4 per cent more in Ireland than they do in the UK.
To be blunt, most big Scottish companies have more customers in the UK than in Scotland. Take Standard Life, 90 per cent of whose British clients are south of the border. To keep them happy, the Edinburgh-based insurer has said it will redomicile in the event of independence. While the implications of this for jobs remain unclear, in the long run it is likely to mean more operations relocating to the UK.
Mr Salmond claims independence will unleash the energy and self-confidence of entrepreneurs. Maybe so: but their first task will be to deal with the self-inflicted damage caused by replacing a highly-integrated single market with a looser relationship with Scotland’s biggest trading partner. On this point it is the Yes camp – rather than business – that chooses to remain silent.

Masters in management options are growing fastMasters in management options are growing fast
By Della Bradshaw
©Nick Lowndes
It was when Parul Dubey was studying for her electrical engineering degree in India that she read about London Business School ’s plans to launch a masters in management (MiM) degree for recent graduates.
More
Book review: ‘The Key’, by Lynda Gratton
Dubey had already began to question her future career. “I realised the engineering lifestyle wasn’t a good fit for me,” she recalls, so she applied to LBS for its first MiM class, which started in 2009. On graduating from LBS she got her first job, working in London for Pimco, the investment management company.
But that is not the end of Dubey’s business education story. Today, four years later, she is halfway through her two-year MBA programme at Harvard Business School.
As MiM degrees have flourished over the past decade, one of the biggest fears of business schools that run both MBA and MiM degrees has been that the MiM degree for younger students will cannibalise the market for MBAs. Dubey’s tale would suggest otherwise and her story is not unusual, says Leila Guerra, executive director of early-career programmes at LBS.
Parul Dubey, ex-London Business School
‘The case method has taught me to be a better listener. It has enabled me to put forward an argument and defend it in a class of people’
Even though LBS is just graduating its fourth class, Guerra reports that alumni from the programme have already signed up to study for MBAs at several top business schools, including Wharton, Chicago Booth, Stanford and Insead. “In 2009 the value of the MiM was really discussed in the school and by alumni,” says Guerra. “Now everyone sees the value.”
Though the growth in the European market for such degrees is beginning to plateau, there is increasing demand in Asia-Pacific, South America, Africa and even the US, the home of the MBA. Some of the country’s big-brand schools – Fuqua, Kellogg, Michigan Ross, MIT Sloan and Notre Dame – are among the 50 or so US business schools that already run MiMs, and others are looking closely at the model.
One of the biggest problems in the US is that recruiters and employers, seasoned MBA recruiters, find it hard to understand the value of the MiM. LBS, together with Kellogg and Duke in the US and IE in Spain, have set up the International Masters in Management Association, to help promote the degree.
3/70 of the top MiM programmes are directed at students with an engineering background
“Because the MiM market is very young, it is very collaborative,” Guerra points out. “We need to do what we did in the European market 10 or 15 years ago so that companies and recruiters understand the value of MiM graduates.”
At the Kellogg school at Northwestern University near Chicago, associate dean Betsy Ziegler believes the MiM presents a compelling proposition for recruiters. “The reason we are so excited about this is that these kids will be wildly productive and high-performing in the workplace.”
Jean Charroin, Audencia Nantes, France
‘It is not enough that someone speaks English. Students have to have the mindset to work in different cultures’
The first two classes of the Kellogg MiM have been restricted to Northwestern undergraduates. However, from July 2015 the programme will also be open to graduates from a handful of top universities. “We have proved the concept; now we will introduce it to other universities,” says Ziegler. At Kellogg, MiM graduates will be able to enter the second year of the MBA directly.
Though a fledgling degree compared with the MBA, the MiM is already evolving, with business schools adapting to a rapidly changing market for business graduates. Recruiters are looking for graduates with an increasingly sophisticated attitude to world markets and the ability to work in a number of countries, says Jean Charroin, director of French business school Audencia Nantes. “Our students from developing countries won’t be placed in their native country but will work in other countries.”
Languages are critical, he continues, with recruiters often looking for graduates who speak three. “It is not enough that someone speaks English. They have to have the mindset to work in different cultures. They must be able to adapt to different contexts,” he says.

Double-dip: The London Business School and China’s Fudan announced a two-year programme in which students spend one year in London and one year in Shanghai
Double-degree programmes are increasingly popular – Fudan University in China and LBS recently announced a two-year programme in which participants spend one year in London and one year in Shanghai. MIT Sloan also runs a double-degree programme with a number of partner schools, such as ESCP Europe. The selected participants spend one year at ESCP and one at MIT, studying on either Sloan’s master of science in management studies (MSMS) or its master of finance.
Many French students want to go to the US, because they want to work there, says Léon Laulusa, ESCP’s vice-dean for international development, but he concedes that the cost of the one-year MIT programmes will deter many – the fees start at $60,000.
34% of the 2011 MiM graduates surveyed by the FT work outside their home country
For Parul Dubey, LBS and Harvard have provided very different experiences and opportunities. “I believe I got the best of both worlds. LBS is in London, the financial capital of the world, and the business school is much more diverse. Harvard is a very different value-add,” she says. “The case method has taught me to be a better listener. It has enabled me to put forward an argument and defend it in a class of people.”
But the degree that has given her the biggest career opportunity has been the MiM, she says. “The MiM gave me the space, time, the geography and resources to move into finance and to London.”

Management-led growth held hostage by old ideasMeet the dean: Susan Hart, Strathclyde Business School
Another academic, William Lazonick, has shown how in recent years many large US corporates have been spending more than their total profits on dividends and share buybacks, leaving precious little for investment or employees. And in The Road to Recovery, City economist Andrew Smithers , hardly a rabid lefty, argues that the recession is not cyclical but structural, and it is caused by the misallocation of investment resources brought about by bonuses and incentives. For Smithers, dismantling the bonus culture that misdirects managers’ investment decisions is the single most important task for economic and social policy today.
If this is the case then, the management innovation that is needed will not come from hot new communication and co-ordinating technologies (such as big data, the internet of things or social media). In fact, the reverse. In today’s financialised world, these are more likely to be used to accentuate the job-stripping, winner-takes-all trend already seen with previous techniques like outsourcing and offshoring.
As Straub writes: “Instead of liberating the creative and innovative energy of employees [ ... ] blind processes and rigid hierarchies still hold them down. In effect, the emergence of a Taylorism of a sort in non-manufacturing business operations has been enabled by digital technology.”
Managers are the constitutive organ of society and its very survival is dependent on the performance, competence, earnestness and values of their managers.
- Peter Drucker (1993)
As the reference to Frederick Winslow Taylor’s “scientific management” project suggests, managers are still building mass-production organisations fit for the early 20th century, based on hierarchy, standardisation and compliance, rather than flexible, human-centred outfits in which technology is not a threat but a partner of both employees and customers.
A-list management voices as well as a cohort of younger thinkers and doers, have been calling for the reinvention of management along these lines for years. But nothing much has changed, at least among large established companies – just look at the unreconstructed financial sector. If anything, managers report that short-term pressures are getting worse.
So if this is old news, what is holding things up? What has to change to break the management logjam? Enter the zombies. As Smithers demonstrates, the invisible link between sluggish innovation, cost-cutting, share buybacks, the jobs and pay squeeze, and neo-Taylorism, is management incentives. What locks them all together in a tight, self-reinforcing paradigm is shareholder value – the assertion that the sole purpose of the company is to maximise returns to shareholders.
Technology is not a threat but a partner of employees as well as customers
This idea is embedded deep in official governance codes and it is hard to believe it is both recent – gaining traction only in the 1970s and 1980s – as well as based on a myth. In law, as the redoubtable legal scholar Lynn Stout, among others, has pointed out, shareholders own shares, not companies, which are separate legal persons, and directors’ only fiduciary responsibility is to the company. Shareholders are not principals and managers are not their agents.
The fact that this is a zombie idea does nothing to weaken its hold on the corporate psyche, particularly in the US. As the late London Business School scholar Sumantra Ghoshal explained, the problem is not that we fail to recognise good management practice – it is that bad management theory anaesthetises it.
So, yes, an era of management-led growth is both feasible and urgently needed. But the renaissance will not flourish unless a stake is driven through the heart of the shareholder-primacy zombie first.

Data protection in the age of consentSeptember 14, 2014 10:22 pm
Data protection in the age of consent
By Kate Bevan
©Dreamstime
Should the photographer consult the subject before firing the shutter?
Unexpectedly finding a picture of oneself frolicking at a somewhat frivolous club night on a tabloid website is pretty much guaranteed to ruin your day. A friend of mine was not pleased when that happened to him after the London Naked Painting party, and complained to the event promoter, saying that he had not been asked for consent for the image of him to be published.
The promoter was dismissive, pointing out that the published rules for the party stated: “Only accredited press is allowed photography.” The promoter added that if my friend had allowed himself to be photographed, he should have assumed those photographs could appear in the press.

The promoter had a point, but the incident raises more general points about consent. How detailed do terms and conditions need to be when one is seeking consent, for example to use data, or even to publish a photograph on a prominent news website? Should consent for one thing be presumed to extend beyond the original use, and how much onus should be on the individual to refuse to be photographed? Should the person being photographed say explicitly: “You may take my photograph now but you may not sell this image on to a third party”? Is it acceptable to assume that partygoers will understand that any photographs taken of them at the event might end up in the press? Should the photographer have asked my friend before firing the shutter at the party? Should he further have made clear that he would be selling the images to the Daily Mail website?
Robert Bond, head of data protection and information security at law firm Speechly Bircham, says: “That exposure might well be unfair, although the fact that this was a naked event and the reference to press photography might mean consent was implied.
“On the other hand, the terms of the event did not clearly say that participants might have their image publicised and given the nature of the event such transparency might be necessary.” In other words, it is a grey area, to say the least.
Every interaction we have with technology involves consent, either explicit or assumed. Whether that is choosing to keep out of the way of a camera, or installing an app on your smartphone, using a social media platform or a free cloud service or even using one of a plethora of smart devices for the home – each activity requires you to grant consent so that the device or platform can function.
However, it is time to be both more circumspect and questioning about the permissions we grant. And that means those whose businesses depend on technology need to think more carefully about what consent they ask of users.
The trade-off thus far has been that you consent to surrendering data in return for using a free service: the obvious examples are Facebook and Gmail, which collect a lot of information about you in order to show you “relevant” adverts. Given their large numbers, most users are clearly more or less comfortable with that bargain.
But how often do you look at precisely what permissions something you want to use is seeking? And what happens if a product you are comfortable with changes hands? When Google bought Nest , which makes smart thermostats, at the beginning of the year, Nest said that it would not share data with Google, allaying the fears of many commentators. Yet just six months later, at the end of June, Nest said that, um, yes, after all, it would share data with Google. At the moment, Nest users have to opt in to share that data, and it is only available in a limited way to Google to allow the Android app to function.
For those concerned about the porous borders through which data can leak, however, it is a reminder that your consent to a specific use can be potentially compromised further down the track.
And just ticking the box granting an app permissions can go wrong. The most recent example of that came when Yo, the app that only allows users to send the message “Yo”, was hacked. The hackers had discovered a security hole that exposed the phone numbers of any Yo user: to prove it, they texted the developer. The app needs access to your phone list to function.
You consent to surrendering data in return for using a free service
Taking care of such data is going to become a lot more important when the proposed EU data protection regulations come into force, probably towards the end of 2016. Not only could businesses reporting a data breach be subject to a fine of up to 5 per cent of global turnover, it is also likely that they will have to be much more transparent about seeking consent to use data: one proposal, which Bond expects to be adopted, is that the language will also have to be appropriate to the age of the person signing up. That is going to pose a challenge, he says: “How do you tell a 13-year-old at the same time as a 17-year-old with a different level of understanding what’s they’re agreeing to?”
Nonetheless, a greater reluctance simply to grant consent without stopping to consider the implications could be turned to the advantage of a smart business: the developers who make data privacy, safety and explicit consent a key part of the brand could find themselves more successful than rivals who set less store by such concerns.
Meanwhile, says Bond, as businesses will be required under the new framework to have data protection officers, those seeking a career change could do a lot worse than developing an expertise in this area – and becoming data protection officers.

App and away: software that helps you make the most of your time
Glympse, all platforms, free
Arranging to meet someone can be tricky if you are on the move. Glympse is a neat way of letting someone know where you are: it uses your location data to send an alert to the people you want to share your location with – and to protect your privacy, your Glympse is only available for a time limit that you set. The recipient does not need to have the app on their device – the alert sends them a link to a website which updates in more or less real time.
Entrain, iOS, free
The developers of Entrain reckon their app can help you get over jet lag faster by creating a sleep and light schedule. The principle is that exposure to light is the quickest way to set your circadian rhythm. The app uses information about your travel, the time you usually go to sleep and wake up, and the amount of light you expect to be exposed to, as light levels have an effect on how quickly your body resets to a new timezone.
Lightroom, iOS, free
The app enables you to crop images, tweak parameters such as white balance, contrast and highlights, as well as apply presets to images – but only those that come built-in with the full paid-for desktop version (which is required in order to have the app). There are no user-defined presets. It is an impressive app that is free with any of Adobe’s subscription packages and like its desktop big brother, is great for both professionals and keen amateurs.

Data protection in the age of consentSeptember 14, 2014 10:22 pm
Data protection in the age of consent
By Kate Bevan
©Dreamstime
Should the photographer consult the subject before firing the shutter?
Unexpectedly finding a picture of oneself frolicking at a somewhat frivolous club night on a tabloid website is pretty much guaranteed to ruin your day. A friend of mine was not pleased when that happened to him after the London Naked Painting party, and complained to the event promoter, saying that he had not been asked for consent for the image of him to be published.
The promoter was dismissive, pointing out that the published rules for the party stated: “Only accredited press is allowed photography.” The promoter added that if my friend had allowed himself to be photographed, he should have assumed those photographs could appear in the press.

The promoter had a point, but the incident raises more general points about consent. How detailed do terms and conditions need to be when one is seeking consent, for example to use data, or even to publish a photograph on a prominent news website? Should consent for one thing be presumed to extend beyond the original use, and how much onus should be on the individual to refuse to be photographed? Should the person being photographed say explicitly: “You may take my photograph now but you may not sell this image on to a third party”? Is it acceptable to assume that partygoers will understand that any photographs taken of them at the event might end up in the press? Should the photographer have asked my friend before firing the shutter at the party? Should he further have made clear that he would be selling the images to the Daily Mail website?
Robert Bond, head of data protection and information security at law firm Speechly Bircham, says: “That exposure might well be unfair, although the fact that this was a naked event and the reference to press photography might mean consent was implied.
“On the other hand, the terms of the event did not clearly say that participants might have their image publicised and given the nature of the event such transparency might be necessary.” In other words, it is a grey area, to say the least.
Every interaction we have with technology involves consent, either explicit or assumed. Whether that is choosing to keep out of the way of a camera, or installing an app on your smartphone, using a social media platform or a free cloud service or even using one of a plethora of smart devices for the home – each activity requires you to grant consent so that the device or platform can function.
However, it is time to be both more circumspect and questioning about the permissions we grant. And that means those whose businesses depend on technology need to think more carefully about what consent they ask of users.
The trade-off thus far has been that you consent to surrendering data in return for using a free service: the obvious examples are Facebook and Gmail, which collect a lot of information about you in order to show you “relevant” adverts. Given their large numbers, most users are clearly more or less comfortable with that bargain.
But how often do you look at precisely what permissions something you want to use is seeking? And what happens if a product you are comfortable with changes hands? When Google bought Nest , which makes smart thermostats, at the beginning of the year, Nest said that it would not share data with Google, allaying the fears of many commentators. Yet just six months later, at the end of June, Nest said that, um, yes, after all, it would share data with Google. At the moment, Nest users have to opt in to share that data, and it is only available in a limited way to Google to allow the Android app to function.
For those concerned about the porous borders through which data can leak, however, it is a reminder that your consent to a specific use can be potentially compromised further down the track.
And just ticking the box granting an app permissions can go wrong. The most recent example of that came when Yo, the app that only allows users to send the message “Yo”, was hacked. The hackers had discovered a security hole that exposed the phone numbers of any Yo user: to prove it, they texted the developer. The app needs access to your phone list to function.

Alibaba to Boost IPO Size on Strong DemandKotak Bank Buys ING Vysya in Record $2.4 Billion Share Deal
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd plans to increase the size of its US initial public offering (IPO) because of "overwhelming" investor demand, people familiar with the deal said on Monday.
The Chinese e-commerce company launched the IPO last week and had enough investor demand to cover the entire deal within two days, people familiar with the process said last week.
Alibaba could set a new record for the world's biggest IPO if underwriters exercise an option to sell additional shares to meet demand, pushing it as high as $24.3 billion and overtaking Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's $22.1 billion listing in 2010.
The company and some shareholders offered 320.1 million American depositary shares at a $60-$66 per share indicative range. Alibaba will likely file an amendment to its IPO later on Monday with a higher price range after discussing the new price with large US mutual funds and institutional investors, one of the people said.
"Demand has been overwhelming since the launch," said the person, who couldn't be named because details of the IPO aren't yet public.
"Increasing the price range was already on the cards from the beginning."
Bloomberg earlier reported that Alibaba plans to increase the top end of the price range to above $70.
Alibaba spokeswoman Florence Shih declined to comment on the size of the IPO being raised.
Reuters reported on Friday that Alibaba plans to close its IPO order book early after it received enough orders to sell all the shares in the record-breaking offering.
Overseas expansion
Alibaba plans to expand its business in the United States and Europe after the much anticipated IPO, billionaire founder Jack Ma said on Monday as the Chinese e-commerce titan pitched its record deal to investors in Asia.
"After being listed in the US, we will develop our business in Europe and in the US," Ma told a packed group of journalists ahead of his presentation to investors. "We will not give up the Asia market because, as I would say, we are not a company from China, we are an Internet company that happened to be in China."
The investor luncheon took place in a huge events room at the luxury Ritz Carlton hotel. The hotel is on the same building as three of the main bookrunners of the IPO, just an elevator ride away from Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley offices, across the harbor from the city's financial center.
Fund managers and analysts were given orange bracelets to give them access to the banquet of smoked salmon, chicken breast and mango pudding. The event had two videos and a question and answer session with Ma answering most of the questions, according to investors at the presentation.
Missed opportunity
Alibaba picked New York for its IPO after Hong Kong officials rejected its request to allow a small group of company insiders to nominate the majority of its board.
The request went against Hong Kong's "one share, one vote" principle, which has been staunchly defended by its securities regulator.
Ma, who is also Alibaba's executive chairman, said that the missed opportunity came about in part because of how Alibaba communicated its plans to local authorities, mirroring statements he gave last year.
"People say that Hong Kong lost the Alibaba deal. To me, I think it is Alibaba that missed this great opportunity to list in Hong Kong," Ma added. "We love Hong Kong. We will continue to love Hong Kong and invest in Hong Kong."
The company launched its IPO last week and is expected to price the deal on Sept. 18. It will start trading a day later.

HSBC Sees Higher India Growth  Lower Inflation in Coming QuartersYou are here: Home Economy
HSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 17:28 (IST)
RBI May Tighten Norms For Foreign Flow In Debt Funds
New Delhi: Supported by better investor sentiment, India's GDP growth rate is expected to strengthen further while inflation is likely to ease in the coming quarters due to base effect, global financial services major HSBC said in a report.
Improved investor sentiment is expected to drive the economy forward in the coming quarters. In order to support the recovery process, the new government, however, would need to pick up the pace of reforms, it said.
"Looking ahead, growth is likely to strengthen, supported by better sentiment, whereas inflation will ease notably due to base effects," HSBC said in a research note on Monday.
India's economic growth accelerated to 5.7 per cent during April-June, much better than 4.7 per cent in the corresponding quarter last fiscal year.
The government expects growth in the current fiscal year to be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent. The economy grew by sub-5 per cent rate in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
The report further said some of the factors that can impact growth revival momentum are poor start to monsoons, high corporate leverage and fiscal compression needed to achieve the budget deficit target.
"To support the recovery, the new government will need to pick up the pace of reforms and quickly address supply side issues in the economy," HSBC said.
Notwithstanding the improved prospects for inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep the policy rate unchanged in the near term, in order to contain the consumer price index-based inflation under 6 per cent by January 2016.
CPI-inflation moderated to 7.8 per cent year-on-year in August (as against 8.0 per cent year-on-year in July). Wholesale inflation also fell to a nearly five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August.
The report further noted that meeting the retail inflation target of 6 per cent by 2016 would prove "challenging" since stronger growth can lift price pressures next year. In order to meet this target, the apex bank would probably choose to leave policy rates at the current "elevated" level, HSBC said.
"From the RBI's perspective, it will have to retain its tight monetary policy stance to ensure sustained disinflation next year, when growth gains momentum," it said.

Clean Energy and the Path to U.S. Energy Independencereddit
As tensions in the Middle East rise, and show every likelihood of continuing for a long time, the U.S. needs to step up its efforts to achieve energy independence and take advantage of every possible source of energy. Historically, the U.S. has been able to rely on Arab nations to meet about 30 percent of its oil needs, but the unpredictable political landscape in the Middle East could restrict that supply at any time.
While the formerly popular theory of 'peak oil' , which postulates that domestic supplies of U.S. oil reached their peak in 2005 and will falter in the future has been widely discredited , it still contains some truth. Even if oil production is not declining, energy consumption is rising rapidly , which is the other side of the coin. At the same time, regulations that prevent oil companies from drilling in resource-rich areas like the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge put even more pressure on supply.
On the back of this situation, natural gas has risen in importance. It provides a seemingly endless supply of energy for everything from heating to electricity. Currently, natural gas accounts for 27 percent of electricity generation stateside, driven by low natural gas prices, and is projected to rise to 30 percent by 2040. In addition, the U.S. currently has 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is enough to last for 92 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
However, these statistics are based on demand remaining static at today's levels. They fail to factor in the possibility of higher consumption or an oil supply deficit, both of which would lead to the faster use of natural gas and create a supply/demand imbalance in that sector as well.
This would, of course, be good for domestic oil and natural gas producers, who would be selling at capacity and at higher prices.  But it also means that other sources of energy will be required to supplement oil and natural gas -- at least in the medium term -- for the U.S. to be energy independent.
One possibility is biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are obtained from plant tissues and are renewable. However, these fuels generate much less energy than crude oil and are difficult to refine. Researchers are working on methods to counter these factors but are still very early in that process.
The other options are traditional sources such as coal which will continue to provide a steady percentage of our energy needs. However, even if the environmental concerns surrounding coal don't actually hamper production, they could still provide an impetus for the generation of clean energy through solar, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen fuel cell technologies -- supported by studies on climate change such as a recent one from the World Meteorological Organization .
Today, clean energy accounts for only 8 percent of electricity generation and 11 percent of total energy production in the U.S. The reason for this is the high expense of producing clean energy relative to the output, and consequently pricing. In addition, investment in low carbon technologies fails to yield sufficient savings to make it cost effective for the power sector and industrial consumers, leading to a slower migration to energy efficient technologies. Making this scenario even more complicated are the mixed signals from policymakers over the years on carbon pricing, which underpins the economics in this arena.
This can all change , however, at the 21st United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, set to take place in Paris in 2015. The UNFCCC is expected to set a global protocol for the reduction of CO2 emissions, to be enacted in 2020. The clarity from such a protocol is expected to set the market for carbon at a level sufficiently high to justify investments in environmentally friendly technologies, which would then give both producers and consumers of clean energy better visibility on their investments.
The clean energy sector in the U.S. still has a long way to go. Unlike Europe and China, where the adoption of such technologies is progressing rapidly , American producers have yet to reach the critical mass required to bring down prices, and consumers still lack a real incentive -- other than a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - or even options to switch to such sources of energy.
This will gradually change as the industry matures but will require the U.S. to prioritize energy independence and to keep in mind that rising energy demand may necessitate the use of a variety of sources, both traditional and new, at the same time.

The Two Trillion Regulatory Burdenreddit
The overall cost of complying with federal regulations is somewhere north of $2 trillion per year according to a recent report from the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), a venerable organization where once I hung my hat.
Of course, the focus of the NAM study, performed by economists Nicole V. and Mark Crain, was manufacturing. All businesses must spend money complying with regulations but manufacturing is a special case. By its very nature -- wresting natural resources from the earth, transporting them over large distances, employing huge amounts of energy to transform them into useful products -- manufacturing poses unique challenges to worker safety and the environment.
Crain and Crain found that manufacturing businesses bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- or $19,564 per employee per year -- or nearly double what the average business pays to comply with federal rules. And small manufacturers pay more than three times as much as the average U.S. firm, or $34,671 per employee per year. This also should come as no surprise to anyone. Complying with complex regulations requires expertise and small companies, whether in manufacturing or another sector, do not have the same access to safety engineers, industrial hygienists, environmental scientists and lawyers that characterizes larger firms.
This latest study builds on earlier work the Crains performed for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. In essence it validated the earlier reports with more recent data. "Our data continue to show that small businesses and manufacturers bear a disproportionate share of compliance costs," said Nicole V. Crain.
The study did not attempt to gauge the impact of the Environmental Protection Agency's upcoming ozone regulations that may be, according to NAM President Jay Timmons, "the most expensive regulation in history." Nor did it factor in the burden of state and local rules.
This NAM report is credible and important and the only thing I would add are some basic suggestions for regulatory reform.
There is no question that we need a dynamic regulatory system to ameliorate private sector failure to protect the environment and consumer welfare. But in today's globally competitive environment, it is imperative we use smart regulation. I would suggest:
• Comprehensive review of all existing regulations.
• Use of cost benefit and cost effectiveness analysis to make sure rules are justified.
• Flexible performance standards to permit more innovative, less costly ways to meet regulatory objectives.
Without question, the cost of federal regulations is eventually borne by workers, consumers and investors. We cannot afford a $2 trillion regulatory bill. We have laws on the books to address these issues. They should be enforced.

Scottish referendum not seen having an impact on rupeeScotland referendum unlikely to impact rupee
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:45 AM IST
The referendum to decide whether or not Scotland remains a part of the United Kingdom, scheduled to be held on Thursday, isn’t likely to have an impact on the rupee.
During the referendum, voters in Scotland will be posed the question, “Should Scotland be an independent country?”
“Even if the verdict is ‘yes’, it will not have an impact on the rupee, as the number of investors from Scotland isn’t high,” says N S Venkatesh, executive director and head of treasury, IDBI Bank.
On Monday, the rupee breached the 61/dollar mark, closing at a near one-month low of 61.15/dollar (it stood at 61.22 on August 13), compared with its previous close of 60.66. After opening at 60.93/dollar, it touched an intra-day low of 61.17.
Prashant Sawant, senior economist at UK-based global risk and strategic consulting firm Maplecroft, says, “An independent Scotland is likely to pursue better trade relationship with emerging countries, including India. Trade in oil & gas and manufacturing goods are some of the key common factors that will help improve India’s trade balance in the long-run.”
Some, however, believe if Scotland becomes an independent nation, the rupee will be hit. “If the verdict is ‘yes’ and they vote for separation, it will have an indirect impact on the rupee; it will have an immediate impact on the whole Euro zone. In such an environment, there might be sell-off from domestic markets. That will result in a couple of days of nervousness,” said Anindya Banerjee, a currency analyst at Kotak Securities.
Experts say a key factor for the rupee will be the outcome of a meeting of the US Federal Reserve on September 16-17. “The level of 61.5/dollar is crucial. If the rupee breaches that level, it could even weaken to 61.75/dollar,” said Sandeep Gonsalves, forex consultant and dealer, Mecklai & Mecklai.
The key factor behind the rupee’s fall on Monday was data on industrial output for July; the data, released after market hours on Friday, showed growth in industrial production fell to a five-month low of 0.5 per cent in July.
Currency dealers said though the central bank was active in the market on Monday (through state-run banks), its intervention wasn’t significant.

University of Illinois nurses extend contract -- a second time -- to Oct. 21.
Wages are among the sticking points for U. of I.'s 1,150 nurses, who are seeking 21.5% raise over 3 years
The University of Illinois Hospital and its unionized nurses have agreed to extend their labor contract for a second time in as many months because the two sides have been unable to come to terms on a new pact.
The hospital and the union agreed late last week to extend their current contract to Oct. 21 from Sept. 23, a nurses union spokesman said.
The nurses, members of the Illinois Nurses Association, voted in late August by a wide margin to authorize a strike if their union and the West Side academic medical center cannot reach an agreement on a new contract.

It's understandable that the union would agree to extending the talks, in part because the agreement that they eventually come to will contain some retroactive provisions. Then there's this. Right now it would appear that, even though the nurses are apparently pretty well-compensated,...

Full review of govt bank chiefs  appointments  after Syndicate Bank scandalRobust review before PSU bank chiefs are selected
Manojit Saha | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has begun to review the performance of those appointed to or candidates for the top posts in public sector banks (PSBs).
The move to make the appointment process more robust comes after last month’s arrest of S K Jain, chairman and managing director (CMD) of Syndicate Bank last month, over graft charges. As a result, the authorities have started asking for feedback and not only from the immediate reporting heads and peers.
The previous government had selected some for appointment in PSBs to replace the many CMDs and executive directors (EDs) due for retirement in 2014-15. The present government is now doing a complete review of those selected.
Following Jain’s arrest, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) found irregularities in the appointment process. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had requested both RBI and the cabinet secretary to review the appointment process.
A committee headed by the RBI governor, which includes the financial services secretary of the Union finance ministry, is set up to select the candidates. The committee sends its recommendations to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister.
CMD posts in four PSBs are already vacant and other vacancies will arise during the financial year. The heads of Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank have competed their terms and United Bank’s CMD opted for early retirement in February. Jain was suspended following his arrest. Two more CMD posts will become vacant by the end of the month, with S L Bansal of Oriental Bank of Commerce and R K Dubey of Canara Bank completing their terms. Later in the financial year, the top post in Vijaya Bank will also get vacant.
And, a number of ED positions will also become vacant on retirements.
A committee headed by former Axis Bank chief P J Nayak has emphasised a need to make the appointments process in PSBs more transparent. Set up by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, it gave a report in May.
At a banking seminar here on Monday, the RBI chief agreed there was a need to change the management appointment process in PSBs, to make it more transparent. The central bank is in talks with the government to improve governance in these lenders, he said.

Adidas unveils miCoach Smart Run watch at Rs 24 999Adidas unveils smartwatch miCoach Smart Run at Rs 24,999
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 20:39 IST
German sportswear firm Adidas has joined the smartwatch bandwagon with its 'miCoach Smart Run', priced at Rs 24,999, which will allow users to monitor heart rate and play music.
The smartwatch , which will be available exclusively on Adidas website, will also allow runners to track their runs using GPS mapping.

Adidas already offers a miCoach app on smartphones.
Smart wearables, as a category, is growing globally with the likes of Samsung, Motorola and Apple coming out with their smartphones across various price points.
While smartwatches from these firms are not dedicated to healthcare or athletics, most of these support apps like pedometer and heart rate monitor to help users monitor various bodily functions.

Mediterranean tragedy: 500 boat migrants feared dead in  worst shipwreck in years500 migrants feared dead in Malta shipwreck

More than 700 people fleeing Africa and the West Asia may have drowned in the latest shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, bringing the death toll this year to almost 3,000, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Monday.
In the worst incident, as many as 500 migrants are believed to have died after traffickers rammed their ship off Malta's coast last week, an event that only came to light this weekend in testimony from two of the nine survivors.
The survivors said the traffickers ordered the migrants to change vessels in the middle of the Mediterranean. The migrants refused, leading to a confrontation that ended when traffickers rammed the ship carrying the migrants, IOM spokesperson Christiane Berthiaume told Reuters in Geneva.
"Some 500 people were on board - Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese. They were trying to reach Europe," Berthiaume said.
"That means that 700 people perished at sea these last days in the Mediterranean, the deadliest incidents in the space of a few days," she said.

The vessel had set off on Saturday, September 6 from Damiette, Egypt, and sank off Malta's coast on September 10, she said. The UN refugee agency also learned of the shipwreck, but said its information was the wreck occurred on Friday.
"In all, nine people survived and were picked up boats," Berthiaume said. IOM officials interviewed two Palestinian survivors who were taken to Sicily, Italy, while other survivors were taken to Malta and to Crete, Greece, Berthiaume said.
Four days later, another ship packed with up to 250 African emigrants sank off the Libyan coast, and most of them are feared dead, a spokesperson for the Libyan navy said late on Sunday. Some 26 people survived.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said the situation in the Mediterranean was unclear and it was trying to get confirmation of five shipwrecks in all. "At least 500 people have died or are missing in the last three days", UNHCR spokesperson Francis Markus said in an email.

"It was without any doubt the deadliest weekend ever in the Mediterranean," Carlotta Sami of the UNHCR said.
Some 130,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, compared with 60,000 last year, according to the UNHCR. Italy has received more than 118,000, most of them rescued at sea under its naval operation Mare Nostrum.
UN high commissioner for refugees Antonio Guterres and UNHCR special envoy Angelina Jolie visited the naval rescue headquarters in Malta on Sunday, meeting survivors, the agency said in a statement issued on Monday.
"Amidst concerns about the sustainability of the Italian Mare Nostrum operation, they also called for increased efforts by European nations to contribute to rescue efforts and reduce deaths at sea," the UNHCR said.
Half of those arriving in Europe by boat are refugees from Syria and Eritrea, according to the agency.

"We all need to wake up to the scale of this crisis. There is a direct link between the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere and the rise in deaths at sea in the Mediterranean. We have to understand what drives people to take the fearful step of risking their children's lives on crowded, unsafe vessels; it is the overwhelming desire to find refuge," Jolie said.
"It is also part of a bigger problem - the soaring numbers of people displaced by conflicts around the world today, which now stands at over 51 million. Unless we address the root causes of these conflicts, the numbers of refugees dying or unable to find protection will continue to rise," she said.

ATM transactions not free for banks  says Raghram RajanNo free lunch: Rajan on ATM transactions
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:48 AM IST
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said while there was criticism on reducing the number of free transactions at non-home bank automated teller machines (ATMs) from five to three a month, this was necessary, as banks had to pay for such transactions.
“There is no such thing as a free lunch; we tend to forget this sometimes. If your bank has to pay some other bank for those transactions, it has to collect it from somewhere. It does this by increasing some other fee on customers. It passes the cost back to customers,” he said, adding five such transactions cost a bank Rs 75-100.
The RBI chief said to the extent that everybody carried out five ATM transactions free and everybody incurred the same cost, the cost was passed to customers. But this led to distortions, as those carrying out five transactions benefited, while carrying out one or no transactions didn’t, he added.
“Should we mandate such cross-subsidy and subsidising people in use of cash?” he asked. The answer, he said, was a partial withdrawal of the mandate — from November, the number of free ATM transactions at non-home bank ATMs in six metros (Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad) would be three a month.
Rajan clarified RBI wasn’t directing banks to charge for such transactions, but merely telling them that they could. “Banks can choose to subsidise. Overall, this will reduce the hidden cross-subsidy and make it more transparent.”
For credit card transactions, RBI has a two-step authentication process. Rajan said this would continue. He added some were bypassing this and clearing transactions abroad, contravening a number of rules. “The immediate pushback was RBI was against innovation. Whatever the innovation, you have to follow rules. If there is a rule in the book, we don’t allow it to be violated simply because the innovation is cool,” he said.
Such authentication, Rajan said, had strengthened security of transactions. He added now, RBI was considering how to innovate and allow easy small-value payments. It was mulling reducing second authentications for low-value payments, provided the card provider had systems to protect against misuse, he said, adding they would bear costs beyond a certain point in case a card was misused.
The governor raised questions related to the priority sector. One had to ask why some sectors secured credit more easily than others, he said, adding for instance, priority sector student loans were subsidised for study abroad, too. “Are students studying abroad the neediest in the country, or the most important? I am not saying this is bad, but we should ask questions.”

Zydus Cadila bags license for hepatitis C drugZydus Cadila bags license for hepatitis C drug
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Sep 15, 2014 08:56 PM IST
Ahmedabad-based pharma major Cadila Healthcare (Zydus Cadila) today announced that it has signed a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc, which will allow the generic manufacture of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (used for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C) for distribution in 90 developing countries, including India.
The company said here in a statement that the agreement would allow Zydus to manufacture the generic versions of sofosbuvir and the investigational single tablet regimen of ledipasvir / sofosbuvir. "There are nearly 10 million patients suffering from hepatitis C in India. The problem is further compounded by the fact that patients remain undiagnosed till the late stage and can ill afford the treatment," the statement said.
Pankaj R Patel, chairman and managing director of the Zydus Group said, "By joining hands and providing access to affordable therapy, we are taking a far reaching step towards fighting the scourge of hepatitis C. It is through such joint initiatives and combined efforts that we serve the cause of healthcare."
Zydus Heptiza, the specialty division of the Zydus group will be marketing the therapy. "Over the last four years since launch, Heptiza is the only division present with an entire range of antivirals approved for hepatitis B & C management in India. It has been reaching out to high risk population with free screening for hepatitis B & C patients and has made available hepatitis B vaccination to patients, free of cost," the statement said.
Under the licensing agreement, Zydus will receive a complete technology transfer of the Gilead manufacturing process to enabling production to be scaled up as quickly as possible. Zydus will set its own prices for the generic product, paying a royalty on sales to Gilead. The licenses also permit the manufacture of sofosbuvir or ledipasvir in combination with other chronic hepatitis C medicines.
Sofosbuvir was approved under the trade name Sovaldi by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2013 and by the European Commission in January 2014. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing the company's applications for a single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir; it is an investigational agent and its safety and efficacy have not been established.

BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Sep 15, 2014 08:56 PM IST
Ahmedabad-based pharma major Cadila Healthcare (Zydus Cadila) today announced that it has signed a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc, which will allow the generic manufacture of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (used for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C) for distribution in 90 developing countries, including India.
The company said here in a statement that the agreement would allow Zydus to manufacture the generic versions of sofosbuvir and the investigational single tablet regimen of ledipasvir / sofosbuvir. "There are nearly 10 million patients suffering from hepatitis C in India. The problem is further compounded by the fact that patients remain undiagnosed till the late stage and can ill afford the treatment," the statement said.
Pankaj R Patel, chairman and managing director of the Zydus Group said, "By joining hands and providing access to affordable therapy, we are taking a far reaching step towards fighting the scourge of hepatitis C. It is through such joint initiatives and combined efforts that we serve the cause of healthcare."
Zydus Heptiza, the specialty division of the Zydus group will be marketing the therapy. "Over the last four years since launch, Heptiza is the only division present with an entire range of antivirals approved for hepatitis B & C management in India. It has been reaching out to high risk population with free screening for hepatitis B & C patients and has made available hepatitis B vaccination to patients, free of cost," the statement said.
Under the licensing agreement, Zydus will receive a complete technology transfer of the Gilead manufacturing process to enabling production to be scaled up as quickly as possible. Zydus will set its own prices for the generic product, paying a royalty on sales to Gilead. The licenses also permit the manufacture of sofosbuvir or ledipasvir in combination with other chronic hepatitis C medicines.
Sofosbuvir was approved under the trade name Sovaldi by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2013 and by the European Commission in January 2014.

Hero MotoCorp likely to sign MoU with AP on TuesdayHero MotoCorp likely to sign MoU with AP on Tuesday
BS Reporter | Hyderabad Sep 15, 2014 08:44 PM IST
Hero MotoCorp Limited is likely to sign an MoU with the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday for setting up a motorcycle manufacturing plant in the state. The investment likely to be committed by the company is around Rs 2,200 crore, according to government sources.
During his recent visit to Delhi, the sources said, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu succeeded in convincing Hero MotoCorp managing director and chief executive officer Pawan Munjal and his father Brij Mohan Munjal to choose AP as its manufacturing base for South India.
The state government has offered 600 acres of government land in Chittoor district adjoining the SriCity Industrial Park, at almost zero cost, besides 100 per cent exemption of value-added tax (VAT) on bikes made here. Power subsidy and other incentives available under the existing industrial policy were also being extended to the company, the sources told Business Standard.
Recent reports suggested the company had zeroed in on Karnataka among several other competing states to locate its plant for the South Indian market. Interestingly, the government of Telangana too was in the fray.
The decision was kept under wraps by the AP administration. Even the MoU was not circulated for vetting by either the finance or the law department, they said.
The Andhra Pradesh Cabinet on Monday reportedly discussed the incentives being offered to the company. However, information and public relations minister Palle Raghunath Reddy refused to share the details. Instead, he stated Naidu himself would announce the details in this regard on Tuesday.

JSW says its offer for Lucchini is below $10...JSW Steel says its offer for Italian steelmaker Lucchini is below $100 million
By Reuters | 15 Sep, 2014, 10.14PM IST
Italian media reports had previously speculated that heavy liabilities and a need to protect jobs meant that Lucchini could be sold for only one euro.

Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI/LONDON: JSW Steel has offered less than $100 million for troubled Italian steelmaker Lucchini's core assets in Piombino and will not take on any of the company's debt, JSW chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Monday.
The comments were Jindal's first since Lucchini, Italy's second-largest steelmaker by capacity, announced late last week that it was considering a binding offer from JSW.
"The Lucchini acquisition cost will be sub-$100 million," Jindal told reporters on the sidelines of a Mumbai lecture series, adding that JSW would not take on any debt.
A spokesman for Lucchini declined to comment.
Lucchini, previously owned by Russia's Severstal, was declared insolvent in 2012 and placed under special administration - a procedure designed to save large companies and avoid heavy job losses.
Italian media reports had previously speculated that heavy liabilities and a need to protect jobs meant that Lucchini could be sold for only one euro.
"The fact that JSW are not assuming any debt is positive. EU steel demand is about 30 percent below the 2008 financial crisis, and Italy was back in recession in Q2 2014, so JSW are not buying something that has upside in the short or even the medium term," said VTB Capital's head of commodities research, Wiktor Bielski.
The Piombino complex employs about 2,000 people and can produce 2.5 million tonnes of steel a year. The Italian government has taken a keen interest in its sale as it struggles to pull the country out of its third recession in six years.

Gujarat  Guangdong set to become sister prov...Ahmedabad
(It's likely to be something…)
BEIJING: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, Gujarat, is set to become the sister province of one of China's most developed Guangdong province and its capital Guangzhou the sister city of Ahmedabad, after the two sides ink a pact this week during Chinese President's India visit.
The pacts are expected to be signed during Xi Jinping's visit to Ahmedabad on September 17, coinciding with Modi's 64th birthday.
Guangdong is China's richest province posting the highest GDP growth compared to all Chinese provinces, since 1989.
It is where Chinese reformist leader Deng Xiaoping launched his famous SEZ pilot project at Shenzhen which became China's biggest business and industrial hub.
With a population of over 100 million, Guangdong raked in a GDP of USD 1.5 trillion last year with per capita income of over USD 9,500.
Gujarat is also widely regarded as one of India's richest and most developed states.
The agreements could leverage a lot of direct investment opportunities facilitating direct interaction between the two.
Similarly, the sister city agreements between Guangzhou and Ahmedabad may enable both provincial capital cities to explore direct investment opportunities and joint development programmes besides cultural interaction, officials told PTI.
It's likely to be something similar to the pact signed between Japanese city Kyoto and Modi's constituency Varanasi during his recent visit to Japan.
The agreements were expected to be signed at a ceremony on the banks of Sabarmati river and would be attended by both Xi and Modi.
For Modi, it was a coup of sorts to get Xi to begin his maiden visit to India from Gujarat as the Chinese President initially toyed the idea to visit Kochi in Kerala instead.
The cancellation of Xi's visit to Pakistan also enabled him to rework his programme. He is currently visiting Maldives from there he would go to Sri Lanka and then come to India.
Chinese officials explored the Kochi option as it showcased famous Chinese navigator Zheng He's travels to the state in 14th century.
Kochi houses the unique Chinese fishing nets, which remained a major travel attraction.
In July this year, some Chinese officials even visited Kochi to discuss plans for Xi's visit to the city.
Xi also considered a visit to Kerala as part of his vision to develop the strategic 21st century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) to recreate the epic voyage undertaken by Zheng He. China has invited India to be part of the MSR.
Xi also wanted to visit Gujarat to see the development under Modi's stewardship as Chief Minister of the state.
Modi visited China several times during his tenures as Chief Minister and successfully courted Chinese investments.
The September 8 visit of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval here and his meeting with Xi clinched Xi's visit to Gujarat, officials said.

For car makers  it s not a full turnaround yetFor car makers, it's not a full turnaround yet
Sharmistha Mukherjee | New Delhi Sep 15, 2014 10:30 PM IST
There is a correction to this article that may be seen at its end.
When domestic car sales clocked 12.54 per cent growth in August, the industry's fourth straight monthly gain, the perception that buyer sentiment has revived gained ground. In April-August 2014-15, the market has grown 4.46 per cent. If the momentum doesn't run out of steam, the year could record better growth than 2013-14 (when passenger vehicle sales fell 6.05 per cent) and 2012-13 (it registered a nominal growth of 2.15 per cent). At the 54th Annual Convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, or SIAM, in New Delhi last week, the mood was distinctly upbeat. Senior executives talked of how acche din are back for the industry.
Buoyed by strong sales in the first five months (up 15.77 per cent to 459,040 units), Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car maker, has scaled up its projection for sales growth this financial year. Its chairman, RC Bhargava, says, "We will surely have a double-digit growth rate this year. We had not expected more than 7 or 8 per cent growth till the general elections, but our sales have grown at an average 16 per cent in the past five months. I will, however, not like to predict whether the rate for full year will be 12 per cent or 16 per cent." Abdul Majeed, partner and leader (automotive practice), PricewaterhouseCoopers, says: "At the beginning of the year, we estimated the passenger vehicle industry will grow 3-5 per cent due to release of pent-up demand. Given the increase seen in sales over the last three-four months, the industry can grow 10-12 per cent. But this can only happen if GDP growth improves to 5.5-6 per cent and inflation moderates. We are waiting to see how the festive season goes before we finalise these estimates."
It is coming
However, a closer look at the sales numbers of automobile manufacturers shows that the much-talked-about turnaround may still be some months away. Data made available by SIAM reveals it is only the bigger car makers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Honda that have registered strong double-digit growth this year. The others are still stuck in low growth and have pinned their hopes on the festive season for a broad-based recovery across segments. While green shoots have appeared for the big boys, others like Mahindra & Mahindra (sales are down 14.03 per cent to 89,546 units), General Motors (sales dropped 33.36 per cent to 24,284), Renault (drop of 32.96 per cent to 17,510 units), Tata Motors (decline of 33.83 per cent to 58,697 units) continue to stutter primarily due to lack of new offerings. It is only recently that Tata Motors launched its new sedan, the Zest. The company has said it has over 10,000 orders for the new model and is expecting sales to pick up from September.
Bhargava believes overall growth in the car market this year will not be higher than the 5-6 per cent predicted earlier. "The growth is not across manufacturers. Some of Maruti Suzuki's new launches helped it grow its sales. But, generally, customers are not willing to take risks; they are playing safe and moving to products that are established and trusted," he informs. Rakesh Srivastava, senior vice-president (marketing & sales), Hyundai India, agrees, "Last two years have been challenging. In the initial phases of revival, we have always seen growth is largely limited to a few established players. With the overall sentiment and fundamentals of the economy improving, growth will percolate (to others). The festive season is a good start for that. We have seen a good start in Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi and we expect the momentum to continue going ahead." Hyundai expects the industry to close the current year with growth in high single digits.
BIKE SALES ARE ZOOMING AHEAD
In the two-wheeler space, the mood is clearly upbeat. The industry has grown 15 per cent to sell 6.6 million units between April and August this year. Market leader Hero MotoCorp has lined up 12 refreshed products for launch to cash in on the festive season that begins later this month. Pawan Munjal, vice-chairman and managing director, Hero MotoCorp, says, “Our sales this time will be better than last year when we sold around 600,000 units during the festive season.”
Rival Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, which has had a good run so far, too is gearing up to cater to demand for the festive season.  Yadvinder Singh Guleria, vice-president (marketing & sales), says: “We have an order backlog of 85,000 units, of which 65,000 are scooters. We are running on full capacity and tweaking our production plans. Customers prefer taking deliveries during the festive season, and we are increasing scooter production by 15-20 per cent to meet their requirements.”
Launches of new models such as the Honda Mobilio and the Hyundai Elite i20 have also helped increase sales during the last few months. The Elite i20 has registered 21,000 bookings within a month of launch in August this year. For Honda India, the newly-launched Mobilio (5,530 units) and the Amaze (9,198 units) helped grow sales by 88 per cent in August. The models contributed nearly 90 per cent to Honda's overall passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market last month. Production of Honda's flagship sedan, the City, has temporarily stalled in August and the vehicle production is being shifted to the company's new facility in Tapukara, Rajasthan. Honda India agrees the growth seen in the first few months has not been shared by all. The company's senior vice-president (marketing & sales), Jnaneswar Sen, says: "The fact remains that people are buying more cars than last year. Growth is not shared by everybody but if the improved sentiments are followed by increase in GDP growth and moderation in inflation, there is enormous headroom to grow."
Honda, which has received bookings for more than 19,000 Mobilios, is planning a second shift at its facility in Tapukara from November to scale up production to 20,000 units per month. The company will roll out the Amaze, Mobilio, CR-V and Brio from its Greater Noida factory, while the Amaze and City will be manufactured in Rajasthan.
Brisk action
Ford, which has lined up four new products for launch in the Indian market over the next 18-20 months to expand its footprint as the market recovers, says the recovery is for real but sustained turnaround in demand may take a few months. Nigel Harris, president, Ford India, says, "The recovery is for real. There are positive signs but the turnaround is not strong enough. There are only four manufacturers, including us, who have seen year-on-year growth so far. Sustained demand growth is still some months away. The new government has been in office only for about 100 days now, people are still waiting. The spike during festive season will be normal and not extra-ordinary."
But even as apprehensions persist regarding the strength of the sales momentum in the domestic market, what has emerged as a clear trend over the last few months is the revival in the demand for petrol cars, particularly in the small car segment. Sumit Sawhney, country CEO and MD, Renault India, says, "What we are seeing is that in the compact space, the demand for petrol products has revived. But in larger vehicles such as SUVs, the demand for diesel options will continue to remain strong." Given the altered dynamics, Maruti Suzuki had decided to temporarily stall the second phase of expansion at its diesel engine manufacturing unit in Gurgaon. The company, however, does not see a dramatic shift back to petrol products either, despite price differentiation between the two fuels coming down substantially. "The diesel shift is not dramatic. It was 62 per cent at its peak, now it is 50.5 per cent. It had gone up from 32 per cent to 62 per cent very swiftly, but the fall has not been at the same rate", Bhargava says. The company is slated to launch two sports utility vehicles over the next two years - both of which will have diesel options. With the companies keeping a close tab on the changing consumer sentiment and sprucing up their line-up, it remains to be seen whether they can bring sales back on track.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Honda is planning to start a third shift at its facility in Tapukara when in fact it's the second shift that the company is looking at. The error is regretted.

SpiceJet tops occupancy for 3rd straight mth...SpiceJet tops flight occupancy figures for the third straight month in August

MUMBAI: Low fare carrier SpiceJet topped flight occupancy figures in the industry for the third straight month in August, although it ceded second position to Jet Airways after ousting it in July.
The carrier managed on average to fill 82.5% of its flights during the month, according to figures from DGCA . In comparison, market leader IndiGo just managed to fill 74.8% of its flights.
SpiceJet has been filling its planes by dint of its repeated offers of rockbottom fares across its network. The airline's rationale as explained recently by its COO Sanjiv Kapoor is that "it's a crime to fly empty seats"
SpiceJet in July posted industry-best load factor figure 79.4% during July. In June too, it had the industry's highest seat occupancy levels at 81.4%.
For the month of August, SpiceJet occupied 19.5% of the market, while Jet Airways together with its subsidiary JetLite regained the number 2 position with a 20.1% market share.
Last month, SpiceJet had become India's number 2 carrier with a 20.9% share while Jet and JetLite were relegated to the number three position a 19.6% share. Since then Jet has been offering aggressive pricing schemes, which experts fear will hamper its margins even as they help fill its planes.

According to Patel, dinner is arranged for a total of 22 VVIPs of both the sides including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "There will be 11 members each from both the sides, taking the total number to 22. Our 11 dignitaries include the prime minister, Gujarat chief minister Anandi Patel and several ministers" said Patel, who inspected the preparations at the Riverfront ahead of Xi's visit on September 17.
Giving details about the schedule, Patel said Xi will land at Ahmedabad airport at 2:30 pm on Wednesday. "Jinping will be greeted by our chief minister, Governor and ministers at the airport where he will also be given the Guard of Honour. He will then be taken to Grand Hyatt hotel... Modi will hold one-to-one talk with Jinping for almost 20 minutes," said Patel.
There will be a business meet and MoUs will be signed at the hotel. Later, Xi is scheduled to visit Sabarmati Ashram, accompanied by Modi.

Kent State University Urban Outfitters Incorporated eBay Inc.
Kent State University and many on the Internet criticized Urban Outfitters Inc. on Monday for selling a sweatshirt with its college logo and what appears to be spattered blood, saying it evoked memories of the 1970 shooting where four students died.
“This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today," the Ohio-based university said in a statement on its website. "We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit.”
Urban Outfitters sells bloody Kent State sweatshirt, quickly apologizes
If you're going to sell a college-branded sweatshirt with what looks a whole lot like bloodstains and bullet holes on it, maybe you don't pick the school with one of the most infamous shootings in history.

Urban Outfitters, which apologized on Twitter, sold the item for $129 on its website as part of an assortment of vintage clothing. It has since sold out. But it is being offered on eBay for a "Buy It Now" price of $2,500.
"It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State in 1970 and we are extremely saddened that this item was perceived as such. The one-of-a-kind item was purchased as part of our sun-faded vintage collection," the company said on Twitter.
Urban Outfitters said the red markings were the result of distressing and "wear and fray." Kent State invited anyone interested in buying the sweatshirt to tour its recently opened May 4 Visitor Center, noting the date when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire, killing four and wounding nine other students during a campus protest of the Vietnam War.
The company said a visit would help them "to gain perspective on what happened 44 years ago and apply its meaning to the future."
@PeterBella How do we know they sold out? UO may very well have lied about this. IF they sold out, perhaps 1 person or organization did so to remove them from the marketplace.

Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its dividend.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent.
Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained.
Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.
"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

ObamaCare may spell healthy buys for IT cosObamaCare may spell healthy buys for IT cos

Mumbai, September 15:  
The Cognizant-TriZetto deal shows that there is growing appetite among software companies to mop up healthcare IT providers despite the deliberations surrounding ObamaCare, industry watchers say.
All indications are that Indian companies, especially the tier-1 players, may loosen the purse strings for acquiring companies that render technology services to payers, hospitals and physicians.
So what’s driving this optimism? “One, the US healthcare sector is a huge industry representing more than 15 per cent of GDP. Two, the healthcare IT sector remains highly fragmented,” said Peter Schumacher, CEO of Value Leadership Group, a management consulting firm.
A recent report by Mercom Capital suggested that there has been an increase in M&A transactions in the health IT sector, with 57 in Q2 compared with 54 in Q1. Health IT management companies saw the most M&A activity, having completed 20 transactions.
"It was a quarter of several milestones. It was the first billion-dollar fundraising quarter for the healthcare IT sector, which has now raised almost $7 billion in venture funding since 2010. M&A deals were also at their highest levels this quarter…,” Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital, said in a press statement dated July 16.
For acquirers, the downside is that healthcare IT companies command steep valuations. “Only time will tell if these bets pay off for shareholders,” said Schumacher.
According to some estimates, about 42 changes have been made to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (popularly called as ObamaCare), ever since it was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010.
However, Harish HV, Partner at Grant Thorton India LLP, believes that changes to ObamaCare may augur well for IT companies as the systems and services will have to be tweaked accordingly.
Interestingly, Indian IT companies have not been as aggressive as their global peers when it comes to healthcare M&A. “Most of the deals have been in sub-$20 million category to acquire niche capabilities,” said Harish. However, things could change with the Cognizant’s multi-billion dollar bash.
“I suspect there will be a many ‘reactive’ deals in healthcare IT, especially from the larger companies,” said Harish.

Inflation at 5-year low  but Rajan nixes rate-cutDipping commodity prices bring inflation down in August
K.R.Srivats
The wholesale price index for August has come in at a five-year low of 3.74 per cent.
Cooling fuel prices too help
New Delhi, Sept 15:  
A sharp fall in global commodity prices had a salutary impact on wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation in August, which hit a five-year low at 3.74 per cent.
Falling food articles inflation — which too hit a five-year low at 5.15 per cent — besides the substantial impact of softening fuel prices bolstered the downward trend.
The WPI of 3.74 per cent for August was lower than 5.19 per cent in July and 6.99 per cent in August last year, official data released on Monday showed.
“International commodity and crude prices have corrected to multi-year lows. The softening in global crude prices is playing out. As much as two-thirds of global prices have an impact on WPI,” Saumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor, State Bank of India Group, told BusinessLine.
Given that core inflation had trended down, one can expect the whole year average for WPI to be around 4-4.5 per cent, Ghosh said. He expects the consumer price index (CPI) for 2014-15 to be around 7.5-7.7 per cent. This average is lower than the 8 per cent target set by the Reserve Bank of India for January 2015.
The declining trajectory in WPI and the CPI-based inflation notwithstanding, the RBI will keep policy rates unchanged on September 30, say economy watchers.
Confederation of Indian Industry Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said “coming shortly before the Monetary Policy, this (falling inflation) should provide the necessary manoeuvring space to the RBI”. FICCI President Sidharth Birla said “This is definitely a good sign”. But prices of food items at the retail end continue to be a cause for concern, he added.
Despite WPI inflation cooling off, the benchmark equity indices were not enthused and plunged 1 per cent on Monday due to disappointing industrial production data and weak global cues.

Vaibhav Choukse: Sweetheart deals that hurt consumersVaibhav Choukse: Sweetheart deals that hurt consumers
Vaibhav Choukse |  Sep 15, 2014 09:46 PM IST
India is among the world's fastest-growing pharma markets, accounting for 25 per cent of the world's generic drug market. The issues of delivering affordable quality health care and stimulating the existing infrastructure have received special attention in the Union Budget of 2014-15. In spite of globalisation, our health care sector is prey to underfunding, bad governance and lack of implementation of policies. Owing to these irregularities, the entire sector is prone to anti-competitive practices. The recent penalties on top Indian generic drug makers (or generics) such as Ranbaxy, Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan) and Lupin by the European Competition Commission (EC) for executing "pay for delay" deals with patent-holder drug makers (or originators) has attracted the attention of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Media reports say the CCI is considering investigating patent settlement deals including the one between Hoffmann-La Roche and Cipla on the lung cancer drug erlotinib.
With industry bodies accentuating the need for out-of-court settlements, generics and originators in India are increasingly resorting to mediation to resolve patent disputes. Mediation does give parties some respite from prolonged and costly judicial processes. But are such settlement terms rational? Paying competitors to stay out of the market at the expense of the consumer has nothing to do with the legitimate protection of intellectual property.
Sweetheart deals: These deals are concluded between generics and originators with the aim of delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines in the market, forcing consumers and patients to continue to pay for expensive drugs. Under competition law, such arrangements are (infamously) known as "pay-for-delay" or "reverse payment settlement" deals. These deals mushroomed as a consequence of avoiding costly and prolonged patent litigation between the originators and generics who would defend and refute, respectively, the "ever-greening" of patents. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), these illegal settlements are estimated to cost US consumers $3.5 billion per year, a figure that will rise to $35 billion over the next 10 years.
Generics make a key contribution to ensuring affordable access to health care for all citizens. Empirical evidence shows that the average price of a drug can drop by 90 per cent in the first two years after the entry of the first generic in the market. For example, in India, Natco Pharma introduced the generic anti-cancer drug at Rs 8,800 as opposed to Bayer's price of Rs 2.8 lakh. The competition by generics is also a dynamic force that encourages pharma companies to continue to invest in R&D since they cannot rely forever on their blockbuster products.
Enforcement heats up on both sides of the Atlantic: Investigating pay-for-delay settlements has been the FTC's top priority since 1990. Under US laws, virtually all patent settlements are reportable to the FTC within 10 days of their execution. Much later, Europe intensified its action by launching a sector inquiry in 2008. In June 2013, arguably, the most significant patent antitrust decision in decades was delivered by the US Supreme Court in FTC versus Actavis, holding that "reverse payment" settlements are subject to antitrust scrutiny.
The ripple effect was felt across the globe. In the past year, EC has imposed a fine of euro 600 million (Rs 4,500 crore) on several pharma companies including Ranbaxy, Unichem, Matrix and Lupin for concluding a series of deals aimed at delaying or blocking the market entry of generic medicine. In August 2014, the Brazilian Competition Authority fined Merck $1.8 million for forming a cartel to restrict the sales of generic medicines in Brazil. The fines are only the tip of the iceberg since companies are now exposed to damages by an affected consumer, which may exceed billions of euros. Competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic including France, the UK, Italy and Canada are investigating similar deals.
The common thread between all these rulings is the involvement of Indian generics in these sweetheart deals.
"Appreciable adverse effect on competition": Indian generics and originators are increasingly resorting to mediation to resolve patent fights with at least 15 settlements in the pipeline including between Hoffman La Roche and Cipla, and Merck and Glenmark. It is, of course, legitimate to apply for patents, enforce them, transfer technologies and settle litigation. But patent settlements should not be misused. The CCI is closely monitoring these settlements and may ask parties to submit their settlement agreements followed by an investigation.
Apart from a complaint or government reference, the CCI has suo motu
powers to investigate any agreement or practice that cause, or are likely to cause, an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC) within India. A case under Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 (anti-competitive agreements) would involve any agreement (formal or oral) between originator and generics restraining the entry of generic drugs. However, a Section 4 (abuse of dominance) case involves a unilateral conduct of an originator misusing the legitimate tools including patent system, buying a competing technology and bribing generics. The recent fines on Indian generics pose major challenges for the CCI. It will be interesting to see whether such deals, although executed outside India, caused AAEC in India, as the CCI has extra-territorial jurisdiction to investigate deals that affect the Indian market. The CCI's antitrust co-operation agreement with the competition authorities of Europe and the US can also play a vital role during investigation.
Pill for thought: While campaigning for the presidency, US President Barack Obama had identified health care reform as a top priority including curbing pay-for-delay deals. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia also strongly objected to such deals and warned the pharma companies to focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract rents from patients. Governments all over the world want to bring down the cost of health care and generic medicine is the way out because they are cheaper for patients and help governments preserve an inclusive and sustainable welfare state. Today, more than half of Indians do not have access to basic medical services. Preserving competition in the pharmaceutical sector is sure to make a real difference to people's lives. This is why antitrust enforcement in the Indian pharma sector should be the top priority for the newly-elected government.

Vaibhav Choukse: Sweetheart deals that hurt consumersVaibhav Choukse: Sweetheart deals that hurt consumers
Vaibhav Choukse |  Sep 15, 2014 09:46 PM IST
India is among the world's fastest-growing pharma markets, accounting for 25 per cent of the world's generic drug market. The issues of delivering affordable quality health care and stimulating the existing infrastructure have received special attention in the Union Budget of 2014-15. In spite of globalisation, our health care sector is prey to underfunding, bad governance and lack of implementation of policies. Owing to these irregularities, the entire sector is prone to anti-competitive practices. The recent penalties on top Indian generic drug makers (or generics) such as Ranbaxy, Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan) and Lupin by the European Competition Commission (EC) for executing "pay for delay" deals with patent-holder drug makers (or originators) has attracted the attention of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Media reports say the CCI is considering investigating patent settlement deals including the one between Hoffmann-La Roche and Cipla on the lung cancer drug erlotinib.
With industry bodies accentuating the need for out-of-court settlements, generics and originators in India are increasingly resorting to mediation to resolve patent disputes. Mediation does give parties some respite from prolonged and costly judicial processes. But are such settlement terms rational? Paying competitors to stay out of the market at the expense of the consumer has nothing to do with the legitimate protection of intellectual property.
Sweetheart deals: These deals are concluded between generics and originators with the aim of delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines in the market, forcing consumers and patients to continue to pay for expensive drugs. Under competition law, such arrangements are (infamously) known as "pay-for-delay" or "reverse payment settlement" deals. These deals mushroomed as a consequence of avoiding costly and prolonged patent litigation between the originators and generics who would defend and refute, respectively, the "ever-greening" of patents. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), these illegal settlements are estimated to cost US consumers $3.5 billion per year, a figure that will rise to $35 billion over the next 10 years.
Generics make a key contribution to ensuring affordable access to health care for all citizens. Empirical evidence shows that the average price of a drug can drop by 90 per cent in the first two years after the entry of the first generic in the market. For example, in India, Natco Pharma introduced the generic anti-cancer drug at Rs 8,800 as opposed to Bayer's price of Rs 2.8 lakh. The competition by generics is also a dynamic force that encourages pharma companies to continue to invest in R&D since they cannot rely forever on their blockbuster products.
Enforcement heats up on both sides of the Atlantic: Investigating pay-for-delay settlements has been the FTC's top priority since 1990. Under US laws, virtually all patent settlements are reportable to the FTC within 10 days of their execution. Much later, Europe intensified its action by launching a sector inquiry in 2008. In June 2013, arguably, the most significant patent antitrust decision in decades was delivered by the US Supreme Court in FTC versus Actavis, holding that "reverse payment" settlements are subject to antitrust scrutiny.
The ripple effect was felt across the globe.

Ajai Shukla: Kashmir floods - Army gains where media failsAjai Shukla: Kashmir floods - Army gains where media fails
Ajai Shukla |  Sep 15, 2014 09:44 PM IST
If perspectives of this month's flood disaster in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), especially the New Orleans-like inundation of Srinagar, were shaped only by national television, this would be a simple story of how the Indian Army again pulled the chestnuts out of the fire. Day after day, this monochromatic narrative played out with minor variations, like the suggestion that Kashmiris should thank the army for saving their undeserving hides.
The insensitivity even took the form of taunting questions to Kashmiris about whether they should now learn to love the army that they criticised so much. Had TV channel editors warned off their half-baked correspondents, the army might have benefited enormously from public gratitude for its selfless work. Instead, there was seething anger on the streets of Srinagar at this crass and tactless milking of nationalism.
The stage on which this disaster played out is littered with protagonists, most of whom did not receive the attention they deserve. First amongst them is the Aam Kashmiri. The national media failed dismally in highlighting the local response, and the rescue effort that locals mounted when their government proved unable to. While the state government has been rightly castigated for evaporating when it was most required, there has been insufficient examination of the pretenders - the separatist leaders who usually waste no time shoving their way into the limelight. The central government has reaped the benefits of the army's good work, but has questions to answer about why its other agencies failed to function, such as the National Disaster Management Agency.
Let us publicly acknowledge the common Kashmiri - an inappropriate term because Srinagar's inhabitants demonstrated in the face of calamity that they are uncommon folk. From Day One of the crisis, even before the army could swing into action, students, mohalla leaders and common folk began moving the marooned to safer locations, using makeshift methods. Initial army efforts benefited from these splendid youngsters, since government servants had simply abandoned their responsibilities. Then, with families separated and people missing, these techno-savvy youngsters used social media to bridge the communication gap. Others established relief camps to receive emergency supplies that began flowing into the valley as the country rallied behind Kashmir.
The local media, even with its publication equipment knocked out by the flood, comprehensively outdid the national media. Taking quickly to social media, local reports provided the first insights into the bravery of locals.
Notwithstanding this grass-roots solidarity, the disaster revealed a traumatised, fractured and leaderless society. Of Kashmir's many internal fault lines, none has emerged as starkly as the abyss between the people and their leaders. This mirrors the street violence of 2008, 2009 and 2010, when leadership slipped into the hands of the people and previously unknown luminaries like Masarat Alam. This month again, the Kashmiri leadership - both elected and separatist - vanished, reappearing much later as a speck in the rear-view mirror, scrambling to invent a rationale for itself.
Not even a disaster so immense should sweep away an entire government structure. If, as Chief Minister Omar Abdullah dramatically declares, Kashmir's police, civil servants and even ministers were themselves struggling to survive, why did they not reappear later, in whatever battered form, for rescue work? When students and local community members could organise rescue work, what reason was there for governance to evaporate? The bleak conclusion is that the J&K government has become a securitised structure, focused only on the physical protection of its leaders and functionaries. Will the J&K government call its absconding functionaries to account? Unlikely, given that the absentees include top bureaucrats and ministers.
In another environment, fundamentalist, even jihadi, elements might have garnered credibility by coming forward when government leadership collapses. This happened during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, when Jamat ud Dawa (the Lashkar-e-Toiba front) was prominent in organising rescue and relief, just as it had done after the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir. Fortunately, the separatist leadership in Kashmir is less dynamic. Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who could have opportunistically gained brownie points, only discredited himself by accusing the army of "staging rescues" for TV cameras. Mr Geelani grossly underestimates the Kashmiri people.
It is hard to dispute that the army has emerged from this disaster with its image enhanced. Yet it is the nature of day-to-day politics in Kashmir that this is only a transient gain. A single fake encounter, a single allegation of rape or molestation and the public dialogue will revert to the injustice of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the alleged brutality of "India's army of occupation". New Delhi must realise that the military's good work in the floods is a mere opportunity for a political outreach to Kashmir. If the moment is not grasped, it will quickly pass.
The most impressive dimension of the army's rescue work was not the 226,000 people rescued; the infant handed out swaddled in a blanket; the grandmother hauled out of swirling waters; or the chopper landing on the roof of a house to convey the frantic inhabitants to safety. The army does those things all year round. Instead, an unusually impressive performance has come from the army's media organisation, the Army Liaison Cell (ALC). Under an imaginative commander, Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan, the ALC transformed its Facebook page and Twitter feed into an information exchange, in which distressed enquiries from across the country were forwarded through a closed WhatsApp group to Srinagar, providing inputs into decisions about where to send rescue parties. Similarly, details of people rescued flowed back from Srinagar, with the ALC disseminating the good news to the world. The army's long-standing weakness has been its public interface. This could be changing.

Sensex regains 27 000 mark  Nifty above 8 100Updated: September 12, 2014 16:35 IST
Sensex regains 27,000 mark, Nifty above 8,100
PTI
stock exchanges
Snapping a three-day losing trend, Sensex on Friday rose 65 points to reclaim 27,000-mark and Nifty gained 20 points to end above 8,100-level led by jump in Cipla, ITC, HDFC shares ahead of industrial output and retail inflation data releases.
The BSE 30-share barometer resumed higher and moved sideways in a range of over 100 points before ending at 27,061.04 — a rise of 65.17 points, or 0.24 per cent. It had lost almost 324 points in previous three sessions on caution due to worries over early Fed rate hikes, among others. On a weekly basis, Sensex logged its fifth straight rise as it inched up 34.30 points.
The 50-issue NSE Nifty reclaimed 8,100 level by recovering 19.80 points, or 0.24 per cent, to end at 8,105.50. It had shed over 88 points in previous three days. On a weekly basis, Nifty also logged its fifth straight rise as it inched up nearly 19 points.
The government is scheduled to release Industrial Production (IIP) data for July and inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) for August 2014 after market hours later on Friday.
The rebound in benchmark indices was led by Cipla, Bharti Airtel, M&M, HDFC, HDFC Bank, HUL, ITC, SBI, Sesa Sterlite and TCS. Overall, 16 counters gained in the 30-scrip index.
Laggards included Hindalco, Sun Pharma, RIL, NTPC, L&T, Infosys, ICICI Bank, CIL, Dr Reddy, BHEL and Tata Power.
Smallcap and midcaps continued their upward journey. The BSE Midcap index gained 0.20 per cent and Smallcap index rose 0.50 per cent on sustained retail investor interest.
Meanwhile, Snowman Logistics made a stellar debut on the NSE with shares surging nearly 70 per cent.
Sectorally, the BSE Healthare Index gained the most by rising 0.74 per cent, followed by Consumer Durables index (0.72 per cent), Auto index (0.64 per cent), FMCG index (0.54 per cent) and Banking index (0.29 per cent).
Globally, Asian indices ended mixed. Europe barometers opened up ahead of a meeting of euro-area Finance Ministers.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs. 433.55 crore on Thursday, as per provisional data.

Chandrababu Naidu holds first paperless cabinet meetNara Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh introduces the first e-Cabinet meeting in Hyderabad on Monday saying a good bye to meeting with papers. (Source: PTI)

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his colleagues held the first e-cabinet meeting on Monday. There was no paper in the room related to the agenda, only tablets and e-devices. The minutes of the meeting were electronically noted, remarks and suggestions were keyed in, power-point presentations were made and after the meeting the ministers walked out without without any papers. Of course, some ministers did carry small notebooks in their pockets, just in case.
The ministers accessed the agenda of the meeting on their devices through an app called e-cabinet. The data is password-protected and cannot be shared or viewed by anyone else. The electronic files that need sharing are hosted on a file-sharing system using FileCloud tool.
After conclusion of the Assembly session on September 7, a camp had been organised for ministers to acquaint them with the e-cabinet app, including how to login using a password, and the file-sharing procedure. But besides the CM, only a few ministers are tech-savvy, and others like Food and Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunita needed a little help to navigate through the electronic documents.
Monday’s meeting was significant as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government completed 100 days on September 8 and this is the first time that a paperless cabinet meeting has been held in the country.
“The cabinet today decided to implement the loan waiver scheme from first week of October, after a few hurdles are taken care of. From October 2, Andhra Pradesh will have power supply 24×7. NTR canteens will be started at a few places, which will provide quality food at subsidised rates from October 2. It has been decided to allot 600 acres to Hero Motocorp in Sri City SEZ in Nellore district,” Minister P Naryana said.
The first important e-document sent across by the CM on Monday was about creating the “Sunrise state of AP” in which he also spelt out his vision to “eliminate poverty, reduce economic and social disparities, leading to a healthy, happy and prosperous society”.
“We have completed 100 days in government. During these crucial days, we have strived hard to formulate policies for our state. We realise that every step of ours is going to lay a strong foundation in scripting the future. In this journey, I appeal to each one of you to walk with me in transforming Andhra Pradesh into ‘Swarnandhra Pradesh’,” Naidu wrote.
The other issues that were discussed included land acquisition for new capital city; visit of committee headed by Urban Development and Municipal Administration Minister P Narayana to three capital cities to study growth models; farm loan waiver; introduction of 20 litres drinking water cans in continued…

ABVP candidate wins with some help from a model  her posterPrint
Kanika Shekhawat; her posters featured Nauheed Cyrusi
Written by Shikha Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 9:45 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:57 am
Thousands of Delhi University students who voted for ABVP candidate Kanika Shekhawat in the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections received a jolt Monday when they realised that the face of the candidate they voted for and the one who came to power aren’t the same.
In the run up to the elections, posters carrying Shekhawat’s name urging students to vote for her were pasted across the city on flyovers, subways and metro pillars, especially near off campus colleges in east and west Delhi. The photo on the posters, however, is that of Indian model and VJ Nauheed Cyrusi.
Students who voted to make Shekhawat DUSU secretary said they felt “cheated”. “These leaders don’t usually visit off campus colleges, so the only way we know them is through posters,” said Rahul Mehra, a student from a west Delhi college.
“Maybe she didn’t think she is photogenic enough. All is fair in war and elections, I guess,” said Swati Sinha, another student.
Shekhawat, however, said she had nothing to do with the posters, and blamed her rival party, the National Student Union of India (NSUI), for the “conspiracy”. “ It has come to my notice that there are some posters of mine bearing images of Nauheed Cyrusi. I am sure this was done by the NSUI so that they could get my nomination cancelled. I have filed a complaint regarding this in the police headquarters. The fact that I have won is a tight slap on their faces,” Shekhawat said.
The NSUI denied the charges. “It is not the culture of the party to unnecessarily target candidates. ABVP has indulged in all kinds of malpractices this election season, and they should own up if their wrongdoing has been noted,” said Roji M John, NSUI national president.
A graduate in political science from Miranda College, Shekhawat is studying MA in Political Science in ARSD college, south campus. Shekhawat, who comes from Rajasthan, has been with the ABVP for the past three years, and won the election by stressing on women-centric issues within the university. “My focus will be to work on issues of women security and empowerment in the university. My immediate priorities will include reopening the women development cell in the university, and creating separate counters for girls to get bus passes,” she had said.
She defeated NSUI’s Amit Teema by 3,022 votes.

Kanika Shekhawat; her posters featured Nauheed Cyrusi

Thousands of Delhi University students who voted for ABVP candidate Kanika Shekhawat in the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections received a jolt Monday when they realised that the face of the candidate they voted for and the one who came to power aren’t the same.
In the run up to the elections, posters carrying Shekhawat’s name urging students to vote for her were pasted across the city on flyovers, subways and metro pillars, especially near off campus colleges in east and west Delhi.

Associations beefing up reserve accounts  report shows0
Among the highlights: Condominium assessments overall rose 3.1 percent, to $256.02 in 2013 from $248.34 in 2012.
When broken out by architectural type, low-rise properties increased assessments 7.8 percent, to $243.38 monthly, and town house properties increased assessments 0.04 percent, to $211.97 monthly. High-rise assessments increased 1.8 percent, to $433.19.
Assessments at high-rise properties tend to be higher than the others because their buildings are more structurally complex and they often hire more staff and security personnel, said Matthew O'Hara, IREM's senior income and expense analysis manager.
A second IREM research tool, the Income/Expense Analysis Online Lab, organizes the yearly data to identify long-term trends. Monthly assessments for all types of condos, for example, jumped 36.8 percent during the past decade. However, they increased a mere 1.1 percent over the last five years.
O'Hara is reluctant to explain the numbers, but he noted that assessment increases were larger before the Great Recession began in 2008.
"The market was much different then," he said.
Condo associations as a whole are building their reserve accounts, funds set aside for future capital repairs and replacements.
Last year, they set aside $555 per unit, almost the same amount as in 2012. Reserve contributions represent 22 percent of total budgets.
When reserve contributions are broken down by architectural type, low-rise properties added $515.62 per unit, and town home properties added $493.27 per unit. High-rises kicked in the most, $921.05.
These amounts represent between one-fifth and one-quarter of the respondents' total budgets.
Associations overall have raised their reserve contributions by 66.5 percent during the last 10 years and by 18.1 percent during the last five years.
As for how associations spent their money last year, their total expenses increased 3.6 percent to $2,517.25 per unit.
The repair and maintenance category, which historically accounts for the largest part of an association's expenses, increased 10.2 percent to $965.37 per unit.
Looking back, repair and maintenance costs increased 21.9 percent over 10 years and 19.2 percent over five years.
"The number was pretty steady for a few years and then started to increase," O'Hara said. "Since 2011, (respondents) have been freeing up some money to spend on repairs."
Fixed expenses, including real estate taxes and insurance, made the biggest one-year jump of all the expense categories by increasing 17.6 percent to $386.98 per unit.
Fixed expenses increased 43.7 percent over 10 years and 5.2 percent over five years.
The responding properties vary in price and age.
Seventy percent reported market value between $90,000 and $300,000. Thirty-two percent have been built since 2000.

Olive Garden Has Been Committing a Culinary Crime Against HumanityA blog about business and economics.

Olive Garden Has Been Committing a Culinary Crime Against Humanity
 
Starboard Value
Hedge fund Starboard Value delivered the mother of all food reviews this week with a 294-page slide presentation tearing apart Darden Restaurants, the struggling parent company of Olive Garden. It charges the Italian chain with all manner of incompetence—from serving too little alcohol to serving too many breadsticks—but the most powerful accusations are reserved for its pasta.
Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.
Here's why: Olive Garden has stopped salting its pasta water.

"According to Darden management, Darden decided to stop salting the water to get an extended warranty on their pots," Starboard, which is in a proxy fight for control over Darden's board, explains. "Pasta is Olive Garden’s core dish and must be prepared properly. This example shows how disconnected Darden management is from restaurant operations and how little regard Darden management has for the guest experience. If you Google 'how to cook pasta,' the first step of Pasta 101 is to salt the water."
Elsewhere, Starboard calls the decision to stop salting "appalling," and concludes that it "results in a mushy, unappealing product that is well below competitors' quality despite similar cost."
For the non-home cooks out there, salting water is essential for correctly flavoring pasta.* Once the noodles are done cooking, you can also use starchy, briny leftover water to prepare a nice pan sauce. It's all basic stuff, and an act of culinary bad faith for any restaurant not to do it.
Anyway, Starboard also says that these days Olive Garden's breadsticks taste like "hot dog buns." Vicious stuff.
*Correction, Sept. 14, 2014: This post originally misstated that salting water helps pasta cook correctly by increasing the liquid's boiling point. Despite the dearly held beliefs of many home cooks, adding a moderate amount of salt does not significantly change the temperature at which water boils.

Too Soon Record-Early Snow Hits Parts Of United Statesreddit
Winter came a little too soon for some Americans this week, as an early-season snow storm moved through parts of the western United States.
And it’s more than just a dusting. The three day average shows several areas of South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming received more than seven inches of snow, according to the Weather Channel. Up to 18 inches was estimated to have fallen in the Bighorn Mountains in northern Wyoming.
North Platte, Nebraska; Rapid City, South Dakota and Cody, Wyoming all reported the earliest snowfall on record this week.  Boulder, Colorado also saw its first snow of the season, with less than an inch reported on Friday morning.
Photos of what some are calling “Snowtember” appeared on social media and local news outlets. While some celebrated the first snow of the season , others lamented that the rest of the country was still enjoying summer while they froze.

Diesel Prices May be Cut amid Sharp Correction in Brent Crude
NDTV | Updated On: September 15, 2014 13:18 (IST)
Gold Falls From Near 3-Week High on Stronger Dollar
A sharp fall in Brent crude prices is likely to benefit Indian consumers as diesel prices may be cut for the first time in seven years on Monday. Brent crude oil held above $98 a barrel on Friday, but concerns over weak demand and plentiful supplies, plus a strong dollar, continued to weigh on prices.
The fall in Brent prices - from $115 per barrel as recently as in June to a two-year low of $96.72 a barrel last week, has nearly wiped out under-recoveries in diesel prices. According to government data, the under-recovery on selling diesel at below market prices was just 0.08 paise per litre for the fortnight beginning September 1.
The relative stability of the rupee against the dollar has also helped bring down the landed cost of crude. India imports three-fourth of its oil needs and a strong rupee helps cut import bill.
The cut in diesel prices will not only help consumers with diesel-powered cars, but will also help bring down inflation in the economy.
Since January 2013, diesel prices have been hiked nearly every month by 50 paise a litre. Over the last 20 months, diesel prices have been hiked 19 times for a total hike of Rs. 11.81 per litre.
In contrast, petrol prices, which are deregulated, have moved up and down. Last month, petrol prices were cut three times, but diesel prices, which are still controlled by the government, kept on rising. Diesel rates were last raised on August 31.

Looming Payment for Australia Coal Assets Hangs Over GVKYou are here: Home Corporates
Looming Payment for Australia Coal Assets Hangs Over GVK
Reuters | Updated On: September 15, 2014 11:44 (IST)
Kotak Bank Buys ING Vysya in Record $2.4 Billion Share Deal
New Delhi/Melbourne:
Indian conglomerate GVK Group faces an October deadline to pay a final $560 million to billionaire Australian miner Gina Rinehart for coal assets it bought in 2011 and has yet to develop in Australia's outback.
The looming payment is the latest headache for GVK on three projects it took over at the height of the coal boom, which industry experts see as uneconomic with coal prices mired at five-year lows and unlikely to be developed for several years.
GVK bought 79 per cent stakes in the Alpha and Alpha West coal projects and a 100 per cent stake in the Kevin's Corner project from Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting for $1.26 billion, agreeing to pay the sum in three stages, with the final payment of $560 million no later than three years after the deal closed.
A senior GVK executive, who spoke on condition he was not named, confirmed the payment is yet to be made and is due next month.
Back in 2011, GVK had hoped the first mine would start producing in 2014, but the company has yet to sign off on a $10 billion plan to build a mine, rail and port as the coal price slump has made it tough to attract funding.
With no income from the project yet, the company faces a tough challenge to fork out $560 million.
"They will have to go to the banks and raise another loan," said Vibhor Singhal, an analyst at Phillip Capital.
"The future of the project is not in jeopardy. However, nothing has started yet, so there is still a question over how they can raise the funds and when they will start mining."
Two people familiar with GVK's Galilee Basin project said given the circumstances, GVK would probably need to renegotiate the payment deadline.
"Any such payments are a commercial matter and will be dealt with accordingly," said Josh Euler, a GVK Resources spokesman, in an emailed statement to Reuters. He declined to comment on how GVK would finance the payment.
Encouraged by huge energy demand in their home market and a shortage of domestic supply, Indian firms like GVK and Adani have spent billions overseas - including in Australia - to mine coal, which they want to ship to India to feed power plants.
But the projects in Australia have come up against a series of hurdles, including environmental opposition to the mines and the expansion of a port near the Great Barrier Reef that will be used to ship the coal.
The GVK Hancock project lies in the Galilee Basin, where massive reserves of coal remain untapped due to the costs of building ports and rail lines to Australia's east coast nearly 500 kms (310 miles) away.
GVK's share in the joint venture GVK Hancock is majority-owned by parent GVK Group, with listed entity GVK Power & Infrastructure owning the remainder.
Shares in GVK, which has a market capitalisation of $330 million, have lost 23 per cent since June 1 against a 2.4 per cent rise in the CNX INFRA Index, as the firm struggles to stem losses, trim its Rs 22,000 crore ($3.63 billion) in debts and the Hancock liabilities weigh on the stock, analysts say.
The listed company made a loss after tax of Rs 83.1 crore in the three months to end-June, widening from a loss of Rs 66.1 crore a year earlier.
A Hancock official did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Are Women Entrepreneurs Better Off Than a Year Agoreddit
During yesterday's second annual NMTC-WIT   Luncheon , a reporter in the audience asked the panelists if things were getting any better for women.
In an article published this year in  Forbes ,  Geri Stengel  predicted that 2014 would be the breakout year for women entrepreneurs. "While the number is still small --  nearly 20 percent of angels in 2012 invested in women-led businesses -- the percentage grew more than 40 percent from the previous year, according to the  Center of Venture Research,  which studies early-stage equity financing for high-growth ventures.
Even venture capitalists have increased their support of women-led companies. It's still paltry, but the percentage of VC deals going to women-led businesses was 13 percent in the first half of 2013. That's nearly a 20 percent jump over 2012, according to  Pitchbook,  a venture-capital research firm." Encouraging statistics that point to better opportunities ahead. But the real question is, as individuals, do we see new possibilities or more of the same status quo?
The answers from the luncheon's diverse panel of men and women, including our own COO at APPCityLife, varied from some panelists seeing no change at all to a few answers that, yes, things have changed. As a female CEO, I am well aware of New York Time 's  annual report that of the top 200 highest paid chief executive officers, only two are women. I've also seen first-hand at least one venture capital door close because of gender. I could easily see the glass as 87 percent to 95 percent empty (the percentage of venture capital currently funneled into male-founded companies in the U.S.).
I choose to see it differently. In my experience over the past year, I've seen both significant and subtle changes that make me believe there is more respect, opportunities, and equality for women founders than ever before. Despite a few fairly disheartening experiences with investors, I've also found passionate support from others.
Our company raised almost $500,000 in angel and family fund investments over the past twelve months, and we've been selected as one of only ten New Mexico companies invited to pitch for a larger round of investment at the upcoming Deal Stream Summit .
Because of our focus on solving problems in the civic space, I've had the incredible privilege of being invited to meet with leaders from around the globe and participate in discussions about civic innovation. And I have yet to find an instance where my gender created any barrier of entry into any office when I've reached out to civic leaders - even in some of the biggest urban centers in the US.
But more than anything else, the topics of discussion at the luncheon were a strong indicator to me of just how far we've come as a community in New Mexico. Last year's luncheon opened with the very uncomfortable topic of the jerk tech apps pitched from the stage of TechCrunch Disrupt . Almost the entire hour of conversation last year was focused on the unfairness, the bias, and the simmering anger of those who'd been passed over, ignored, and not taken seriously simply because of their gender. This year's luncheon definitely covered some of the same challenges -- the funding disadvantage, the challenge at being taken seriously -- but what inspired me most was the questions that had to do with the real meat of running a business. Those questions were new. Topics ranged from the value of having Non Disclosure Agreements and Employment Contracts to implementing sales channels for international businesses. Instead of simply focusing on the problems women face, the panelists were able to share valuable insight and knowledge that were real takeaways for the rest of the crowd.
Perhaps the only reason we were able to focus on questions about business and expertise this year is because we did address the more uncomfortable topics in the past year. But I, for one, am heartened by the notion that as women, perhaps we've come to the place were the conversation can begin to change from how do we let women in at all to how do we help more women grow international, high growth companies.
It's certainly what I and my cofounders have set out to do, and I am inspired by the growing support and opportunities making that more and more possible.

Are Women Entrepreneurs Better Off Than a Year Agoreddit
During yesterday's second annual NMTC-WIT   Luncheon , a reporter in the audience asked the panelists if things were getting any better for women.
In an article published this year in  Forbes ,  Geri Stengel  predicted that 2014 would be the breakout year for women entrepreneurs. "While the number is still small --  nearly 20 percent of angels in 2012 invested in women-led businesses -- the percentage grew more than 40 percent from the previous year, according to the  Center of Venture Research,  which studies early-stage equity financing for high-growth ventures.
Even venture capitalists have increased their support of women-led companies. It's still paltry, but the percentage of VC deals going to women-led businesses was 13 percent in the first half of 2013. That's nearly a 20 percent jump over 2012, according to  Pitchbook,  a venture-capital research firm." Encouraging statistics that point to better opportunities ahead. But the real question is, as individuals, do we see new possibilities or more of the same status quo?
The answers from the luncheon's diverse panel of men and women, including our own COO at APPCityLife, varied from some panelists seeing no change at all to a few answers that, yes, things have changed. As a female CEO, I am well aware of New York Time 's  annual report that of the top 200 highest paid chief executive officers, only two are women. I've also seen first-hand at least one venture capital door close because of gender. I could easily see the glass as 87 percent to 95 percent empty (the percentage of venture capital currently funneled into male-founded companies in the U.S.).
I choose to see it differently. In my experience over the past year, I've seen both significant and subtle changes that make me believe there is more respect, opportunities, and equality for women founders than ever before. Despite a few fairly disheartening experiences with investors, I've also found passionate support from others.
Our company raised almost $500,000 in angel and family fund investments over the past twelve months, and we've been selected as one of only ten New Mexico companies invited to pitch for a larger round of investment at the upcoming Deal Stream Summit .
Because of our focus on solving problems in the civic space, I've had the incredible privilege of being invited to meet with leaders from around the globe and participate in discussions about civic innovation. And I have yet to find an instance where my gender created any barrier of entry into any office when I've reached out to civic leaders - even in some of the biggest urban centers in the US.
But more than anything else, the topics of discussion at the luncheon were a strong indicator to me of just how far we've come as a community in New Mexico. Last year's luncheon opened with the very uncomfortable topic of the jerk tech apps pitched from the stage of TechCrunch Disrupt . Almost the entire hour of conversation last year was focused on the unfairness, the bias, and the simmering anger of those who'd been passed over, ignored, and not taken seriously simply because of their gender.

The impact of institutional decayUpdated: September 15, 2014 00:40 IST
The impact of institutional decay
Krishna Kumar
study abroad
If the new government at the Centre wishes to improve the state of education, institutional recovery will have to be its topmost priority. Other reforms can wait. Universities and undergraduate colleges determine the quality of teachers at all levels from kindergarten upwards
Starting with the latter half of the 19th century, many Indian students went overseas in pursuit of higher education. Some of them later became leaders of the freedom movement. This trend continued after the turn of the century. Gandhi and Nehru studied in England, Ambedkar went to the United States and Lohia and Zakir Hussain acquired their doctoral degrees in Germany. Even today, we notice that thousands of some of our best students go abroad in pursuit of higher education and never return. Not all of them are driven by the attraction of a foreign degree. Before it brings them better income and status, it is the opportunity to study abroad that provides them a more satisfying experience of learning and research than is available in India. It is not merely the personal consequences of having one’s higher education abroad, but also its experience that differs rather sharply from what is available in India.
‘Politics of waiting’
The gap between our universities and those in Europe and North America began to narrow in some cases by the 1980s, but the 1990s reversed the trend. Established policies were ignored, and a new ideology took over. Even as the industrial policy shifted away from quota-permit-inspection raj, the system of education used precisely these means to regulate the burgeoning private-commercial sector. This attempt met with failure and corruption in all areas of professional higher education, including engineering, medicine and teacher training.
Read: Why do Indians want to study abroad?
Institutional decay is a common, national story, but its details differ from State to State. Not one of our 700 universities figures in the list of institutions adjudged the best in the world. This list includes not just the American, European, Australian and Japanese universities, but also some in China, South Africa and even Malaysia. India’s absence in global educational rankings is usually seen as a national embarrassment, but that is hardly the point. What ought to concern us is the impact that institutional decay has on the young. An Ambedkar, a Ramanujan or a Jagadish Chandra Bose hidden in a young mind today would need an American or a European university to identify and nurture it. Let us imagine that such a young person returns to India after completing a doctoral degree. The first thing he or she would have to worry about is getting through the National Eligibility Test (NET) organised twice a year by the University Grants Commission (UGC). This notorious test cannot be negotiated without a lot of cramming. Qualifying in it is an essential condition to get the job of a lecturer (now renamed as assistant professor). Even if the young person we are contemplating manages to qualify in the NET, the challenge of getting a teaching position still remains. In all likelihood, he or she will get an ad hoc position, with a fixed salary and no rights or dignity. Ad hoc teachers cannot freely present their views in staff meetings as their contract is to be renewed every four or six months. They usually teach a lot more than permanent staff, yet they cannot borrow books from a library without a hefty security deposit. An ad hoc appointment can last for years, and it can make the most positive young mind cynical. The “politics of waiting” analysed by Craig Jeffrey in his book on educated unemployment in India is actually quite damaging, both to individuals and to society.
Read: The quality of India's higher education
Deprived of dignity
You can find any number of young men and women across the country who have been teaching for years in vulnerable positions known by various names like “temporary,” “contractual,” “ad hoc” or “guest.” They keep waiting for permanent vacancies to be advertised, but in many parts of India, such advertisements are now a thing of the past. In any case, getting a permanent or tenure post in an Indian university now implies managing a highly complex constellation of favourable factors. These include patronage, contacts, a desirable social background and luck. To these, the UGC has added a maze of quantifiable points. This remarkable device offers the same score whether you publish your work in bogus journals or genuine ones. The same applies when it comes to participation in seminars. Despite all the song and dance of transparency and accountability, the basic processes of selection and appointment are usually quite earthly. It is no wonder then that courts are dragged into giving a stay on appointments so frequently. The difficulties and delays faced in the process of selection and appointments have destroyed the careers of tens of thousands of capable young people. Hundreds of universities and thousands of colleges have also been wrecked in the process.

Downsizing trend
In both higher and school education, the trend to downsize permanent staff started in the early 1990s. Economic reforms formed the background of this trend. Long before the Fifth Pay Commission explicitly ordered a reduction in posts, the process of recruitment of teachers had either been stopped or drastically modified in many States. Apparently, contractual hiring of teachers and reduction of support staff were perceived as a convenient means of meeting the fiscal crisis in many States. Once the number of low-paid, vulnerable teachers grew, they became politically useful for rival political parties and union leaders. Both these processes were quite visible across northern India. In Madhya Pradesh, lecturers have not been recruited since 1993. New courses of various types have been launched, and they are being taught by guest or ad hoc teachers. States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh have followed this trend. In a puzzling case, Delhi University decided to juxtapose its launch of a new four-year undergraduate course with a tacit ban on permanent appointments. The number of ad hoc teachers in Delhi now stands at the astonishing figure of 4,000. At the school level too, Delhi now boasts of 20,000 guest or contract teachers. But Madhya Pradesh has gone farther than any other State to downgrade its teacher workforce. School staff recruited before the 1990s were declared a “dying cadre,” and a new spectrum of low-paid contract teachers replaced it. Political change aroused hope among this new vulnerable cadre, but the policy did not change. Madhya Pradesh was once respected for its robust public system of higher and school education; it now tops national rankings for rape.
Cultural wealth
Education signifies cultural wealth. This wealth consists of thoughtful minds and an ethos shaped by an exchange of ideas, the reading of books and creative activities. The happiness of teachers forms the centre of such an ethos. By denigrating the teacher, India has damaged what capacity its system of education had for producing and conserving cultural wealth. Decay of libraries has contributed to this process. Schools in our country seldom have libraries, but many provincial colleges once boasted of rich, usable libraries. I recall visiting Allahabad’s famous Ewing Christian College as part of an inspection team and discovering to my horror that its famous library had been partitioned. The old collection was locked up; the part accessible to students mostly had guidebooks. Public libraries have also suffered neglect.
The once-prestigious Delhi Public Library is now a shadow of its past glory, with nearly half of its permanent posts lying vacant. Perhaps libraries no more qualify to be a priority in Indian universities and colleges. Adroit planners have endorsed its neglect and shifted the focus to e-resources. These resources are, of course, important, but they cannot substitute the ethos a library creates. In countries ahead of us in education, the maintenance of the library as a special place is regarded as key to inducting the young into a community of knowledge.
If the new government at the Centre wishes to improve the state of education, institutional recovery will have to be its topmost priority. Other reforms can wait. Universities and undergraduate colleges determine the quality of teachers at all levels from kindergarten upwards. No matter where we look, non-appointment has become a culture. Enrolment has increased while institutional capacity has diminished. Even in the richer southern States like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, commercial and political interests have injured the quality of education. If money has indeed been saved by letting vacancies accumulate or by filling them cheaply and by cutting down support staff, this kind of saving has incurred a big price. What has India gained by doing this kind of saving? It has weakened the already limited capacity the system had for serving children. Had Dr. Radhakrishnan — whose name we invoke to honour the profession of teaching — been alive, he would have been startled to see how the nation has treated its teachers.

RBI Chief Calls for Change in Appointment Process in State BanksYou are here: Home Industries
RBI Chief Calls for Cleaning Up of Banking System
Reuters | Updated On: September 15, 2014 22:47 (IST)
RBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
Mumbai: Public sector banks need to improve monitoring of loans and root out "bad apples" and "bad practices," Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Monday, as the sector continues to struggle with bad assets.
In a speech at a banking conference in Mumbai, Mr Rajan also called on public sector banks to stop outsourcing assessments of creditworthiness, and said the lenders needed to better monitor their loan evaluation processes.
"We need better evaluation using in-house skills, not intermediaries. I think one of the problems that has emerged in recent years and in recent scandals is the fact that evaluation has been outsourced," he told the gathered bankers.
"Evaluation is so central to banking, it's impossible to outsource it. It has to be brought back in-house and competency generated. We have to move towards engaged, informed banking and not banking driven by outside intermediaries and middle men."
Mr Rajan further said that public sector banks had "lots of good people" but said the lenders needed to root out "bad apples, bad practices, and weak capabilities".
The RBI supervises state-run banks in India, although the Finance Ministry controls the lenders through its majority stakes.
An economic slowdown in India has hit balance sheets in the sector, with stressed loans - those categorised as bad and restructured - amounting to about 10 per cent of all loans.
Police last month launched a corruption investigation at state-controlled Syndicate Bank Ltd, further raising concerns about weak oversight, graft and politically-directed lending in the sector.
State Bank of India (SBI), however, said the country's largest lender has never used a third party to assess the profile of a corporate borrower.
"SBI has never used a loan appraisal by any intermediary. We have always used our in-house appraisal system," SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.

Oil Hits 26-Month Low Under $97 on Weak China DataRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
London: Brent crude oil fell below $97 per barrel on Monday to its lowest in more than two years as lacklustre economic data from China, the world's top energy consumer, cast a shadow over the outlook for oil demand at a time of abundant supply.
China's factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August, while growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown.
October Brent, due to expire on Monday, fell as low as $96.21 a barrel, its weakest since July 2, 2012. The futures contract recovered to around $96.70 by 1325 GMT (6:55 p.m. in India), down 41 cents.
US crude was down 40 cents at $91.87, after touching $90.63 - near a 16-month low of $90.43 hit last week.
"Struggling global economic growth has resulted in falling growth in global oil demand," PVM oil analyst Tamas Varga said, adding that concerns over conflict in the Middle East, North Africa and Russia had not translated into supply disruptions.
Chinese data, which showed a drop in power generation for the first time in four years, came on the heels of downward revisions in 2014 and 2015 global oil demand growth estimates by the International Energy Agency last week.
On the supply front, Libya's oil production is expected to rise to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in October. Libya was supplying almost nothing to world oil markets four months ago.
Oil ministers from the Middle East Gulf said last week the oil price drop was unlikely to spur action by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) unless crude fell below $85 a barrel.
A rally in the US dollar against major currencies has also helped weaken oil. Investors will be closely watching the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the United States will raise interest rates.
A stronger US currency makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Investors continue to keep an eye on geopolitical tensions for indications of any new threat to supply.
The United States and European Union imposed fresh sanctions on Moscow last week, hampering exploration of Russia's huge Arctic and shale oil reserves and setting rules on tougher financing of existing Russian projects.

Oil Hits 26-Month Low Under $97 on Weak China DataRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
London: Brent crude oil fell below $97 per barrel on Monday to its lowest in more than two years as lacklustre economic data from China, the world's top energy consumer, cast a shadow over the outlook for oil demand at a time of abundant supply.

Marine wounded alongside Medal of Honor recipient featured in new videoBy Dan Lamothe September 15 Follow @danlamothe
When President Obama presented the Medal of Honor this year to Marine Cpl. William Kyle Carpenter, he recalled the way the infantryman attempted to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nick Eufrazio, from the devastating effects of a grenade blast on a roof in Afghanistan.
“When the grenade landed, other Marines in the compound looked up and saw it happen,” Obama said of the Nov. 21, 2010, ambush in which both Marines were grievously injured. “Kyle tried to stand. He lunged forward toward that grenade, and then he disappeared into the blast. Keep in mind, at the time, Kyle was just 21 years old. But in that instant, he fulfilled those words of Scripture: ‘Greater love hath no man than this; that a man lay down his life for his friends.’”
Carpenter’s recovery required dozens of surgeries and years of physical of therapy, and has been well documented as the story of his heroism spread. Eufrazio’s recovery is less known, but also remarkable.
As the new, independent video above shows, he sustained a severe traumatic brain injury that doctors said would prevent him from every speaking again. He still spends much of his time in a wheelchair, but he’s now able communicate freely, and has retained a razor-sharp sense of humor.
“I’m talking now, right?” he says, when asked in the video if he proved doctors wrong.
Nick’s father, Mark, says in the video that his family acknowledges their Marine has changed, but that they have to be positive and focus on the fact that he is still here.
“Things have changed, but you know what? It’s time to change,” the father said. “Again, you do have your days. I don’t think you’re ever going to be away from that. But you heal. I don’t know, everybody is different, and everybody heals in a different way.”
As outlined by Marine Corps Times , the video was produced as part of a project by artist Thi Linh Wernau. It’s called “ You. Are. Beautiful ,” and includes photos and videos featuring numerous veterans.

Olive Garden Defends Unlimited Breadsticks  Because  Italian Generosityreddit
Olive Garden has issued a strongly worded defense of its unlimited salad and breadsticks on Monday, because it had to.
In a 24-slide presentation published Monday , Darden, the owner of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille and others, defended its Italian chain's breadstick and salad strategy, complicated menu and overall “brand renaissance.” The report came just days after Starboard Value, an investment firm, issued a 294-slide presentation eviscerating everything from execs’ use of corporate jets to Olive Garden’s insistence on not salting the pasta water.
Darden called its endless salad and breadsticks an "icon of brand equity," and staunchly defended its tactic of piling tables high with buttery carbs and offering a bottomless bowl of salad soaked in Italian dressing.
"It conveys Italian generosity and our salads have the highest loyalty rating of any menu item based on the menu satisfaction surveys we conduct," the company said in the presentation.
Darden remained silent about its refusal to salt its pasta water. When asked about Olive Garden's pasta water, a Darden spokesperson referred The Huffington Post to the presentation.
Darden's full breadstick and salad defense, circled in red below:
Starboard's take on Olive Garden's salad and breadsticks, from its presentation released Thursday:
Darden and Starboard are currently locked in a battle over the restaurant company's future. Over the past several months, Darden has struggled as customers have ditched sit-down restaurants for fast-casual eateries like Chipotle and Panera Bread. The company reported a loss of $19.3 million on Friday and Olive Garden has had five quarters in a row of declining same-store sales, a key retail metric.
Starboard is urging shareholders to dump all 12 of Darden’s board members at the company’s shareholder meeting on October 10 and replace them with a group of its own nominees. Darden is offering a slate that includes four new independent candidates, four continuing independent candidates and four slots to be filled by Starboard, Matthew Stroud, the company's senior vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.

ABVP candidate wins with some help from a model  herposterPrint
Kanika Shekhawat; her posters featured Nauheed Cyrusi
Written by Shikha Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 9:45 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:57 am
Thousands of Delhi University students who voted for ABVP candidate Kanika Shekhawat in the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections received a jolt Monday when they realised that the face of the candidate they voted for and the one who came to power aren’t the same.
In the run up to the elections, posters carrying Shekhawat’s name urging students to vote for her were pasted across the city on flyovers, subways and metro pillars, especially near off campus colleges in east and west Delhi. The photo on the posters, however, is that of Indian model and VJ Nauheed Cyrusi.
Students who voted to make Shekhawat DUSU secretary said they felt “cheated”. “These leaders don’t usually visit off campus colleges, so the only way we know them is through posters,” said Rahul Mehra, a student from a west Delhi college.
“Maybe she didn’t think she is photogenic enough. All is fair in war and elections, I guess,” said Swati Sinha, another student.
Shekhawat, however, said she had nothing to do with the posters, and blamed her rival party, the National Student Union of India (NSUI), for the “conspiracy”. “ It has come to my notice that there are some posters of mine bearing images of Nauheed Cyrusi. I am sure this was done by the NSUI so that they could get my nomination cancelled. I have filed a complaint regarding this in the police headquarters. The fact that I have won is a tight slap on their faces,” Shekhawat said.
The NSUI denied the charges. “It is not the culture of the party to unnecessarily target candidates. ABVP has indulged in all kinds of malpractices this election season, and they should own up if their wrongdoing has been noted,” said Roji M John, NSUI national president.
A graduate in political science from Miranda College, Shekhawat is studying MA in Political Science in ARSD college, south campus. Shekhawat, who comes from Rajasthan, has been with the ABVP for the past three years, and won the election by stressing on women-centric issues within the university. “My focus will be to work on issues of women security and empowerment in the university. My immediate priorities will include reopening the women development cell in the university, and creating separate counters for girls to get bus passes,” she had said.
She defeated NSUI’s Amit Teema by 3,022 votes.

General Motors confirms at least 19 dead in faulty-ignition crashesprint
General Motors acknowledged on Monday that more people died in crashes linked to its faulty ignitions than the 13 it originally reported, saying 19 death claims were approved for compensation.
In its first report on processing compensation requests for the problem, GM said it had received claims for 125 deaths, another 58 for crippling injuries and 262 for hospitalization stemming from ignition-related accidents.
Of those, it has so far determined 31 claims eligible for compensation, including 19 of the death claims.
GM said Monday that the rest of the claims are either still awaiting review or are judged deficient and needing more documentation, with independent compensation claims expert Kenneth Feinberg in charge of deciding which claims are valid.
In the base plan announced by Feinberg on June 30, for each eligible death claim, GM will pay a minimum $1 million for the victim, $300,000 for the surviving spouse and another $300,000 for each surviving dependent.
Financial and medical treatment compensation of at least $20,000 will also be offered to those with eligible physical injury claims from an accident.
GM set up the program earlier this year after recalling 2.6 million cars over the problem, in which the faulty ignition could turn off power to a car's power steering and safety airbags while it is in motion.
GM knew about the problem for a decade or more, but only took recall action beginning in February, after hundreds of possible accidents and deaths in the affected cars.
Before Monday the largest US automaker had only acknowledged 45 accidents and 13 deaths.
The independent Center for Auto Safety says it has counted more than 300 deaths linked to air bag non-deployment in the GM cars covered by the ignition recall, though it has not tied those to ignition shutdowns.
Lawyers for many victims have already filed a number of class-action suits that could cost the company far more than its promised payouts under the compensation program.
But the program offers victims the promise of earlier payouts. if they give up their right to sue once their claim has been accepted.

Ahead of Xi s India visit  Chinese civilians intrude into LadakhChina, India in border skirmish ahead of Xi visit

The Chinese are at it again. Days before President Xi Jinping's arrival in India, possibly with promises of huge investments, his troops were locked eyeball-to-eyeball last week with Indian security forces, an incident serious enough to be escalated to PM Narendra Modi's office.
The face-off started on September 10 around the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chumar sector of eastern Ladakh, an area which has seen a big increase in Chinese activity this year. According to authoritative government sources, a mixed patrol of Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) troops saw more than 200 Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops with 12 heavy vehicles including cranes, bulldozers and a Hummer trying to level a rivulet and construct a temporary road two kilometres into Indian territory.

According to the army assessment, this was part of a PLA plan to build a road connecting Manza and Kyenjung outposts on the Chinese side of the LAC with Chepzi on the Indian side and install a surveillance camera for area domination and patrolling.
In no mood to allow this, Indian forces confronted the PLA and asked them to withdraw, resulting in no fewer than seven face-offs and even shouting matches. Some 15-20 metres of the temporary track was demolished by the Indian forces during the night of September 10 using heavy equipment.
The latest incident highlights the bitter differences between the two Asian giants despite the likely bonhomie that will mark Xi's first Indian visit. Modi is flying to Ahmedabad to meet Xi, who lands on Wednesday — incidentally the Indian leader's birthday.

More than 130 Indian troops and 230 Chinese were involved in last week's standoff with additional men brought in on both sides as the situation threatened to deteriorate rapidly.  But both sides backed off, with the Chinese deploying two surveillance helicopters to confirm whether the Indian Army troopers had withdrawn to its original position. The whole incident spanned five days.
"The Chinese PLA have increased their troop strength  seven to nine times in Chumar over the past year and are involved in construction activity across the disputed LAC," said a senior South Block official, adding that between January and August, there had been 42 intrusions by the Chinese compared with nine transgressions during the same period last year.
Despite Indian efforts to exchange maps in the disputed eastern Ladakh or western sector with the Chinese side, Beijing has refused to exchange positions since 2002.

Dow edges up but tech weighs on S&P  NasdaqDow, S&P 500 end at records after U.S. data, Intel outlook

The major stock indexes stayed relatively flat Wednesday as big banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced fines for misconduct in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its dividend.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent.
Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained.
Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.
"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

Outreach plans for scientistsUpdated: September 15, 2014 00:11 IST
Outreach plans for scientists
universities and colleges
The decision of the Union Minister of Science and Technology to tap the talent pool of about 6,000 scientists from institutions and centres that come under the umbrella of the Department of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Earth Sciences and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to give lectures to school and college students is a good initiative. Scientists dedicating 12 hours a year each to engage with students to impart scientific knowledge and inculcate a scientific temper in them is bound to go a long way in attracting young talent to science and grooming them. This is a much-needed step as India, like several other countries, faces an alarming situation of steadily decreasing numbers of school students opting for science, and a lack of long-term interest among those who have chosen it. While the intent behind the initiative is good, a coordinated approach by different Ministries would be more effective in achieving the goal. Not involving scientists from the 32 institutions of the Indian Council of Medical Research and similar nodal bodies is unjustified. The lapse becomes all the more glaring as the outreach programmes are to be made mandatory and scientists’ performance is to be evaluated once every three years. As it stands, the initiative could cause resentment among the 6,000 scientists as their counterparts in institutions that come under other nodal agencies face no such compulsions. The government should act swiftly to ensure that all the scientists working in government institutions become involved in student outreach programmes. The metrics of their performance can be used to reward them while assessing their research proposals and promotions.
Several institutions and individuals in the U.S. engage in student outreach programmes and India has a great deal to learn from their experience. We should make sure that as we belatedly embark on this ambitious goal, we conscientiously avoid committing the same mistakes that have been seen elsewhere. The first and foremost pitfall to be avoided is compelling scientists to teach science by replacing teachers. Teaching should be made active rather than passive. Excellent results can be achieved when scientists guide students and teachers to do real science that is open-ended, inquiry-based and driven by a sense of exploration — which only scientists are best-equipped to offer. This will foster critical thinking and imagination and impart skills of scientific investigation. Also, it will arouse children’s curiosity and set off a series of questions prior to, during and after a project. Information and knowledge thus gained remain indelible, and science becomes fun. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s work of guiding students from a handful of engineering colleges to build satellites, which were eventually launched, is one of the best examples of imaginative student outreach programmes.

Mumbai: Information technology (IT) stocks fell by as much as 3% on Thursday after Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. lowered its full year revenue guidance to at least 14% from 16.5% earlier, indicating that the sector may face some challenges ahead.
In intra-day trade, shares of top IT services providers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd fell by 2% on BSE. Wipro Ltd lost 2.87%, HCL Technologies Ltd went down by 2.27%, while Hexaware Technologies Ltd declined 1.27%.
Cognizant had on Wednesday reported a healthy 24% jump in net profit at $371.9 million for the quarter ended 30 June, but struck a cautious note as it lowered the full year revenue guidance.
“Due to weakness at certain clients and longer than anticipated sales cycles for certain large integrated deals, we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year and revising our 2014 revenue guidance to growth of at least 14% over the prior year,” Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza had said.
The New Jersey-based firm, which has big operations in India, also expanded its stock repurchase programme by $500 million to $2 billion.
In India, it has global delivery centres in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Coimbatore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kerala, Kolkata and Pune.
Overall, the company’s revenue for the second quarter of 2014 rose by 16.5% to $2.52 billion, from $2.16 billion a year ago.
At close, TCS fell 1.56% to Rs.2,470.20, Infosys shed 1.68% to Rs.3,514.55, Wipro rose 0.26% to Rs.552.75, HCL Technologies declined 1.58% to Rs.1,520.75, while Hexaware Technologies added 0.60% to Rs.141.90.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.30% lower at 25,589.01 points.

Mangalyaan on track: 5 things to know about India s Mars MissionComments
India's ambitious Mars Orbiter Mission, scheduled to enter the orbit of the Red Planet on September 24, is in the "pink of health" and sending vital information from 211 million km away after covering 95% of its journey, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has said.

“MOM keeps sending us vital information about the health of its various modules and measurements from sensors. This is called Telemetry signal. The telemetry has confirmed that MOM is in the pink of health,” the Isro posted on Twitter on Saturday.
“MOM uses 2.2m High Gain Antenna to send us signals from the present distance of 211 million kilometre,” it added. The Isro said the spacecraft was less than “four million kilometres” away from mars.
Here are 5 things to know about India's Mars Orbiter Mission:
1. Close to its destination
The MOM will perform the crucial Mars orbit insertion (MOI) manoeuvre when it is in the shadow of Mars. With the solar panels not receiving any sunlight, the battery will then supply all the power required for this operation.
The spacecraft is slated to enter the Mars atmosphere on September 24 around 7.30am. Scientists would undertake a challenging task on September 24 when they would restart the onboard liquid engine, which has been in sleep mode for nearly 300 days, for a critical manoeuvre of the spacecraft.
2. MOM will follow MAVEN on Mars
NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft is expected to enter the orbit around Mars on September 21, three days before the MOM.  Both the MOM and the MAVEN were launched into space last year.
3. Objectives
One of the main objectives of the MOM is to develop the technologies required for design, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. The other major objectives of the mission are:
# Deep space communication, navigation, mission planning and management.
# Exploration of Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere by indigenous scientific instruments.
# The MOM will also study the atmosphere of Mars, using a methane gas sniffer. On Earth, methane can have both geological and biological origins, so detecting it on Mars could suggest the presence of Martian microbes, Indian scientists say.
# The mission will also look at Mars' minerology, morphology and surface features.
3. The payloads
Dissambled view of the MOM spacecraft. Pic courtsey: ISRO website
The MOM carries five scientific payloads to observe the Martian surface, atmosphere and exosphere extending up to 80,000 km for a detailed understanding of the evolution of the planet. These payloads consist of a camera, two spectrometers, a radiometer and a photometer. Together, they have a weight of about 15 kg.
# Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP)
The Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP) is an absorption cell photometer. It measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from lyman-alpha emission in the Martian upper atmosphere (typically Exosphere and exobase). Measurement of D/H (Deuterium to Hydrogen abundance Ratio) allows scientists to understand the possible process of loss of water from the planet.
# Mars Color Camera (MCC)
This tri-colour Mars colour camera gives images and information about the surface features and composition of the Martian surface. They are useful to monitor the dynamic events and weather of Mars. The MCC will also be used for probing the two satellites of Mars — Phobos and Deimos. It also provides the context information for other science payloads.
The other components are Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) and  Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS).

4. India’s road to the elite club
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have been successful. A similar mission by China, which beat India to the Moon, failed in 2011. Only the US, Europe, and Russia have sent probes that have orbited or landed on the planet.
If the MOM succeeds at entering the orbit around Mars, India will be the fourth international entity credited with accomplishing that task.
5. Cost and size of the mission
The gold-coloured MOM probe is almost the size of a small car. The cost of the mission is $73 million, less than a sixth of the $455 million earmarked for the Nasa’s MAVEN.

Deadmau5 vs. Disney Is More Than Just A Battle Over Mouse Earsreddit
There's a battle going on between one of the largest media companies in the world and an electronic musician and performer. It's the Deadmau5 vs. Walt Disney Company .
For those of you who don't know who Deadmau5 is (pronounced "deadmouse"), he is a musician whose real name is Joel Zimmerman and lives in Canada. Deadmau5 began to blow up in 2008 after the release of his album "Random Album Title." A huge part of Deadmau5's identity is his logo, which is creating most of his issues recently. To some, his logo (which he has a full helmet of) looks similar to Mickey Mouse, the original and possibly most important character of Disney.
Then the question arises of "why does Disney care all of the sudden?" Simply put, Deadmau5 applied for a trademark of his logo last year and Disney is fighting it. Disney claims that the Deadmau5 logo looks too similar to the silhouette of Mickey Mouse. Deadmau5 chipped in via Twitter, tweeting , "Landed home to some interesting news: looks like Disney officially just filed in opposition of my trademark... lawyer up Mickey."
He then made a stab at Disney and their need to oppose his trademark by saying, "Disney thinks you might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse. That's how stupid they think you are."
To make the situation even more aggressive, Deadmau5 tweeted about how Disney used arguably one of Deadmau5's most well known track "Ghosts n' Stuff" without his permission. What we have now is a standoff between a modern musician who has had his intellectual property used without his permission and a mascot for a whole corporation. While Deadmau5's issue is much more concrete than "it looks like Micky Mouse," Disney has infinitely more money and lawyers to fight this battle.
To add a whole new level to this issue, in all technicality Mickey Mouse SHOULD be public domain. Mickey Mouse, along with a whole slew of original Disney characters, should have entered public domain back in 2003. Walt Disney Company brought a bill to the Senate proposing a 20-year extension of the U.S. copyright limits. This bill was passed and is called (jokingly) the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act."
Deadmau5 is easily one of the most animated artists out there. As opposed to getting gold chains or expensive watches like other successful musicians, he decided to deck out his Ferrari in a brand new paint job and naming the creation a "Purrari." After getting the paintjob, he got a nice little cease-and-desist from yet another large company, Ferrari. Deadmau5 has also done a coffee run with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in the Purrari.
My guess is that Disney will pay Deadmau5 for the infringement on his intellectual property, but then begin a huge battle over the Deadmau5 logo and the similarity between it and Mickey Mouse. Between the Disney and Ferrari Cease-and-desists, I'd say Deadmau5 is getting some amazing "free" publicity. Just so everyone knows, this is what Disney is worried about people getting mixed up...
In the end, this is far more than just a battle over the shape of mouse ears . This is a battle between a company and character that has had a turn in the spotlight for more than long enough, and a modern musician who is trying to make his image and name known. One argument that was brought up during the conversation about the Copyright Extension Act was that it might cause future advancement to be halted because of the copyrights held under individuals for too long. This whole argument between Deadmau5 and Disney ratifies this thought, and proves that for new ideas and concepts to exist, the old cannot hold a grasp on advancement.

The Congress clamped on Monday a gag order to restrain its leaders from speaking out of turn, drawing a sharp response from two defiant leaders Manish Tewari and Rashid Alvi who said it is not time for fighting and humiliating each other.
    
"Only the spokespersons in the linked list are authorised to speak on behalf of the party", Ajai Maken, AICC general secretary and media department chief, said putting out a list of the five senior spokespersons and 13 spokespersons on Twitter.
   
The action was seen in party circles as a snub to party leaders like Tewari and Alvi, though at the AICC briefing, party general secretary and spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed repeatedly denied that the party is voicing any opposition to any particular leader.
   
Ahmed's refrain was that there are 18 designated spokespersons in the party and that it is they who are authorised to give the official line of the party.
   
Certain remarks by Tewari and Alvi were not found in tandem with the party's official line. Moreover, there is talk of an internal rivalry among young leaders for media space.
   
Unfazed by the party's gag order, a defiant Tewari and Alvi said they would continue to express their viewpoints even while maintaining that it's time to fight communalism and "not fight and humiliate" each other.
 
Stung by AICC's diktat, Tewari, who was acting chairman of the media department till sometime ago, hit back as did Alvi who was unceremoniously removed as spokesperson last year.
 
While Tewari said he does not require a "noun or an adjective" with his name to intervene in public discourse, Alvi said Congressmen "should not fight and humiliate each other", suggesting some sort of a rivalry among party leaders for media space.
 
"I ceased to be national spokesperson of the INC in Oct 2012. When I intervene in the public discourse I do as an ordinary Cong worker who has served the party for 34 yrs. There are certain core convictions I believe in.
 
"When they are assaulted, I do not require a noun or a adjective behind my noun to intervene in the public discourse as as a party activist I do not hold myself out as the spokesperson," Tewari said in three successive tweets.

Centre slams Pakistan for backing Hafiz SaeedIndia slams Pak for clean chit to Hafiz Saeed

India hit out at Pakistan on Monday over its remarks that Hafiz Saeed had no case against him, saying he was the “evil” mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks and it was up to Pakistan to bring the chief of terror outfit Jamat-Ud-Dawa (JuD) to book.
The development cast a fresh pall — after the foreign secretary-level talks failure — on the strained India-Pakistan ties that had rekindled hopes of improvement following Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to India during Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony.
“Our views on Hafiz Saeed are very clear. To us, he is the evil mastermind of the attacks on Mumbai and one of the accused in an Indian court for the killings on streets of Mumbai. We have repeatedly asked Pakistan that he should be apprehended and taken through normal judicial process,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.
Read: Hafiz Saeed our national, free to roam around: Pak envoy
“Alas! He has never been arrested on account of 26/11. Therefore.... he is only free because he is a Pakistani citizen,” he added.
His statements came in reaction to Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit's remarks that “Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around.”
Basit also said, “So what is the problem... he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned. Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him.”
The exchange of words came close on the heels of India calling off foreign secretary-level talks with its neighbour last month following Basit’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
There has been a deadlock in dialogues between the two countries after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which armed gunmen unleashed a reign of terror in the city in late November and killed more than 150 people.
Asked about Pakistan’s stand that there was not enough evidence to prove Saeed’s involvement in the Mumbai attacks, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said, “99% evidence in this case is in Pakistan. That is because the entire conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. The planning for this dastardly act was done in Pakistan.”
Recently, Saeed, known for his anti-India tirade and designated as a terrorist by the US, has also accused India of indulging in “water-terrorism”.
He had blamed dams constructed in ‘Indian Kashmir’ as the reason responsible for the flood disaster that had claimed over 200 lives in Pakistan.

Why none of the Roosevelts could be president todayBy Alyssa Rosenberg September 15 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt. (AP Photo)
Last month, inspired by his visit to Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s home at Hyde Park in New York, Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt pondered whether FDR could have been elected today. The same question has occurred to Ken Burns and Geoffrey Wards, whose look at the lives of Theodore, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt began airing on PBS last night and will continue through Saturday evening.
“I think we know too much about people these days. My view, at least with FDR, is I don’t think we would elect him now because of his handicap,” Ward told me when we spoke in July at the Television Critics Association press tour. “They would compete to see who could find him the most pitifully helpless, in footage, and put it on the nightly news.”
Burns agreed with him. “TR is too hot for TV,” he said. “Eleanor, there would be all the issues that women are unfairly saddled with, attractiveness and whatever suitability for national office. I”m afraid that none of them, along with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, couldn’t get out of Iowa.”
It is one thing to decry a newly invasive media culture, or the fact that we still demand female politicians meet standards of attractiveness that have nothing to do with the functioning their jobs. But “The Roosevelts” ought to encourage us to think more broadly about what we deny ourselves when we narrow the path that can lead people to public office at any level.
Today, the Roosevelts’ wealth and the fact that they inherited it might have rendered all three of these remarkable people suspicious to the electorate.
“Though they had before them, in the examples around them, and within their own family, of the ability to spend their lives in leisure, they instead dedicated it to public service and really spent themselves doing that,” Burns suggested. “Because they had wealth and inherited this sense of obligation, we don’t see that anymore. We think we can buy elections rather than inhabit them.”
But Ward thinks that it was precisely that experience of growing up in great comfort that made Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor less awed by (and less dependent on) monied interests.
“They weren’t impressed by money. … They didn’t think that people who made money were any better than anybody else. … They had none of those views,” he told me. “It’s not an accident that FDR’s classmates hated them. He knew them. He sort of tried to be one of the inner circle. But later in his life, I think he really thought they were very limited in their view.”
The family’s tendency toward depression might also have been treated as if it were disqualifying, “Particularly for TR and Eleanor,” Burns said. “They come from the branch where there’s alcoholism and there’s madness and there’s insanity.” These were not fleeting sadnesses — Theodore described his with the operatic term “Black Care.”
But this tendency towards depression spurred an incredible work ethic in Theodore and Eleanor and pushed them towards new experiences and a broader sense of the world, which informed their public service. Theodore went West to become — in keeping with his family money — a rancher rather than a cowpoke and discovered a new sense of self-reliance and physical power. Eleanor traveled constantly as Franklin’s eyes and ears, wrote a syndicated newspaper column and even answered her own correspondence. Ward recalled writing her a letter as a child and getting back a handwritten response.
Without the constraints of contemporary politics, all three Roosevelts were freer to be themselves, and, Burns suggested, to make more authentic connections with voters.
“Politics is a dirty word today, but it’s a knee-jerk dirty word. Politics is the way things work, and they were interested in the way things work, and part of that is getting to know all the different people,” he mused. “Here you had TR, who spoke with a Harvard kind of accent, four eyes, a rather rotund figure, and people loved him because he was himself. … That was true of Franklin Roosevelt. He certainly didn’t look like anyone you knew who was suffering through the Depression.”
But those looks were not determinative. In a story about Franklin Roosevelt that has attained the status of a folktale, a man in Washington breaks down on the street when FDR’s casket passes him by. One of his fellow mourners asks if he knew the late president. “No,” the stricken man says, “but he knew me.”
In refusing to let politicians be human, we have denied ourselves the opportunity to be seen and to be treated the same way.

Why none of the Roosevelts could be president todayBy Alyssa Rosenberg September 15 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg

Last month, inspired by his visit to Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s home at Hyde Park in New York, Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt pondered whether FDR could have been elected today. The same question has occurred to Ken Burns and Geoffrey Wards, whose look at the lives of Theodore, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt began airing on PBS last night and will continue through Saturday evening.
“I think we know too much about people these days. My view, at least with FDR, is I don’t think we would elect him now because of his handicap,” Ward told me when we spoke in July at the Television Critics Association press tour. “They would compete to see who could find him the most pitifully helpless, in footage, and put it on the nightly news.”
Burns agreed with him. “TR is too hot for TV,” he said. “Eleanor, there would be all the issues that women are unfairly saddled with, attractiveness and whatever suitability for national office. I”m afraid that none of them, along with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, couldn’t get out of Iowa.”
It is one thing to decry a newly invasive media culture, or the fact that we still demand female politicians meet standards of attractiveness that have nothing to do with the functioning their jobs. But “The Roosevelts” ought to encourage us to think more broadly about what we deny ourselves when we narrow the path that can lead people to public office at any level.
Today, the Roosevelts’ wealth and the fact that they inherited it might have rendered all three of these remarkable people suspicious to the electorate.
“Though they had before them, in the examples around them, and within their own family, of the ability to spend their lives in leisure, they instead dedicated it to public service and really spent themselves doing that,” Burns suggested. “Because they had wealth and inherited this sense of obligation, we don’t see that anymore. We think we can buy elections rather than inhabit them.”
But Ward thinks that it was precisely that experience of growing up in great comfort that made Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor less awed by (and less dependent on) monied interests.
“They weren’t impressed by money. … They didn’t think that people who made money were any better than anybody else. … They had none of those views,” he told me. “It’s not an accident that FDR’s classmates hated them. He knew them. He sort of tried to be one of the inner circle. But later in his life, I think he really thought they were very limited in their view.”
The family’s tendency toward depression might also have been treated as if it were disqualifying, “Particularly for TR and Eleanor,” Burns said. “They come from the branch where there’s alcoholism and there’s madness and there’s insanity.” These were not fleeting sadnesses — Theodore described his with the operatic term “Black Care.”
But this tendency towards depression spurred an incredible work ethic in Theodore and Eleanor and pushed them towards new experiences and a broader sense of the world, which informed their public service. Theodore went West to become — in keeping with his family money — a rancher rather than a cowpoke and discovered a new sense of self-reliance and physical power. Eleanor traveled constantly as Franklin’s eyes and ears, wrote a syndicated newspaper column and even answered her own correspondence. Ward recalled writing her a letter as a child and getting back a handwritten response.
Without the constraints of contemporary politics, all three Roosevelts were freer to be themselves, and, Burns suggested, to make more authentic connections with voters.
“Politics is a dirty word today, but it’s a knee-jerk dirty word. Politics is the way things work, and they were interested in the way things work, and part of that is getting to know all the different people,” he mused. “Here you had TR, who spoke with a Harvard kind of accent, four eyes, a rather rotund figure, and people loved him because he was himself. … That was true of Franklin Roosevelt. He certainly didn’t look like anyone you knew who was suffering through the Depression.”
But those looks were not determinative. In a story about Franklin Roosevelt that has attained the status of a folktale, a man in Washington breaks down on the street when FDR’s casket passes him by. One of his fellow mourners asks if he knew the late president. “No,” the stricken man says, “but he knew me.”

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his colleagues held the first e-cabinet meeting on Monday. There was no paper in the room related to the agenda, only tablets and e-devices. The minutes of the meeting were electronically noted, remarks and suggestions were keyed in, power-point presentations were made and after the meeting the ministers walked out without without any papers. Of course, some ministers did carry small notebooks in their pockets, just in case.
The ministers accessed the agenda of the meeting on their devices through an app called e-cabinet. The data is password-protected and cannot be shared or viewed by anyone else. The electronic files that need sharing are hosted on a file-sharing system using FileCloud tool.
After conclusion of the Assembly session on September 7, a camp had been organised for ministers to acquaint them with the e-cabinet app, including how to login using a password, and the file-sharing procedure. But besides the CM, only a few ministers are tech-savvy, and others like Food and Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunita needed a little help to navigate through the electronic documents.
Monday’s meeting was significant as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government completed 100 days on September 8 and this is the first time that a paperless cabinet meeting has been held in the country.
“The cabinet today decided to implement the loan waiver scheme from first week of October, after a few hurdles are taken care of. From October 2, Andhra Pradesh will have power supply 24×7. NTR canteens will be started at a few places, which will provide quality food at subsidised rates from October 2. It has been decided to allot 600 acres to Hero Motocorp in Sri City SEZ in Nellore district,” Minister P Naryana said.
The first important e-document sent across by the CM on Monday was about creating the “Sunrise state of AP” in which he also spelt out his vision to “eliminate poverty, reduce economic and social disparities, leading to a healthy, happy and prosperous society”.
“We have completed 100 days in government. During these crucial days, we have strived hard to formulate policies for our state. We realise that every step of ours is going to lay a strong foundation in scripting the future. In this journey, I appeal to each one of you to walk with me in transforming Andhra Pradesh into ‘Swarnandhra Pradesh’,” Naidu wrote.
The other issues that were discussed included land acquisition for new capital city; visit of committee headed by Urban Development and Municipal Administration Minister P Narayana to three capital cities to study growth models; farm loan waiver; introduction of 20 litres drinking water cans in continued…

Thou shalt not speak  Congress tells itsleadersPrint

In an unprecedented move, the Congress on Monday gagged its leaders from airing their views in public. But hours after the party said only the designated spokespersons were “authorised” to speak on “behalf of the party”, two of its visible faces — former union minister Manish Tewari and Rashid Alvi — hit back, saying they would continue to interact with the media.
Hours after the party’s communication department chief Ajay Maken tweeted that “only the spokespersons… are authorised to speak on behalf of the party”, general secretary and spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed drew another red line at the AICC briefing. He said there was no bar on general secretaries talking to the media on issues related to states, implying that they should refrain from talking on issues which do not fall in their domain. He, however, said the direction was not aimed at any particular leader.
Maken even tweeted the list of 18 spokespersons. This list, released in January this year, comprises five senior spokespersons and 13 spokespersons. Alvi is not in the list, and Tewari ceased to be a spokesperson in October 2012 after becoming a union minister.
The move clearly indicates the simmering tension and tussle within the Congress after its crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. On one hand, its leaders have been speaking in different voices on key issues, and on the other, there has been open criticism against the leadership.
In fact, a group of young AICC secretaries went to the extent of asking the elders to refrain from making negative comments in public.
They were upset with general secretary Digvijaya Singh’s suggestion that party vice president Rahul Gandhi should be seen and heard more and the debate triggered by his colleague Janardan Dwivedi’s demand for fixing an age limit for holding active party posts.
Ahmed said it was not a gag order, but a reminder that the 18 designated spokespersons were the only ones authorised to speak on behalf of the party. It is another matter that many of them, including P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sandeep Dikshit, have hardly addressed more than one press conference at the AICC office after the poll defeat.
Sources said Maken’s missive was aimed at Tewari and Alvi who began their mornings with “television bytes”. This eroded the media department’s utility and at times their comments too were not in congruence with the party’s views, they added. Both Tewari and Alvi are former party spokespersons. For instance, Tewari contradicted the party line on the issue of former Chief Justice P Sathasivam’s appointment as Kerala Governor earlier this month, when he said there was “no constitutional or legal bar” on his appointment.
The immediate provocation, sources said, was Tewari and Alvi’s reaction to BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj’s allegation that madrasas across the country were imparting “education of terror” and “love jihad”. The communication department, sources said, had decided that the party should not join issue with Maharaj as it felt these remarks were “orchestrated” and aimed at polarisation.

Agnikalam: The India-Pakistan phenomenon - ready for economic deconstructionAgnikalam: The India-Pakistan phenomenon - ready for economic deconstruction
Agnikalam |  Sep 15, 2014 09:50 PM IST
One of the best recent novels is The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid, a non-resident Pakistani, an NRP so to speak, educated at Princeton and Harvard, employed at one point in New York and now living in London. Of several reviews, the most apt was New Statesman's - "Admirably spare and amazingly exciting" - reflecting the subtle tones that weave the transformation of an upper-class, soft-spoken Pakistani boy educated in America, a janissary for the West, to a bearded protagonist who returns to Pakistan.
But this is not a book review. The reason for its use lies in its final pages where the author emotes against India through the protagonist's voice, derailing his "spare" narrative, and essentially leading to its collapse. Post-9/11, "the threat of war with India reached its highest point ... the heat was too great for an Indian offensive in the desert, then because the monsoon's rains made driving treacherous for Indian tanks in the Punjab". There is no mention of Kargil. "America felt justified in bringing so many deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq, and ... in risking so many more deaths by tacitly using India to pressure Pakistan." Thus, the determining factors for India, the would-be attacker, not to attack are attributed to weather, war strategy and confidence emanating from an Indian-American nexus.
The question is why otherwise enlightened Pakistanis would feel this way. On this side of the Line of Control, or the LoC, their Indian counterparts find it far-fetched that an American-Indian nexus exists, leave alone persists, in light of the extraordinary tensions between them that have historically existed, will continue to exist, and perhaps will intensify in light of recently emerging world economic and political events. The clearly unsuccessful July 31 day-long talks in New Delhi between the foreign ministers of both nations and their open admission to "a lot of homework" to do and "divergence" are its latest evidence. I recall a 2006 visit to a venerable educational institution in Karachi where the faculty and students and persons of eminence embraced my presence even while, in everyone's speech, India was referred as if not doing so publicly was socially indefensible. I remember wondering why we in India are not similarly afflicted despite nuclear capability on both sides.
Because India is, physically and normatively, more expansive. Clearly, India has to play the larger role by persistently extending its hand in cooperation. Prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh tried albeit with very limited success. Despite the latest continual provocations, confidence-building measures have to be deepened by our new prime minister. Indo-Pak trade remains little compared to Indo-Bangla. Figure 1 reveals that while India's imports from Bangladesh and Pakistan have been comparable, the former has surpassed the latter. Further, India's exports have been far higher to Bangladesh than to Pakistan. India's integrated border posts at Attari with Pakistan and Petrapol with Bangladesh that oversee the procedures for trade and security reveal the difference in trade volumes handled despite the former's larger infrastructure to handle expansion. Pakistan's being a considerably smaller economy than India's, it seems natural that India should consider to unilaterally and comprehensively liberalise trade with Pakistan despite the latter's shorter positive list for which it allows trade with India. After all, as figure 2 shows, India's share of trade with Pakistan to its total trade remains minuscule, at 0.7 per cent of its total exports and at 0.1 per cent of its total imports in 2013-14, lower figures than with Bangladesh. Opening up trade with Pakistan fully, to begin, India's exports would jump leading to both pecuniary and non-pecuniary gains. Pakistan's exports should also improve.
A visit to the Wagah border and witnessing the drill and mock show of force by our soldiers, both men and women, arouse feelings of patriotism. Yet the subsequent two shakes of hand by bedecked jawans on both sides of their divisive gates raise the fraternity quotient. Resultant of the statecraft of foreigners and assimilation by our respective leaders of the day, one needs to squint the eyes to view our distancing cousins across the gates. They wave their flag. A wave of hands from this side invites a similar wave of hands from theirs.
Yet great wars have been fought among cousins. On return to the city, one learns that more of our jawans have made the supreme sacrifice for the nation, for our protection.
"Gathered round preceptor Drona, Pandavas in armour bright/Like the five star constellation round the radiant Queen of Night,/Gathered round the proud Duryodhan, dreaded for his exploits done,/All his brave and warlike brothers and preceptor Drona's son./Wrathful sons of Dhritarashtra, born of Kuru's royal race!/Righteous sons of noble Pandu, god-born men of godlike grace!"1
The big placard just inside the Indian border proclaiming "Respect All, Suspect All!" that had earlier invited smiles from passers-by suddenly appears relevant. No doubt our neighbour's ceaseless incursions set more goalposts for our leaders to cross. We could begin by dazzling our neighbour with free trade as a unilateral gesture and wait to see the response. Improbable as it may sound, fully free trade should improve its economic prospects, contain its burgeoning internal strife, hopefully abate its relentless compulsions for attack, and bring positive externalities to our own soil. But it won't be easy. It has to be achieved by leapfrogging hurdles that would rear their head from far corners of the bureaucracy.

Kanchun Kaushal & Rajesh Haldipur: Big Brother & the Indian lawKanchun Kaushal & Rajesh Haldipur: Big Brother & the Indian law
Kanchun Kaushal & Rajesh Haldipur |  Sep 15, 2014 09:48 PM IST
We are living in a brave new world today in which technology has progressed far ahead of our laws, and more troublingly, has even left our concepts of ethics and morality dated. We must shed our blinkers and squarely face the indubitable fact that privacy as we knew it till, say, the early 1980s, is dead. Nothing we say, do or write is hidden. Today, Big Brother is really watching - what George Orwell foretold in his book 1984, has come to pass, albeit a few decades late. What should our laws do about it? The following questions suggest that we need to drag our laws of evidence and criminal and civil procedure codes kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
Are social media posts reliable evidence?
Recently, in a tax case, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal relied on evidence adduced in the form of profiles displayed on a social networking site to conclude that the company had a Permanent Establishment in India that justified taxation of its income earned from India sales to tax in India. This decision was promptly stayed by the high court. Currently, therefore, we are exactly where we were before the tax tribunal stirred this hornet's nest. If profiles on social networking sites became evidence, can Facebook posts, tweets on Twitter and videos on YouTube be far behind?
Social media posts are voluntary - and we should stop kidding ourselves that the posts remain private because one has expressed the intention to keep them so that only ones "friends" can see them. And remember, if one's tweet is retweeted, it no longer remains one's own to delete. Deleting the original post will do nothing to the retweet. Similarly, once Google has indexed a page, it will remain forever on its servers ("cache"), waiting to be served whenever an appropriate search string is put in. Currently, Google's search engine does not index Facebook posts - but Facebook stores them forever, even after one has deleted them from one's "Timeline". We need to go way beyond just exhorting our children, nieces and nephews to be discreet online. We really need to take a collective view (and see that it is reflected in the law) on whether, and to what extent, such posts can be relied on as evidence.
What about our mobile records?
In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Board of India convicted several people of insider trading and conspiring to manipulate prices of a particular scrip in 2008 based on mobile phone tower records that gave away the locations of the accused - and proved that they were in the same vicinity at the same time, when the plan was being hatched/implemented. One should be aware that such data gets recorded routinely - effectively tracking every move one makes. So we are not speaking only of data relating to text messages that we send and receive, the voice calls that we make or receive, and the websites and email accounts that we check out. Mobile companies can even record the websites we visit using the "incognito" mode on our mobile browsers.
Shocked? Don't be. Again, the lesson is this: we must stop kidding ourselves that we can stop the telecom companies from collecting, storing and recording this information. We cannot. Nor can we stop our appearance on uncounted CCTV cameras. But we can, and do need to write much more robust laws and rules about who can access this kind of data/information, and punish violators or people who leak these records. The recent controversy over leaked telephone conversations in India was an excellent opportunity - alas, lost in the political waves it unleashed - for us to collectively debate on this issue, and build robust checks and balances into the protection of mobile data, and write into the law severe deterrent measures for violators.
Digital commerce and banking
Many of us today have virtually stopped writing cheques. We transact in myriad ways - at Points of Sale at merchant establishments, at ATMs, through electronic clearing services, automated bill payment services, National Electronic Funds Transfer, Real Time Gross Settlement, and we use debit/credit cards, over the internet using laptops/desktops and, increasingly, mobiles, with Wi-fi, Bluetooth, near field communication or mobile data network technologies. All these, doubtless, are protected by strong encryption - but one cannot wholly understand why a friend who knows all about banking technologies refuses to use any of these technologies but still writes cheques. Maybe, it has something to do with how familiar one is with these technologies - the digital equivalent of "no man is a hero to his valet".
Recently, we know of a case where a person had to fight with the bank to refund amounts wrongly and inexplicably debited from her account due to two debit card transactions supposedly made from the Cayman Islands to book air tickets on Cayman Air. Such stories cause disquiet. If we have to leapfrog technology and promote inclusiveness in banking, we must consider strengthening our banking laws and cyberlaws - to some extent, this has to happen worldwide - to make it possible to track down, and crack down on, perpetrators of misuse of such payment systems, wherever they may be.

Would shield Snowden from political extradi...Swiss say would shield Edward Snowden from "political" extradition to US
By Reuters | 15 Sep, 2014, 11.09PM IST
The decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum in Switzerland ultimately lies with the government and with justice officials.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ZURICH: Former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden could be granted safe passage in Switzerland if he helped a potential criminal inquiry into US spying there, the Swiss public prosecutor's office said on Monday.
He would probably not be extradited to the United States if Washington asked, but it was also unlikely that he would be granted political asylum, according to a document laying out Switzerland's legal options if Snowden were to visit.
The prosecutor's office, which provided the document to Reuters, stressed the issue was "purely hypothetical" because Snowden had not been invited to come from his current refuge in Russia. It had no further comment.
The document was leaked last week and prompted a lively debate in the Swiss media.
Some German politicians have suggested inviting Snowden to Germany to testify about National Security Agency spying there, but Berlin has ruled that out to avoid a clash with Washington over extraditing him to the United States.
Michael McCaul, Republican head of the US House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, reacted to the Swiss debate by telling the US-based Foreign Policy magazine that Snowden should not be allowed to "trade our intelligence community's sources and methods for safe haven in other countries".
GENEVA CIA ACTIVITIES
According to the three-page Swiss document, "Edward Snowden could be assured of free movement by the federal prosecutor if he cooperated with a criminal investigation" into US spy activities he says he learned about while working in Geneva.
Switzerland would not comply with a US extradition request if he is accused of treason or divulging state secrets because such charges would have a "political character" under Swiss law, the document said.
The guarantee for Snowden's free passage in Switzerland could be trumped by "higher state obligations" such as a treaty, the document said, adding this required more study.
Marcel Bosonnet, Snowden's lawyer in Switzerland, did not comment on the document.
The prosecutors said Snowden was not likely to be granted asylum in Switzerland because he has already been given a three-year residency in Russia last month.
The decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum in Switzerland ultimately lies with the government and with justice officials.
Snowden worked as a computer technician for the Central Intelligence Agency in the US mission to the United Nations in Geneva between 2007 and 2009.
He has told London's Guardian newspaper he had a "formative" experience in the Swiss city when the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home.
When he was arrested, a CIA operative offered to intervene and later recruited the banker, Snowden has claimed. Some Swiss officials have questioned if the incident ever happened.

Uddhavs new-found aggression  as much a necessity as atactic‘BJP wanted to contest 135 seats and I have rejected it. Everything has an alternative. I have conveyed to BJP that I can’t go beyond a point’, Uddhav Thackeray said on Monday.

From all accounts, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray appears an unlikely candidate for a skirmish involving bitter allegations of lust for seats and an impending divorce. The wildlife photographer and nature lover is known to be soft-spoken, friendly with leaders across parties, hardly the hard-nosed negotiator and chief ministerial aspirant he has turned into suddenly.
It is in the shadow of Narendra Modi’s big win this summer that the 54-year-old leader’s public persona has undergone a rapid transformation. Barely weeks after the swearing-in of the union government, fliers and posters emerged in Mumbai that announced: “We won Delhi, now let’s win Maharashtra.” Not only were the images reminiscent of the first Ab Ki Baar Modi Sarkaar posters with the leader striking an aggressive pose with a pointed finger, but the Sena had also dropped all mention of the BJP. Additionally, the party appeared to have borrowed some elements from the Modi-centric BJP campaign, including a call for a “missed call” to a given number to register support.
Then, mid-June, at a party conclave in Mumbai, Shiv Sainiks raised slogans calling for Uddhav to be named the face of the saffron combine’s Maharashtra campaign. This came weeks after the death of the BJP’s Gopinath Munde. Weeks later, the “Utha Maharashtra” campaign of the Shiv Sena emerged. U-Tha, or awaken, is also a NaMo-style moniker for Uddhav Thackeray. And state BJP leaders admitted they were uneasy.
That this unmatched opportunity to seize control of Maharashtra cannot be squandered would certainly have had some bearing on Uddhav’s coming of age. Simultaneously, the party would also have been buoyed by a growing trickle of support for him. “Not only has the Sena cadre accepted Uddhav completely, but the young generation, the social media generation has also shown tremendous support for him,” says Anant Geete, the party’s senior-most parliamentarian. “The youth see him as a young, fresh leader.”
One television channel’s prepoll survey found Uddhav to be the most favoured CM candidate after incumbent CM Prithviraj Chavan, who incidentally scores high on personal popularity. Eighteen per cent of respondents reportedly wanted to see Uddhav as CM.
Geete says Uddhav’s new face is not one of hunger for political power. “By nature his interest is not in power, but in development. He has ideas for Maharashtra, and to execute those he wants the Sena to be in power and he wants to lead it from the front,” Geete tells The Indian Express.
But Uddhav’s “No. 1 state” dream for Maharashtra could not have come overnight. Even the reasoning that the Sena is continued…

The battle within the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance is an old trend now taken to new heights, with each partner asserting its claim to the chief minister’s chair and looking at a seat share the other hasn’t agreed on. Maharashtra’s 288 seats go to polls on October 15.
Dealing with a BJP more confident than ever, the Shiv Sena has been more explicit about the next chief minister, having projected Uddhav Thackeray as the candidate. The party is looking at recapturing the space it had lost to the MNS in 2009, when the latter won 13 seats and damaged the Sena in a dozen others.
The BJP hasn’t announced a CM candidate yet but indicated that the elections will be held under the leadership of state party president Devendra Fadnavis.
Again, the Sena has demanded 150 seats and the BJP 135, which works out to 285 out of 288, but that would not account for the 18 seats or so that have to be left for the smaller allies. “The BJP is making a reasonable demand when it says we will contest 135 out of 288 seats. The demand for an equal number of seats is on electoral merit,” says Fadnavis, referring to the last assembly and Lok Sabha poll trends.
The Sena’s unyielding pitch for the CM’s chair is its means to send a message across to its cadre that the late Bal Thackeray still rules in Maharashtra, not Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “If Modi could set a target of 272 in the Lok Sabha elections, what’s wrong if I have set one of 150 in the assembly polls?” says Uddhav, referring not to the seats to be contested but to those the party wants to win.
Sena MP Sanjay Raut adds, “There cannot be any compromise on the chief minister’s post. The Sena is entitled to it — it was decided almost 25 years ago that the BJP would have the upper hand in Delhi and the Sena in Maharashtra.”
The BJP is no less keen to show who the bigger partner is. Modi and BJP president Amit Shah are said to have conveyed to the state unit that they need to bargain hard with the Sena. Whatever the formula that emerges, each side is intent on ensuring it has the chief minister’s chair. Shah has conveyed to the party that its single mission these elections is to ensure BJP is the largest party. “Maharashtra is a very important state and the BJP cannot give up its claim to the leadership,” he reportedly said at a party meeting.
The alliance has ruled Maharashtra only once, in 1995-99. In 2004, Sena and BJP leaders worked at cross purposes in several constituencies leading to the defeat of each other’s candidates.  continued…

Ahmedabad: Three MoUs related to Gujarat, one of them for setting up an industrial park near Vadodara, will be signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting on September 17.
Xi will start his India visit from on Wednesday and he will be welcomed by Modi, who will turn 64 on that day. Giving details of these MoUs, Finance Minister Saurabh Patel said the agreement to develop industrial parks will be signed between China Development Bank (CDB) and Industrial Extension Bureau (iNDEXTb) of Gujarat Government.
"For the promotion of bilateral trade and setting up industrial parks in Gujarat, especially for electronics and electrical goods, China Development Bank (CDB) will sign an MoU with iNDEXTb on 17th September," he said at a press conference on Sabarmati riverfront on Monday.
Giving details of these MoUs, Finance Minister Saurabh Patel said the agreement to develop industrial parks will be signed between China Development Bank (CDB) and Industrial Extension Bureau (iNDEXTb) of Gujarat Government.

Modi will host a private dinner for the Chinese President on Sabarmati riverfront. "Many Chinese firms are keen to invest in Gujarat. They have also identified some places, like one at Karjan in Vadodara, to set up an industrial park," said Patel.
The other two MoUs are related to services sector. "One MoU will be signed between Guangdong province and Gujarat Government. Another will be between Guangzhou city and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). These MoUs will facilitate exchange of ideas and services between Gujarat and China," said Patel, who was accompanied by Road and Building Minister Nitin Patel at the press meet.
The MoUs will be inked at a luxury hotel. Besides Modi and Xi, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Patel, her Cabinet colleagues, members of Chinese delegation and several top businessmen from the State will attend the event.
"Though businessmen have been invited, no MoU will be signed between them and Chinese Government that day. It is possible that agreements between them will be signed when the Chinese President visits Delhi," said Patel.
Meanwhile, both Ministers took stock of preparations at the riverfront ahead of Xi's visit.

Cognizant to buy US-based TriZetto for $2.7 billionCognizant to buy US-based TriZetto for $2.7 billion
Explained: A vote and a union introubleAlex Salmond (Scotland First Minister, face of ‘Yes’ campaign) and Aalistair Darling (Labour mp, face of ‘Better Together’ campaign)
Written by Aleesha Matharu | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:42 am
What is Scotland voting for? How did it come about?
On September 18, 4.1 million people living in Scotland will vote to answer the question: “Should Scotland be an independent country?”. The result will be determined by a simple majority vote, and is expected to be announced on September 19. British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to a referendum a couple of years ago when he and Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, who is also the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), signed the Edinburgh Agreement that set in motion plans for the vote.
Why do Scots want independence?
In 2011, the pro-independence Scottish National Party won the 2011 Scottish Parliament election by a landslide. The Salmon-led government believes independence would make Scotland one of the world’s richest countries, thanks to its oil wealth. According to him, the Scots should be set free of the “shackles” of a London-based UK parliament.
Who are the main faces?
The official campaigns are ‘Yes Scotland’ (with party support from SNP and Scottish Greens) and the unionist ‘Better Together’ (supported by Labour, Liberal Democrats, and Conservatives). Salmond has been the primary face of the ‘Yes’ campaign, while Alistair Darling, Labour MP and former chancellor of the exchequer, has headed ‘Better Together’.
What powers does the current Scottish government have?
The Scottish Parliament came into existence in 1999, following a “yes” vote in a referendum on “devolving” some powers to a Scottish elected body. The Parliament was initially controlled by the Scottish Labour Party, but since 2007, SNP has held most of the seats. Under the terms of the Scotland Act of 1998, the Scottish government can pursue its own policies in a broad range of areas, including education, health, agriculture and environment. But the Parliament at Westminster controls foreign policy, defence, immigration, most government benefits, corporate regulation, and energy. It also sets most of the tax rates for the UK as a whole.
Will a ‘yes’ vote mean Scotland becomes a country straightaway?
No. There is still a lot of ground to cover. There will be 18 months of negotiation on a range of issues: currency, division of assets and liabilities, borders, movement of people, EU membership, and the distribution of welfare agreements. A declaration of independence would take place on March 24, 2016 (chosen because it was exactly 309 years to this date that the union was signed). An election would follow in May. Until then, current laws will stay.
What happens if people vote ‘no’?
The SNP will remain in office in Edinburgh until the Scottish parliamentary elections in May 2016. All three Westminster parties have promised more devolution to Scotland. But Queen Elizabeth II will still be head of state.
Would independent Scotland be part of the European Union?
There isn’t continued…

Cong  NCP will contest together: SharadPawarPrint
Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:24 am
NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday said the alliance with the Congress will remain in place for the assembly elections on October 15. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar indicated all political parties were veering towards contesting alone, but stressed that a final decision on the Congress-NCP alliance would rest with the top leadership.
The Congress-NCP alliance, now 15 years old, has hit a roadblock over seat-sharing. Following the Lok Sabha election results that saw the NCP winning four seats and the Congress two, the former, which had fielded candidates in 114 of the 288 seats during the assembly polls in 2009, has stepped up pressure on the Congress for an allocation of 144 seats this time around. And the Congress leadership has been unwilling.
Pawar said that the party’s state leadership had not altered its demand for an equal seat share. He added, however, that the decision eventually taken by party seniors will be final. “We do not believe in the concept of a big brother and a little brother in an alliance. After we put across the proposal for 144 seats, there was a phase when there was no discussion between the allies for many days. The ball is now in the court of party seniors on both sides. Whatever decision they take will be acceptable,” Pawar said.
Meanwhile, a day before the NCP hold its first public rally in Western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur, the party on Monday inducted eight sitting Independent legislators.

Rivals have a head start on Cong inHaryanaPrint
Written by Mukesh Bhardwaj , Pragya Kaushika | Chandigarh | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:19 am
The Haryana Congress screening committee had cleared its first list of 22 candidates almost simultaneously with the INLD’s first list of 57. But since then, the Congress list has been stuck with the leadership while the INLD has released a second list of 16 and its 73 candidates are already campaigning.
The BJP, meanwhile, has declared a first list of 43 candidates, who too have hit the trail. Haryana has 90 seats.
The Congress leaders selected but not yet cleared are camping in Delhi rather than campaigning. They are worried that late efforts by a rival could block their way.
CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Ashok Tanwar, bitter rivals, are also spending much of their time in Delhi to ensure their supporters are taken care of. At one meeting, Tanwar questioned Hooda’s efforts to give tickets to MLA whose names have come up in corruption cases, and about tickets being sought for ministers, chief parliamentary secretaries and MLAs who were caught in a sting that apparently showed them demanding money in lieu of change-of-land use certificates. The INLD released clippings purportedly showing 10 such leaders.
A number of other senior leaders have their own lists for approval. Finance Minister Harmohinder Singh Chatha and Revenue Minister Mahender Pratap want tickets for their sons. Irrigation Minister Captain Ajay Singh Yadav who is head of the election committee, wants his son Chiranjeev Yadav fielded in Ahirwal.
An exception is Parliamentary Affairs Minister Randeep Singh Surjewala. Selected  for Kaithal, he is already camping in his constituency, except for one day every week when he has to go to Delhi to fill in as Congress spokesman.
The delay in the list has also delayed the Congress manifesto, which is ready. The INLD, the Haryana Janhit Congress, the Haryana Lokhit Party of Gopal Kanda and the Jan Chetna Party of Venod Sharma have already released theirs.
Back to Brand Modi in both states
New Delhi: Its alliances struggling in both Haryana and Maharashtra, the BJP is likely to refrain from naming a CM candidate in either state and bank solely on the Narendra Modi image, party sources said. For Haryana, for instance, the party leadership has cleared taglines such as Haryana Ke Badle Halat, Chalo Chalein Modi ke Saath. In this state, in fact, where the BJP sees itself as strongly placed, it may eventually decide to contest on its own if an understanding with the Haryana Janhit Congress does not work out. In Maharastra, the BJP is in a battle for dominance with Shiv Sena. Party leaders believe that voters in both states are likely to connect with Modi better than they would with any other leader. The absence of a high-profile BJP leader in either state is another reason why the party has placed all its faith solely in Modi’s image. “It is only after the Lok Sabha elections that we realised how strong our chances to win these two state assemblies are. And our surveys suggest people are still identifying BJP with Modi,” said a senior party leader. continued…

Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its dividend.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent.
Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained.
Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.
"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

How The New York Times Overhyped The Benefits Of FrackingHow The New York Times Overhyped The Benefits Of Fracking

If America's fracking boom is creating a job boom, it's hard to tell.
Maybe you've heard of the miraculous job-creating powers of fracking. President Barack Obama has claimed fracking could create 600,000 jobs. The Chamber of Commerce has declared that fracking creates "millions of jobs." This week, The New York Times gave fracking credit for "a transformation spreading across the heartland of the nation," one "changing the economic calculus for old industries and downtrodden cities alike."
Workers on a natural-gas well in Pennsylvania.
The story focused on a patch of Ohio from Youngstown to Canton, where "entire sectors like manufacturing, hotels, real estate and even law are being reshaped." It suggested fracking -- where you pound rock with water, sand and chemicals to release the natural gas trapped inside, along with rainbows and unicorn farts and American jobs -- had made Ohio's job market better than the rest of America's.
One supposed side benefit of fracking is that energy gets so cheap that factories will just have to start opening up and hiring people in America again. Sounds transformational -- calculus-changing, even. Except for the math part: If you look at actual numbers, it's kind of hard to see the evidence of this boom in any way that matters to humans, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center For Economic And Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank, pointed out.
"The data do not seem consistent with the story told in this article," Baker wrote.
Baker tried and failed to spot the boom in factory jobs in Youngstown:
Zoom out to an even longer-term view , as the Washington Post's Jim Tankersly did, and the picture is even more depressing. It would take 30,000 more jobs to get Youngstown back to where it was in the 1990s, Tankersly pointed out:
Look at all of Youngstown employment, to include all those other industries like hotels and real estate and law, and it's still hard to see the boom:
The NYT made a big deal out of how Ohio's unemployment rate, 5.7 percent, is lower than the national rate of 6.1 percent. But in the boomy boom town of Youngstown, factory employment is 15 percent lower than just before the recession. Total employment is down 5 percent. In contrast, total U.S. employment is at a record high.
The picture's a little better in Canton, but not much. Here are Canton's factory jobs:
And here's total employment in Canton:
Note  how the line turns down at the end of the chart. The boom's not petering out already, is it?
I'm not suggesting the NYT is making stuff up. It quotes a lot of locals who believe in the transformational power of fracking. It is possible that job growth in Ohio might look a whole lot worse if not for fracking. And the fracking boom is still pretty new, having really gotten going in earnest around 2008, in the midst of the recession.
I am suggesting that fracking is not creating nearly enough jobs to justify the environmental havoc it wreaks. It wastes trillions of gallons of water. It pumps toxic chemicals like lead, mercury and uranium into the earth. Some of this stuff, along with byproducts of fracking like methane gas, leaks into the water supply. That may make tap water flammable and certainly hazardous to human health . It causes earthquakes , maybe. It fosters our dependence on fossil fuels, even as greenhouse gases are already being pumped into the atmosphere at record rates .
And, again, it seems to barely move the needle on job growth. The post-recession recovery in jobs in Ohio is indistinguishable from a normal post-recession jobs recovery with or without fracking. For example, note how Youngstown's factory sector is in no better shape than the U.S. factory sector, which also has not enjoyed all that much of a boom:

The Most Educated Countries In The WorldTweet
More people access higher education today than ever before. One in three adults in developed countries held a college degree in 2012, a substantial increase from 2000 when just over one in five had attained such qualifications.
According to data recently released by the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than half of Russian adults held tertiary degrees in 2012 — the equivalent of college degree in the United States — more than in any other country reviewed. Meanwhile, less than 4% of Chinese adults had tertiary qualifications in 2012, less than in any other country. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries with the highest proportion of adults holding a college degree.
Click here to see the most educated countries in the world
The most educated populations tend to be in countries where tertiary education spending is among the highest. Tertiary education spending in six of the most educated countries was higher than the OECD average of $13,957. Spending on tertiary education in the U.S., for example, was $26,021 per student, by far the most in the world.
According to Andreas Schleicher, director for education skills at the OECD, education in the U.S. has become much more expensive, and student debt burdens have reached troubling levels in recent years. Despite these facts, it is still considered a good investment, as U.S. residents with higher degrees earn substantially more than their less educated peers.
It is also a worthwhile investment for the government. Schleicher explained that “taxpayers in the U.S. get $200,000 more out of every graduate than what they actually invested, so it’s a good business for the government as well.”
Despite the value of investing in education, there are exceptions. Korea and the Russian Federation both spent less than $10,000 on tertiary education per student in 2011, considerably lower than the OECD average. Yet, they still have among the most educated populations.
Qualifications do not always translate into stronger skills. While only 1 in 4 of U.S. college graduates reach the top-end of literacy skill, more than 35% reach that level in Finland, Japan, and the Netherlands. As Schleicher explained, “We typically describe people by their formal qualifications, but this data suggests that the skill value of formal qualifications vary considerably across countries.”
Nevertheless, countries with strong higher education systems tend to have higher levels of advanced skills. Roughly 12% of adults across the OECD performed at the highest literacy proficiency level in 2012. The percentage of adults performing at the highest literacy level exceeded that figure in five of the most educated countries.
Those higher skills may be paying off for residents. Only Ireland had an unemployment rate higher than the OECD rate of 7.5% in 2012. According to Schleicher, this relationship may also work the other way around because those who are employed are far more likely to pursue higher education and training. Unfortunately, this means “those who need life-long learning the most actually get the least out of it.”
To identify the most educated countries in the world, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries with the highest proportions of residents aged 25 to 64 with a tertiary education in 2012. These data were included as part of the OECD’s 2014 Education at a Glance report. The countries considered included the 34 OECD member countries, and ten non-OECD nations. Included in the report were data on the proportion of adults completing various levels of education, unemployment rates, as well as public and private education expenditure. We also reviewed data from the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills, which included advanced adult proficiency in both math and reading. The most current figures for education expenditure by country are from 2011.
These are the most educated countries in the world.

Reveal source of documents against CBI director: SCNew Delhi, September 15, 2014

CBI Chief alleged to have met 2G accused at his house
The Supreme Court on Monday told lawyer Prashant Bhushan that it would consider his allegation that CBI Director Ranjit Sinha frequently met people accused in the 2G scam, provided he named the source of his information in a sealed cover.
A Bench comprising Justices H.L. Dattu and S.A. Bobde said the affidavit filed by Mr. Bhushan, as the lawyer for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, whose petition led the court to cancel 122 2G licences, was not in consonance with procedures on how information from whistleblowers should be passed on to the court as evidence. Mr. Bhushan had handed over the visitor register at the CBI chief’s residence and other documents to the court. He said a person dropped them at his house at night.
Bhushan’s charge will tarnish image: CBI chief
In response, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha told the Court that lawyer Prashant Bhushan’s allegation he met several persons accused in the 2G scam should be dismissed with “exemplary costs” as the source of his information was unknown.
“Unless the identity of the whistleblower is known, further proceedings based on the allegations raised would affect the sanctity of this court’s proceedings and the reputation of the CBI director,” senior lawyer Vikas Singh, appearing for Mr. Sinha, contended.
Mr. Bhushan hit back saying, “Why do you want to know the identity of the whistleblower? Identity of the whistleblower needs to given only if the court doubts the authenticity of the evidence.” “If we find there is something hanky-panky, we will order an investigation,” Justice Dattu observed.
The next date of hearing is September 22. Mr. Singh likened Mr. Bhushan’s explanation to someone saying, “I found a packet lying on the road, opened it to find these sensitive documents.” He also alleged that Mr. Bhushan was being “controlled by someone.”
“On the day Mr. Bhushan revealed to the court about the visitor’s register, a newspaper had already reported it that morning. How did they know Mr. Bhushan was going to do exactly that in court,” Mr. Singh asked. The court told Mr. Bhushan to part with the name of whistleblower in a sealed cover.

Senate Republicans Vote to Silence Working AmericansSenate Republicans voted unanimously last week for elections that are competitions of cash, with candidates who amass the most money empowered to shout down opponents.
The GOP rejected elections that are contests of ideas won by candidates offering the best concepts.
Forty-two Republican Senators on Thursday opposed advancing a proposed constitutional amendment called Democracy for All. It would have ended the one percent’s control over elections and politicians. It would have reversed the democracy-destroying Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions by permitting Congress and state legislatures to once again limit campaign spending. Republicans said no because they favor the system that indentures politicians to wealthy benefactors. 
As it stands now, corporations and billionaires may spend unbounded and unreported billions to buy elections. They’re likely to invest $2 billion in this fall’s contests. That’s thanks to the activist, right-wing, so-called justices on the Supreme Court who upended a century of campaign finance law with rulings like Citizens United in 2010 and McCutcheon this year.
The result is that everyone retains their free speech rights, but the wealthy and corporations, who can afford gigantic amplifiers, can now use their money to buy the loudest voice, one that overwhelms and silences those of tens of millions of working Americans. The right-wingers on the Supreme Court said it was fine for the wealthy and corporations to use their money to drown out the pleas of the non-rich. And Senate Republicans agreed last week.
This has made the majority of Americans very, very cynical about politicians and elections. The typical voter knows his or her $5 or $25 or $100 contribution to a candidate can’t compete with the $10,000 or $100,000 or $1 million gifts from corporations and billionaires.
Americans aren’t stupid. They knew what big bucks buy.
They pay for access. The Senator will make time to see the CEO whose corporation donated $250,000. The Senator won’t do the same for the worker who gave $25.
Big bucks also buy votes. Americans believe politicians’ positions on issues are the ones that the biggest benefactors told them to take. In private meetings, of course. A poll by the Opinion Research Corporation in 2012 found that 68 percent of voters , including 71 percent of Republicans, think that a corporation that spends $100,000 to help elect a Congressman could successfully pressure him to change position on proposed legislation.
While Republican politicians celebrate that outcome, most Americans do not. And that includes Republican voters. A poll in July by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research found 73 percent of voters in the 12 most competitive Senate battleground states want the Citizens United ruling reversed, including significant majorities of Republicans.
In 2012, Montana voters passed a referendum by 74 percent telling the red state’s congressional delegation to support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. In purple Colorado, voters passed a similar referendum by 73.8 percent . Fourteen other states, the District of Columbia and 600 communities have called for reversal of Citizens United.
Still, Senate Republicans, groomed by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, ignored the sentiments of the majority of citizens and blocked the Democracy for All amendment. McConnell, who once supported a similar constitutional amendment , now praises unlimited, unregulated, undisclosed campaign contributions. He told a group of fat cat GOP donors in June that he just didn’t know where he’d be without them.
Well, not in office, that’s for sure. He would be in far greener – as in greenbacks – pastures, cleaning up with former House GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who lost his primary this year, then quickly resigned so he could grab $1.8 million as vice chairman at a Wall Street investment bank . Wealthy donors and corporations reward their indentured servants even when they lose elections.
Republicans didn’t always endorse this corruption. Conservative GOP Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party’s nominee for President in 1964, supported campaign finance reform in 1983, saying : “Our nation is facing a crisis of liberty if we do not control campaign expenditures. We must prove that elective office is not for sale. We must convince the public that elected officials are what James Madison intended us to be, agents of the sovereign people, not the hired hands of rich givers.”
Former Sen. Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire who campaigned for reform, wrote after the Citizens United ruling, which he called rash and immoderate: “Supreme Court opinion notwithstanding, corporations are not defined as people under the Constitution, and free speech can hardly be called free when only the rich are heard.”
Another Republican Presidential nominee, John McCain, whose name graced the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform act of 2002, said after it was struck down by the Citizens United ruling: “What the Supreme Court did is a combination of arrogance, naiveté and stupidity the likes of which I have never seen."
Still, McCain joined all of the other Republicans in the Senate Thursday to obstruct a constitutional amendment to fix that problem.  
Sen. Tom Udall, the New Mexico Democrat who proposed the amendment, said he’ll continue to press for its passage. He must because that limitless campaign cash is ruining the American democracy.
Voters know that money tends to corrupt, and infinite money corrupts infinitely.

Wall Street little changed but tech weighs on NasdaqWall Street little changed but tech weighs on Nasdaq
By Reuters | 15 Sep, 2014, 09.19PM IST
US stocks were mixed with the tech sector weighing on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as investors make space for Alibaba's planned debut later this week.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks were mixed on Monday with the tech sector weighing on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as investors make space for Alibaba's planned debut later this week.
Alibaba Group plans to increase the size of its U.S. initial public offering because of "overwhelming" investor demand, people familiar with the deal said, giving a short-lived push to shares of Yahoo, who owns a 23 percent stake.
"Tech has done well lately so there's a little profit taking there and maybe (investors) are making some room for Alibaba," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
The tech sector of the S&P 500 closed at a multi-year record last Thursday.
Forrest also said the market is broadly in a holding pattern ahead of Wednesday's statement after the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee meets, with investors in search of hints as to when the first U.S. rate hike in more than eight years will happen.
The Dow Jones industrial average was rising 15.53 points, or 0.09 percent, to 17,003.04, the S&P 500 was losing 2.57 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,982.97 and the Nasdaq Composite was dropping 41.71 points, or 0.91 percent, to 4,525.89.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Alere Inc, rising 12.63 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Bankrate Inc, down 16.35 percent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Bank of America, up 0.27 percent to $16.84; Nokia Corp, up 2.63 percent to $8.59 and Sprint Corp, down 0.86 percent to $6.94.
On the Nasdaq, Yahoo, up 0.1 percent to $42.94 after earlier rising nearly 3 percent; Avanir Pharma , up 64.4 percent to $11.08; and Apple Inc, up 0.9 percent to $102.60, were among the most actively traded.
Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,826 to 1,065, for a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,011 issues were falling and 595 advancing for a 3.38-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The broad S&P 500 index was posting 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 25 new highs and 56 new lows.

Expect better returns from private sector banks: Geojit BNP ParibasGaurang Shah
('Still believe that from…)
In a chat with ET Now, Gaurang Shah, VP, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, shares his views on some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: PSU banks are making a comeback even though the IIP number and CPI inflation data was not that impressive.
Gaurang Shah: I guess valuation argument is again creeping in in terms of pure comparison between the private sector banks and especially the mid and smaller PSU banks. But we still believe that from an investment angle, there are better returns to be made in the private sector banks.
Though the IIP and WPI data were not really exciting and one could not really put in a case of a rate cut coming through, but in the first calendar quarter in 2015, you would possibly see some initiation by the RBI Governor on rate cuts. That is where the entire banking pack would get excited along with the equity market. There are certain positives in the PSU banks that we are positive on, like the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India and maybe PNB, but maybe we would possibly look at dips to buy into them. The preference however still remains with the private sector, both large as well as midcap banks.
ET Now: So give us three stock ideas that you are still liking and recommending to your clients?
Gaurang Shah: In the banking space?
ET Now: Overall.
Gaurang Shah: If I look at the names in the midcap space, Motherson Sumi has given a fantastic price and volume breakout over the last couple of trading sessions. We were just discussing that petrol and diesel price is cooling off and that should trigger better numbers month on month. That would translate into better earnings capacity for some of the auto ancillary companies like Motherson, which is an OEM company. So we have a positive coverage over there.
Other than that, we continue our positive coverage on Crompton Greaves and Voltas. Although both of these stocks are consolidating, but we do expect the entire sector to do better going forward from here on. In the large cap space, we are bullish on TCS, and with their focus increasing on digital and cloud computing, great numbers should be expected from this vertical.
  ET Now: Does it make sense for any individual investor to buy into a stock like TCS, which has got a market capitalisation of Rs 5 lakh crore? The best case scenario is that stock could give you 30-40% return, but if you are of the view that we are in a bull market, there are lot of stocks which will give you more than 30-40% return in next three years.
Gaurang Shah: You can get better returns in the midcap stocks as well. So if somebody is risk averse, really not having an appetite for choppiness and volatility in the market, it is always better to go with the names which have time tested capability and ability to deliver numbers. If you are risk averse, you can definitely look at names like TCS. You may get a conservative return of 25-30%, but at least you have a stable investment. Those with risk-on mode can definitely look at small and midcap names across the sectors because most of these names are definitely performing well.
So I would say that it depends upon the client's risk appetite and considering the choppiness in the market which will possibly come through. In case the interest rates scenario in the US turns around and dollar strengthens, this augurs well for the IT companies and it is always insulated from inflationary pressures.
ET Now: I am just scratching my head trying to understand that why would somebody buy into United Spirits. We had this chat when they came out with numbers and the stock is up Rs 200 from its result day. Obviously, there is some large ticket buying happening there.
Gaurang Shah: But I am still not convinced. There is a lot of chaos and confusion. We are still waiting for the management's decision to look into it and it seems they are appointing an independent agency to look into these loans that have been doled out by United Spirits to United Holdings and likewise other subsidiary companies of the UB Group. Just because the stock corrected from 2400-2450 to maybe 2250 and now it has pulled back to again 2400 levels should not be a reason to buy.
I am still optimistic about the new management (Diageo). It is a good brand, it is a good company, but the balance sheet has gone amiss in the last two or three quarters and that is what my concern is. So I would wait for clarity to come through and then take a call.

Govt considers closing some loss-making state firms like BSNL  MTNL  AISave precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Government officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals to shut down some loss-making state-owned companies, risking a conflict with powerful trade unions.
After two decades of halting privatisations, the central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level, involved in activities ranging from generating nuclear power to making condoms.
Some of them, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Steel Authority of India are successful, but there are dozens more that have been bleeding cash for decades and kept afloat by budgetary support each year.
On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 245 billion ($4 billion) in 2012/13.
The list includes Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Air India , Hindustan Photofilms and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation, according to a note prepared by the Department of Public Enterprises.
Officials at the department have drawn up proposals to close some.
They include Hindustan Photofilms, a company set up in 1960 to make film rolls and take on the likes of Kodak but declared a sick company in 1996 and recommended for closure by the department in 2003 on the grounds that it could not compete with private players.
The company, based in the southern town of Ottacamund in the Nilgiri hills, went to court and won a stay order on any further proceedings that could lead to its closure.
In 2010 the firm proposed a recovery plan but the government has been sitting on it, with no decision having been made since about the company's future. In the meantime the company's accumulated losses have piled up to 82.32 billion rupees, about 40 times its paid-up capital.
"There is no future for this company in the current environment. It is a fit case for winding down," said a government official at the Department of Public Enterprises, which is overseeing the privatisation of state firms. The official did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The department will be making a presentation at Tuesday's meeting.
The government is also considering a proposal to wind down the watch-making division of HMT Machine Tool Limited after years of losses that have forced it to borrow from the government to pay wages.
UNIONS
Trade unions are opposed to any moves to shut down state firms and the Bharatiya Mazadoor Sangh (BMS), a body affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would work with other unions to block the move.
"We are co-ordinating with all central trade unions on the matter. We are fortunate that all trade unions are on the same page when it comes to these issues," said Vrijesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the BMS .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which took office in May pledging to reignite growth, has embarked on a cautious course of shedding stakes in state firms although it has eschewed big moves.
The government increased its privatisation target for its fiscal year 2014/15 budget to 630 billion rupees from the interim budget's target of 480 billion. The target is nearly four times larger than total government divestments in the past four years.
Officials said the government was also looking for ways to revive some of the sick companies through capital infusion, joint ventures and by bringing in new management.

China President Xi's India Visit
(Syed Akbaruddin said…)
LEH/NEW DELHI: Ahead of President Xi Jinping's visit, Chinese civilians in government vehicles have entered Indian territory in Demchok in Ladakh and are preventing locals from working on an irrigation project there.
The Indian government sought to downplay the reports while maintaining that the boundary question would be discussed with the Chinese side.
"This is true that for the last one week, China is objecting and protesting against the work on an irrigation project in Demchok village which is close to the Line of Actual Control along with China border," Leh Deputy Commissioner Simrandeep Singh said.
He made these comments in the wake of reports that the Chinese Army had entered Indian territory and stopped the local villagers from work on the irrigation project under the NREGA scheme.
Singh said the Chinese civilians from a village across the LAC called 'Toshigang' were brought in government vehicles in large numbers to prevent the locals from working on the project.
Asked to comment on the issue, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said the "brave sentinels" on the border will address any issue that happens on the border. Whatever happens there, they will handle it, he said.
Regarding issues on the table, Akbaruddin said the unresolved issues including the boundary question and questions about the media reports would be addressed.
Meanwhile, the Army refused to comment on the media reports about the villagers.
A Brigadier-level flag meeting was held in Chushul earlier today where the issues of incursions and face-offs are learnt to have been raised by the Indian side.
Sources in the Army Headquarters said the meeting was scheduled earlier and had nothing to do with any specific incident.

Here are the chemicals that make your iPhone workBy Rachel Feltman September 15 Follow @rachelfeltman
The iPhone 6 is almost here and the preorders are piling up. But what do you really know about the insides of the iPhone 6, or any smartphone for that matter? (Courtesy of the American Chemical Society)
The recently announced iPhone model has broken pre-order records, selling 4 million units in 24 hours. That's a lot of phones -- and it takes a lot of elements to keep all those batteries charged and touch screens touchy. In the above video from the American Chemical Society, you can learn about some of the chemical reactions that keep you happily texting.
A smartphone screen, for example, is much more complicated than just a piece of glass. Elements like Praseodymium, Terbium, Yttrium, and Gadolinium help produce vibrant coloration. Meanwhile, Indium, Tin, and Oxygen form a transparent film on the screen, allowing it to conduct electricity. It's the electricity from your skin that allows you to interact with touch displays (which is why many gloves make touchscreen use impossible --   but conductive thread can fix that issue ), so this conductive layer is vital.
And in the iPhone 6, displays boast "ion-strengthened glass," -- a chemical miracle that keeps your car keys from scratching the screen off of your expensive new toy.

Basel III
(Recent amendments by India's…)
NEW DELHI: Rating agency Fitch today said Indian banks will require more than $200 billion (about Rs 12 lakh crore) in fresh capital as they prepare for the full implementation of Basel III capital requirements by March 2019.
The core capital position of the Indian banking system is weaker than that of many Asian banking systems that are also migrating towards the Basel III capital norms, Fitch said in a study.
State-owned banks to account for 85 per cent of the capital requirement. As per the estimates, public sector banks require Rs 2.40 lakh crore equity capital by March 2019.
These banks account for a higher proportion of stressed assets - their stressed assets formed around 12 per cent of total system assets in 2013-14 compared with 10 per cent for the system - and have lower profitability, which have added to their capitalisation pressures.
Private banks are much better positioned in terms of their capital levels and access to markets.
Stressed assets in the Indian banking system are likely to peak around 2014-15, though there will be near-term pressures due to economic slowdown and existing structural and policy- related constraints. Any improvement after that will be gradual, it said.
Banks are likely to raise mostly core equity and additional Tier 1 capital to meet the capital shortfall, it said, adding, capital raising, thus far, has been limited to a few banks, though Fitch expects greater momentum for the latter going forward.
Recent amendments by India's central bank to Basel III capital guidelines have created a more favourable environment for creditors and broadened the pool of investors, it said.
It may take more time for the banks to raise core equity capital because valuations have yet to recover, it added.

Rarely Seen Photos Spotlight The 1970s Social Scene Of South Side Chicagoreddit
To say it was a different time is putting it lightly.
In the 1970s on Chicago's South Side, revelers in their finest packed into nightclubs, dancing the night away to the soulful music of the era while knocking back a drink or three at now-extinct blues clubs like Perv's House, Pepper's Hideout and the High Chaparral.
No one captured the scene better than Chicago photographer Michael L. Abramson . What started as a simple student project during his time at the Illinois Institute of Technology ultimately earned him a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts and catapulted him into a career as a prolific freelance photographer.
While several of the Brassai -esque shots below might look familiar -- some were included in the Grammy-nominated LP set "Light on the South Side," which featured Abramson's photography alongside music from the era -- many are being shown to the public for the very first time thanks to a new exhibition co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Photography and the Columbia College Chicago Library .
The exhibition, titled "Pulse of the Night," comes three years after the photographer's death at the age of 62 but marks the first large-scale public show of his work since 1977.
Below, a preview of some of the work featured in "Pulse of the Night."

Drug makers sign pact with Gilead for cheaper Hepatitis-C drugDrug makers sign pact with Gilead for cheaper Hepatitis-C drug
BS Reporter | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 12:43 AM IST
Seven India-based drug makers – Cipla, Ranbaxy, Mylan, Strides Arcolab, Hetero, Cadila Healthcare and Sequent Scientific — have signed a licensing agreement with Gilead, a multinational drug company, which allows the generic drug makers to manufacture and sell low-priced versions of two new Hepatitis-C products in 91 countries.
Under the agreement, the generic drug manufacturing firms will be free to price their products but will have to pay a royalty of seven per cent on sales to Gilead. The two products are sofosbuvir and its next-generation version which would combine it with the experimental therapy ledipasvir. The second one is currently in the investigation stage.
Gilead also plans to launch sofosbuvir in India under its own branded Sovaldi and price it at $300 a month. The drug, usually prescribed for either three or six months, costs $84,000 for a 12-week course in America.  Under the licensing agreements, the domestic companies will also receive a complete technology transfer for Gilead’s manufacturing process. The 91 countries where the generic versions of Gilead’s drugs will be sold are 54 middle-income and 37 low-middle income countries.
“We need to have enough companies to have a competitive marketplace,” Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice-president, corporate and medical affairs said, while announcing the agreement.
Public health groups and activists were critical of the deal, saying it raised concerns about access of the drug to several countries.
"Gilead's licensing terms fall far short of ensuring widespread affordable access to these new drugs in middle-income countries, where over 70 percent of people with Hepatitis-C live today. Gilead's deal excludes many middle-income countries considered by industry to be profitable emerging markets," said Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis, Medecins Sans Frontieres- Access Campaign.
The critics have also questioned the agreements by generic drug makers because there are no patents on sofosbuvir in India and several other countries. Instead, in various countries, including in India, Gilead is facing pre-grant opposition for its product.

Jet Airways drops business class faresJet Airways drops business class fares
BS Reporter | Mumbai: Sep 16, 2014 12:44 AM IST
Now, you can fly Delhi-Mumbai in a business class at less than Rs 5,000, typically the price of an economy class ticket on the route. Jet Airways has reduced its business class fares on domestic and international routes in a three-day sale as competition heats up in the domestic market.
Vistara, the Tata-Singapore Airlines’ joint venture, is expected to launch operations by next month-end and will compete with Jet Airways for corporate business.
Typically, business class fares on domestic routes are about five times higher than economy class fares. A day before the launch of Jet’s offer, business class seat on the Delhi-Mumbai route, on October 16 was being sold upwards of Rs 25,000. Even GoAir’s business class product was being sold for Rs 16,000.
Under the Jet Airways offer, discounted business class tickets are available for sale from Tuesday to Thursday for travel between October 16 and January 31, 2015.  Jet said the offer was available across its domestic destinations as well as several international routes like Singapore, London, Toronto, Bangkok, Dubai, Hong Kong and Dammam.
An all-inclusive one-way business class fare between Delhi-Mumbai will cost Rs 4,819 while the Mumbai-Delhi fare is priced at Rs 11,581. Similarly, Mumbai-Goa is available for Rs 4,819 and Mumbai-Hyderabad tickets are on offer for Rs 6,918. To give a perspective,  one-way economy class fare between Delhi and Mumbai for travel on Wednesday was priced upwards of Rs 4,699. One-way economy tickets on October 16 are priced upwards of Rs 2,999.
Gaurang Shetty, senior vice-president, commercial, Jet Airways, said, “We are certain that this unique special fare offer will provide exceptional value to our guests and prove to be extremely popular with them.”
A travel industry source said "Generally airlines discount tickets on flights which have light loads. Normally afternoon flights have low occupancy and discounted tickets are offered on such flights."

India Inc s August foreign borrowings up at $5.07 billionIndia Inc's August foreign borrowings up at $5.07 billion

IndusInd Bank cuts interest rate on savings accountsIndusInd Bank cuts interest rate on savings accounts
Neeelasri Barman & Nupur Anand | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:46 AM IST
Private sector lender IndusInd Bank has become the first bank to reduce the interest rate on savings bank accounts, after it was deregulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2011. The lender was also among the few banks which started offering more on savings account when rates were freed.
IndusInd has cut the interest rate on savings account to 4.5 per cent per annum against 5.5 per cent per annum earlier for daily balance less than Rs 1 lakh. The reduction in interest rate came into effect from September 1. The bank has however maintained the rate of 6 per cent per annum for daily balance equal to or greater than Rs 1 lakh. All the public sector banks and all large private banks offer four per cent on savings bank deposits.
IndusInd bank could not be reached for comment.
The bank had raised the rate in October 2011 following deregulation of the savings bank interest rate. Some other banks like YES Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank had also hiked the rate following the deregulation.
YES Bank continues to offer an interest rate of 7 per cent per annum on savings bank account balance of Rs 1 lakh and above while it offers 6 per cent per annum for balance below Rs 1 lakh. Kotak Mahindra Bank, on the other hand, offers 6 per cent interest per annum on savings account balance over Rs 1 lakh and 5.5 per cent per annum on balance up to Rs 1 lakh.
After the hike in interest rate on savings deposit, these banks had recorded impressive growth in their savings deposits. In fact, another private sector lender, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, has recently increased its savings bank interest rate to five per cent for accounts with a balance of Rs 1 lakh and above.
Banking analysts believe it is not easy to make money by offering a higher rate on the savings accounts. "The reason why despite the deregulation several banks have not increased the rate is because the economics don't always work out and that is why several banks have stayed away from increasing the rate," said an analyst.

Govt okays R930-cr scheme to boost capital goodssectorPrint
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:11 am
Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to “Make in India”, the government on Monday approved a Rs 930 crore scheme to enhance the competitiveness of the capital goods sector.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs that is chaired by the Prime Minister.
“This scheme, on its implementation, would attempt to make the Indian capital goods sector globally competitive,” said an official release after the meeting, adding that sub sectors that would be covered under the scheme include machine tools, textile machinery, construction and mining machinery, and process plant machinery.
The move comes at a time when the Prime Minister is keen to turn India into a manufacturing hub and would also give a fillip to capital goods production that contracted 3.8 per cent in July this year. The sector however provides nine to 12 per cent of the total manufacturing value added. The consumption of capital goods constitutes a constant share of 17-21 per cent of the total gross domestic investment in the country.
To be implemented during the 12th and 13th Plan period, the scheme would address the issue of technological depth creation in the capital goods sector, besides creating common industrial facility centres.
It would have five components including creation of advanced centres of excellence for R&D and technology development, integrated industrial infrastructure facilities or machine tool parks and setting up common engineering facility centre for textile machinery. It would also include testing and certification centre for earth moving machineries and setting up of a technology acquisition fund under the Technology Acquisition Fund Programme (TAFP) to help the capital goods industry to acquire and assimilate specific technologies.
“The scheme has an estimated outlay of Rs 930.96 crore. The gross budgetary support from the government for the scheme would be Rs 581.22 crore and the balance Rs 349.74 crore would be contributed by the stakeholder industries,” said the release.
‘CCEA clears R4,754-cr power transmission scheme’
New Delhi: The government on Monday cleared a scheme for strengthening power transmission in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim at a cost of Rs 4,754.2 crore. “ The Comprehensive Scheme for Strengthening of Transmission & Distribution Systems  in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim is to be taken up under a new Central Sector Plan Scheme of ministry of power,” said an official release after the meeting of the CCEA.
Pointing out that the intra-state transmission and distribution systems in the North-Eastern states are very weak, the release noted, “Presently, 5 out of 20 districts in Arunachal Pradesh are connected to the transmission network.” ENS

Reviewing proposal to ease exit policy: RoadministryPrint
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:10 am
Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said his ministry was reviewing a proposal to further ease the exit policy for the sector, as demanded by the highway builders’ association and supported strongly by the National Highways Authority of India. “(NHAI) has requested us to review the exit policy… talks are going on and soon, we will take it up for cabinet consideration,” Gadkari said at a press conference.
The move comes after NHAI chairman RP Singh wrote to Vijay Chhibber, secretary at the ministry of road transport and highways, a week ago, expressing his concern on the lingering uncertainty over a proposal to allow developers to fully exit completed projects. NHAI had asked that the developers be allowed to exit completely from the projects which were awarded before 2009 and if the policy is implemented at the earliest, then stuck equity in a clutch of deals that private equity funds, corporates and foreign pension funds have either already clinched or are negotiating with incumbent developers could be freed up for future projects. Currently, it is mandatory for developers to hold a minimum of 26% equity in the projects awarded before 2009.
Gadkari said the Centre wants to sign deals with states to ensure that pending road projects in various states are brought under fast-track implementation.
“There are projects stalled in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. I shall meet the CMs of these states to discuss issues relating to the projects and see that bottlenecks are removed. Without states’ cooperation, the Centre cannot implement highway, roads and port projects. We want to sign support agreements to ensure clarity on the areas of cooperation between the Centre and the states in matters of implementing projects.” FE

Will seek consensus before amending Land AcquisitionActPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:09 am
Assuring that the government will first evolve a political consensus before bringing about any changes to the new Land Acquisition Act, Rural Development minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said there were “contradictory views” emerging within the parties that want changes to the legislation.
“The issue is the microscopic minority leaders sitting in Delhi. Their practical chief ministers are saying something. They are giving in writing (suggested changes). These people (microscopic minority leaders) are saying something else. I am confused,” Gadkari said when asked about the government’s efforts to bring changes to the Act.
The Union Minister was addressing a press conference to outline his ministry’s initiatives in the first 100 days of this government.
He, however, made it clear the government would take all political parties in confidence and evolve a consensus before changes are brought in. He also clarified there would be no compromise on clauses related to compensation and rehabilitation and resettlement.
“There is no question of reducing compensation package for farmers whose land is acquired for projects, we will try to increase it,” Gadkari said. “Leaders from every political party were telling me in writing to bring changes in the Act… I wish to make it clear that whenever there will be a consensus on the matter, then the government will take a decision. There is no general consensus on the issue right now,” he said, adding parties that had passed the Act in Parliament last year now wanted some changes.

Tax avoidance  global growth to top this weeks G20agendaPrint
Written by Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:06 am
Amidst expectations of modest global growth this year as well, finance ministers of G20 countries are set to discuss measures to improve economic growth when they meet later this week in Australia.
“The week recovery in global growth is one of the crucial issues before the finance ministers and revised growth strategies will be discussed by member countries,” said an official familiar with the development, adding that India would highlight its measures in the Budget to given an impetus to the economy.
“This is the first meeting of the G20 finance ministers since the new government has been formed in India. The Budget too has been presented and we will list out policy measures announced in the Budget to improve growth,” said the official.
India is also expected to take up issues of black money stashed abroad as well as the issue of finding a permanent solution on food subsidies in the WTO at the meet, said a second official.
“Tax avoidance is one of the key issues at the G20 meet where a timeline for implementing the common reporting standards will also be finalised. So it will be the perfect platform for India to raise the issue of black money stashed abroad in countries like Switzerland,” said the official.
The G20 finance ministers summit is scheduled to be held at Cairns, Australia on September 20-21. India’s G20 delegation will be led by minister of state for commerce and industry (independent charge) and finance Nirmala Sitharaman, who will be accompanied by finance secretary Arvind Mayaram and senior finance ministry officials.
The discussions at the Summit are crucial and will lead up to the meeting of heads of states of G20 countries at Brisbane in November. The G-20 finance minsters are expected to discuss concrete measures that can be taken to boost global GDP by an additional two per cent by 2018. The issue was also earlier deliberated at the G20 deputies meeting in June this year as well.

SFIO finds Saradha siphoned off R2 500 cr; money trailestablishedPrint
Written by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:04 am
The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has found that the Saradha group of companies siphoned off over Rs 2,500 crore by running several chit funds and collective investment schemes, duping lakhs of small investors lured by promising astronomically-high returns on their deposits.
A source told The Indian Express that “the SFIO has established the money trail of amount worth Rs 2,500 crore which was siphoned off by the group companies for investing in unlawful activities”.
The source said that the SFIO, the investigating arm of the ministry of corporate affairs, has found several violations of the Companies Act 1956, mainly Section 58 A and 628 pertaining to public deposits and false statements, along with violations pertaining to negligence by auditors and directors.
According to Section 58 A, deposits from public can not be invited without issuing an advertisement while the Centre prescribes the limits, manner and conditions subject to which deposits may be invited. Section 628 deals with penalty for false statements including any return, report, certificate, balance sheet, and prospectus.
“According to the modus operandi, daily collections were made by gathering money from very small, largely rural, investors. The agents who made the collections were paid off handsomely for their work. The money was then apportioned to 14 group companies with the help of a software developed by a private company specifically for this purpose,” the source said.
Violations pertaining to Indian Penal Code as well, have been found by the SFIO including section 409, 419, 406 and 403 regarding criminal breach of trust, cheating by impersonation, dishonest misappropriation of property.
“The report and evidences will be shared with the CBI and Sebi who are also investigating the scam,” the source added.
The Supreme Court had ordered the CBI early this year in May to take up the investigation in the multi-crore scam. The CBI has already made several arrests in the case including the top cop of West Bengal, DG Police Rajat Majumdar, and singer and filmmaker Sadananda Gogoi for their alleged involvement in the scam.
The Saradha scam came to light in April last year after which group chairman Sudipta Sen was arrested along with two of his associates. Since then, the scam has also implicated West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who allegedly was close to Sen. In fact, suspended Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh, who is in the CBI custody for his role in the scam, has demanded that he should be jointly interrogated with Mamata and Sen. Recently, during a rally in West Bengal, BJP president Amit Shah claimed that the scam would sink the Mamata Banerjee government in the next Assembly elections in 2016.
The source said that the Sebi will prosecute for violation of the Sebi Act for running collective investment schemes. Also, several instances of violation of the Prize Chits and Money
Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978 have also been found and since prosecution under this has to be initiated by the state government, the ministry of corporate affairs will also share report with it.

Modi fixes April 2016 deadline for GSTlaunchPrint
Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:57 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given directions for Goods and Services Tax to be rolled out by April 2016.
Modi met finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday to judge how far the GST preparations have moved. According to Jaitley, the Constitutional Amendment Bill to give states and the Centre co-equal power to tax services and production can be introduced in Parliament in the Winter Session. This is the first structured meeting on the tax measure that has been held by Modi.
The big challenge in the run up to GST is setting up of a national IT framework that can act as a clearing house for the taxation of inter-state movement of goods. Finance ministry officials have told Modi that the IT framework would be up and running by 2016.
The ministry has already set up a GST cell headed by a joint secretary-level officer. This cell, which also has officers from the Central Board of Excise and Customs, will be the secretariat for the empowered committee of state finance ministers and pilot the key bills through Parliament and monitor their subsequent progress through state legislatures. The setting up of the cell shows the ministry has now begun to rush the timetable for GST roll out.
Modi is, however, reported to have advised the finance ministry to ensure that all the elements are in place, before making the announcement for a nationwide roll-out of the tax. GST will replace all domestic taxes on production and sale of goods and services.
While the finance ministry is in favour of a single rate of tax in the bill, it has conceded to the demand by the states for a band within which their levies would flourish.
The Confederation of All India Traders that has most retailers under its umbrella has argued for a single rate.
On the other hand, representatives of major industrial houses have stepped up their lobbying with the Centre to make the tax come true. But irrespective of the choice of the rates the roll out of GST will be the single most economic reform in the country.

The Odisha government has made the right announcements to improve the plight of migrant workers, but a lot more needs to be done
In December 2013, a labourer chopped off the palms of two migrant workers from western Odisha. He had paid them an advance for working in the brick kilns of Hyderabad and did not take kindly to their arguing with him about the payment and place of work. In January 2014, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of media reports on the incident and pulled up the State government for failing to protect the rights of the migrant workers. A few weeks ago, the court made it clear that it would like a plan to be put in place for the protection of the rights of these workers, following which, a few days back, the State government announced that it would increase the number of work days available under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from 100 days to 150 days a year in the Bolangir and Nuapada districts of western Odisha. It also announced the activation of a toll-free number for migrant labourers. When in distress, they can call this number and the State government willprovide immediate assistance.
Read: Brutalised migrants of western Odisha
Modern day slave trade
The Supreme Court’s concern resonates profoundly with the distress cries of migrants which have fallen on deaf years for decades, from this poverty-stricken belt. The region, traditionally associated with malnourishment, hunger deaths, drought and famine, has also in the recent past gained limelight for being an active belt of left-wing extremism. The migrants of western Odisha are forced to leave their homes because of endemic poverty and lack of opportunities. Around the time of harvest of the paddy crop every year comes the festival of nuakhai, meaning eating new rice, around the beginning of September. At this time, poor families take an advance from labour contractors and then migrate to pay it through their labour.
Migration takes place under the pathariya system, wherein a work unit comprising a husband, wife and one or two children migrate together. A labour-contractor mafia, with political patronage cutting across party lines, organises this modern day version of slave trade and human trafficking from western Odisha to the brick kilns of Andhra Pradesh and other similar sites. Accidents while travelling on crowded trains are common. Several people have been maimed for life. Some others have died. Children are preferred in brick-making because of their height; they do not have to bend down while filling brick-frames with mud as adults do. Living conditions at these sites are insanitary and terrible. Women are sexually exploited. Social protection laws are violated with impunity. In short, such migrant destinations are the underbelly of our economic growth and hold a mirror to any notion that this migration is “aspirational” in nature.
Read: Woes of migrant labour
An opportunity for change
The Supreme Court’s intervention is an opportunity to bring about a change in this appalling situation. But this has to begin with recognition by the government of the distress nature of this phenomenon. At present, there seems to be a tacit understanding in government circles not to accept that this migration is distress-induced. Only when the distress nature of this migration is accepted will the situation turn around.
How? Most of these migrant families own land and are what the Government of India’s Rural Labour Enquiry calls “landed labourers,” i.e, small and marginal farmers who are forced to migrate despite owning land. Their unproductive land holdings are in need of minimal public investment to give them food and livelihood security. Leveraging MGNREGA, such lands can be treated through appropriate measures and an irrigation source provided. Targeted interventions to augment livelihood opportunities for the landless can also be imaginatively woven into this tapestry. Through such means, the poor can be made active participants in the growth process rather than passive recipient of doles. Changes to their incomes and livelihoods can become sustainable, while lifting them out of their poverty. Over time, their dependence on employment guarantee will reduce too. In short, they will not need to migrate in order to survive.
Indeed, some of these steps have already been successfully initiated by the State government in partnership with civil society. Let us look at some examples. The village of Kathdungri in Muribahal block, Bolangir district, has 153 households of which, in 2011, 43 were distress migrants. Civil society and administration, working together, ensured MGNREGA works were planned and opened and wages were paid on time.
Read: Protecting India’s migrants
No one migrates from Kathdungri now. Water harvesting structures have recharged wells and enabled farmers to cultivate their hitherto uncultivable land, thus increasing their incomes. A mahabandha (large earthen dam) constructed in village Bhutungpada of Belpada block in 2012-13 was able to provide employment for more than half the year. Migration from the village has stopped. The dam will provide irrigation to 100 acres in the coming season.
This approach is in alignment with the National Democratic Alliance government’s emphasis on linking MGNREGA with agricultural productivity. It provides employment in the construction phase and, by lifting beneficiaries sustainably out of poverty, also contributes to a growth which is inclusive.
Such examples need to be built upon through a concerted effort. A mission for the prevention of distress migration should be set up which should be monitored at the level of the Chief Minister. The mission should ensure deployment of dedicated human resources at the gram panchayat level for planning and execution of MGNREGA and livelihood projects in line with the approach of the MGNREGA 2.0 guidelines. Each migrant household should be tracked and targeted and household level livelihoods plans should be made and executed so that employment is made available before the migrant season starts. Through forging a vast stakeholder alliance of workers, panchayats, government and civil society, it should be possible to bring these people back home. In the process, wounds will be healed and confidence in governance restored.

A mahabandha (large earthen dam) constructed in village Bhutungpada of Belpada block in 2012-13 was able to provide employment for more than half the year. Migration from the village has stopped. The dam will provide irrigation to 100 acres in the coming season.
This approach is in alignment with the National Democratic Alliance government’s emphasis on linking MGNREGA with agricultural productivity. It provides employment in the construction phase and, by lifting beneficiaries sustainably out of poverty, also contributes to a growth which is inclusive.
Such examples need to be built upon through a concerted effort. A mission for the prevention of distress migration should be set up which should be monitored at the level of the Chief Minister. The mission should ensure deployment of dedicated human resources at the gram panchayat level for planning and execution of MGNREGA and livelihood projects in line with the approach of the MGNREGA 2.0 guidelines. Each migrant household should be tracked and targeted and household level livelihoods plans should be made and executed so that employment is made available before the migrant season starts. Through forging a vast stakeholder alliance of workers, panchayats, government and civil society, it should be possible to bring these people back home. In the process, wounds will be healed and confidence in governance restored.

Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its dividend.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent.
Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained.
Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.
"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

Airport privatisation: Govt seeks more viewsAirport privatisation: Govt seeks more views
Sharmistha Mukherjee | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 12:45 AM IST
Minister for Civil Aviation Ashok Gajapati Raju has directed fresh consultations with state and central government organisations, airport and airline operators, passenger associations and travel operators before finalising the model concession agreement (MCA) for the construction and operations of airports in the country on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. In a letter dated September 11, the minister’s office said, “With regard to the Concessionaire Agreement concerning PPP, for construction/operation of airports in the country, which may be entered in the future, the HMCA desires that a broad based consultation should be held with the following – relevant states and central government organisations/agencies, airport developers/operators, airline operators, representatives of passengers’ associations, representatives of travel operators.”
The minister desires that the consultation should be held prior to entering into PPP agreements and the views of the stakeholders should be given due consideration before finalisation of the agreement, the letter notes. A senior official in the ministry who did not wish to be identified said, “The aim of holding the consultation process is to ensure transparency. We want the terms and conditions to be clear and minimalise grievances of all stakeholders.”
The decision to initiate a fresh consultation process may briefly hold up the government’s programme to award management contracts at six identified airports in Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Guwahati, Ahmedabad and Jaipur. The ministry had already determined the broad contours of the model concession agreement for awarding management contracts to private operators and an inter-ministerial group (IMG) was scheduled to meet on September 4 to finalise it. The meeting was postponed as a new secretary, V Somasundaran, assumed office a day before the scheduled meeting.
A senior ministry official had said last week, “We have been able to resolve most differences we had with the Planning Commission regarding the MCA for airport privatisation.” These management contracts were decided to be awarded to private operators at pre-determined rates, and not on a cost-plus basis, to protect passengers from high user charges after award of projects. The ministry has set for itself a realistic target of four airports in view of possible obstacles. For instance, there is a court case pending in relation with award of management contract for the Chennai airport to a private operator.
The MCA as well as the targets for award of management contracts may be re-worked with fresh consultation processes now considered for initiation.
The process to award management contracts for these six airports had been initiated last year by the previous government but the plan had to be put on the back burner following a difference of opinion between the Union civil aviation ministry, then led by Ajit Singh, and the Planning Commission, over the terms of the project-award agreement.
Several private and foreign infrastructure companies, such as IL&FS Transportation Networks, Essar Projects India, Cochin International, Essel Infraprojects, GVK, Fraport, Saudi Arabia, GMR Airports, Sahara Group and Turkey's Celebi Habacilik Holding AS, had evinced interest in these projects.

The Trapper Keeper is Back with an iPad CaseRemember the Trapper Keeper? It's back! With an iPad case!
Nicole Spector TODAY contributor
Email
Back to school is taking on a whole new meaning this fall. The mobile accessory maker Kensington, in partnership with the school supplies and stationery brand Mead, is set to bring students way, way back ­– to the 90s and even the 80s. Its time machine? The "Trapper Keeper." Sort of.
ACCO Brands
The Trapper Keeper of 2014 is an iPad cover.
The fellow ACCO brands have reinvented the iconic classroom staple for today’s digital-minded students. It’s called the Trapper Keeper & Mead Collection Universal Tablet Case and unlike the traditional Trapper Keeper, which is designed to keep loose-leaf papers, binders, and vertical folders (aka "Trappers") organized and secure for travel, this one is made to encase 7” and 10” tablets. 
“Introducing this new line of tablet folios is especially fitting when you consider how quickly students are choosing digital tools,” said Greg Agustin, Global Product Manager at Kensington.
The tech-friendly Trapper Keepers look strikingly like the vintage variety. Invoking nostalgia is a big, if not the biggest, part of the marketing strategy behind the product launch.
Back in June when it issued a press release announcing the Trapper Keeper & Mead Collection Universal Tablet Case, which started shipping this month, Kensington opened with: “Remember how neat, organized and cool you felt when you roamed the school halls with your backpack slung over one shoulder and your Trapper Keeper tucked inside?”   
Kensington is referring to the golden age of the Trapper Keeper, when, in the few years after launching the product in 1978, the Mead Corporation sold more than $100 million worth of them annually. Almost every kid had one. Beyond the basic solid colors there were a plethora of designs. Kitties. Lamborghinis. Unicorns. Flying geometric landscapes.
The product was so successful other manufacturers introduced similar ones, like the Lisa Frank "Tri Fold" binders featuring the colorful images for which the iconic children's design brand was known.
34 of the most radical Trapper Keepers ever
If you ever have a hard time keeping it together, jump back into the past when Trapper Keepers kept you organized, fresh, and sometimes, even a little funky.
A typical one featured a doe-eyed seal in a rainbow-hued reef. How empathetically he watched you through the horrors of math class. How much he needed you to save him by stuffing him with homework assignments. Your papers were still in utter disarray, but they were in disarray in one place, a pretty place, where a psychedelic marine mammal kept them safe.
"Trapper Keepers and similar products were a simple pleasure that kids could enjoy; they were functional and well-designed,” Lisa Frank, who is a real person, told TODAY in a rare interview. "The artwork allowed kids to express themselves, be stylish, and they actually looked forward to Back to School shopping."
The nostalgia factor isn’t lost on Frank, who, like Trapper Keeper has become something of a cult figure herself.
“These days, millennials reminisce on our Facebook page all the time about their favorite Lisa Frank school supplies and they tell us they’re using them in the workplace,” said Frank.
Unlike Lisa Frank’s products and the original Trapper Keeper, the new Trapper Keeper for tablets features a magnetic flap closure. There is no Velcro to be found. This past July, Mead reissued the regular Trapper Keeper for papers and folders, using a similarly wistful approach in its marketing, but also highlighting “fresh features.” Apparently, one of those fresh features is a snap closure. No Velcro on this product either.
They didn't have a choice.
“Due to the noise created from the Velcro when students would open and close their Trapper Keeper, teachers were banning Trapper Keepers from classroom and school supply lists,” said Jessica Hodges, Mead's Senior Director of Marketing. “Now, the updated Trapper Keepers have a super sturdy (and quiet!) snap closure.”
Aging sentimentalists aren’t Kensington's and Mead’s target audience. It’s the kids, teachers, and parents that the Trapper Keeper for tablet needs to attract.
A classic Trapper Keeper commercial.
And there's the potential snag. A tablet cover by its nature is a step away from Trapper Keeper's populist past.
David W. Harrington runs after-school writing programs for high school students at an educational non-profit. There’s seldom a tablet in sight.
"The [kids] use mostly traditional notebooks," he said. “They’re mostly poor.”
Meanwhile, Brian Chu, an English teacher at an elite independent high school in Brooklyn, sees plenty of tablets on campus. That's because the school gives every student one.
“The school issues generic rubber covers, but the kids who buy their own [tablets] have nicer leather ones that can hold a stylus, or, better yet, have a keyboard,” said Chu. (The new Trapper Keeper doesn't.)
Mead
Some of the new Trapper Keeper iPad designs reach back into the past for inspiration.
If today’s kids aren’t going to be drawn to this product, then Kensington and Mead need to keep working the nostalgia angle. If they can’t bring back the Velcro, then at least bring in Lisa Frank so girly-girls can have a more apt reminiscence.
“I would love to design Lisa Frank Trapper Keepers for tablets!” said Frank.

Meet the new faces of Washington business educationJoined university: August 2002.
Academic specialty: Marketing and ethics.
Catholic University made the decision two years ago to expand its business and economics programs from a department to a stand-alone school, a move that Dean Andrew Abela said was designed to give the school and its degrees greater cachet among students, faculty and prospective employers.
The decision has meant enrolling more students and hiring new faculty, as well as starting to develop new academic offerings, such as the school’s first MBA program. In an area already crowded with well-regarded business schools, Abela said he believes Catholic University has an advantage over its peers: The school’s direct connection to the Vatican, a distinction unique not just in the region but the country, means its teachings are rooted in Catholicism as well as capitalism.
What do you view as the most important role of the dean?
The single most important role I would say is faculty recruitment and development. Although we need good students to be a good school, over the long term, the main driving factor of the quality of the school is going to be the quality of the teaching and research.
What is the biggest challenge facing business schools today?
This is going to sound self-serving because this is what we were established to do, but the business community as a whole has a challenge to demonstrate their contributions to society. So business schools have a responsibility to demonstrate to their students and the world at large the contributions of business, the good that business does.
How are students’ needs and demands different today compared with five years ago?
The job market is much tougher now than it was five years ago, so they’re looking for more help in terms of career discernment and placement. At the undergraduate level, … we have a number of required activities, which include a series of courses in career development that begin freshman year. We have a specialized master’s in business analysis, which is a crash course in business for students who didn’t study business as undergraduates. The career preparation is even more intense there. It’s two semesters long, and the students take an internship in the morning and then take class in the afternoon and evening.
How has demand for your programs changed?
Demand is very strong both at the graduate and undergraduate level. We’re only two years old as a school. We were a department before that within the School of Arts and Sciences. We had 167 freshman in our undergraduate class this year, up from 130 last year and about 100 the year before. We’re seeing really strong demand to the distinctive focus of our school on the human approach and moral approach to business, which we think, particularly among young people, really resonates well.
Why transition from a department to a standalone school ?
It gives us greater autonomy within the university than as a department in terms of hiring faculty. It’s also symbolic. Some students and employers have a problem taking you seriously if you’re just a department rather than an actual business school. In student placement, we had cases where students would tell us they went on interviews and they say, “How can we take your education seriously, you didn’t go to a business school?”
Have you had to market the new school to students and others?
There’s been quite a bit of publicity around us because of what we think is our distinctive position. We are part of Catholic University of America, which is the only Catholic university in the United States that is directly owned by the Catholic Church. We take the Catholic ethos of our university very, very seriously, so among business leaders who try to live as faithful Catholics in business, they found the creation of our school very exciting.

Alexander J. Triantis
University of Maryland, College Park
Appointed dean: September 2013.
Joined university: September 1995.
Academic specialty: Finance.
Alexander J. Triantis expects the number of business schools to decline in the coming years as competition for top-notch students and faculty becomes too fierce for some programs to remain viable. As dean of the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, Triantis’s job is to ensure his program makes the cut.
To that end, Triantis said the business school is supplementing its traditional degrees with those in emerging fields, such as marketing analytics, as well as devising online and in-person programs that will likely appeal to nontraditional business students
The school plans to introduce minors in business starting next fall for undergraduates studying other disciplines, such as engineering, the arts or communications. At the graduate level, a one-year master’s degree was recently added to provide students who haven’t studied business with an overview of finance, accounting, marketing and other subjects.
What do you view as the most important role of the dean?
Shaping the future strategy of the school, which now is probably more important than ever to try to have a clear sense of where the strategic direction of the school is. Given all the disruption that has occurred within education as a whole, and business education specifically, unless we try to think a few steps ahead about what programs we want and the overall experience students have, quite frankly, some business schools won’t be around in a few years.
What is the biggest challenge facing business schools today?
We’ve had this huge increase in the number of business schools. There is an intense challenge right now and intense competition for really top students and that has become more heated than in the past, particularly for full-time MBA students. At the same time, you have this huge demand for top talent in the faculty ranks, [and] you don’t really see doctoral programs increasing the number of students they bring in.
Is a traditional MBA still worth the money?
I think it is. First of all, I should point out this past year we had an increase of about 30 percent for our full-time MBA program. I haven’t looked carefully, but I think that’s one of the highest increases in the nation. Clearly, there’s still a demand there, so that’s a good thing.
Is the value there? I think that is the clear question. The value comes from providing something that is unique. Something you couldn’t get by picking up books or doing a less sophisticated online program. It comes from the network of alumni you’re involved in and connection to companies. You see it in the long-term return on investment.
What is one big change you’ve made in your first year?
One of the key areas I think we have a great opportunity being at a top-tier university like Maryland is we have great departments and great students outside of the business school, as well. One thing I’m trying to do is take advantage of partnerships in different colleges across the university. We now have a business minor for students who are not in the business school as an undergraduate. This allows a top student in engineering or liberal arts to get a minor in general business or innovation and entrepreneurship, or business and analytics.
You said some business schools won’t be around in a few years. What did you mean by that?
Some are predicting over the next five or 10 years that business schools will go under or there will be consolidation. There’s going to be a line, and I don’t know how far down in the rankings that line will be, where the schools that are below a certain ranking are going to struggle to find the best students if those students have more opportunities to find that education at a lower price point.

Joined university: Fall 1995.
Academic specialty: Accounting and tax policy.
Sarah Nutter made a tough and, to some, controversial call when she was appointed interim dean of George Mason University’s business school: She eliminated the school’s full-time MBA program. Long considered the flagship of any business school, full-time MBA programs today are struggling with enrollment and profitability at many universities outside the top tier. Thus, Nutter believes other schools could soon follow George Mason’s lead. The decision frees up money and other resources to create more customized programs. The school recently introduced a Master’s in Management of Secure Information Systems, colloquially called the Master’s in Cybersecurity, as well as an executive MBA program tailored to existing defense and contracting professionals. In the Washington region, there’s no limit on prospective students for such programs, Nutter said.
What is the biggest challenge facing business schools today?
State funding is a big issue for us. It’s a declining percentage of the overall budget of the university. There’s no question in a public institution that’s one of our big challenges, how to bridge the gap. We at Mason and in the business school, as well, have long been looking at ways to become more efficient on the cost side of the proposition. Our cost to educate a student at Mason has remained relatively flat over the last decade. We’ve been driving efficiencies. The question you have in a state institution is how much could you increase the tuition rates without challenging the affordability issue.
Is a traditional MBA still worth the money?
The answers is it depends. We actually did end up cancelling our full-time MBA program about 18 months ago. Most full-time MBA programs don’t make money. The competition for graduate business education is fierce to start out with, so you’ve seen a decline in the number of full-time MBA programs nationally. We at Mason have always had really strong and highly qualified students in our part-time programs. We really have evolved to serve the professional community.
How has demand for your programs changed?
Demand mix has changed substantially for us over time. We’re doing more specialized master’s programs. We have a M.S. in cybersecurity … that program is a model of the new type [of degree] in the sense it’s a collaborative degree program between the business school, school of engineering and the public policy school. It’s been really quite successful. Those specialized master’s programs are the way of the future, in many respects.
What factors did you consider when ending the full-time MBA program?
It starts with enrollment. There was a strategy decision made to invest in the full-time MBA program to enhance the overall ranking of the program, but also with an eye to using that as a mechanism to drive the ranking of the whole school. You have to invest a lot of resources in it. Student acquisition is very expensive with scholarships, graduate assistantships, and tuition waivers.
The amount that we as the business school were spending to try to acquire students to build reputation was not going to move the dime enough. Even though we were investing large dollar amounts, the pool of those that were seeking a full-time MBA declined, and the packages that were being offered [by other schools], we couldn’t compete. It really was a strategic decision for us whether we could support the dollars necessary to … create the highest quality MBA program. It just didn’t add up for us.  
You’ve developed graduate programs for government contractors. Does the slowdown in government spending worry you? 
I’m not worried that the federal government is going to go away anytime soon. There will always be a role for the government partner, those that will be supporting the role of the government. If we can educate those that will be working on either side of this, those that are working for the government or government contracting, so they can be better, then that’s a wonderful win for everyone.

Meet the new faces of Washington business educationJoined university: August 2002.
Academic specialty: Marketing and ethics.
Catholic University made the decision two years ago to expand its business and economics programs from a department to a stand-alone school, a move that Dean Andrew Abela said was designed to give the school and its degrees greater cachet among students, faculty and prospective employers.
The decision has meant enrolling more students and hiring new faculty, as well as starting to develop new academic offerings, such as the school’s first MBA program. In an area already crowded with well-regarded business schools, Abela said he believes Catholic University has an advantage over its peers: The school’s direct connection to the Vatican, a distinction unique not just in the region but the country, means its teachings are rooted in Catholicism as well as capitalism.
What do you view as the most important role of the dean?
The single most important role I would say is faculty recruitment and development. Although we need good students to be a good school, over the long term, the main driving factor of the quality of the school is going to be the quality of the teaching and research.
What is the biggest challenge facing business schools today?
This is going to sound self-serving because this is what we were established to do, but the business community as a whole has a challenge to demonstrate their contributions to society. So business schools have a responsibility to demonstrate to their students and the world at large the contributions of business, the good that business does.
How are students’ needs and demands different today compared with five years ago?
The job market is much tougher now than it was five years ago, so they’re looking for more help in terms of career discernment and placement. At the undergraduate level, … we have a number of required activities, which include a series of courses in career development that begin freshman year. We have a specialized master’s in business analysis, which is a crash course in business for students who didn’t study business as undergraduates. The career preparation is even more intense there. It’s two semesters long, and the students take an internship in the morning and then take class in the afternoon and evening.
How has demand for your programs changed?
Demand is very strong both at the graduate and undergraduate level. We’re only two years old as a school. We were a department before that within the School of Arts and Sciences. We had 167 freshman in our undergraduate class this year, up from 130 last year and about 100 the year before. We’re seeing really strong demand to the distinctive focus of our school on the human approach and moral approach to business, which we think, particularly among young people, really resonates well.
Why transition from a department to a standalone school ?
It gives us greater autonomy within the university than as a department in terms of hiring faculty. It’s also symbolic. Some students and employers have a problem taking you seriously if you’re just a department rather than an actual business school. In student placement, we had cases where students would tell us they went on interviews and they say, “How can we take your education seriously, you didn’t go to a business school?”
Have you had to market the new school to students and others?
There’s been quite a bit of publicity around us because of what we think is our distinctive position. We are part of Catholic University of America, which is the only Catholic university in the United States that is directly owned by the Catholic Church. We take the Catholic ethos of our university very, very seriously, so among business leaders who try to live as faithful Catholics in business, they found the creation of our school very exciting.

Alexander J. Triantis
University of Maryland, College Park
Appointed dean: September 2013.
Joined university: September 1995.
Academic specialty: Finance.
Alexander J. Triantis expects the number of business schools to decline in the coming years as competition for top-notch students and faculty becomes too fierce for some programs to remain viable. As dean of the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, Triantis’s job is to ensure his program makes the cut.
To that end, Triantis said the business school is supplementing its traditional degrees with those in emerging fields, such as marketing analytics, as well as devising online and in-person programs that will likely appeal to nontraditional business students
The school plans to introduce minors in business starting next fall for undergraduates studying other disciplines, such as engineering, the arts or communications. At the graduate level, a one-year master’s degree was recently added to provide students who haven’t studied business with an overview of finance, accounting, marketing and other subjects.
What do you view as the most important role of the dean?
Shaping the future strategy of the school, which now is probably more important than ever to try to have a clear sense of where the strategic direction of the school is. Given all the disruption that has occurred within education as a whole, and business education specifically, unless we try to think a few steps ahead about what programs we want and the overall experience students have, quite frankly, some business schools won’t be around in a few years.
What is the biggest challenge facing business schools today?
We’ve had this huge increase in the number of business schools. There is an intense challenge right now and intense competition for really top students and that has become more heated than in the past, particularly for full-time MBA students. At the same time, you have this huge demand for top talent in the faculty ranks, [and] you don’t really see doctoral programs increasing the number of students they bring in.
Is a traditional MBA still worth the money?
I think it is. First of all, I should point out this past year we had an increase of about 30 percent for our full-time MBA program. I haven’t looked carefully, but I think that’s one of the highest increases in the nation. Clearly, there’s still a demand there, so that’s a good thing.
Is the value there? I think that is the clear question. The value comes from providing something that is unique. Something you couldn’t get by picking up books or doing a less sophisticated online program. It comes from the network of alumni you’re involved in and connection to companies. You see it in the long-term return on investment.
What is one big change you’ve made in your first year?
One of the key areas I think we have a great opportunity being at a top-tier university like Maryland is we have great departments and great students outside of the business school, as well. One thing I’m trying to do is take advantage of partnerships in different colleges across the university. We now have a business minor for students who are not in the business school as an undergraduate. This allows a top student in engineering or liberal arts to get a minor in general business or innovation and entrepreneurship, or business and analytics.
You said some business schools won’t be around in a few years. What did you mean by that?
Some are predicting over the next five or 10 years that business schools will go under or there will be consolidation. There’s going to be a line, and I don’t know how far down in the rankings that line will be, where the schools that are below a certain ranking are going to struggle to find the best students if those students have more opportunities to find that education at a lower price point.

Hindu by birth  sickular by choiceprint
Be scared, very scared even if you are a Hindu on the moderate side, which for troll purposes comes under the ‘sickular’ brand name these days.
You deal with the nameless, faceless fringe elements — who believe only they uphold Hinduism — by ignoring them, but how do you escape when the same voices come from the mainstream.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have appealed for a communal violence-free India, but there are people in his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who seem intent on dealing in provocative speeches that tear into India’s secular fabric, which the Constitution bestows on us.
Days after an FIR was filed against BJP MP Yogi Adityanath for hate speech, another party MP, Sakshi Maharaj, made inflammatory remarks saying madrassas were giving “education of terrorism.”
Read: FIR against Adityanath for defying poll meeting ban
Throw into the cauldron Union minister Maneka Gandhi’s concern over India being the world’s largest beef exporter and claim that the money from illegal animal slaughter is “going into terrorism, it is going into bomb making. It is going into killing us”.
She does, however, add that no particular community is to be blamed for this.
Read: Money from cow slaughter racket funding terror: Maneka Gandhi
Dear minister, who are we trying to hoodwink with such qualifiers at a time when self-styled protectors of Hinduism are fuming over ‘Love Jihad’.
It just so happens that Adityanath, Maharaj and Gandhi represent seats in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous and politically key state.
The scare tactics and the accompanying noise are inescapable. Those who consider themselves not ‘sickular’ and thus on the right path make sure you hear their side on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and the like.
Of course, Photoshop comes in handy to attest this confirmation bias.
This is scary because isn’t Hinduism supposed to be inclusive and tolerant — facets that many Indians feel proud upholding.
Losing this tolerance is not an option in a country poised to have the youngest population in the world in a few years. 
Eminent jurist Fali Nariman pointed this out recently, arguing that the Hindu tradition of tolerance was showing strain and fearing that Hinduism was changing its benign face.
Read: Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain, says Fali Nariman
Lack of tolerance that’s worrying came to fore on the death of writer UR Ananthamurthy. The writer may have rubbed Hindus the wrong way and opposed Modi, but that did not call for distasteful bursting of crackers on his demise.
For sure, we are better than that.
Many of us were born Hindu in this country and have chosen the right to be ‘sickular’. I would like to believe that Hinduism in India still has the breadth to accord ‘sickulars’ their place.
I refuse to live and let die no matter what the cost.

Apple Watch and the iPhone 6: Things to Ponderreddit
The most impressive thing about Apple's iPhone 6 launch event was not the hardware, software or the company's fantastic ecosystem. It wasn't Apple Heath or even Apple Pay. It was Apple's clear and well-executed strategy.
While the Street was not impressed with any of it (as evidenced by the downward movement in share price), analysts may have missed a subtle (but important) point. Apple didn't name the new payment system "iPay" and it didn't name the new watch "iWatch." It replaced the "i" for Internet with the aspirational brand identifier "Apple."
Apple clearly has no interest in the several billion people who don't own smart devices. It doesn't care if you can't afford its products and services. Apple is catering to its affluent, self-identifying audience in a demonstrable way. Need proof? An iPhone 6 Plus with 128 GB of storage, an Apple Watch and a 2 year phone plan should set you back approximately $4,500-$5,000 USD. $500-$1,050 for the iPhone, case and tax depending upon whether you get a subsidized phone or buy it retail; $2,400 for the phone/data plan; approx. $500-$750 for the Apple Watch and a cool band... depending upon how it prices Apple Watches, you might spend much more.
Several million people have the money and the desire to make this commitment. And make it they will. As for the billions of people who just don't have the money? They are of no concern. Apple is laser-focused on a fashion-conscious, moneyed aristocracy that is perfectly segmented to serve up to developers, advertisers and its business partners.
Apple has differentiated itself from all other hardware manufacturers; not only are its margins incredible, its data gathering and consumer targeting is awe-inspiring.
Will Apple be the first trillion-dollar market cap company? Maybe, but to get there, it's going to need to make hardware and software that people really want. Do you want an Apple Watch? Do you want Apple Pay? Do you want to quantify your life Apple-style? There is no "need" in Apple's vocabulary. It is a luxury goods company, so you have to "want" its products.
Will you "want" an Apple Watch or an iPhone 6? Let's review.
Apple Watch
Reading comments about the Apple Watch from horology, design and fashion experts, I am reminded of a favorite supposition: "If, on that fateful night, a rookie captain was piloting the Titanic, it would still be floating today." While being a subject matter expert in horology, design or fashion accessories probably gives one standing to pass meaningful judgment on timepieces, it does not guarantee the validity of opinions regarding the misnamed Apple Watch.
While eponymous and descriptive, the name Apple Watch does the device a disservice. The first wristwatch was purpose-built to tell time. According to the New York Times:
"The watchmaker Girard-Perregaux supplied what may be the first examples to the German Imperial Navy in 1880, after an officer reportedly complained that operating a pocket watch was difficult when timing a bombardment."
The Apple Watch is not a pocket watch strapped to your wrist. It was not designed to tell time any more than the iPhone was designed to make calls.
What exactly is an Apple Watch? No one - not even Apple - knows. It may be a gateway to health and wellness, sports and fitness, quantified self or even location-based self-authenticated personal navigation. It may be none of the above. It may be a platform for app developers, or just a failed attempt at a user interface. As of today, the Apple Watch could be anything... and that's the point.
When the iPad debuted, I was completely convinced it would fail. It had limited storage, didn't run programs, didn't have a USB port, etc. I viewed the iPad through my computer/laptop lens. Through that lens, it failed by every measure. I could not have been surer of myself and I could not have been more wrong.
I don't think there's a big market for digital watches that need relatively expensive companion smartphones to function. But, as I said, I don't think the Apple Watch is a digital watch. The Apple Watch looks like a great first attempt at a new interface in a connected world. It will require new approaches to UI and UX, and it will need at least one "killer app" to make it a "must have" device.
It's possible that there is no killer app and that the entire idea is flawed. But I think we should keep an open mind. Exploring Apple Watch will be fun and, if you do come up with a use case that inspires consumers, good things will happen.
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
I'd love to tell you how great these devices are and do some hardcore fanboy gushing about Apple. But I can't. The new iPhones are iterative and that's all they can be. If you like a big screen, you're in luck. If you want a slightly better camera, a little more RAM, faster WiFi, a slightly better processor and some new bells and whistles... Apple heard you. If you're looking for the next coming of the lord in a phone... you will have to look elsewhere; these are just big iPhones.
As it turns out, almost everyone I know is going to order one, and the people who aren't going to order one want one, too. As I have often said, "If you want an iPhone, nothing else will do." If your contract is up and you're an iPhone person, get one. If your contract is not up, pay retail... you'll love it. If you're an Android person (and you know who you are), there's no reason to switch. If you own a Samsung Galaxy S5 or an HTC One M8 or an LG G3 and are happy, you can completely ignore the iPhone 6.
We're going to have several sessions about wearables, mobile payment systems, mobile health, quantified self and even smartphones at our 7th Annual Media Technology Summit on October 23 at the Sheraton Times Square. Come join us.

It may be a platform for app developers, or just a failed attempt at a user interface. As of today, the Apple Watch could be anything... and that's the point.
When the iPad debuted, I was completely convinced it would fail. It had limited storage, didn't run programs, didn't have a USB port, etc. I viewed the iPad through my computer/laptop lens. Through that lens, it failed by every measure. I could not have been surer of myself and I could not have been more wrong.
I don't think there's a big market for digital watches that need relatively expensive companion smartphones to function. But, as I said, I don't think the Apple Watch is a digital watch. The Apple Watch looks like a great first attempt at a new interface in a connected world. It will require new approaches to UI and UX, and it will need at least one "killer app" to make it a "must have" device.
It's possible that there is no killer app and that the entire idea is flawed. But I think we should keep an open mind. Exploring Apple Watch will be fun and, if you do come up with a use case that inspires consumers, good things will happen.
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
I'd love to tell you how great these devices are and do some hardcore fanboy gushing about Apple. But I can't. The new iPhones are iterative and that's all they can be. If you like a big screen, you're in luck. If you want a slightly better camera, a little more RAM, faster WiFi, a slightly better processor and some new bells and whistles... Apple heard you. If you're looking for the next coming of the lord in a phone... you will have to look elsewhere; these are just big iPhones.
As it turns out, almost everyone I know is going to order one, and the people who aren't going to order one want one, too. As I have often said, "If you want an iPhone, nothing else will do." If your contract is up and you're an iPhone person, get one. If your contract is not up, pay retail... you'll love it. If you're an Android person (and you know who you are), there's no reason to switch. If you own a Samsung Galaxy S5 or an HTC One M8 or an LG G3 and are happy, you can completely ignore the iPhone 6.
We're going to have several sessions about wearables, mobile payment systems, mobile health, quantified self and even smartphones at our 7th Annual Media Technology Summit on October 23 at the Sheraton Times Square. Come join us.

15 Reminders You re A Working Momreddit
Like many working moms, I try to manage the juggling act of working, taking care of my daughter, being a wife and managing a home. In the midst of all this chaos, sometimes I find myself laughing out loud at life's little moments. Those moments consist of not taking life too seriously, finding joy even in the busiest of days and those "keeping it real" moments that occur when you are least expecting it.
It's the occasional princess sticker stuck on my high heel shoes or the temporary tattoo on my arm that I don't notice until halfway through the work day, or the conference call I take during a dance class. I am constantly reminded throughout my day that I am a mom first and my work takes a clear second place. Since my daughter was born, I have racked up a long list of working mom reminders. Here are just a few.
1. Your 2-year-old puts on your high heels, grabs her princess purse and takes off down the hallway, saying "Bye, gotta go to a meeting."
2. You call time spent in the car commuting to work "me time."
3. The default music in the car is "If you're happy and you know it...."
4. You ask your daughter where her stuffed animal's mommy is and she replies, "She's in the playroom, working."
5. You go to point out an important item on your spreadsheet to a potential client, and notice your nails are streaked with purple nail polish from playing "beauty shop" the night before.
6. Your work bag contains a Hello Kitty notepad.
7. You have mastered the "driving while pumping" traffic offense, while not flashing any truck drivers, nor spilling any of the precious milk.
8. You drop everything for an impromptu mother-daughter field trip when your child responds to your "I love you" comment with, "I love The Sitter."
9. You reach into your purse to pull out a business card, and a pacifier falls out.
10. You count the number of hours you are with your daughter and compare it to The Sitter and Daddy.
11. Your daughter can be found with her pretend laptop on her vanity, typing away and saying "Shhhh... I'm working."
12. You need to pull your hair back at work, but all you pull out of your purse is a red and white pom-pom rubber band, and a pink sparkle clip.
13. You get up to use the restroom during a company dinner, and you say, "Excuse me, I am going to use the potty."
14. A co-worker tells a funny story and you say, "You are so silly."
15. You kept noticing your boss looking over at your right arm during a conversation, later to check in the office bathroom mirror, it's your daughter's breakfast left over from the "goodbye" kiss and hug in the morning.

YouTube users in India will soon be able to save videos from the Google-owned service, making it possible to watch them offline, and the feature will eventually be available globally, the company said Monday.
The feature will be available through the YouTube app on Google's new $105-Android One smartphones unveiled in New Delhi on Monday.
"YouTube will be available offline soon, starting with India," Google India communications manager Gaurav Bhaskar told AFP.
Smartphones using Google's Android operating system are used by more than one billion people globally and the new Android One phone is part of the company's drive to reach out to billions more.
The company said the YouTube save service will be available soon but gave no date. It did not give any indication when it would be extended to other parts of the world.
The new YouTube save feature will be "a great benefit for when there is a slow connection or re-watching videos without using up the data plan", said Bhaskar.
Google has tied up with local Indian handset makers Micromax, Karbonn and Spice Mobiles to make Android One Smartphones that will start at 6,399-rupee ($105).
"While 1.75-billion people around the world already have a smartphone, the vast majority of the world's population -- over five billion more -- do not," said Sundar Pichai, a senior Google vice president.
Google said the phones will be "high-quality" and "affordable" smartphones sold through online Indian retailers.
The new Google phones come with improved security features and more than a million apps, the company said.  
Smartphone-makers are in a race to the bottom of India's economic pyramid as they battle for customers in the fast-growing low-end market segment where analysts say opportunities are vast.
India is now the fastest-expanding smartphone market globally and the third-largest market after China and the United States, according to Britain-based consultancy Canalys.
The cheapest smartphones now retail at 2,000 rupees ($33), down from an average 15,000 rupees two years ago.
Technology consultancy IDC India projects annual smartphone sales growth of around 40 percent for the next five years in the price-sensitive nation, home to 33 percent of the world's poor.
Smartphones now hold a 10 percent market share among India's mobile-phone-using population, according to consultancy IDC.
Handset makers in India and other emerging markets have been leapfrogging fixed-line technology that was used in developed markets.
They are employing mobile broadband to deliver Internet access to people who have no computers.

August inflation slows to 5-year low of 3.74%Comments
India’s wholesale inflation rate plunged to 3.74% in August, the lowest in almost five years, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices, data released Monday showed.
The more than one percentage point drop in wholesale inflation rates over July’s 5.19%, should bring cheer to the NDA government that rode to a landslide election victory promising to bring down prices of essentials as part of its poll pledge to usher in `Aachen din’ (Good days).
It was also the lowest since 1.79% of October 2009, a period when demand for goods fell sharply battered by the worst global recession in 80 years.
Besides, with crude oil prices falling to two-year low of $97 dollar a barrel, expect retail petrol and diesel prices to come down further.
Wholesale food inflation, a measure of how costly the platter has become, grew 5.15% compared to the previous month’s 8.43%. Wholesale vegetable prices fell 4.88% in August on a year-on-year basis, while onion prices plunged 41%.
Prices of protein-rich food items such as pulses, milk, and fruits have risen faster that overall food prices growing at 7.81%, 12.18% and 20.31% in August.
As the tens of millions of people shift to higher standards of living, the focus is changing from basic needs of nutrition to such as rice and coarse grains to more aspirational protein-rich products, a trend that economists describe as structural inflation.
`Manufactured products inflation’—a broad index to gauge price movements of industrial goods—was only marginally lower at 3.45% in August compared to July’s 3.67%, but significantly higher than last August’s 2.31%.
In the current context, high manufactured products’ inflation implies greater demand and sales of consumer and investment goods, mirroring revival signs in the Indian economy that is battling to claw out of a quarter-century slump.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has made taming inflation one of its top priorities, despite business leaders clamouring for rate cuts.
"I have no desire to keep interest rates high for even a second longer. I want to bring down interest rates when it is feasible and that would be when we have won the fight against inflation," Rajan said in Mumbai.
"There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation pick-up again," Rajan said, adding that right now he thinks the central bank is continuing the way it proposed recently.
Retail inflation eased in August to 7.8% year-on-year from 7.96% the previous month, data showed last week, although that is still above the central bank's target of 6% by 2016.
Industry leaders have been ratecthing up their demand for lower borrowing costs to assist investment plans, critical to spin jobs and multiply income.
“Coming shortly before the monetary policy, this (low inflation rate) should also provide the necessary maneuvering space to the RBI, “ said Chandrajit Banerjee, CII director general.
Analysts, however, cautioned that the time to open the bubbly may be still far away as part of the fall in wholesale inflation, is also because of a high base effect—a statistical phenomenon that magnifies small changes, although the real fall may not be very large.
The rupee’s value—it fell 48 paise to close at 61.13 to a dollar on Monday—can also partly offset the gains from falling crude oil prices.
Every time the rupee depreciates by one rupee against the US dollar, the fuel subsidy bill bloats by Rs. 8000 crore is added to the fuel subsidy bill.
“It remains to be seen how agricultural produce prices move from here on and particularly in the October – November ’14 period given the monsoon this year has been delayed and largely subdued.
We do not expect any change in RBI’s policy stance later this month and thereby expect the repo rate to be status-quo at 8%,” Care Ratings, a credit ratings agency, said in a research report.

The Maker of Bud Wants to Buy the Maker of MillerDrunk on antitrust.

Because no amount of fizzy yellow water can quench its thirst for market share, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s No. 1 beer-maker, is reportedly talking to bankers about plans to buy No. 2, SABMiller. Between them, the companies control almost one-third of the planet’s beer sales. Nothing is formal yet, according to the Wall Street Journal , but AB InBev has been trying to secure financing in order to make the long-rumored marriage a reality.
AB InBev owns Budweiser, while SABMiller produces Miller (as well as Milwaukee’s Best, Keystone Ice, Leinenkugel, and more). It would be bad for American consumers if the two companies were allowed to combine their stateside operations, but chances are that won’t happen thanks to antitrust concerns. When AB InBev purchased Corona-maker Grupo Modelo last year, the Justice Department forced it to spin off a new brewer that would produce all of the Mexican beer titan’s brands in the U.S., thus preserving domestic competition. Something similar might happen in the event that AB InBev gobbles up SABMiller.

As of now, SABMiller's brands are brewed and sold in the U.S. by MillerCoors, a company it co-owns with Molson Coors, maker of Coors and Coors Light. The two created the joint venture in 2007 in order to better compete with Anheuser-Busch; today, it controls about 27 percent of the American market, according to data from Beer Marketer’s Insights, versus AB InBev’s 45.6 percent share. Should AB InBev manage to buy SABMiller, it will likely have to sell off MillerCoors to placate regulators.
So in short, even if this monster merger were to happen, there will probably still be plenty of competition among makers of mass-market American swill.

Android One  will bring high-quality smartphones to new markets like Indiaprint
In March 2013, Chennai-born P Sundarajan, better known as Sundar Pichai, shot to fame when Google CEO Larry Page announced that he would head the Chrome operating system (OS) and apps business and fill the shoes of Andy Rubin, the architect of the Android unit. Around that time, Pichai was also being mentioned as a potential co-CEO of Microsoft Corp. Reports said Pichai was cajoled to stay back by Page. An IIT-Kharagpur graduate, Pichai joined Google in 2004. Today, the Android operating system (OS) has a market share in excess of 80%, both globally and in India. In an interview on Monday, Pichai, in Delhi to launch three Android One phones, spoke about the road ahead for Android, wearable devices and partners. Edited excerpts:
This is a real big event for India. What do you hope to achieve with Android One?
Outside the I/O (Google’s annual developer conference), this is one our biggest events globally. Android One is our initiative to bring high-quality smartphones to new markets like India. We are going a step forward from Android. We are providing a reference platform, and a menu of choice for our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to choose various tested and pre-qualified components so that it’s easier to build a phone. And with that, they get the peace of mind of software backed by Google, with security and updates.
We are not only announcing the launch of the devices, but also connectivity partnerships with telecom service providers like Bharti Airtel, and our expansion to other countries in South Asia. All three devices from Micromax, Karbonn and Spice will go on sale across India, both online and offline. The question was: what was the most affordable phone we could deliver, given the quality bar we had in mind?
By 2017, India will have 500 million internet users, and Google expects many of these users to access the internet through smartphones. Within the next couple of years, India will become the second largest internet user (market) in the world, and most new users will access the internet on mobiles. And Android is powering much of this growth. In India, Android users have more than tripled over the past 12 months. With today’s announcement (of the Android One mobiles), we expect the pace to accelerate.
And you have wearables in the offing?
Wearables will be the next wave of computing, and they are a great addition to the smartphone experience. There are a whole new set of uses in segments like health and fitness.
Which mobile you currently use?
I have about 20 devices at any given time, and switch between them. I’m constantly using the next phase of devices that are being tested, and which we plan to ship.
What’s that on your wrist now (pointing to a smartwatch-like wearable)?
This is a confidential prototype that I can’t talk about.
What’s that on your wrist now (pointing to a smartwatch-like wearable)?
This is a confidential prototype that I can’t talk about.
Do you feel you have filled the shoes of Andy Rubin well?
They were definitely big shoes to fill in. Andy had run it (Android) for a long time. At the same time, it was a very natural and intuitive thing for me to do. I had a very good team in place. The good thing about stuff such as Android is that you don’t get much time to think about such things. I felt like running a marathon at a sprint pace on a treadmill, and someone just came and made the treadmill go faster. You get one shot at it, or you fall down.
Will we see the Chrome OS and Android OS merging at some point?
We invest both in Android and Chrome. Computing is integral to people’s lives. The onus is on us to deliver more useful things to them. We have a huge opportunity across Android to make computing more useful. We are investing in both areas, and we will converge organically. In L (the new Android L is an update that will offer Google’s new design, improved battery life, enhanced security features and smarter notifications), we are doing a lot of work on making Android and Chrome integrated with the rest of our offerings. So, while there will be a unifying experience across services, Chrome OS and Android One won’t be a single OS since they have unique attributes.
But you do face competition from companies such as Apple and Microsoft., especially from the latter in the enterprise segment, for which you have Android for Work. How do you perceive this scenario?
Android One is not guided by others. We don’t take the computing landscape for granted. Competition is good and the journey to get computing to all is important. But our approach is different from our competitors. Android for Work (a platform that allows business and personal information to co-exist on a single device—derived much from Samsung’s Knox) is underway. It will be a consistent platform for companies.
It’s a big initiative and we are working with a lot of partners, including Samsung. There were reports about competitors trying to poach you. But you’re still at Google...
I’m very passionate about computing and Google is a place where I can have a long-term vision for it and a humbling place to be in. Larry (Page) is committed to the very long term. It’s a partnership I enjoy.
What’s your leadership style?
I believe in working with people who share your vision for making a difference and then empowering them. At a practical level, it’s (about) staying out of the way. When coordinating such a large ecosystem such as Android, people need to share your concerns.

When waters rose  Muslims here first rescued PanditsComments
Wazirbagh has a temple and a gurdwara. Though many Kashmiri Pandit families have left the area, 10 to 12 families still live here and its adjoining areas. There are several Sikh families too whose garments and hardware shops now lie submerged in water.

When flood waters were rising by a few feet every hour, the family of a Kashmiri Pandit, Ashok ji, as neighbours call him, was among the first to be rescued by Sohail Tabrez and Akil, the Muslims of the locality.
“Ashok ji had saved young Akil when there was a theft in his house. We went to the Pandit families here and asked them to leave their homes. The Sikh families too were rescued by army and locals,” says Sohail Tabrez.

The sprawling three-storied house of Ashok ji is being looked after by Shariq Mughal and Akil, both teenagers, who along with their friends take over a dozen trips a day on a boat taken from the army by depositing their identity cards.
When they reach the submerged Kalgi Dhar gurdwara in neighbouring locality, they call out to Inderjit Singh, the gurdwara’s old caretaker to take his supplies of the day.
Also getting their daily milk and food from the boat are Akil’s pet cats, Angrez and Rangrez, besides some pet dogs in Burzbagh. The few locals and migrant workers who continue to live on the top floors or rooftops of eateries and homes too call out for water and food.

The Pandit family owning the Natraj medical shop on the corner of road leading to Lal Mandi Chowk has long left but it is still called Natraj gali. “We had requested Bhabhijaan to stay but the family left. Inderjit, the gurdwara’s caretaker only has Muslim friends,” said Tabrez whose throat has gone hoarse asking people to stand in a queue to be ferried on boat. “I will have to again take medicine from Tinni,” he says referring to the young Sikh homeopathic doctor of the locality.

World pledges to crush ISISprint
An international coalition took shape in Paris on Monday, with 29 countries coming together against the ISIS (Islamic State Syria and the Levant).
Monday's conference came just a day after ISIS released a video of the beheading of a British aid worker, 44-year-old David Haines. He was the third Western hostage to be killed by the militant group. Earlier, two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were also killed by the ISIS.
French President François Hollande said Iraqi territory was not the sole territory affected and called for a “global response” to what he said was a “global problem”.
All countries agreed in principle on the use of “whatever means necessary” whether military, financial or humanitarian. Prior to the hosting the conference, France had agreed to conduct air strikes “if necessary" and two Rafale jets had flown over Iraq from Abu Dhabi for reconnaissance missions on Monday morning.
 
Spelling out the broad ideas world leaders agreed to on Monday, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said, “The Daesh (ISIS) movement is neither a state nor is it representative of Islam. It’s an extremely dangerous movement that should be pushed back and destroyed”. The delegates pledged full support to the Iraqi government led by President Fuad Masum who said the terrorists were using new strategies to perpetrate “massacres and crimes that should be considered genocide”.
 
President Hollande made an appeal to the international community to find a sustainable solution for Syria where, he pointed out, the militant group was “born” and where the 3-year-old crisis has led to 200,000 dead. Hollande said Lebanon’s sovereignty was also under threat and it had already received 2 million Syrian refugees. He confirmed that France and Saudi Arabia had agreed to help Lebanon by beefing up its army’s capabilities.
The recruitment of fighters from 51 countries across the globe, including Europe, was spoken of as a major challenge. It was emphasised that the threat is not just to the countries that are under direct attack but also to the Middle East, Europe and the rest of the world.
 
However, several difficult questions were left unanswered. ISIS is holding 49 Turkish hostages, which is why Turkey, that shares a long border with Iraq and Syria, has refused the use of its air bases for strikes. The US kept Iran out of the Paris conference nor does it want the country to participate in the coalition. But Iran shares nearly 1500 kilometres of its border with Iraq. It’s also not clear if air strikes in Syria will be conducted and who would be in control once the mission will reach an end.

Centre slams Pak envoy s clean chit to SaeedIndia slams Pak for clean chit to Hafiz Saeed
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 15, 2014

India hit out at Pakistan on Monday over its remarks that Hafiz Saeed had no case against him, saying he was the “evil” mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks and it was up to Pakistan to bring the chief of terror outfit Jamat-Ud-Dawa (JuD) to book.
The development cast a fresh pall — after the foreign secretary-level talks failure — on the strained India-Pakistan ties that had rekindled hopes of improvement following Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to India during Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony.
“Our views on Hafiz Saeed are very clear. To us, he is the evil mastermind of the attacks on Mumbai and one of the accused in an Indian court for the killings on streets of Mumbai. We have repeatedly asked Pakistan that he should be apprehended and taken through normal judicial process,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.

“Alas! He has never been arrested on account of 26/11. Therefore.... he is only free because he is a Pakistani citizen,” he added.
His statements came in reaction to Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit's remarks that “Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around.”
Basit also said, “So what is the problem... he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned. Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him.”
The exchange of words came close on the heels of India calling off foreign secretary-level talks with its neighbour last month following Basit’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
There has been a deadlock in dialogues between the two countries after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which armed gunmen unleashed a reign of terror in the city in late November and killed more than 150 people.
Asked about Pakistan’s stand that there was not enough evidence to prove Saeed’s involvement in the Mumbai attacks, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said, “99% evidence in this case is in Pakistan. That is because the entire conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. The planning for this dastardly act was done in Pakistan.”
Recently, Saeed, known for his anti-India tirade and designated as a terrorist by the US, has also accused India of indulging in “water-terrorism”.
He had blamed dams constructed in ‘Indian Kashmir’ as the reason responsible for the flood disaster that had claimed over 200 lives in Pakistan.

Non-Hindu males should carry IDs togarbaPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:38 am
One more BJP MLA in Madhya Pradesh has linked ‘love jihad’ to garba and exhorted the administration to ask the organisers to insist on identity cards and allow non-Hindu males only if they give an affidavit that they have faith in Hinduism and its gods.
“How come Muslim youth suddenly get interested in Hindu festivals when it comes to Navratri. If they want to participate they will have to believe in Hinduism. Else, they should be accompanied by either their sister or wife or mother. Garba is not just dance, it’s an expression of faith,’’ MLA Rameshwar Sharma told The Indian Express.
The 44-year-old legislator raised the matter on Monday during the district planning committee meeting in Bhopal attended by cabinet minister Gopal Bhargava, police and officials of local administration.
“What’s wrong in asking for identity and address proof before rather than after something goes wrong. Admittedly, the festival itself has degenerated due to commercialisation but that does not mean we should not remain alert to stop elements with criminal bend of mind,’’ said Sharma, who was municipal councillor for a decade before his maiden victory in the 2013 Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections from Huzur constituency in Bhopal.
The former Bajrang Dal activist organises big events like Dharma Yatra, Kanwad Yatra, Bhagwat Katha and Kavi Sammelan in the state capital.
“It does not necessarily have to be the BJP’s stand. But eventually the party and other legislators will echo what I am saying today,’’ said Sharma, the second BJP legislator after Indore MLA Usha Thakur to publicly say that non-Hindus be kept away from garba venues.
“Whether you name it ‘love jihad’ or something else it has to stop,’’ the MLA said and claimed that those present in the meeting agreed with what he said. Despite repeated attempts, Bhargava could not be contacted.

India  Vietnam call for free navigation in S ChinaSeaPranab Mukherjee with Truong Tan Sang in Hanoi on Monday.
Written by Abantika Ghosh | Hanoi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:26 am
India and Vietnam sent out a stern message on Monday to “concerned parties” by reiterating that the “freedom of navigation in the East Sea/South China Sea should not be impeded”. Among the seven agreements India and Vietnam signed are a $100-million credit line for defence procurement for Vietnam — including patrol vessels — and a letter of intent between ONGC Videsh Limited and PetroVietnam for exploration of new oil blocks.
Though the joint statement by President Pranab Mukherjee and Vietnam President Truong Tan Sang did not name any country, this is the second instance in recent weeks that India has chosen to send a covert message to China from foreign soil. This is the fourth year of India’s strategic partnership with Vietnam.
Though details of the defence equipment to be procured by Vietnam are still being finalised, among the items under consideration, sources say, are vessels to patrol the country’s maritime borders.
The other agreements that were signed relate to cooperation on matters pertaining to customs, animal health, transfer of technology for setting up catfish breeding and farming in India, youth affairs and a MoU between Jet Airways and Vietnam Airlines for daily flights between Delhi and Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City.
In his speech at the inauguration of an India Study Centre at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics, President Mukherjee spoke of a time when cooperation between the two countries would reach a level when it will be possible to “drive from Hanoi to Kolkata” and quoted Ho Chi Minh in describing the sustained partnership between India and Vietnam as a “cloudless sky”. “We in India consider Vietnam as a trusted friend and an important pillar of India’s ‘look East Policy’. In our cooperation in the area of defence and security, we are committed to promotion of peace in our region,” Mukherjee said in his speech.
Meanwhile, speaking to The Indian Express soon after signing the MoU, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal said: “We are looking at operating daily flights from Mumbai and Delhi from November 5. We have high hopes that the flights will do well. It will be a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. It is a joint venture with Vietnam Airlines.”

Come up with innovative ideas for relief: SC toJ&KPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:24 am
The Supreme Court Monday turned the spotlight on the Jammu and Kashmir government’s efforts to rescue and rehabilitate those affected by the flood in the state, and asked the administration to think “out of the box” to accord immediate relief to the victims.
“A tragedy like this would need out of the box solutions. You (J&K government) need to come up with innovative ideas like a floating ATM for banking operations etc. We are sure the state is not short of funds or ideas, but you have to make everything available to the victims,” said a bench led by CJI R M Lodha.
The bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman, said authorities must ensure necessary supplies such as food, drinking water and medicine reach the last of the flood-hit victims with emphasis on their rehabilitation.
The SC asked the state government to apprise it by Thursday on the ground realities. Applauding the Centre for its “wonderful job” in the rescue and relief operations, it, however, expressed its doubts if the focus was restricted to Srinagar whereas other flood-hit areas like Kulgam, Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama, Ganderbal, Baramulla and Budgam were left out.

Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its dividend.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent.
Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained.
Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.
"Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year," she said. "(There is) no reason in the world why we can't see P/Es expand." Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year.
The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87.
The Philadelphia Fed area "isn't a hub of industrial activity anymore but it's still important and it's strong," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month.
Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P's largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit.
Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain, down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.
After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent.
About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

Apple Quietly Discontinued The iPod Classic This WeekApple Quietly Discontinued The iPod Classic This Week
Posted:
reddit
The iPod Classic quietly passed away this week. It was 12 years old .
If you didn’t notice its death, don’t feel too bad. Apple didn’t make an announcement. It simply pulled the product from its website, while the world gawked at the Apple Watch and the fact that U2 is still around.
Go to the iPod section of the Apple site now, and you’ll see only three options:
While I couldn’t find the iPod Classic for purchase anywhere on the Apple site, I could find an iPod feedback page , where I left a parting remark.
By the time of its passing, the iPod Classic could hold an ungodly 160 GB worth of music , or 40,000 songs. You can't get that kind of storage any more, at least not in an Apple device.
Presumably, Apple killed the iPod Classic because its new generation of iPhones offers as many as 128 GB of storage . I’m no math major, but I’m pretty sure 128 is less than 160. If you want to stick with what's left of the iPod line, you’ll get 64 GB or less . That is, like, not nearly as much.
Apple introduced the original iPod in October 2001. At that time, it only had 5 GB of storage, enough for roughly 1,000 songs . Or, to put that in 2001 terms, HOLY CRAP THIS THING CAN HOLD 1,000 SONGS!?
In the video above, Steve Jobs introduces the iPod for the first time. It gets good around the 20:30 mark, where you’ll notice people clapping because 1,000 songs on a single device was an absolutely incredible thing back then.
Naturally, some people on the Internet were sad about the iPod Classic's demise. People like my friend Will:

@maxwellstrachan do you have time to write my entire biography
— ° Will Wiesenfeld ° (@BATHSmusic) September 11, 2014
Every generation must watch its music-listening device of choice become obsolete. For some, it was the turntable. For others, the cassette player. Presumably people once really dug the phonograph? But for a generation of us, it will always be the iPod Classic.
We’ll miss you, dear friend.

All work  no play makes Fuhu one very successful  very intense company0
You can hardly argue with the results. Fuhu says it sold nearly $196 million worth of tablets and accessories, a 66 percent revenue boost over the previous year, when its sales first landed it at the top of the Inc. 500. That Fuhu is back in the same slot again this year is a rare achievement. Only one other company has pulled off consecutive  No. 1 's in the 33-year history of the Inc. 500: energy management company Cogentrix, in 1989 and 1990.
Fuhu succeeded this time by rapidly increasing the number of products it sells, including accessories. Fujioka and Mitchell are masters of market segmentation and line extensions: You can buy a 5-inch Nabi Jr. for toddlers, a Nabi 2 for kids, and a Nabi XD for tweens — not to mention the special editions from Nickelodeon and Disney, the $70 headphones, or the $40 Nabi messenger bags. Last year, Fuhu tripled the number of stores selling its products; retail outlets now number nearly 15,000. The company also nearly doubled its ad budget in 2013.
"What Fuhu did was take a product that clearly had resonance in the marketplace, the tablet, and had an appeal to kids — they're eager to grab the iPad — and figure out a way to optimize the experience," says analyst Ross Rubin, of Reticle Research.
Now Fuhu is raising a fourth round of funding from investors including DreamWorks and Intel — and it's aiming to  go public , according to sources familiar with its plans. Bo Brustkern, a private company valuation expert and founder of Denver-based Arcstone Partners, says fast-growing tech companies typically see valuations ranging from four to 10 times revenue, a calculation that could easily value Fuhu at more than $1 billion. (Mitchell and Fujioka declined to comment.)
Fuhu now seems well along an enviable path, which Mitchell describes as a "transition from a startup to a company." But all of this success has also created an increasingly urgent challenge, one familiar to fast-expanding businesses but particularly acute at Fuhu: How do you handle the side effects of growing up?
At Fuhu, the growing pains so far have mostly taken the form of employee burnout and concerns about micromanagement. "As long as you have the right attitude and a willingness to learn, you'll succeed here," says Chris Cheong, who has worked in the business development department for two years. "But Fuhu moves very fast, and a lot is expected of you. It's not easy for everyone to embrace."
It's a familiar refrain to Mitchell and Fujioka, who are well aware that they set an exhausting pace. Neither executive has taken a legitimate vacation in the past eight years, and claim that everything would come to a halt if either did.
An employee who recently left and who asked not to be named says that the pedal-to-the-metal work style of Fuhu's top executives is "why Fuhu is successful, but it's also why people are leaving." Though the company's employee turnover rate of 15 percent is a little below the tech hardware industry average, according to research firm Radford, it's on the executives' minds.
"It's a hard place to work," Fujioka says. "We've always kind of assumed that turnover would be a part of life."
He's trying to better understand some of the causes of that turnover. Fujioka says he reads every single review of Fuhu on Glassdoor, the website where employees post anonymous (and thus often critical) reviews of companies they've worked for. Common complaints about Fuhu include: "long hours," "inexperienced managers," and executives who "micromanage."
"What we probably need to get better at is making sure that turnover doesn't result in people being upset when they leave," Fujioka says. "And we haven't ever done a very good job of that."
Now Fujioka and Mitchell are trying to fix some of those problems. Recently, Fuhu has added some employee perks, including access to a fitness trainer and a psychologist, sweets on Fridays, and catered meals. It's also replacing some seat-of-the-pants structures with more formal processes: There's now an onboarding team for new hires and a formal exit-interview process. (Departing hires once were swept out the door as quickly as possible.) Fuhu is also experimenting with paying people to leave, a practice Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh pioneered to weed out new hires who aren't dedicated to the company.
Employee perks can help improve morale, but the bigger problem for a fast-growing company such as Fuhu may be getting the founders to stop micromanaging, says J. Keith Murnighan, a Northwestern University Kellogg School professor and a leadership expert.
Fuhu has historically shunned professional managers, meaning all decisions roll up to the two top executives. Fujioka explains that part of the reason for doing so is to avoid some of the entrenched silos he has seen stymie growth at other tech hardware companies. He and Mitchell are hardly the only startup executives to insist on staying intimately involved as their company expands. Even so, says Murnighan, the model is "not sustainable. The risks of letting go seem horrendous, but they're absolutely necessary for success."

Half of China s wealthy plan to leaveHalf of China's wealthy plan to leave

Chinese buying spree for U.S. homes
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Many rich Chinese are still looking overseas for a better quality of life.
A Barclays survey of wealthy people around the world found that 47% of about 50 Chinese respondents want to move abroad in the next five years.
The main reasons: access to better education and employment for their children, and economic security.
Hong Kong is their preferred destination, followed by Canada and the United States.
Wealthy citizens of Qatar are the second mostly likely to move, with 36% of respondents saying they plan to do so in the next few years, primarily driven by efforts to secure better opportunities for their kids.
That's followed by those in Latin America -- 34% of respondents in that region plan to emigrate.
Overall, Barclays surveyed more than 2,000 individuals with over $1.5 million in assets.
Related: Why the rich are ditching their home country
It's no surprise that many Chinese say they plan to leave.
They've already overwhelmed popular investor immigrant visa programs in the U.S. and Canada. Interest was so high that Canada shut its program earlier this year. And the U.S. recently said it had run out of such visas for the Chinese.
Experts say the emigrants are looking for a brighter future for their children, to escape heavy pollution, and to find some protection against political and economic uncertainty .
"There are fewer barriers to mobility than ever before," Barclays said in the report. "More high net worth individuals are seeking secondary citizenships to help them grow their businesses abroad and to take advantage of international career opportunities."

Rupee tanks 48 paise to 1 month low of 61.13 vs dollarRupee tanks 48 paise to 1 month low of 61.13 vs dollar
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Sep 15, 2014 06:16 PM IST
The Indian rupee today plunged 48 paise, logging its biggest fall in more than five weeks, to close at over one-month low of 61.13 against the greenback following fresh dollar demand from importers and negative cues from local equities.
A strong surge in dollar overseas also kept the rupee under pressure combined with expectations of higher trade deficit data, a forex dealer said. After currency markets closed, government data showed that trade gap in August rose to USD 10.83 billion.
Against a gauge of six major global rivals, the dollar index was up by 0.23% ahead of the two-day policy setting meeting of the US Federal Reserve starting tomorrow.
Forex dealers expect early hike in interest rates by Fed after improving economy, which might induce foreign funds to withdraw money from emerging markets, including India.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local unit resumed lower at 60.92 a dollar from last weekend's close or 60.65 and immediately touched a high of 60.90.
Later, rupee met with strong resistance and dipped to a low of 61.18 before settling at 61.13, a steep fall of 48 paise or 0.79%. Previously, it had tumbled by 65 paise on August 6, 2014. The closing level of 61.13 is its weakest since ending at 61.21 on August 13, 2014.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex today plunged 244.48 points, or 0.90%, on weak global cues. FPIs/FIIs had picked up shares worth USD 40.83 million last Friday, Sebi data says.
Meanwhile, the inflation measured on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) dipped to 3.74% in August to a nearly five-year low from 5.19% in July and 6.99% in August 2013.

PSU banks can return 14-16% returns in next few daysBank Nifty
(Within the banking lot,…)
MUMBAI: The Nifty is being dragged lower by losses in Bank Nifty but PSU banks are an exception. The PSU Bank Index is not only up in trade today but gave a strong buy signal recently.
"PSU Banks are trading at very low valuations as compared to private sector banks and it has been observed historically that a revival in the economic growth invariably leads to the re-rating of these banks," said CD EQuisearch report.
"Concerns on worsening asset quality have led to the de-rating and any revival in the economic growth of the country will lead to not only reduction in further impairment of assets but also recovery in the already impaired assets," the report added.
Within the banking lot, the Bank Nifty has been making newer highs over the last two-three weeks, but the PSU banking lot was not participating.
However the CNX PSU Bank Index has given a fresh breakout and will be in action for next few days.
"There is strong action in the PSU banking stocks as well as the CNX PSU banking index. My belief is that the CNX PSU Banking index has given a strong buy signal. It should possibly test the high which it had made in month of June which is around 4000," said Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com.
"It is at about 3,750-3,760 right now and may possibly surpass 4000 levels and head toward 4300 levels. If you are talking about broadly 12-13 per cent kind of upside in the CNX PSU banking index, then the stocks could possibly go up by 14-15-16 per cent or so," Thacker added.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's comments that there was a need to change the management appointment process in public sector banks to make it more transparent also provided support to PSU stocks.
Analysts are of the view that PSU banks can give abnormal returns over a longer period of time
"GDP growth is always accompanied by improvement in asset qualities under stress of banks. While in the near term the private banks will continue to be preferred, PSU banks can give abnormal returns over a longer period of time," said Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"The main concerns of PSU banks still remain on governance, which often leads to high NPAs. However, with the new government in place, may be these concerns will give place to optimism," Bhat added.
According to Manishi Raychaudhuri, MD & Asia Equity Strategist, BNP Paribas, in the PSU banking universe, investors should stay relatively selective and cautious.
"There are a few PSU banks which simply because of their size tend to have an advantage in some situations. When some of the assets that these PSU banks have lent have a possibility of turning bad, they are in a relatively good position to absorb them because their large balance sheet size," he told ET Now.
Thacker has a buy on Oriental Bank of Commerce with the stop below Rs 288 for target of Rs 310.
He advises to buy SBI for target of Rs 2705 and keep a stoploss at Rs 2,600.
The PSU Bank Index was at 3,732.85, up 0.27 per cent against 0.62 per cent decline on Bank Nifty.
Andhra Bank rose 1.53 per cent and Bank of India was 1.24 per cent higher. SBI was down 0.58 per cent and Oriental Bank of Commerce was 1.23 per cent lower.

Apple iPhone 6 pre-orders hit record 4 mn on...Apple Inc said it received record first-day pre-orders of new phones, with over four million in the first 24 hours.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Apple Inc said many customers will need to wait until next month for their new iPhones after a record 4 million first-day pre-orders were logged, double the number for the iPhone 5 two years ago.
The company said demand had outstripped supply of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which feature larger screens and longer battery life. Deliveries of pre-orders will begin on Friday and will continue through October.
Bumper first-day pre-orders point to first-weekend sales of up to 10 million units, analysts estimated.
"Assuming preorders are similar to the 40 percent of first weekend sales for the iPhone 5, this would imply iPhone 6/6Plus first weekend sales could be around 10 million," Wells Fargo Securities analysts wrote in a note.
About 2 million pre-orders were received for the iPhone 5 in the first 24 hours after it went on sale in September 2012. Apple sold 5 million of these phones in the first weekend.
Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5Ss and 5Cs, which were launched last year, in the first three days in stores. The company did not reveal pre-order numbers for these phones.
Raymond James analysts said they expect sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to top 9 million in the first weekend.
"Apple will be selling every iPhone it can make, at least through October. Because of this, the first weekend sales are typically more indicative of supply than demand," they said.
The company routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design.
Apple's website showed last week that the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models displayed a wait time of up to a month. The 4.7-inch version was available for delivery on Sept. 19.
Janney Capital Markets analysts said the large number of pre-orders was due to "pent-up demand" for bigger iPhone screens.
The brokerage raised its sales estimate for the latest iPhones to 37.4 million units for the current quarter and 60 million for the quarter ended December.
"We believe significant demand will even spill into the March and June quarters given supply and the timing of shipments in China," Barclays analysts wrote in a note.
The company said the new iPhone models will be available to customers in its stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and some other countries on Friday morning.
AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp, T-Mobile US Inc, Verizon Wireless and some Apple authorized resellers will also start selling the phones on Friday.
The phones will come equipped with Apple's new payments service, "Apple Pay", which launches in the United States next month and allows users to pay for items in stores with their phones.
Apple's shares were up less than 1 percent at $102.92 Monday afternoon.

Android One devices to make smartphones aff...Indian-American Pichai said the Android One phones launched in India have lots of processing power, so that users can get information quickly.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Introduction of Android One phones in the Indian market is aimed at making powerful smart phones with latest technologies accessible and affordable to the people of the country, Google said today.
"By working closely with phone and silicon chip makers to share reference designs and select components, we're making it easier for our partners to build phones that are not just great to use, but also affordable," Sundar Pichai , senior vice president, Android, Chrome & Apps at Google said in a blog posted on the company's website.
Indian-American Pichai said the Android One phones launched in India have lots of processing power, so that users can get information quickly.
"They have high-quality front- and rear-facing cameras. And for all those pictures, along with your apps and videos, Android One phones will have expandable storage. We also added features that people in India will find particularly useful, like dual SIM cards, a replaceable battery and built-in FM radio," he said.
To help ensure a consistent experience, Android One devices will receive the latest versions of Android directly from Google,, he said, adding that as a result the users will get all the latest features, up-to-date security patches, and peace of mind knowing your stuff is always backed up.
"It also means Android One devices will be some of the first to be updated to the Android L release later this year.
"For our hardware partners, they'll be able to create customized experiences and differentiate their devices without having to change the core software," he wrote.
Pichai announced that in an effort to reduce data costs, if an user has an Airtel SIM card, they will get these software updates for free for the first six months.
"As part of this same Airtel offer, you'll also be able to download up to 200MB per month worth of your favorite apps (that's about 50 apps overall) from Google Play--all without counting toward your mobile data usage," the top Google executive said, adding that this is just the "beginning of the Android One journey".
The first phones, from Google hardware partners Micromax, Karbonn, Spice and chipmaker MediaTek, are available starting today in India from leading retailers starting at Rs 6,399.
"We're also excited to welcome more partners to the program, including phone manufacturers Acer , Alcatel Onetouch , ASUS , HTC , Intex , Lava , Lenovo , Panasonic , Xolo , and chipmaker Qualcomm. "We expect to see even more high-quality, affordable devices with different screen sizes, colors, hardware configurations and customized software experiences," he said.
"Finally, we plan to expand the Android One program to Indonesia, the Philippines and South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) by the end of the year, with more countries to follow in 2015," Pichai said.
"Access for access's sake is not enough. With Android One, we not only want to help people get online, we want to make sure that when they get there, they can tap into the wealth of information and knowledge the web holds for everyone," Pichai said.

These are the 12 drugs sending the most kids to the emergency roomBy Abby Phillip September 15 Follow @abbydphillip
In this photo illustration, bottles of the generic prescription pain medication Buprenorphine are seen in a pharmacy. Buprenorphine is the No. 1 drug implicated in unsupervised prescription medication ingestions among children, according to a new study. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Every year, more than 70,000 kids are taken to the emergency room because they accidentally overdosed on a medication, and most of those kids were less than 2 years old.
Despite efforts to child-proof medication containers for both prescription and over the counter drugs, more young children are being sent to the emergency room because of their parents' prescription drugs every year, according to a new study.
The report, which was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics , found some alarming statistics: just 12 types of drugs accounted for more than 75 percent of child hospitalizations and 12 specific medications alone or combined sent 45 percent of kids to the hospital.
Researchers, led by Maribeth Lovegrove, an epidemiologist in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Medication Safety Program, used adverse drug event data from 2007-2011 to look closely at 1,513 cases of emergency room visits of children who had accidentally taken prescription drugs.
They found that three of the 12 substances that sent the most kids to the ER were pain medications, including ingredients in Oxycontin and Vicodin. But several others were for treating chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety, sleeplessness and depression. With some 23 percent of adult Americans suffering from  high blood pressure and 10 percent living with diabetes alone, these drugs are likely to be present in a lot of U.S. households.
More needs to be done to improve child safety packaging and educate patients about the risks to their children, the study found.
Here are the 12 medications that are implicated in 45 percent of hospitalizations between 2007 and 2011:
1. Buprenorphine - treats chronic pain
Brand name drug: Subutex
2. Clonidine - treats high blood pressure
Brand name drugs:  Catapres and Kapvay
3. Glipizide - treats type II diabetes
Brand name drug: Glucotrol
4. Clonazepam - treats seizures, anxiety
Brand name drug: Klonopin
5. Metoprolol - treats high blood pressure
Brand name drugs: Lopressor® Toprol® ¶  Toprol® XL
6. Lorazepam - treats anxiety, depression, insomnia
Brand name drug: Ativan, Lorazepam
7. Lisinopril - treats high blood pressure
Brand name drugs: Prinivil, Zestril
8. Amlodipine -  treats high blood pressure
Brand name drugs: Amvaz, Norvasc
9. Bupropion - treats depression, aids smoking cessation
Brand name drugs: Aplenzin, Budeprion, Wellbutrin, Zyban, Componet in the new diet drug  Contrave
10. Glyburide - treats type II diabetes
Brand name drugs:  DiaBeta, Glynase, PresTab, Micronase
11. Hydrocodone - treats chronic pain
Brand name drugs: Vicodin, Panacet
12. Oxycodone - treats chronic pain
Brand name: Oxycontin, Percocet

$70: Alibaba s newest magic numberEMAIL
AP
Demand for Alibaba’s IPO this week is so strong the company Monday increased its initial price range to between $66 and $68 a share.
As USA TODAY reported Friday , large instititions are so hungry for the shares, the initial price range of between $60 and $66 a share looked to be too low. That strong demand allowed the company and its underwriters to boost the price range on the initial public offering to between $66 and $68. That’s just below the $70 a share where demand seems to be strongest, says Francis Gaskins of Equities.com.
Investors are gearing up for Alibaba’s shares to start trading Friday in what is expected to be the largest U.S. initial public offering in history, raising north of $20 billion. Billions of dollars will be made as the company raises money in the deal along with early investors including Yahoo that are selling portions of their stakes.
If Alibaba is able to sell its stock at $68 a share, that would give the company a commanding market value of $170 billion. At that valuation, the company would be the 23rd most valuable U.S. company, in line with Intel (INTC) at $171 billion, but ahead of Amazon.com (AMZN) at $153 billion and even Disney (DIS) at $154 billion. Amazon has plenty of its own secret reason to fear Alibaba.
The only U.S. tech companies that would still be worth more than Alibaba are Apple (AAPL) , Google (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Facebook (FB) , International Business Machines (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) .
Initial public offerings, though, are fluid leading up the deal. Things can quickly change and investors continue to mull over the prospectus and decide what the shares are worth.
The increase in the price range indicates that the company should have no trouble selling the 320.1 million shares as expected Thursday night. The stock is seen to start trading Friday morning.

This war is not about theUSNew York Times | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:07 am
By: Thomas L. Friedman 
There are three things in life that you should never do ambivalently: get married, buy a house or go to war. Alas, we’re about to do No 3. Should we? President Obama clearly took this decision to lead the coalition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, with deep ambivalence. How could he not? Our staying power is ambiguous, our enemy is barbarous, our regional allies are duplicitous, our European allies are feckless and the Iraqis and Syrians we’re trying to help are fractious.
There is not a straight shooter in the bunch. Other than that, it’s just like D-Day.
Consider Saudi Arabia. It’s going to help train Free Syrian Army soldiers, but, at the same time, is one of the biggest sources of volunteer jihadists in Syria. And, according to a secret 2009 US study signed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and divulged by WikiLeaks, private “donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” Turkey allowed foreign jihadists to pass into and out of Syria and has been an important market for oil that ISIS is smuggling out of Iraq for cash. Iran built the EFPs — explosively formed penetrators — that Iraqi Shiite militias used to help drive America out of Iraq and encouraged Iraq’s Shiite leaders to strip Iraqi Sunnis of as much power and money as possible, which helped create the ISIS Sunni counter-revolt. Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, deliberately allowed ISIS to emerge so he could show the world that he was not the only mass murderer in Syria. And Qatar is with us Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and against us Tuesdays and Thursdays. Fortunately, it takes the weekends off.
Meanwhile, back home, Obama knows that the members of his own party and the Republican Party who are urging him to bomb ISIS will be the first to run for the hills if we get stuck, fail or accidentally bomb a kindergarten class. So why did the president decide to go ahead? It’s a combination of a legitimate geostrategic concern — if ISIS jihadists consolidate their power in the heart of Iraq and Syria, it could threaten some real islands of decency, like Kurdistan, Jordan and Lebanon, and might one day generate enough capacity to harm the West more directly — and the polls. Obama clearly feels drummed into this by the sudden shift in public opinion after ISIS’s ghastly videotaped beheadings of two American journalists.
OK, but given this cast of characters, is there any way this Obama plan can end well? Only if we are extremely disciplined and tough-minded about how, when and for whom we use our power. Before we step up the bombing campaign on ISIS, it needs to be absolutely clear on whose behalf we are fighting. ISIS did not emerge by accident and from nowhere. It is the hate-child of two civil wars in which the Sunni Muslims have been crushed.
There will be no self-sustained stability unless those continued…

And then the watersroseStatements coming from the chief minister do not indicate that there are reassuring, competent professionals in government with a handle on ongoing relief measures.

As August slipped into September, Kashmir was its usual idyllic, picturesque self. The evening sun was gentle and golden, readying to welcome the next phase of the tourist season. Jewellery shops at Lal Chowk were open on Sundays, heralding the wedding season. Citizens in areas like Rajbagh, Gogji Bagh, Sonawar and Jawahar Nagar were tending their gardens for the next burst of chrysanthemums. Roads were lined with shops signifying new development activity. They had modern glass facades and offered the latest in tiles, taps, wall paint, cement and upholstery. The banks of the Jhelum were finally landscaped after lying unkempt for over 40 years. Impending elections added to the sense of activity, with local predictions from Muslims and Hindus alike that the BJP could well form the next government in the state, albeit perhaps in coalition with the PDP. It was expected to do well in Jammu and Ladakh and pick up a few seats in the Kashmir valley to stake a claim. Most had given up on the National Conference.
A visitor familiar with the turbulence in Kashmir over the last 25 years would have noticed the sense of security, stability and well being manifested by the frenetic construction activity going on in most areas, from large new houses along the airport road to renovations in private dwellings and craft workshops and showrooms in the inner lanes of the old city. Within the city, one could see hostile wall slogans like “India go back” in only two or three places. Most local residents toss off questions about the Hurriyat Conference’s Syed Ali Shah Geelani or Yasin Malik with dismissive comments about their irrelevance. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah had recently taken to defending the cosy tea party between the Hurriyat and the Pakistan high commissioner. The people described this as a sure sign that he felt politically weak and insecure. They recalled how even Sheikh Abdullah at one time, and during the last decade the PDP, had done the same.
This backdrop is necessary as a contrast to the grave natural disaster that hit the state of Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir overnight. The prime minister of India lost no time in personally assessing the damage and lending support to the disaster management effort. The defence services, which have been the target of politically organised dissent for so long, have pulled out every stop to rescue stranded citizens.
Today, several individuals are caught in a strange contradiction of their own making as they praise the army for itsrescue but curse the media for publicising this.
Disaster brought forth offers of mutual assistance from the political leadership of India and Pakistan, although Pakistan’s elected leader continued…

Withering away of arevolutionBy: C R Sasikumar
Written by R K Vij | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:06 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 7:57 am
The recent surge in the surrender of Maoist cadres, particularly in Dandakaranya, seems to be a reality check for the protagonists of Maoist ideology, who claim that only a protracted armed struggle can bring about social transformation in a class-ridden society. Maoists of all hues — members of military formations or the People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), political formations and the Janatana Sarkar (people’s government) — are leaving the so-called “revolutionary” path they had pledged to tread when joining the movement against the feudal and semi-colonial ruling class. The romance of the armed struggle for capturing power is, perhaps, waning.
There are three main reasons for the surrender of Maoist cadres. The first and foremost is the realisation of the futility of the (people’s) war. More than three decades of violence have not produced any convincing results. Whatever existed in the name of development has been vandalised by the Maoists. An ex-president of the Janatana Sarkar in the Indravati (Maad) area, venting his frustration while surrendering, said that he was fed up with the Maoists’ lofty claims and false promises of realising collective party goals, and that the party has little to show in terms of achievements. Another cadre said he had joined the Maoists because he had seen only Naxalites in the jungles of Maad. But when he encountered the real world outside Maad, he decided to join the mainstream. A former member of the Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), said the party could no longer charm people with its revolutionary songs and dances to make them join up. Despite their serious efforts, more cadres are now leaving than joining. People’s support, the cornerstone of any revolution, has been eroding steadily.
Second, the police’s continuous persuasion has resulted in a change of mind and heart in many cadres, who had been brainwashed by the Maoists. The police have been approaching Maoists’ family members with the government’s surrender and rehabilitation (S&R) schemes. A “back-home” programme initiated by the former Gadchiroli superintendent of police, Suvez Haque, and followed by many others has proven efficacious. This has also helped the police gain the trust of Maoist cadres who have become disgruntled with their decision to tread the path of bloodshed. Often, pamphlets are distributed in local markets and hung in remote areas, so that the message of returning to the mainstream may reach wandering Maoist cadres. One dalam commander on surrender revealed that when such posters were being put up by a villager, he had grabbed one and decided to surrender with his weapon, as it carried a huge reward. The media, due to its pervasiveness, has also played a significant role in spreading awareness of such schemes.
Third, many Maoist cadres are deserting because of personal reasons. After tying the marital knot in forest camps, they are not allowed to enjoy married life. Therefore, many couples are surrendering. The killings continued…

Windmills of themindPrint
Posted: September 16, 2014 2:02 am
The Narendra Modi government has come face to face with the perils of crowdsourcing, which it had deployed to give people precisely what they want, including a sense of agency and participation in government. Can power be generated from the wind of passing trains, wondered a former bank official, and he shot off a letter to the PMO. The quest should have stopped there, for anyone with a passing acquaintance with school physics would know that the intermittent passing of trains cannot keep windmills turning. And whoever is now in charge of wit and humour at the PMO should have added that since almost all Indian trains are slow and late, their capacity to deliver wind power is pathetically meagre.
But maybe the humour portfolio has been abolished in the new PMO. In a display of inhumanly efficient automatism, the letter was forwarded to the railways ministry. And ever since, the babus at Rail Bhavan have been busy keeping various players updated on the developmental status of this stillborn idea — the originator, the chairman of the Railway Board and the PMO.
Certainly, all ideas related to alternative energy should be entertained. Some pretty incredible products are already in development. A tattoo battery powered by human sweat can charge an iPod. Sugar-powered batteries and supercapacitors made of marijuana fibre are serious projects. In Stockholm and Paris, human body heat harvested from subway stations is being used to heat buildings. But usually, ideas about new energy sources violate the first or second laws of thermodynamics. A railway windmill isn’t half as bad — it is only financially implausible. Even so, it should have been stopped dead at the PMO. Crowdsourcing is an exercise in smart filtering, but so far, it would appear that the government doesn’t have the smarts for it.

Sorabh Pant talks about his new book ‘Under Delhi’, and says his protagonist is his female version, only more fearless
Sorabh Pant gets annoyed when he comes across headlines that scream ‘Seventeen year old raped…’ “Shouldn’t we focus on the perpetrator of the crime, shame him and say, for example, a 45-year-old man committed the act. The story should also be about the man who did it and not just the girl,” he argues.
He has been getting irked by sexist remarks made by politicians, god men and others when heinous crimes against women make headlines. Sorabh didn’t stop at outraging on social networks. He gave vent to his thoughts through a story of a female vigilante based in New Delhi, in his new book Under Delhi (Hachette; Rs. 299).
The idea, he says, wasn’t triggered after the Delhi incident involving a 23-year-old paramedical student. “The Delhi incident had very little to do with the book. The story had been brewing for about five years. I have a sister and six women cousins and I’ve heard them talk on a lot of issues concerning women,” he says.
Under Delhi tells the story of Tanya Bisht, a young vigilante who takes offenders to task, guided by a certain mysterious ‘Soniaji’. “Tanya is a culmination of many people I know. To an extent, she is my female version, more fearless. My personal observations have gone into making her who she is and how she looks at things. She is a regular girl, at the receiving end in her office,” says Sorabh. His protagonist is also disturbed, battling her inner demons and is a victim of date rape.
Wouldn’t it have been possible to have a vigilante who isn’t a victim? “I did a lot of research on women who’ve been through abuse and came across stories of hope, where women have risen above their situation. I wanted Tanya to be like one of these women. Tanya is indecisive, flaky and the only thing she is sure of is her vigilantism. She is still trying to figure out who she is,” he says.
The morbid humour was a given, taking into account Tanya’s past. Sorabh concedes, “I like writing dark humour. The territory within which Tanya works calls for this kind of humour,” he says.
The book makes references to vigilante groups in India such as the Red Brigade from Lucknow and pokes fun at people in general and those in power who resort to moral policing and cast an accusing look at victims. Even the ‘dented and painted’ remarks come under the scanner. “Women who belong to the Red Brigade are trained in martial arts; there have been many other incidents, like the ‘pink panty initiative’ that came up as a repercussion to statements made about women and rape. The story has references to all such movements,” says Sorabh.
Under Delhi is a linear narrative, like his debut book The Wednesday Soul. Though it took him nearly four years to develop the story, the writing process, he says, didn’t take him very long. As he moves from one place to the other performing stand-up comedy acts, there’s another story brewing, waiting to be written. “My next will blend history, mythology and politics,” offers Sorabh.

Veterinarian explains the high-risk surgery required to remove a tumor from George the goldfishBy Elahe Izadi September 15 Follow @ElaheIzadi
A beloved pet goldfish in Australia that underwent emergency surgery is now "swimmingly well," according to a veterinarian at the animal hospital. (Reuters)
Goldfish: the reluctant carnival prize, the fish you don't expect to live more than a year or two, the pet you resign yourself to flushing down the toilet once it meets its maker.
But wait a minute -- you don't have to give up on a sick goldfish!
George, a 10-year-old goldfish in Australia, had a relatively large tumor on its head. So George's owners brought the fish to Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Melbourne, where a veterinarian successfully performed surgery on the pet. According to the hospital , the procedure last week went ... "swimmingly."
Post by Lort Smith .
How do you operate on a goldfish? Well, first you call someone like Tristan Rich, head of Lort Smith's exotic and wildlife veterinarian team.
Rich set up numerous buckets with different levels of anesthetics, as the hospital's Facebook post described . Once George was knocked out, Rich ran a tube into the fish's mouth to pump water with a smaller dosage of anesthetic so that he remained under.
Next, the doctor removed a "large tumor" from George's head, using a specific type of medical sponge to help control George's bleeding. The size of George's wound made it "difficult to seal," according to the hospital. Rich managed to put in four rows of stitches, then used tissue glue to seal the rest of the wound.
George was then placed in a recovery unit and given oxygen, pain relief injections and antibiotics. The goldfish took a couple of breaths on his own, and he was back swimming in no time. The entire procedure lasted about 45 minutes, the Sydney Morning Herald reported .
Post by Lort Smith .
The brain tumor had grown over the course of the year, and Rich told Yahoo7 News of Australia that "the fish was having trouble eating, getting around and he was getting bullied by other fish."
Rich told the Sydney Morning Herald that he gave George's owners "the option of trying to take [the tumor] off, or putting him to sleep." But the owners were "quite attached" to George, he said, and wanted to do everything they could to save his life.
George's owners, Lyn Orton and Pip Joyce, have 39 goldfish, some as old as 18, they told the Herald Sun , which reported that they paid $200 for the surgery.
The procedure "was so impressive, everyone was just amazed," Orton said. "Now he could live for another ten, maybe 20 years," she added. Her beloved fish, she said, “are not just things in the water ... they’re characters."
Rich told 3AW radio in Australia  the procedure was "high-risk" and that he has performed goldfish operations a few times before.
Here's some footage of George swimming around back home, post-surgery, with his many buddies:
If only this type of goldfish medical procedure was available in the 1980s, then perhaps Dr. Huxtable wouldn't have to have held a solemn funeral for Lamont the Goldfish in this "Cosby Show" episode:

How Facebook  Twitter and Blake Shelton solved a Sept. 11 mystery 13 years in the makingBy Caitlin Dewey September 15 Follow @caitlindewey
A Sept. 11 mystery 13 years in the making has — through the collective power of Facebook, Twitter and country music’s Blake Shelton — finally been solved .
Every year since the attacks, Elizabeth Stringer Keefe has attempted to identify the people in a wedding photo one of her friends found in the debris near ground zero. The image, faded and torn in places, seemed to have come from someone’s desk — and the fate of both owner and subjects could only be guessed at. So Keefe paged through photos of the deceased, looking for someone from the picture. She repeatedly posted the image to Twitter and Facebook, begging anyone with information to respond.
Every year on #911 I post this photo hoping 2 return 2 owner. Found at #groundzero #WTC in 2001. Pls RT pic.twitter.com/mZ9LdQqE7x

On Friday, someone finally did: His name was Fred Mahe, and in the image, he’s the gentleman on the left.
@ProfKeefe I KNOW THE PEOPLE IN THE PICTURE! I was at the wedding.
— Fred Mahe (@FredWMahe) September 12, 2014
Mahe worked on the 77th floor of the second World Trade Center tower, but was not in the building when it collapsed. Neither was any member of the wedding party, in fact: Everyone in the picture is still alive. The bride and groom, Christine and Christian Loredo, live outside of San Francisco and have a 6-year-old son.
Attention wonderful world: ALL SIX PEOPLE ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND I HAVE JUST SPOKEN TO ONE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!! #Happyending #911photo

“I think it’s nice to know that people out there care so much for strangers,” Christine, the bride, told ABC News over the weekend. “It gives me confidence in humanity.”
But, with no offense intended to Keefe (whose persistence was, honestly, both heart-warming and remarkable), maybe it should give her confidence in network theory, too. After all, there’s a reason the photo went viral this year, when it didn’t go viral all the long years before. For the first time, it hit what information scientists call the epidemic threshold — the point at which a thing reaches enough nodes in the network that it can’t easily die out.
To be clear, network theory is really complex and mathematical, and I’m simplifying here. But when information moves through a social network , it doesn’t move at random: The information pings from one “node,” or person, to another, and the relationships between all those thousands of nodes create an intricate geography of influence and power. When we refer to someone as a “power user” on a platform like Twitter, it means that they’re a very influential node, or connector , in the network. And when we say something goes “viral,” we actually mean that its spread through the network mirrors the spread of a disease: fast, multi-nodal and self-replicating.
Keefe’s photo never “went viral” before, because it never hit the epidemic threshold. It never reached enough nodes outside of her immediate network.
But when the image was shared first by a popular Boston news account, @universalhub , and then by Blake Shelton, that changed. This is the message Shelton retweeted:
pic.twitter.com/bv9hzHmAdr @ProfKeefe is looking for the owner of this photo found at ground zero 2001 @blakeshelton can you RT pic to help?
— Monica Rabbitt (@MlynnrabbMonica) September 12, 2014
The story was promptly picked up by outlets like Buzzfeed and Gothamist, both of whom cover viral media. A friend of Frank Mahe read Gothamist. And just like that, a mysterious photo was reunited with its owner, courtesy one very persistent professor … and a country music star.
Keefe is now enjoying the completion of her decade-long quest. She and Mahe met in New York this morning; she tweeted that she’d be returning the photo to him, after its 13 years hidden in a novel on her bookshelf. Shortly before 8 a.m., she posted another photo to Twitter: a selfie with Mahe, both of them grinning into the camera.

Britain on thebrinkScottish First Minister Alex Salmond has sold freedom as a lollipop, a sweet to be enjoyed on its own merit.
Posted: September 16, 2014 2:11 am
It’s the passionate poetry of freedom versus the cold prose of facts, the sweetness of “yes” against a churlish “no”. On September 18, more than 40 lakh Scottish voters go to a poll on whether to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent nation. The stakes for both are existential. A poll of opinion polls on September 10 put the break-up vote at 48 per cent and unity vote at 52 per cent. But on the ground, the razor’s edge is sharper.
Blame the existence of the referendum on glorious British democracy and a little bit of smugness. Self-rule powers have been devolved to Scotland for decades, giving it a parliament. Yet the Scots voted the separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) to power in 2011. This implied that a sizeable number of people in Scotland wanted to leave Britain, and British Prime Minister David Cameron had little choice but to give them a clear vote. Cameron could go down in history as the PM who presided over the end of the 300-year-old union, but when the referendum was announced in late 2012, everyone thought it was a good idea. Why would they leave, anyway?
But with the “yes” campaign gaining ground, the unthinkable might occur, and it has to be asked: What happens if Scotland votes “yes”? Shock and horror and casualties all around. A huge constitutional logjam lasting years. Actual independence would come only in 2016; in between, there is the British general election in May 2015, in which Scots would still vote and send 59 members of parliament to London. In the current parliament, 41 are Labour MPs and only one is from the ruling Conservative Party. If Labour comes to power, its government could fall in May 2016, when Scottish MPs leave, forcing new polls. More crucially, would this lame duck government have the legitimacy to negotiate the terms of separation? If not, who would? In any case, Cameron’s career is probably over, as perhaps of Labour leader Ed Miliband.
SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has all the romance of a freedom fighter. He says he will “keep” the queen and the pound sterling, and never hassles himself with facts. Well, the queen looks unlikely and the pound impossible. There will be no currency union with England and a one-sided use of the pound means “free” Scotland will have no freedom to run its monetary policy and, indeed, its economy. Then there is the certainty of massive flight of capital and business to England. Welfare and borrowing costs will be crippling, and a future like Greece or Spain in deep debt looms.
Also, once Scotland leaves the UK, entry into the EU is not automatic and would continued…

Scottish referendum: Media caught in crossfire as D-day nearsprint
The pro-independence campaign has accused the BBC of becoming the ‘British Biased Corporation’ for allegedly favouring the ‘No’ campaign that wants Scotland to remain the United Kingdom, a charge that spilled over to journalist groups and others.
Nearly 1,000 ‘Yes’ supporters converged on BBC’s Scotland office, carrying placards against the political editor, Nick Robinson, asking that he be sacked for allegedly heckling their leader, Alex Salmond, during an interaction last week. Expressing its concern at the “increase in intimidation and bullying of journalists covering the independence referendum”, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) on Monday called for people on both sides of the campaign to rein in the abuse being directed at its members.
Meanwhile, campaigning for the last time before the referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron appealed on Monday to the ‘head and heart’ of the Scots to ensure a ‘No’ vote. Cameron was expected in Aberdeen — the hub of Britain’s North Sea offshore oil and gas industry, almost all of which would come under Scottish control in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote. ‘Yes’ leader Salmond pointed out that several business leaders were in favour of independence. Queen Elizabeth’s remark on Sunday that Scottish voters should “think very carefully about the future” before casting their votes was interpreted as favouring their respective sides by both the camps.

Pak envoy gives clean chit to 26/11 mastermind Saeed  India sees redIndia slams Pak for clean chit to Hafiz Saeed
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 15, 2014

India hit out at Pakistan on Monday over its remarks that Hafiz Saeed had no case against him, saying he was the “evil” mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks and it was up to Pakistan to bring the chief of terror outfit Jamat-Ud-Dawa (JuD) to book.
The development cast a fresh pall — after the foreign secretary-level talks failure — on the strained India-Pakistan ties that had rekindled hopes of improvement following Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to India during Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony.
“Our views on Hafiz Saeed are very clear. To us, he is the evil mastermind of the attacks on Mumbai and one of the accused in an Indian court for the killings on streets of Mumbai. We have repeatedly asked Pakistan that he should be apprehended and taken through normal judicial process,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.
Read: Hafiz Saeed our national, free to roam around: Pak envoy
“Alas! He has never been arrested on account of 26/11. Therefore.... he is only free because he is a Pakistani citizen,” he added.
His statements came in reaction to Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit's remarks that “Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around.”
Basit also said, “So what is the problem... he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned. Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him.”
The exchange of words came close on the heels of India calling off foreign secretary-level talks with its neighbour last month following Basit’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
There has been a deadlock in dialogues between the two countries after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which armed gunmen unleashed a reign of terror in the city in late November and killed more than 150 people.
Asked about Pakistan’s stand that there was not enough evidence to prove Saeed’s involvement in the Mumbai attacks, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said, “99% evidence in this case is in Pakistan. That is because the entire conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. The planning for this dastardly act was done in Pakistan.”
Recently, Saeed, known for his anti-India tirade and designated as a terrorist by the US, has also accused India of indulging in “water-terrorism”.
He had blamed dams constructed in ‘Indian Kashmir’ as the reason responsible for the flood disaster that had claimed over 200 lives in Pakistan.

Netflix s French connectionBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz September 15, 2014: 11:54 AM ET
 
Vive le streaming! Netflix enters France
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Are Parisians ready for some "Orange est le Nouveau Noir?"
Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) entered the French video streaming market Monday, and the new media company is set to debut in several other European nations soon as well.
Netflix first announced plans to move into France back in May. It also plans to launch in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg before the end of the year.
Although French cable companies are expected to fight hard to keep customers from cutting the cord and embracing Netflix, the European expansion plans have been met with rave reviews from Wall Street.
How do you say "bufffering" in French?
Shares of Netflix are up nearly 30% in 2014 and are not far from their all-time high. Investors also love the fact that Netflix's streaming subscriber base is growing rapidly in the United States.
In fact, Netflix may soon top another milestone. The company is now worth $28 billion ... slightly less than the $30 billion market value for television network owner CBS ( CBS ). (It reminds me of the classic line by Hyman Roth to Michael Corleone in "The Godfather, Part II" about how big their criminal operation had become: "We're bigger than U.S. Steel!" Sadly, this movie is not available for streaming on Netflix.)
Soon to be bigger than old media? Surpassing CBS in market valuation would be yet another sign of how new media is disrupting the business models of the old TV and movie establishment.
CBS owns the most watched TV network in the U.S., not to mention the Showtime cable channel, a giant nationwide radio network and book publisher Simon & Schuster. (It's worth noting that Comcast ( CMCSA )-owned NBC was tops with the 18 to 49 year-old demographic that advertisers covet in the 2013-2014 season though.)
Related: Netflix is one of the top performers in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index
As companies like CBS continue to try and adapt to the changing ways that people watch television, Netflix is winning customers and investors. Wall Street expects Netflix's earnings to increase more than 40% a year, on average for the next few years. Analysts are forecasting annual profit growth of 15% for CBS.
But Netflix stll needs old media: Of course, that 15% growth rate for CBS is not too shabby. And you could argue that CBS and other "old media" giants like Disney. ( DIS ) Fox ( FOXA ), Viacom ( VIAB ) and CNNMoney owner Time Warner ( TWX ) are important parts of Netflix's success as well.
 
The Golden Age of binge TV watching?
While Netflix has been busy building out its own library of exclusive content such as "Orange is the New Black" and "House of Cards," the company also needs other big media firms to keep churning out hits as well.
Consider how popular "Breaking Bad" from AMC ( AMCX ) is on Netflix as many people started to binge-watch it after hearing the strong word-of-mouth reviews.
Related: AMC CEO says 'zombies are thriving'
And Netflix recently paid up for the streaming rights of "Gotham," a new Batman origin story that will air on Fox this fall. (Gotham is produced by Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNNMoney parent Time Warner.) Netflix also just scoped up streaming rights for NBC's "The Blacklist," a drama with James Spader that was one of last season's biggest new hits.
Is the stock overvalued? But even if you've already ditched cable and only watch shows on Netflix, should you buy the stock at these lofty levels?
Shares trade at more than 70 times 2015 earnings estimates, a gigantic premium to all the older media companies.
What's more, Netflix still has a long way to go before it can top the revenue figures of the big media firms. It is expected to report sales of nearly $7 billion in 2015. That's impressive -- but it's less than half of what analysts are forecasting for CBS next year.
So it would be a mistake to say that Netflix is killing old media. It's a symbiotic relationship. And that will probably be the case in Europe and other new markets Netflix looks to enter as well.

Need to boost India  US trade to $1 tn: Thin...Barack Obama
("A surge provides an opportunity…)
WASHINGTON: Ahead of the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama later this month, an eminent Indian think-tank today said the two nations need to take steps to increase their bilateral trade to $ 1 trillion by 2030.
The paper titled The India-US Partnership: $1 Trillion by 2030, by Mumbai-based Gateway House, released here argues that to elevate the bilateral trade from $ 120 billion in 2013 to $1 trillion in 2030, the two countries need to adopt a different path for its bilateral trade.
It says the paths should be based on hockey-stick curve more typical of tech start-ups and one that will bring India into the group of the three other countries outside the G7 , which have a deep economic tie with the US: Israel, Mexico and South Korea.
Authored by Nish Acharya, a senior advisor at Northeastern University, the paper identifies four positions for India and the US to pursue for the success of the engagement.
Technology, then as now, presents the springboard for the future of a vigorous India-US partnership, it says.
In order to tackle India's development challenges, it is necessary to create a 'surge'-- a rapid and intense deployment of talented individuals and technical experts to address the critical and immediate challenges -- in areas such as energy, infrastructure, healthcare and agriculture, the paper says.
"A surge provides an opportunity to invite companies and experts from the US to begin working on these critical areas," it said.
Noting that technologies can create millions of new jobs and opportunities in India, the thinktank said India needs to build a Silicon Swadesh -- a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem, modelled on Silicon Valley -- to support homegrown innovation and entrepreneurship.
According to the paper, India needs to build a ramp for poverty alleviation which would enable the 42 per cent of Indians that live under the World Bank poverty line of $1.25 a day to access the services of NGOs and social entrepreneurs.
"The country needs to take advantage of next generation technologies for which it is well suited, such as synthetic biology, 3D printing, mobile, social and big data, to create an industrial base in India from which products and services can be sold and jobs created," it said.
The US is a pioneer in many of these technologies, and a fruitful collaboration between the two countries would involve mainly research and sales, the paper said.
Observing that Indian-Americans have contributed largely to the entrepreneurial, small business and healthcare sectors in the US, the research paper says India can continue to feed skilled professionals in the US.
The thinktank says the US can leverage the customer base of 100 million Indians who study and work abroad and maintain a connection to the US throughout their lives as their relatives reside there.
Prime Minister Modi will meet President Obama at the White House on September 29 and 30, US officials said.

The International Criminal Courts big missBy Eugene Kontorovich September 15
The International Criminal Court suffered a major setback earlier this month when it was forced to suspend its prosecution of Kenya’s President Kenyatta because of a lack of cooperation from his government.
A failed case against, say, a senator, would be a cause for reckoning in most district attorneys’ offices. A failed run at a sitting head of state is a big deal. As Omar Little would say, “You come at the king, you best not miss.”
Interestingly, international law commentators, usually quick to publicize on ruminate and the significance of every little move of the Prosecutor, have been fairly quiet about this one.
The Kenyatta case is notable in that it is the Court’s first against a sitting head of state, as opposed to deposed or defeated leaders. I explain the significance for international law in a new piece :
The ICC distinguishes itself from its predecessors, the “ad hoc” criminal tribunals such as Nuremberg and Yugoslavia, by claiming jurisdiction over sitting heads of state and ongoing conflicts. Until now, international justice was always a kind of victor’s justice, because it depended on the defeat of the accused. The conceit behind the ICC was that international law had grown strong and respected enough that it could take on the current leaders of actual countries without fighting them first.
Yet thus far in the court’s twelve years of operation, it has completed only three cases, with one resulting in an acquittal. The defendants it has dealt with have not been the high and mighty, but rather a motley crew of guerilla warlords and deposed despots. They all had one thing in common: They no longer held any power, and their prosecution was simply a coda to their military and political defeat by their enemies.
Kenya did what undefeated countries can do: It cleverly slow-walked its cooperation with the international community. If Iran can do it for much higher stakes in Geneva, why would others not be able to do it at The Hague? There have also been very serious allegations of intimidation of the prosecution’s witnesses. Kenya has full control over the “crime scene” and all the witnesses. All the prosecutor has control over is a staff in The Hague.
The only provision for dealing with recalcitrant states is a talking-to from the obscure “Assembly of State Parties,” which does not seem interested in dealing with the Kenyan debacle. African countries had long been outraged by the prosecution of the case, insisting against the rather clear language of the ICC treaty that heads of state should be immune. Indeed, Kenya has apparently suffered little to no diplomatic consequences from first electing candidates under indictment for mass atrocities and then having them use their new positions of power to shut down their prosecution in The Hague. There have not been popular protests or agitation by human-rights groups, threats of economic sanctions, or boycotts.
The Court’s failed run at Kenyatta reminds us that while victor’s justice sounds bad, there is simply no such thing as victim’s justice.

SpiceJet tops occupancy for 3rd straight mnt...SpiceJet tops flight occupancy figures for the third straight month in August
Anirban Chowdhury, ET Bureau Sep 17, 2014, 01.18AM IST

DGCA
(SpiceJet in July posted…)
MUMBAI: Low fare carrier SpiceJet topped flight occupancy figures in the industry for the third straight month in August, although it ceded second position to Jet Airways after ousting it in July.
The carrier managed on average to fill 82.5% of its flights during the month, according to figures from DGCA . In comparison, market leader IndiGo just managed to fill 74.8% of its flights.
SpiceJet has been filling its planes by dint of its repeated offers of rockbottom fares across its network. The airline's rationale as explained recently by its COO Sanjiv Kapoor is that "it's a crime to fly empty seats"
SpiceJet in July posted industry-best load factor figure 79.4% during July. In June too, it had the industry's highest seat occupancy levels at 81.4%.
For the month of August, SpiceJet occupied 19.5% of the market, while Jet Airways together with its subsidiary JetLite regained the number 2 position with a 20.1% market share.
Last month, SpiceJet had become India's number 2 carrier with a 20.9% share while Jet and JetLite were relegated to the number three position a 19.6% share. Since then Jet has been offering aggressive pricing schemes, which experts fear will hamper its margins even as they help fill its planes.

How not to draftregulationGiving any one bank the power to inflict a boycott by all banks is a throwback to the age of khap panchayats. (Source: Reuters photo)
Written by Ajay Shah | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:14 am
The September 9 ruling of the Gujarat High Court has raised questions about RBI regulations on “wilful default”. While India needs to do much more to strengthen the rights of creditors, this should be grounded in the foundations of liberal democracy. Our well-justified outrage about the misbehaviour of some borrowers does not warrant losing sight of constitutional principles.
Say there are two persons, P and Q. You have a contractual dispute with P. When P becomes unhappy with you, the law requires Q to punish you. That is, the coercive power of the state, which forces Q to punish you, is being placed at the disposal of a non-state actor, P, without checks or balances. Such an arrangement would raise many questions.
The RBI’s approach to wilful default is similar. If a bank, P, determines that your default is wilful, all other banks are forced to punish you. P gives you a bad name, and then all other banks, Q, are forced — by RBI regulations — to hang you. The formal processes of enforcement are missing. Non-state actors don’t have the appropriate skills or incentives when it comes to justice. There is no mechanism for judicial review either. The RBI’s regulations on wilful defaulters violate principles of the rule of law.
A khap panchayat engineering a village-wide boycott against someone it deems to be an offender is not the rule of law. If a law has been broken, the case should go through the due process of a chargesheet and a judge, and then the state should punish the guilty. Giving any one bank the power to inflict a boycott by all banks is a throwback to the age of khap panchayats. The September 9 Gujarat High Court ruling expressed some of these problems. But the trouble with the RBI’s regulation on wilful default runs much deeper. India does have a problem with promoters who borrow and then fail to repay.
But our outrage with their behaviour does not justify abandoning the foundations of liberal democracy. We must not indulge in knee-jerk responses. The way forward involves solving the deeper problems of corporate bankruptcy while being anchored in sound legal philosophy.
We must question the tag, “wilful”. Debt is a contract, and default is a violation of the contract. The intent of the person who violates the contract is impossible to assess and irrelevant for the purpose of enforcement. What we need is a bankruptcy code, which kicks in when firms default. The establishment of the T.K. Viswanathan Committee by the ministry of finance is a key initiative in economic policy reform. This bankruptcy code must be grounded in the rule of continued…

Social Media Week 14 to focus onchangePrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:28 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 8:26 am
The world’s foremost experts and influencers of social media from across the globe — including politicians, diplomats and authors — will gather in Mumbai for the country’s third and the city’s second edition of the Social Media Week (SMW 2014). To be held between September 22 and 26, the theme this year will be ‘Social Media for Social Change’.
The organisers have announced a diverse list of speakers including diplomats and political experts such as head of News, Politics & Govt @TwitterIndia Raheel Khursheed, Indian Ambassador to the Arab Republic of Egypt Navdeep Suri. The list also includes representatives from the country’s largest corporations and experts in social media such as Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly, president and country head of OgilvyOne Worldwide (India) Vikram Menon, co-founder of 1+99 Experience Consulting Anaggh Desai, chairman of Manipal Group Mohandas Pai and Forbes #1 Social Media influencer and co-founder of the Huffington Post “Twitter Powerhouses Series” Sean Gardner.
Organisers said the event will see the speakers delve into their own experiences to share their knowledge and insights through various sessions, including those on managing diplomacy through social media, social media and politics and building a career in social media. “I’m very excited to see organisations and brands from different industries coming on board to curate sessions and make it the biggest crowd-sourced festival. I look forward to the five days of social media festivity. I’m quite sure that there is a lot more awaiting the audience,” said Rohit Varma, founder and managing partner, R SQUARE Consulting Services Pvt Ltd.
SMW 2014 will take place in 12 cities simultaneously — Berlin, Chicago, Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Mumbai, Rome, Rotterdam, São Paulo, Sydney, Toronto. All the high-powered events will be streamed live for audience across the globe. The SMW schedule is live at http://socialmediaweek.org/mumbai/schedule/ now.
The event is aimed at focusing on the way digital India thinks and functions and links to social change. “We are looking forward to engaging with marquee speakers at this platform, which connects people across borders and backgrounds; this year’s theme of the impact of social media on social change, will definitely bring to light, some interesting perspectives on how digital India thinks,” said Nikhil Dey, president (public relations) at Genesis Burson-Marsteller.
The rapid growth of the initiative is reflected in the interest it has generated in sponsors, partners and speakers — with companies such as Microsoft (City Support Sponsor), Germin8, Unmetric, KPMG, UL and Wrangler coming forward to support the event.
While elucidating the manner in which Social Media Week acts as a platform for dissemination and sharing knowledge, C V L Srinivas CEO GroupM South Asia, said, “After a successful opening year in Mumbai and Bangalore in 2013, SMW is lining up an exciting fare this year. As social media channels proliferate and become meeting grounds of brands and consumers, SMW provides a great platform for enhancing knowledge and sharing best practices.”
In addition, SMW has partnered with leading media and integrated communication agencies, including The Express Group, Social@Ogilvy, Chlorophyll, UB, TiE Mumbai, continued…

Ujjain varsity V-C office vandalised over appeal to help J&KstudentsPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:25 am
Objecting to Ujjain university vice-chancellor J L Kaul’s appeal to landlords to show leniency towards Kashmiri students, a group of VHP and Bajrang Dal activists allegedly ransacked his office on Monday forcing the administration to provide him with security.
The university teachers and staff, meanwhile, have called a strike Tuesday to protest the vandalism and to demand quick arrest of activists involved in the incident.
While it was unclear if Prof J L Kaul, who became vice-chancellor of Vikram University six months ago, was manhandled, he was admitted to ICU in a private hospital and was likely to be discharged at night.
In the wake of unprecedented floods in J&K, Kaul had appealed to local landlords not to insist on early rent given that the students may have lost touch with their families and could face cash crunch for some time. Kaul had also said the university will organise a camp to help them and that local residents and social organisations could pitch in with help.
Raising slogans, a group of more than 20 activists stormed Kaul’s office and after a brief chat set about smashing glass panes and computers. They wanted him to withdraw the appeal in retaliation to stone pelting at Army personnel engaged in rescue operations in the Valley.
Ujjain SP Anurag told The Indian Express that it was difficult to explain the vandalism allegedly by VHP and Bajrang Dal activists. He said an offence had been registered against unknown persons but based on television footage and other sources the police would make arrests on Tuesday.
After calling on the VC at the hospital, the SP said his condition was better and that he did not suffer any injuries. As a precautionary measure, police guards have been posted outside the V-C’s bungalow and university premises. The SP said Kaul was immediately provided security.

Kalyan youth who joined ISIS callsfamilyPrint
Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:22 am
Kalyan youth Saheem Tanki, who has reportedly joined Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), recently called his family saying he and two of his friends were alright.
His phone call on September 7 comes days after he informed his family on August 26 about the death of his friend Areeb Majeed in the fighting. Areeb, Saheem, Fahad Sheikh and Aman Tandel went missing in May and were later reported to have joined the ISIS. “He said he was fine. When his mother said she was very ill and she wanted him to return, Saheem asked her to take care and said he would definitely return but did not specify a time and date,” said a relative of Saheem who did not wish to be named.
Saheem’s mother then enquired about Aman and Fahad, and he only said that they both were in good health, the relative added. Saheem had also hinted at his return in his earlier call on August 26, when he informed his family about Areeb’s death. “I am in good health and will return soon,” he had told his brother Farzaan at the time.

FIR against Sanjay Sinh son afterclashPrint
Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:19 am
An FIR has been registered against Anant Vikram Singh, son of Congress MP Sanjay Sinh, for criminal conspiracy and against others for murder in connection with the killing of a constable in Amethi on Sunday.
Constable Vijay Mishra, 45, was killed and six persons injured in a clash between police and Anant Vikram’s supporters, who had gathered outside Sanjay Sinh’s ancestral house to prevent his (Sanjay’s) entry.
In a press conference in Amethi Monday, Sinh blamed his ex-wife Garima for “instigating and misusing the public of Ramnagar for personal gains”.
“I have not known Garima Singh for the past 25 years. There has been a conspiracy to prevent me and Ameeta (his second wife) from entering our own house. The locks have been broken and my house has been trespassed. Section 144 of CrPC was in place but the locals of Ramnagar were motivated for personal gains,” said Sanjay Sinh. “Anant had been living with us for past 20 years and had no problem. My marriage with Ameeta was with the consent of the entire family, including my children,” he added.
Sinh expressed grief over the constable’s death and said “the incident was the result of Anant’s immaturity”.
Meanwhile, Anant and Garima demanded that the Syed Modi murder case be reopened by the CBI.
Modi, husband of Sanjay Sinh’s second wife Ameeta Sinh, was shot in Lucknow in 1988. The case was closed by the CBI in 2009 as the motive could not be established.
Garima said, “It is sad that people are giving it the name of a property dispute, when actually this is the fight for my rights.”
Anant said: “Not only me and my mother but also Syed Modi’s brother has demanded re-opening of the murder case.”

Letters to the editor: Roll upsleevesPrint
Posted: September 16, 2014 2:17 am
This refers to the thought-provoking editorial, ‘After the deluge’ (IE, September 15). It is creditworthy that The Indian Express obtained a first-person account from J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on the serious charges against his “missing” government. Going by his explanation, Abdullah appears to have done whatever possible in those trying moments. Yet, there can be no two ways about the fact that this unprecedented disaster took the government by utter surprise owing to its ill-preparedness. It is unfortunate that things turned out the way they did despite the timely issuance of wake-up calls by various state agencies. Since the floods have already caused unprecedented damage, no real purpose would be served if we endlessly debate the allegations against the government. It’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. The service rendered by the armed forces is also creditable, as is the voluntary work done by several civilians and NGOs.
— S.K. Gupta (Panchkula)
Ground zero
Apropos ‘Now toilets scheme for urban areas’ (IE, September 15), in addition to providing toilets for slum dwellers in urban areas, the government should make it mandatory for all buildings with a super area of more than 50,000 square feet to have public toilets on the ground floor, as is the case with the old Indian Oil Bhavan on Janpath. This will ensure that people do not relieve themselves on the walls of the buildings. This is one of the best corporate social responsibility initiatives that a company could undertake.
— P.C. Xavier (Delhi)
On passion
This refers to the editorial, ‘Reset, go’ (IE, September 15). While India participates in international sporting events like the Olympics, it doesn’t really make an impact. Sportspersons feel they are not trained properly or given respect. But the US doesn’t do well at football, in spite of its facilities. That’s because it’s not only about training infrastructure, it’s also about the passion people have for a game.
— Abhishek Jha (Derabassi)
Hon’ble squatters
It is disgraceful that some former MPs continue to occupy official bungalows despite the repeated eviction notices served to them (‘NDMC gets tough on overstaying ex-MPs, disconnects power, water to bungalows’, IE, September 14). The NDMC has done the right thing by disconnecting power and water supply to their houses to ensure compliance. If this action does not yield the desired results, they should be evicted forcibly.

Dont poke your nose in UGC affairs  SC tellsHRDPrint
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:16 am
The Supreme Court on Monday censed the Union HRD Ministry for its “intrusive attitude” and “unwarranted interference” in the working of the University Grants Commission (UGC).
“We can see there is unnecessary interference by the ministry. It is totally unwarranted. You (HRD) cannot thrust your decision on the UGC. UGC is an autonomous body and it needs to be left to work as such. What is the point of having a separate statutory body if the ministry has to control everything at every level?” said a bench led by Chief Justice of India R M Lodha.
“Don’t poke your nose into everything. It is not required at all. UGC has to work independently and intrusion on your part is not right,” said the bench also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by Symbiosis International University (SIU) against the UGC’s decision to block its proposal for setting up an off-campus centre in Hyderabad.
The UGC had decided at its meeting on July 22 that the proposal could not be recommended in view of the HRD Ministry’s policy on deemed universities and their expansion. It had also considered reports by the UGC expert committee, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the Bar Council of India (BCI).
However, when asked by the bench, the UGC counsel disclosed that the final decision was taken after also taking note of the HRD Secretary’s comments. The court then asked why the HRD Ministry was involved in the decision-making process, since the UGC was expected to apply its mind independently.
Appearing for the government, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar said the UGC panel must have a member from the ministry. The court retorted: “You can be a member and also be an active member but you cannot thrust your decision.”
The bench maintained that the expert committee had, in fact, given its opinion in favour of the SIU’s off-campus plan on fulfillment of certain conditions, but it appeared that the UGC went by the HRD Ministry’s views.
When Kumar said the UGC was merely a recommendatory body and the final decision rests with the government, the bench said the ministry could decide once the UGC sends its recommendations, but it could not scuttle the statutory process. The bench then quashed the UGC’s July 22 resolution, and asked it to assess the SIU’s request afresh “with an open mind” and take a decision in three weeks.
Meanwhile, SIU’s lawyer Ram Jethmalani sought permission to let the university go ahead with admissions, but the court turned down the request, saying the UGC and the government must first take a decision.

Oil hits two-year low at $97; dollar rises ahead of US FedSave precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Brent crude fell below $97 per barrel on Monday, its lowest in more than two years, as weak Chinese economic data cut the prospect for global demand at a time of abundant supply, while expectations that the Federal Reserve will provide new details this week about its plans to raise interest rates lifted the dollar.
Chinese factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August as growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown.
The Brent contract for October delivery, which expired on Monday, fell as low as $96.21 a barrel, its weakest since July 2012. The contract later pared some losses to settle down 46 cents at $96.65 a barrel. The November contract for Brent fell 8 cents a barrel to settle at $97.88.
News that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak will meet OPEC officials on Tuesday in Vienna was cited as helping pull oil prices off lows.
"Maybe the pullback on the China data was a little overdone," said Gene McGillian, an analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, echoing the sentiment of other analysts.
US crude rose 65 cents to settle at $92.92 a barrel.
The dollar rose on expectations the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will affirm the US economy's steady recovery at the end of a two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday and possibly provide a timeline as to when it would start to raise rates.
US manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with steadily rising factory activity. That was confirmed by other data showing factory activity in New York state jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September.
The euro fell 0.21 per cent against the dollar to $1.2937, while the dollar index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, traded flat at 84.243. The Japanese yen slipped 0.12 per cent against the dollar to 107.19.
Most US stocks fell, dragged lower by the tech sector as investors made space in their portfolios for Alibaba's planned initial public offering later this week, and biotech shares weighed further on the Nasdaq.
"The Alibaba IPO is going to have a big effect, drawing money out of some stocks, and how it performs can help say a lot about the tech sector," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Oil giant Chevron, up 1.5 per cent at $124.53, added the most points to the Dow's rise.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.34 points, or 0.27 per cent, at 17,032.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.78 point, or 0.04 per cent, at 1,984.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 45.42 points, or 0.99 per cent, at 4,522.18.
MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance across 45 countries fell 0.18 per cent to 425.42.
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares closed down 0.05 per cent at 1,382.32.
US Treasury debt prices rose on bargain hunting encouraged by fresh signs of spotty economic growth, which might slow the Fed's shift away from loose monetary polices.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.5887 per cent.

After UN  Modi to visit 9/11 GroundZeroPrint
Encouraged by the steps taken by the Modi government in its first 100 days, the Obama Administration sees an India that is of great strategic significance and can act as a stabilising force in the entire Asia Pacific region.
Written by Ritu Sarin | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:14 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 8:20 am
Quite a few surprise elements have added a twist — both symbolic and substantive — to PM Narendra Modi’s four-day visit to the United States where he will address the United Nations General Assembly on September 27.
Government officials have said that following his UNGA address, the PM will visit Ground Zero, the site of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in downtown New York which were brought down in terror attacks on September 11, 2001. He is also likely to tour the new 9/11 museum and memorial inaugurated by US President Barack Obama in May.
Following the tour, Modi has agreed to the inclusion of an unconventional item on his agenda. He will visit the much-publicised Global Citizens Festival in the Great Lawn of the Central Park, held every year to coincide with the UNGA. The day-long festival is visited by several celebrities and musicians and organisers have said over 40,000 free tickets will be distributed. As per the current schedule, Modi is slotted to speak for 15 minutes at the Central Park event, the theme of which is ending global poverty by 2030.
“This is basically organised by prominent NGOs,” said a top government official. “They invited the new Indian PM and he decided to visit them.’’
Official sources confirmed some key bilateral and diplomatic engagements. On September 27 itself, Modi will hold consultations with Sheikh Hasina, the PM of Bangladesh, as well as with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Said a senior diplomat, “The meeting with the Sri Lankan President is still somewhat tentative but we expect it will happen.’’
Besides attending a reception at the Indian Consulate, Modi is scheduled to meet former US President Bill Clinton. On September 29, Modi will leave for Washington for his much-anticipated bilateral engagement with Obama.

Five economic hurdles for breakaway ScotsIndependent Scotland’s prosperity hinges on five challenges
By Chris Giles, Economics Editor
©Getty
Scotland’s “Mini-Me” economy is far from an oasis of riches or a pit of despair within the UK. Levels of income, unemployment, labour productivity and inequality are remarkably similar to the combined average for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Completely integrated after 307 years of union, Scotland shares the economic institutions of the UK, its tax system and its powerful insurance mechanisms that support troubled economic areas such as Northern Ireland and extract money from hotspots such as London.
More
Fall in number of inactive young Britons
The one big difference is oil. Scotland’s public finances would be a mess if it did not receive the vast majority of oil revenues after independence, leaving its initial prosperity and prospects dependent on the terms of divorce. Thereafter, an independent Scotland’s economic prospects would hinge on its ability to raise its game. The following five considerations will be paramount.
Currency
An independent Scotland should assume the rest of the UK would refuse to enter a formal currency union. Economists think the best available option would be initial unilateral use of sterling – soon followed by the establishment of a Scottish central bank and currency.
Such an option is unquestionably feasible and could bring currency stability if the Scottish central bank pegged the Scots pound against sterling, much as Denmark fixes the krone to the euro. The trade-off would be the requirement for higher foreign exchange reserves necessary to defend a currency peg and a lack of economic flexibility that floating exchange rates can bring.
The main risk is capital flight, from Scotland and its banks, from people who might fear future depreciation and would prefer their financial assets to be denominated in sterling, euros or dollars. As Neville Hill of Credit Suisse has said: “It’s not whether Scotland will stay in the pound, but whether the pound stays in Scotland.”
Reserves
To defend a currency peg, an independent Scotland would need foreign exchange reserves substantially in excess of the £15bn that Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, says would be in the “upper end of the range” the country could reasonably expect to inherit from the UK. To match the level of reserves held by Denmark as a share of national income, Scotland would need £34bn.
Ronald MacDonald, a University of Glasgow professor who has been working with the pro-union campaign, says the need to accumulate reserves would represent “a recipe for austerity” that would result in the end of any pegged currency with sterling. Scotland might be able to borrow the money to build foreign exchange buffers at the cost of creating exchange-rate risk either for the Scottish people or its creditors. Such borrowing might therefore be very expensive.

Public finances
The division of the UK’s assets and liabilities would involve tortuous negotiations. With the UK’s public finances already stretched, Angus Armstrong and Monique Ebell write in the latest Oxford Review of Economic Policy that on any reasonable division, an independent Scotland would begin life “with a substantial debt burden”, forcing spending cuts or tax increases “for many years” that were more restrictive than the UK has faced since 2010.
Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, would be tempted to carry out a threat not to accept that any UK debt was Scottish, but there would be a price to pay, as Scotland would need the UK’s support in matters such as its application to join the EU.
Assuming a division was seen as fair on both sides, Scotland would be likely to face tougher spending cuts and tax rises than England as oil revenues declined into the medium term. The nationalists say official forecasts for oil revenues are too pessimistic, but they have been persistently over-optimistic in recent years.
Productivity
In the long run, an independent Scotland’s prosperity would rest on the nation’s ability to raise its growth rates to sustain higher living standards. This would require more productivity – that is more output for every hour worked or capital used than now.

PM begs Scots to avoid painful divorceFarage people know Ukip not a protest vote
Mr Cameron used a speech to party activists to warn Scottish voters that a Yes vote would be irreversible and would constitute a “painful divorce”.
“If Scotland votes Yes, the UK will split and we will go our separate ways for ever,” the prime minister said.
He repeated the warning he gave last week not to use the referendum as an opportunity to punish his Conservative-led government. “If you don’t like me, I won’t be here forever,” he said.
And in an emotional plea on behalf of other Britons without a vote, the prime minister said: “I speak for millions of people across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and many in Scotland too, who would be utterly heartbroken by the break-up of our United Kingdom.”
With polls showing guarantees of further devolution could help win over undecided voters, Mr Cameron signed up to a timetable to grant further powers to the Scottish parliament proposed by Gordon Brown , the former prime minister.
He promised to publish draft legislation by next January on “a major, unprecedented programme of devolution” with extra Scottish powers over tax, spending and welfare.
Mr Cameron’s personal intervention in Scotland on the independence debate on Monday stands in contrast to a cross-party campaign to save the union which he has largely delegated to others.
More video
Downing Street justifies this approach by saying its aim is to place the prime minister above the fray of normal politics. “The last thing we wanted was for this to be England versus Scotland; the Tories versus the SNP; Cameron versus Salmond,” said one Number 10 adviser.
But there have also been practical considerations. Aware of his unpopularity in Scotland as a southern English, Eton-educated Conservative, Mr Cameron told the Commons in January: “I humbly accept that while I am sure there are many people in Scotland who would like to hear me talk about this issue, my appeal doesn’t stretch to every single part.”
Given their respective ratings north of the border, Mr Cameron was desperate to stop Alex Salmond turning the referendum into a popularity contest between the two men, and ruled out from the start taking part in a televised debate with the nationalist first minister.
Instead, the prime minister hoped to emphasise the status of his office, making set-piece speeches to invited audiences, such as that he delivered in Edinburgh in February 2012 when he evoked the names Adam Smith, David Hume and Keir Hardie in defence of the union.
That initial speech in Edinburgh set the tone for the prime minister’s subsequent campaigning, which has been occasional, carefully controlled and usually focused on the positive case for the union.

NEW YORK: Apple had more than 4 million advance orders of its new iPhones in the first 24 hours, exceeding its initial supply, the company said today.
The company said the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be delivered to customers starting Friday and throughout September, but many won't be delivered until October.
Phones will still be available Friday on a walk-in basis at Apple retail stores and from various wireless carriers and authorised Apple resellers.
Apple's website had intermittent outages last Friday because of heavy traffic as orders began online. The company said the 4 million orders set a new 24-hour record.
It did not immediately say what the old record was. Last year, Apple sold 9 million phones in the first three days they were on sale.
The new phones were announced last week and have larger screens, faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments at retail stores by holding the phone near the payment terminal. The phones start at USD199 with a two-year service contact.
The phones will initially be available in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK Availability will expand to more than 20 additional countries a week later.
A free update to Apple's iOS software for phones will be available to existing users on Wednesday. The new phones will come with that update, iOS 8.
Apple's stock rose 30 cents to USD 101.96 in midday trading today.

Toyota pauses on Mexico expansion to review ...Toyota pauses on Mexico expansion to review growth strategy
By Reuters | 16 Sep, 2014, 02.43AM IST
The upshot was that a decision on the expansion is unlikely before the start of 2015, two Toyota executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING/NAGOYA: Toyota Motor Corp is reconsidering a move to open a new compact car assembly plant in Mexico after company President Akio Toyoda told planners searching for a site to pause and review its rationale, executives familiar with the matter said.
According to four Toyota and group executives, momentum had been building for a decision this summer on the expansion, with the aim of starting production of the mass market Corolla in Mexico in a few years. But Toyoda then asked the team to "re-review" the project by year's end, the people said.
"There's absolutely no unused capacity lying around anywhere in North America? Installing production capacity to try to trigger growth is the old way that got us in trouble before," one of the executives said, referring to questions Toyoda posed in asking for a comprehensive last-minute re-examination.
The upshot was that a decision on the expansion is unlikely before the start of 2015, two Toyota executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
One said Toyota would probably go ahead with the plant, but might scale it down or delay the start of construction.
Toyota already has a pick-up truck plant in the northwestern Mexican state of Baja California, capable of producing 63,000 Tacoma vehicles a year, but does not have any capacity for passenger cars.
A company spokesman said Toyota had not made any decision on a new plant in Mexico.
"We are always evaluating our production capacity in Mexico, and in North America generally, to keep it in line with local market demand, but no such decision has been made at this time," the spokesman said.
The agonising over further expansion encapsulates the strategic dilemma facing the 58-year-old company chief, who took charge of the firm founded near 80 years ago by his grandfather in 2009 after a 15-year hiatus without a member of the Toyoda clan at the helm.
Toyoda - the "d" was replaced by a "t" in the company name when a new logo was launched in 1936 - inherited a broken company that had just posted the first operating loss in 70 years.
He blamed the slump and a subsequent massive global recall crisis in 2009-10 on what he described at the time as his predecessors blind pursuit of volume and high margins and sought to refocus on product and quality, placing the company under a three-year global ban on adding new capacity through 2016.
Now, with global volumes and profits recover steadily, Toyota bosses are asking whether the time is right to step on the gas pedal again by installing new production facilities.

Growth in other sectors also cooled, raising fears that China may risk a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK/LONDON: Gold rose on Monday after weak Chinese factory data, but the precious metal hovered just above an eight-month low as investors worried that the Federal Reserve may start hinting at plans to raise US interest rates sooner than expected.
Gold prices fell early in the session, but bounced as the S&P 500 equities index edged lower after data showed China's factory output grew in August at the weakest pace in nearly six years.
Growth in other sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may risk a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures.
Investors will watch the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as it starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Some believe the Fed could signal that it may begin raising rates sooner than mid-2015, the current target for many economists.
"The combination of increased shorts and low volume for gold ahead of the FOMC meeting may indicate that investors have built up expectations for a degree of hawkish tone in the upcoming FOMC statement," said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
Spot gold was last up 0.4 per cent at $1,233.20 an ounce by 3:11 p.m. EDT. Early in the session, it fell to its lowest since January at $1,225.30.
US COMEX gold futures settled up $3.60 at $1,235.10 an ounce.
Support for gold came from lower equities and the unwinding of some short positions built in the past few weeks. Gold is usually considered a hedge against risk, but its price could be pressured if the Fed raises interest rates, giving investors a better return on fixed-income assets.
In the physical gold market, imports in India, the world's second-largest gold user behind China, rose to $2.04 billion in August, up 175 per cent from a year earlier.
Silver inched up 0.1 per cent at $18.58 an ounce. On Friday, silver touched its lowest since June 2013.
Holdings at the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rose to a record high as a pullback in prices prompted long-term retail investors to increase purchases of the precious metal.
Platinum fell 0.2 per cent to $1,357.25 an ounce, while palladium was down 0.2 per cent at $831.75.

Linking meat exports and terrorism  Maneka glosses over a fewfactsPrint
Written by Anil Sasi | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:40 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:45 am
Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi’s pointed reference to milking animals being “slaughtered and illegally traded” seems to have overlooked a couple of significant facts — that India’s cattle herd outnumbers that of the US, Europe and China put together, and per capita beef consumption at less than 2 kg a year is the lowest in the world.
Moreover, meat export is one of the most tightly-controlled trades. There are just 53 registered meat abattoirs and 39 meat processing plants across the country that qualify to export consignments. Meat exports have almost doubled in rupee-terms over the past two years, up from Rs 14,000 crore in FY12 to over Rs 27,000 crore in FY14. And the biggest buyers are southeast Asian countries.
While India, as the minister pointed out, is the biggest beef exporter, having overtaken Brazil in 2012, what she did not mention is that India is home to the world’s largest cattle herd with 327 million head, followed by Brazil (197 million head), China (104m), the US (90.8m), the European Union (86.5m), Argentina (49.3m), Colombia (30.9m) and Australia (29.6m), according to the US Department of Agriculture data.
Also, India’s aversion to beef has translated into meagre 2.1 million tonnes consumption domestically a year compared with 11.5 million tonnes a year in the United States, which has just a quarter of India’s population. A 2012 UN Food and Agriculture Organisation report places India at the bottom of the list of 177 countries on meat consumption, with Luxembourg at the top consuming 136.5 kg per person per year.
Data from APEDA — an autonomous body under the Department of Commerce — reveals that bulk of exports is buffalo meat, debunking allegations of cattle (cow, calves and bulls) slaughter. Moreover, buffalo, goat and sheep meat exports are incentivised. In other words, this acts as a disincentive for exports of cow meat and, hence, there are no significant contraband meat consignments. The fiscal incentives include duty credit scripts equivalent to 5 per cent of FOB (free on board) value of exports. In the case of meat and meat products, this was made available from April 2008 to compensate for high transport costs.
What is interesting is that the surge in exports of meat products over the past three years is despite the financial assistance extended by APEDA to meat exporters coming down steadily during the time period: from Rs 20.48 crore (FY12) to Rs 18.86 crore (FY13) and then to Rs 14.61 crore last fiscal. According to APEDA estimates, of the 17.85 lakh tonnes of meat shipments from India in FY12, over 60 per cent (11.08 lakh tonnes) was meat from buffaloes.
Under the Centre’s Meat Export Policy, the export of beef — meat of cow, ox and calf — is prohibited and only buffalo that “are not fit for milch and breeding purposes are allowed to be slaughtered for exports”. Controls on the trade include the condition that each export consignment is accompanied by a certificate that the meat has been derived from buffaloes unfit for continued…

Xi arrives tomorrow  wants Modi on board for Southern SilkRoadPrint

Written by C Raja Mohan | Tengchong (yunnan) | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:35 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 12:44 pm
At the edge of China’s long border with Myanmar, this town could one day become the heart of the ancient Southern Silk Road that President Xi Jinping wants to rebuild with India. It is not clear if Xi can persuade Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join in China’s vigorous effort to connect the two nations through Myanmar and Bangladesh. But try he will.
In the year-and-a-half that he has taken charge as the President of China, Xi Jinping has made the Silk Road initiative a central plank of his regional policy. Last week in Tajikistan, Xi won support for his initiative on developing a Silk Road Industrial Belt between China and Central Asia.
This week in Maldives and Sri Lanka, Xi is pitching for support of his plans for a Maritime Silk Road linking southern China with the Indian Ocean. Xi is eager for India’s participation, especially in the revival of the Southern Silk Road now called the BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar) Corridor.
As Xi arrives, his plans for Southern Silk Road awaits Modi’s backing very much part of Tengchong’s memory and imagination. Local tour operators say Tengchong is 700 km from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province; but Myitkyina in northern Myanmar is only 50 km from and the Indian border begins at 600 km to the south west.
With China’s heartland far away to the north east of Yunnan, trade with the subcontinent and beyond has been a very important part of Tengchong’s long history. It was the centre of the Southern Silk Road that is said to predate the Northern Silk Road running from Xian, the ancient capital of China to the Mediterranean.
The Southern Silk Road flourished for centuries. Large horse caravans travelled between Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, northern Myanmar, and eastern India. They moved goods and ideas, traders and monks across this vast and difficult terrain.
Living on the frontiers of the Chinese empires, the people of Yunnan see long distance trade and commerce as central to their lives. Local folklore here says when a young man wanted a bride in the past, he had to prove his credentials by travelling abroad on a trade mission.
As late as the early 19th century, Tengchong had bigger trade volumes than Canton in southern China that would later become the throbbing heart of Beijing’s global trade. Once it got control of Burma, the British Raj set up a consulate here at the turn of the 20th century. The local government is restoring the consulate building destroyed during continued…

Inflation falls to 5-yr low but RBI may holdratesNo point in cutting rates to see inflation pick up again: Rajan
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:23 am
Headline inflation softened to an almost five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may prefer to wait for a couple of more months and not cut interest rates when it reviews the monetary policy on September 30. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation is the lowest since October 2009, when it stood at 1.8 per cent.
India has always been comfortable when WPI-based inflation is at 4 per cent or less. The August print of 3.74 per cent is partly attributed to a statistical base effect and sub-$100 global crude oil prices. Headline inflation in July stood significantly higher at 5.19 per cent, and the RBI kept the repo rate unchanged at 8 per cent in its August policy review.
While the government released the WPI data at 12 noon, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said at a banking summit earlier in the day that inflation remained high, both in food and non-food items. Economists said the lower inflation would not have a bearing on RBI’s review a fortnight later. The central bank is keen that prices do not rise again due to a pick up in the growth momentum.
Friday’s WPI data showed that food prices, including that of vegetables, wheat, rice and cereals, declined in August. Food articles inflation moderated to 5.15 per cent, compared to 8.43 per cent in July. Vegetables became cheaper by 4.88 per cent, with onion prices declining as much as 44.80 per cent during the month. The inflation in fuel and power category stood at 4.54 per cent, down from 7.40 per cent in July.
Rajan, who did not have the headline inflation data with him when he spoke to bankers, said, “The best solution for the country is to bring it (inflation) down. Then I can cut interest rates… I have no desire to keep interest rates high for even a second longer. I want to bring down interest rates when it is feasible and that would be when we have won the fight against inflation… There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation pick up again.”
Consumer Price Index inflation, an equally if not more important economic data the RBI takes into account while deciding on its policy, also moderated a bit to 7.8 per cent in August, compared to 7.96 per cent in July. But it is yet to reach the comfortable 6 per cent target that RBI wants to achieve by January 2016.Enthused by the decline in inflation, the industry was quick to demand a rate cut. “Going forward, the strengthening of monsoon in September, recent policy measures to lower inflation and a drop in global food prices to a four-year low should further help contain food prices… Coming shortly before the monetary policy, this should also provide the necessary manoeuvring continued…

Alibaba now plans to raise up to $25.03 billion in its upcoming IPO, making what was expected to be the biggest stock market debut even bigger.
ET SPECIAL:

NEW YORK: Alibaba now plans to raise up to $25.03 billion in its upcoming IPO, making what was expected to be the biggest stock market debut even bigger.
The Chinese e-commerce company said it still plans to sell 368.1 million shares, but at $66 to $68 apiece, according to a regulatory filing, instead of its previously set range of $60 to $66 apiece.
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has emerged as a hot commodity because of its e-commerce bazaar, a shopping magnet for businesses and consumers alike as China's economy steadily grows. The company's network of sites includes Taobao, Tmall, and AliExpress, as well as Alibaba.
Most of Alibaba's 279 million active buyers visit the sites at least once a month on smartphones and other mobile devices, making the company attractive to investors as computing shifts away from laptop and desktop machines.
Investors have been salivating over the trifecta of growth that Alibaba offers: "There are very few companies that are this big, grow this fast, and are this profitable," said Wedbush analyst Gil Luria. He initiated coverage on the company with a 12-month price target of $80.
The company's revenue in its latest quarter ending in June surged 46 percent from last year to $2.54 billion while its earnings climbed 60 percent to nearly $1.2 billion, after subtracting a one-time gain and certain other items.
Alibaba has been meeting with potential investors over the past week, and demand spurred the increase. Alibaba is expected to be priced late Thursday and start trading Friday under the ticker `BABA' on the NYSE.
The fundraising target eclipses the $16 billion Facebook raised in 2012, the most for a technology IPO. It also would top the all-time IPO fundraising record of $22.1 billion set by the Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. in 2010, according to the research firm Dealogic.

Alibaba’s investment bankers could raise the price range for the company’s initial public offering, pushing it past its fundraising goal of $21.1 billion . The recordholder is the Agricultural Bank of China, which raised $22.1 billion four years ago.
Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, manager of the Pershing Square fund, plans to raise $2 billion from a listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Ackman is best known for his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.
Does it help an international fund to have “boots on the ground”  – analysts who live in the countries they cover? Apparently not . Most still underperform their benchmarks.
The Chinese economy is weakening , according to most recent data. August industrial production grew at its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and bank credit slowed as well. Chinese GDP growth may come in at less than 6% in the second half of the year.
If you’re a billionaire, what country do you want to leave most? China, according to a recent survey . Only 6% of billionaires in the U.S. want to leave.
A Chinese city has put in special walking lanes for smartphone zombies – those so entranced with their phones that they don’t notice other things, like human beings.

Janan Ganesh on how to maintain a united kingdomSeptember 15, 2014 3:52 pm
Gifted amateurism is no foundation for a united kingdom
By Janan Ganesh
©AFP
Britons will feel a peculiar sensation on Friday morning. The union will be saved – or so the polls suggest – yet seem frailer than it ever has been. Perhaps 45 per cent of Scots or more are going to vote for secession in Thursday’s referendum , a number that outstrips all but the most grandiose expectations at the start of the campaign. Many of those voting the other way will do so out of risk-aversion rather than any emotional fealty. Had it not been for the euro crisis, which deprived nationalists of a neat answer as to which currency an independent Scotland would use, the United Kingdom would be done for.
Even the unionist side has accepted the reality of Scottish otherness. David Cameron has absented himself for most of the campaign because he has the wrong accent (English) and belongs to the wrong party (Conservative). This is simultaneously shrewd judgment by the prime minister and the ultimate proof of what a brittle thing the UK really is.
More
UK voters and the economy
The problem is about to get worse. Not only has the union been tugged loose by this referendum, it will keep loosening the day after. All the main parties in Westminster have promised to divest more powers to Edinburgh, starting almost immediately. With all the authority of a man who scraped 29 per cent of the vote at the last general election, Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron’s predecessor, has promised “nothing less than a modern form of Scottish home rule”. The fact that he is in no official position to offer anything of the sort, and that neither the English nor the Welsh nor the Northern Irish nor parliament itself have been consulted, seems just a rumple to be ironed out in good time.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless. Irreversible promises to do with the governing arrangements of the UK are being thrown around as campaign bait by desperate men in the last ditch.
Their punishment will be the ordeal of having to honour them. On top of everything it already runs, Scotland is being offered the chance to vary tax rates and welfare benefits. This is not quite devolution-max – generally taken to mean autonomy over everything other than foreign affairs and defence – but then it is only a starting bid. Alex Salmond , Scotland’s nationalist first minister, will ask for more and, with the vote-share he is about to achieve, he is entitled to. The two capitals will haggle their way to devo-max or some approximation of it.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless
At that point, MPs representing Scottish seats in Westminster, who are overwhelmingly Labour, will be voting on legislation that scarcely affects their constituents. Anybody who thinks this will be allowed to stand does not talk to enough Tory MPs, many of whose private views on Scottish independence already range from insouciance to glee.
In short, Scottish home rule means English home rule, which in turn means a separate constitutional wrangle about what shape this should take. There may be a federal UK, as Mr Brown suggests, but England’s preponderance would leave it looking freakishly askew. The alternative is to break up England itself into self-governing regions, an old idea that usually runs into a wall of local intransigence. The northeast voted against the creation of its own assembly 10 years ago by a crushing margin. City mayors were rejected in most of the big cities outside London in 2011.
The point is not that greater devolution to Scotland is a bad idea. It is right and unavoidable. The point is that it opens vast and nearly unanswerable questions about the governance of the rest of the kingdom that politicians, in their desperation to scrape over the line on Thursday, have not thought through. The time to ponder a new settlement was the confirmation of the referendum two years ago, when devo-max could have been added as a third option on the ballot. Debate would have swirled around the meaning and implications of that middle way.
Now, it is hard to avoid the image of Mr Cameron and his peers scrawling a new constitution on the back of a panini wrapper as their trains hurtle north for a jaunty last-minute campaign stop they never expected to have to make. There must be a point at which the British traditions of amateurism and muddling through become indistinguishable from the chaotic caprice of a banana republic.
A question nags: how unionist is unionism really? When even supporters of the UK envisage gradual divergence between Edinburgh and Westminster – ever-looser union, to invert the founding text of the EU – then Mr Salmond’s point is largely made for him. Unionism used to suffer from absolutism; many of its adherents resisted the creation of a Scottish parliament long after it had become irresistible. Now it suffers from the opposite problem. It craves the legal fact of the union without any of the content. For all the fervour on both sides, the difference between nationalism and unionism is fading to vanishing point.

ABERDEEN/UNITED KINGDOM: British Prime Minister David Cameron during a visit to Scotland today warned that if the country voted for independence from the UK, it would not be a "trial separation" but a "painful divorce".
"There is no going back from this, no re-run. This is a once-and-for-all decision," he said in Aberdeen in by far his most forceful speech to date ahead of Thursday's referendum.
"Head, heart and soul, we want you to stay," he said. Cameron said a "Yes" victory would endanger Scottish pensions and the currency Scots use, break up the armed forces and put up borders between England and Scotland that "may not be so easily crossed".
He said Scotland's pro-independence government had outlined a future that was "too good to be true", adding: "I don't want the people of Scotland to be sold a dream that will disappear."
A "Yes" victory would be "the end of a country that all of us call home and we built this home together," he said.

Why India comes as a boon to global iron ore...Post mining curbs, India a boon to global iron ore market
By Reuters | 16 Sep, 2014, 02.48AM IST
"The mine closures all over India, starting from Karnataka, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand, have created a massive disruption to supply," Poddar said.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: An oversupplied global iron ore market may find some relief from an unlikely source as former No.3 exporter India turns into a big importer due to a cutback in domestic production.
The country may ship in up to 45 million tonnes over the next three years as home-grown iron ore output falls short of domestic steel production needs, an executive at an influential industry group said.
India imported just 0.37 million tonnes of the steelmaking raw material in 2013/14, government data showed. But already JSW Steel, India's third-largest maker of the alloy, has said it will import 6 million tonnes of iron ore in 2014/15 against zero a year earlier.
"There's no option but to import to meet the shortfall. We're looking at between 10 and 15 million tonnes every fiscal year over the next three years," Basant Poddar, vice president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the only industry group for mining firms in the country, told Reuters by phone.
"The mine closures all over India, starting from Karnataka, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand, have created a massive disruption to supply," Poddar said.
Mining in the key iron ore Indian states of Karnataka and Goa was banned in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following a crackdown on illegal mining by the Supreme Court and the government. Several mines in top producing Odisha state and in Jharkhand too were closed this year following government-imposed restrictions on the renewal of mining licenses.
While the bans have since been lifted, delays in restarting mining operations in Goa and Karnataka and the latest mine closures in the other states have limited local iron ore supply.
The disruptions have cut India's iron ore production to 152 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, from about 218 million in 2009/10, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.
The prospect of higher demand from India comes at an opportune time for global iron ore miners, whose margins have been shrunk by a 40 per cent slump in iron ore prices this year.
Iron ore fell to $81.90 a tonne last week, its lowest since September 2009.
The bulk of India's imports may come from Australia and South Africa, said Poddar, and unlikely from Brazil where shipments are usually made in big vessels. "Indian ports are not geared to handle large vessels," he said.
But the potential import volume won't be enough to absorb the total projected global surfeit. Morgan Stanley , which sees a global surplus of 79 million tonnes this year doubling to 158 million tonnes in 2015, expects the price to drop to $70.
In addition, any relief from Indian demand may be temporary, as the domestic shortage is due to government policy measures that could eventually be reversed.

Advani comes out of the cold  named chairman of Lok Sabha ethicspanelL K Advani
Written by Pradeep R Kaushal | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:46 am
After finding no place in the active decision-making process in the party or government, veteran BJP leader L K Advani finally has a new role — chairman of the Lok Sabha Committee on Ethics.
While Advani was not included in the new ruling dispensation, he was later divested of an active role in the party, as he was excluded from its vital organisational fora. He was made a part of the new advisory body called the Margdarshak Mandal.
Another former BJP chief, Murli Manohar Joshi, who was also included in the Margdarshak Mandal, was earlier appointed the chairman of the Estimates Committee of Parliament.
The Committee on Ethics is designed to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members of the Lok Sabha. It can suo motu take up for consideration and investigation matters in this regard. Following the same procedure as the Committee on Privileges for examining complaints pertaining to unethical conduct of members, it can make recommendations and frame rules, specifying acts which constitute unethical conduct.
The other members of the committee are: A Arunmozhithevan (AIADMK), Ninong Ering (Congress), Sher Singh Ghubaya (Akali Dal), Hemant Tukaram Godse (Shiv Sena), Kariya Munda, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Pralhad Joshi, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Jayashree Patel, Sumedhanand Saraswati and Bhola Singh (all BJP), Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) and Malla Reddy (Telugu Desam).
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has also constituted the Committee on Violation of Protocol Norms and Contemptuous Behaviour of Government Officers with Members of the Lok Sabha under the chairmanship of Rayapati Sambasiva Rao of the Telugu Desam. The committee will examine complaints relating to violation of protocol norms regarding officials’ dealings with MPs.
The Speaker has named M Thambidurai of the AIADMK chairman of the Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) of the Lok Sabha. The panel will periodically monitor and review the performance of the scheme and consider complaints of members.

Watch John Oliver Make a Love Actually–Style Plea for Scotland to Stay With England
By Alison Griswold
 
With Scotland's big vote on independence scheduled for this Thursday, America's favorite British late-night host used his slot on Last Week Tonight to assess the relationship between the Scots and the British. His take? "Scotland and England have been involved in something of a 300-year arranged marriage. And look, I will be the first one to acknowledge, England has been a little bit of a dick since the honeymoon. In 1746 we actually banned the kilt just because we knew they liked it."
John Oliver has plenty of gripes with Scotland. "When they got to choose a national animal ... they selected a unicorn." "For their national flower, the Scots chose a thistle." Then there's the questionable economics of it all. The Scottish National Party is optimistically betting that crude oil resources in the North Sea will be enough to sustain an independent economy. The SNP also wants to stay on the British pound . If they don't, as Oliver puts it, "they'd either have to join the currently unstable euro, or revert to Scotland's old currency, which I believe was sheep and threats."

David Cameron might not be ready to make the big romantic gesture to Scotland. But Oliver is. And he's doing it Love Actually –style to keep the couple together.

What happens to calls that are  recorded for quality assuranceWhat happens to calls that are 'recorded for quality assurance'

Another satisfied customer.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Ever wonder if anyone is listening to your customer service complaints? At AT&T, the answer might surprise you.
The telecom giant is currently experimenting with a new software system that transcribes customer calls. Using machine learning, AT&T's system offers feedback in close to real time to help company reps. The system can even detect customers' emotion, and it offers an interactive database that employees can query for insights on the kind of calls they're getting.
Say AT&T ( T , Tech30 ) starts getting a bunch of angry calls about service quality from customers in a specific neighborhood. The system can detect those complaints and chart them by location, allowing employees to isolate the problem and quickly brief customers on the situation. It can even anticipate the kinds of questions a customer might ask so reps can be ready with the answers.
Related: When is 5G coming? And how fast will it be?
"The tool allows us to do this kind of processing in very close to real time," said Mazin Gilbert, assistant vice president for technical research at AT&T Labs. "If a customer is unhappy, we want to do something at that moment in time as opposed to after the conversation is over."
The system is also a potential sales tool. It can parse conversations and, based on its analysis, suggest new products and services that a customer might be interested in. AT&T also uses it to monitor online discussion of the company by mining comments on Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ), Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) and other Web services.
But the software wasn't built just for customer service. With its speech-recognitiion abilities, it could have applications throughout the business world.
With meetings and teleconferences, for example, the program could create searchable transcripts. It could also log and chart instances at which particular topics have been discussed.
Related: Where you can get blazing-fast Internet speeds
Technicians at AT&T Labs in New Jersey have even installed voice sensors in a few places within the facility where employees tend to congregate. The experiment suggests a creepy future in which anything you say at work could be recorded by a transcription system.
The software is currently being used only in internal pilot programs, though Gilbert said AT&T has received a number of inquiries from interested business customers.
"We're grabbing real data and the system is learning on its own, updating itself," Gilbert said. "The whole idea is to lower the barrier to allow anybody who has an application or service that generates data to see how they can improve the experience."

(IIT Delhi has been leader…)
MUMBAI: India still does not feature among the Top 200 world universities in the new QS rankings. Just like last year, the top-placed Indian institution is 222nd in the world, but this year the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) has overtaken its counterpart in Delhi for the first time.
IIT Delhi has been the leader in India throughout the first 10 editions of the QS rankings, but has slipped to 235th this year, virtually exchanging positions in the table with IIT-B. IIT Bombay has moved up from 233rd to 222nd and IIT Delhi from 222nd to 235th. While IIT Bombay has done better in the 'Employer Survey' a component that accounts for 10 per cent weightage in the World Rankings, IIT Delhi's performance has dropped. This could also be read as IIT Bombay receiving a better score or more responses in the 'Employer Survey' than IIT Delhi.
Also, IIT Delhi's decline in the Citations Per Faculty Indicator, which accounts for 20 per cent weightage in the World Rankings, has been far greater than its peers. While in the regional rankings such as Asia and BRICS the emphasis is also on quantity of research papers published, the World Rankings only focuses on the quality of papers published by taking into account the citations, thereby making it more rigorous and globally competitive.
"It's time Indian universities embraced global rankings and put their best foot forward," says Dr Karthick Sridhar , vice chairman, Indian Centre for Assessment & Accreditation. With the increasing globalisation of higher education, Indian universities need to compete to attract the best intellectual students, as well as best qualified faculty from across the world, he says. Globally, students continue to use rankings as one of their decision making tools to choose their destinations. The prestige associated with higher ranks also drives universities to benchmark themselves globally, adds Dr Sridhar.
Parameters where Indian universities are weak in comparison to global peers are quantity and quality of research (as represented by number of papers and their citation counts) ; surveys of academic peers and employers (a representation of the perception of the quality of the university and 'outgoing' students); and internationalisation (as represented by number of international faculty and students). "These have to be addressed through reorientation of institutional priorities; focused deployment of human and financial resources; enhancement of global reputation and prestige through academic excellence and national higher education policy reforms," says Sridhar.
The number of Indian institutions in the World Rankings has grown to 12 from 11. "Indian institutions are engaging with ranking agencies more than ever before and this has started bearing fruit. There are more Indian universities in the QS rankings than any other international comparisons," a release said. The global rankings are, for the third year, led by MIT , which increased year-on-year citations per faculty by 14 per cent. Imperial College London (UK) also reported a 14 per cent increase in this metric compared to 11 per cent by The University of Cambridge (UK) and 2 per cent by Harvard . Caltech remains the world's top university for research citations.
A total of 31 countries are represented in the Top 200. The US remains the dominant nation with 51 institutions, 11 of which are in the Top 20. The US dominates also for research impact with seven of the 10 top spots in the citations per faculty indicator.

Was rule of law followed in Birla  Parakh FIR: Court asks CBIPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 2, 2014 1:24 am
A Delhi court on Monday, while hearing the closure report filed by the CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla and Parakh, asked the agency to clarify whether ‘rule of law’ was followed in allocation of blocks to Hindalco.
The court has asked the CBI to clarify whether there was an act of omission or commission in the allocation — and if any — whether it has an element of ‘criminality’.
The agency replied to the court that they have not found any criminality in allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco, adding that the screening committee reviewed its previous decision at the request of Birla and that the blocks were given to Hindalco. The court then asked whether the route to change its own decisions taken by the screening committee was ‘permissible’. However, when the judge posed the queries to the IO, he said that special public prosecutor RS Cheema would address the court on these issues. The CBI had filed a closure report in the case in which it had earlier lodged an FIR against Birla, Parakh and others.

DMRC dealt with Alstom France  not UK: SreedharanPrint
E Sreedharan said that the DMRC had “nothing to do” with Alstom UK. (Reuters)
Written by Sumegha Gulati | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:10 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 10:43 am
While Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu has said the Centre will be approaching the UK government to get more details about the alleged Alstom bribery case, former Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) chief, E Sreedharan on Friday told The Indian Express that the corporation had “nothing to do” with Alstom UK.
Britain’s top investigating agency, Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on Tuesday charged the British subsidiary of Alstom — the French rail transport equipment maker — for paying bribes to DMRC officials for winning signalling contracts in phases 1 and 2 of the metro rail network here.
According to Sreedharan, during whose tenure the contracts were awarded, DMRC never did any business with Alstom’s British subsidiary. “This allegation is against Alstom Network, UK. Our contracts were with Alstom France. The two are different companies. We don’t know how our name came up in the whole matter. DMRC makes great headlines for the media, so maybe they are raking up this controversy,” he said.
On two specific cases mentioned in the charges — one, regarding disguised payments made to Singapore-based Indo European Ventures Pte Ltd and, the other made to Hong Kong-based Global King Technology Ltd, Sreedharan responded that he was not aware about the existence and activities of the two firms.
“DMRC had no connection with any such firms. I read their names for the first time a few days ago when news reports mentioned them. I am quite sure DMRC never had any dealings with these companies, nor with Alstom UK,” he added.
DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said that the issue first came to light in February this year. “Since then, DMRC received no information on the allegations or any directions pertaining to these from either the ministry of urban development (MoUD) or any other agency. None of the organisations — MoUD, CBI or any other — ever approached us regarding the issue seeking a probe or assistance in the matter,” Dayal said. Officials in the MoUD confirmed that they will soon request the external affairs ministry to write to the Indian High Commission in London to approach the SFO and get relevant details.

Hero MotoCorp hunting for battery maker to power electric plansHero MotoCorp, along with its technical partners, has developed several new two-wheeler concepts.
Posted: September 13, 2014 3:10 pm
Hero MotoCorp is looking at acquiring or tying up with battery makers of electric two-wheelers for access to latest technologies as it develops electric bikes and hybrid scooters for markets like the US and Europe.
Pawan Munjal, vice-chairman, MD & CEO of Hero MotoCorp, said, “This is on my mind. We are looking at tie-ups and acquisitions, especially on the battery side. We are almost ready with our hybrid scooter Leap, but are yet to finalise the launch plans, and we are also working on an electric bike called SimpliCity.”
Hero MotoCorp, along with its technical partners, has developed several new two-wheeler concepts, including the RNT diesel-hybrid bike it showcased earlier this year. Last year, the company announced a Rs 450-crore investment for its own R&D facility near Jaipur to develop products from the ground up — it was earlier prevented from doing so under its JV with Honda, which ended in 2011.
Munjal said the company will launch its vehicles in the crucial US market around June 2016. “We have already sent our vehicles for homologation (a process of market certification) in the US. We would set up our distribution, but are undecided on branding,” he said.
Back home, Hero will start production at its 1.8-million-units-per-year fifth plant in Gujarat by October-December 2015 while it is also talking to various southern states for a sixth plant. Hero’s domestic output is currently 7.65 million units.

In hour of crisis  RBI opens line of credit  goes easy on termsWith around 650 branches in the state, Jammu & Kashmir Bank is the region’s lead bank.
ENS Economic Bureau | Mumbai | Posted: September 15, 2014 1:43 am | Updated: September 15, 2014 1:57 am
People affected by the massive floods in Jammu & Kashmir would be eligible for relief, including fresh loans, restructuring of existing loans and concessional interest rates from banks.
To facilitate coordination and expeditious action by the banks, the convener of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) should convene a meeting immediately to evolve a coordinated action plan for implementation of the relief programme in collaboration with the state/ district authorities, says the Reserve Bank of India ‘Guidelines for relief measures by banks in areas affected by natural calamities’.
“J&K is now an ideal case for sops under the RBI guidelines,” said a bank official.
With around 650 branches in the state, Jammu & Kashmir Bank is the region’s lead bank. A spokesperson for the bank said coordinated action is yet to commence as road links, telecom and internet services are yet to be restored.
“Out of J&K Bank’s 200 plus affected branches, nearly 115 have restarted operations,” the spokesperson said.
According to the RBI, loans to existing borrowers for general consumption purposes may be sanctioned up to Rs 10,000 without any collateral. The limit may, however be enhanced beyond Rs 10,000 at the discretion of the bank.
Further, timely fresh financial assistance to resume productive activities may be provided not only to the existing borrowers, but also to other eligible borrowers. Notwithstanding the status of the existing account, fresh loans granted to the borrowers will be treated as current dues, the RBI says.
As the repaying capacity of the people affected by natural calamities gets severely impaired due to the damage to the economic pursuits and loss of economic assets, relief in repayment of loans becomes necessary in areas affected by natural calamity and hence, restructuring of the existing loans will be required.
“The principal amount of the short-term loan as well as interest due for repayment in the year of occurrence of natural calamity may be converted into term loan. In case of term loans the instalment of principal and interest due in the year of occurrence of natural calamity may also be converted into term loan,” it said.
The repayment period of restructured term loan may vary depending on the severity of calamity and its recurrence, the extent of loss of economic assets and distress caused.
Generally, the restructured period for repayment may be 3 to 5 years. However, where the damage arising out of the calamity is very severe, banks may, at their discretion, extend the period of repayment ranging up to 7 years and in extreme cases of hardship, the repayment period may be prolonged up to a maximum period of 10 years in consultation with the task force/ SLBC, it says.
In all cases of restructuring, moratorium period of at least one year should be considered. Further, the banks should not insist continued…

Flashback: 6 years after the fall of LehmanFlashback: 6 years after the fall of Lehman

Today marks the sixth anniversary of the fall of Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers, a reminder of how far stocks can fall in a financial crisis when investor confidence evaporates overnight. The anniversary is also a good time to tout the market’s resilience and comeback story.
The flashback
On Monday, Sept. 15, 2008, Wall Street woke up to the unthinkable news, the bankruptcy filing of one-time banking titan Lehman after what amounted to a modern-day run on a bank.
That single news event is often cited as the defining moment of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which saw credit dry up and the value of stocks and real estate plummet.
The tremors felt in the stock market that day — a 504-point, 4.4%, plunge for the Dow Jones industrial average — foreshadowed many bad days ahead for investors. It also sparked fears of a financial system meltdown. In a two-week span from Sept. 26 (when Congress rejected the first banking industry bailout known as TARP) to Oct. 10, the Dow plunged 2,692 points, or 24.2%, basically suffering a bear market, or a drop of 20% or more in 10 trading days.
The Dow, of course, didn’t stop going down until it bottomed out on March 9, 2009, at 6,547.05, a bear-market drop of 53.8% from its then-record closing high of 14,164.53 on Oct. 9, 2007.
Fast-forward to today
The Dow enters Monday’s trading session at 16,987.51, just 0.9% below its Sept. 16, 2014, all-time closing high of 17,138.20.
The Dow has rallied more than 160% since March 2009 and this summer topped 17,000 for the first time. A trader’s modified hat reads Dow 17K on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the morning of July 3, 2014,  in New York City. (Andrew Burton, Getty Images)
From its bear-market low in 2009 to its record peak earlier this month, the blue-chip stock gauge has rallied nearly 162%. The rally has been powered by unprecedented monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve designed to jump-start an economy that was shrinking, as fear rose and demand for goods and services shrank. The Fed not only lowered short-term interest rates to near 0% back in late 2008, it also embarked on an unprecedented bond-buying program that same year, dubbed quantitative easing, which they’re now in the process of winding down.
What’s next?
Ironically, Wall Street traders enter the week on edge with stocks near record highs as they await the Fed meeting this week. Investors will be seeking clues on Wednesday as to when the central bank will start to hike interest rates next year when the Fed issues its policy statement and chief Janet Yellen faces off with reporters when its two-day meeting concludes. The fear is that the stock market and economy will suffer when the Fed’s artificial stimulus is removed from the financial system.
The Fed tapering of its QE program is almost complete. A television screen at a post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange show the decision of the Federal Reserve on  March 19, 2014.  (Richard Drew, AP)
The Fed is slated to end its bond-buying program this fall.
But the big question is when they will start to take the low-rate “punch bowl” away next year and start to hike rates. Wall Street has been looking for the first Fed rate hike in mid-2015, but there’s been recent rumblings following continued good readings on the economy and job market that the Fed could start increasing rates earlier next year. And the prospect of an earlier-than-expected rate hike is causing concern among investors, as it’s unclear how the economy and stock market will fare as the Fed withdraws its market-friendly stimulus.

Fearing CBI arrest  BJD leader applies for anticipatorybailPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:01 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 9:48 am
With the CBI tightening noose around Banki MLA Pravat Tripathy in the multi-crore chit fund scam, the BJD leader on Monday moved an anticipatory bail plea in the Orissa High Court.
Tripathy, who is under the CBI scanner for his proximity to chit fund firms Artha Tatwa and Swastik India group, said he applied for anticipatory bail as he did not want to be humiliated by the CBI. “As my houses have been raided by CBI last month, I apprehend that they could arrest me any moment,” he said.
Chit fund group Artha Tatwa chief Pradeep Sethy told CBI officials how Tripathy sent a BJD member to him, seeking funds for a festival in his constituency. A year ago, an audio recording of a conversation between Tripathy and Sethy had surfaced in the media. But the CID that was probing the chit fund scam earlier, did not pursue the matter. Ranjan Das, who ran chit fund group Swastik India and was close to Tripathy, is already under CBI custody.
The CBI has already raided the houses of Ramchandra Hansda, a BJD MP from Mayurbhanj in July. The CBI sleuths also searched the homes of BJD MLA from Keonjhar Subarna Nayak and former BJP MLA from Khariar Hitesh Bagarti.
All three politicians were allegedly associated with Nabadiganta Capital Service Limited, which is among the 43 chit fund companies under CBI scanner.

Silk route to BeijingPutting in place a strategy to modernise India’s internal connectivity and strengthen its maritime infrastructure is critical for any effective Indian response to China’s silk road initiative. (Source: PTI)

China’s decision to postpone President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pakistan has got much attention in New Delhi. But this in no way marks a major change in Beijing’s policy towards Islamabad. President Xi is likely to travel to Islamabad sooner rather than later and reaffirm the depth of Beijing’s commitment to Islamabad. Delhi, however, is in danger of missing the significance of a more important change in Xi’s itinerary for the subcontinent. Instead of Pakistan, Xi has gone to the Maldives and also keeps his original date with Sri Lanka.
Thanks to its preoccupation with the defence of the contested northern frontiers with Pakistan and China, Delhi does not pay adequate attention to the emerging maritime dynamic to the south of the subcontinent. China’s interest in the island states of the Indian Ocean is relatively new and could turn out to be rather consequential.
As China’s economic interests in the Indian Ocean expanded rapidly in recent decades, Beijing’s naval interest and profile in the littoral also grew steadily. Sceptics say China’s naval priority is the western Pacific, where it is locked in intensifying territorial disputes with its Asian neighbours. They note Beijing’s determination to contest America’s longstanding naval primacy on its eastern sea board.
Others insist that Beijing is pursuing a two-ocean strategy rather than limiting itself to the western Pacific. Since the end of 2008, the Chinese navy has deployed its naval units on a continuous basis for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. This has provided the Chinese navy with valuable experience in conducting “far sea operations”.
Beijing sees the sea lines of communication (SLOCs), which move massive amounts of energy and mineral resources from the Middle East and Africa to China through the Indian Ocean, as vital lifelines. Securing these SLOCs has emerged as a major justification for China’s growing naval activity in the Indian Ocean.
Over the last decade, Beijing has also focused on building maritime infrastructure in the Indian Ocean. Its investment in the development of new ports at Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and Kyaukphyu in Myanmar, has generated much concern in India about China’s long-term intentions in the Indian Ocean.
Although these are all civilian ports for now, Delhi worries that they may portend a permanent Chinese naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Beijing has also cultivated special political relationships with key countries in the region and has stepped up its maritime diplomacy in the littoral. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, visited Seychelles and Mauritius during his tenure as president (2003-13). Now, Xi becomes the first Chinese president to visit Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Xi would certainly want to make continued…

Slippery ground of the secularism debateModi promised growth and employment, but look at the impact of communal riots in Uttar Pradesh on the economy.
Written by Sanjay Nirupam 2 | Posted: September 15, 2014 12:37 am | Updated: September 15, 2014 7:58 am
Narendra Modi’s political narrative, first developed in Gujarat and now offered at the national level, is here to stay. One needs to understand the narrative well to expose it and to offer a counter. Old ideas of secularism and social justice are not enough to fight Modi; an innovative package of new and non-conventional ideas and practices is necessary to oppose him.
Economic arguments more than socio-political analysis would help to puncture Modi’s communal agenda. For instance, Modi won office promising growth, good governance, national security and financial stability. The last would include controlling prices, generating employment and developing infrastructure. The claims were bogus, but he did succeed in convincing voters that he would deliver on his promises. Has he delivered?
Modi promised growth and employment, but look at the impact of communal riots in Uttar Pradesh on the economy. Take, for instance, the riots in Moradabad, a hub of the brassware industry that annually exports products worth Rs 2,500 crore. Muslims constitute a majority of the labour force in this industry while the factories are mostly owned by non-Muslims. The Hindu-Muslim tension, engineered by the BJP in view of the bypolls, has divided the society on religious lines.
My concern is not who pelted the stones first and if the police handled the situation the right way. My worry is that Moradabad’s brass industry has been badly hit. The city is losing business as Muslim workers do not report to work due to the lack of trust in non-Muslim factory owners. Who will compensate the industry for this massive loss, a direct outcome of the riots?
A similar situation prevails in Saharanpur, a traditional wood and furniture business centre. As in Moradabad, Muslim artisans constitute the vast majority of workers here, while shops and factories are mostly owned by Hindus and Sikhs. In a recent report, Assocham estimated that the furniture business lost Rs 244 crore in just 10 days due to the riots. How can Modi, who could not prevent his partymen from fanning communal tension and the resultant destruction of the business climate in these two cities, revive the Indian economy?
But let us not fool ourselves. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat when over 2,000 Muslims were killed in 2002. Yet, he successfully sold the so-called Gujarat growth story to the world. So, Modi’s politics has nothing to do with growth, development or good governance: it is based on the polarisation of votes. The real Gujarat model is nothing but winning elections by polarising voters along communal lines. He has done it repeatedly in Gujarat in the past 12 years.
In the last general election, Modi started with the good governance slogan and finally divided the nation with inflammatory rhetoric. Unfortunately, we continued…

The disintegration of JanataAs early as June 1978, Charan Singh had written a letter to Prime Minister Desai describing his cabinet as a “collection of impotent men” incapable of bringing Indira to justice. (Source: Reuters photo)

SHORTLY after her famous elephant-ride to Belchi, Indira Gandhi went to her constituency, Rae Bareli. Simon Winchester of The Guardian, who was in the hack pack accompanying her, reported that her constituents had “forgiven her in ten minutes flat”.
Her next destination was the tribal belt of Gujarat. The welcome she received there — and even more strikingly, at the airport in Bombay (now Mumbai) en route — came to the Janata ranks as a terrible shock. Angrily, they demanded of the top leadership that instead of allowing her to “strut about the country”, Gandhi should be jailed at once. They argued that since the Shah Commission had already “held her guilty” she must be punished without delay. This reasoning was absurd, of course. For Justice J.C. Shah had clearly stated in his report that under the law, commissions of inquiry were only fact-finding bodies and “could not hold anyone guilty of anything”. If someone was to be punished, specific charges had to be filed in appropriate courts.
Even so, no one could restrain Charan Singh. On October 3, 1977, he ordered Indira Gandhi’s arrest on some flimsy charges that the Intelligence Bureau had framed at his behest. With this piece of paper, officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Delhi Police knocked at her door around noon. What followed was pure theatre from which she derived great political advantage. There isn’t enough space even to summarise the drama. Suffice it to say that at the first sign of the police’s plan to take her out of Delhi’s administrative jurisdiction, the Black Maria was surrounded by the vehicles carrying a large number of her supporters. She got out of the van and sat calmly on a culvert. The police had no option but to bring her back to Delhi and detain her for the night in Police Lines. The next morning, the magistrate before whom she was produced took exactly three minutes to dismiss the charges against her. This fiasco meant
a loss of face for the Janata and earned her enormous sympathy.
By this time, she had also realised that most Congress leaders were treating her with ill-concealed hostility. Some of them had even given evidence against her to the Shah Commission. So on New Year’s Day 1978, she split the party for the second time. Later in the year, she won a by-election to the Lok Sabha from Chikmagalur in Karnataka with a big majority. But her membership of Parliament lasted only six weeks. For the Privileges Committee lost no time to hold her “guilty” continued…

It was a ‘strictly personal’ and private affair, as former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur on Sunday attended the launch of their daughter Daman Singh’s biography of them in Delhi, entitled Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan. Ms. Singh, who wrote the book over the past three years, based the work on interviews with Dr. Singh and his wife while he was Prime Minister, dealing with his work as an economist, surprise over Indira Gandhi’s announcement of Emergency, as well as working with former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao on economic liberalisation. However, it ends in 2004, and gives absolutely no account of his relationship with the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.
At the launch, Dr. Singh posed for photographs, but refused to answer questions saying, “I would not like to comment on someone else’s book.” Ms. Singh also declined to confirm or deny that Dr. Singh would write his own memoirs.
Declines to comment
PTI reports: Dr. Singh, who is under fire from the former CAG Vinod Rai over the 2G spectrum scam and Coalgate, said he had done his “duty” and refused to respond to charges levelled against him. “I, indeed, did my duty,” he said.
Interestingly, Ms. Singh also skirted questions about the ex-CAG’s comments. “Actually, I do not know anything about that. So I cannot comment. I have no idea about that. I have not heard what they have said,” she said.
The function was attended among others by the former Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the former Minister Shashi Tharoor.

Notification for plying of e-rickshaws soon: Nitin GadkariPrint
The Delhi High Court on September 9 has said that ban on e-rickshaws in the capital will continue as they are illegal as per existing laws and had rejected Centre's plea to allow them to ply till rules are framed to regulate them. (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 4:52 pm | Updated: September 15, 2014 4:57 pm
A final notification will be issued after ten days to allow e-rickshaws which have been banned from plying on the roads here by the Delhi High Court over safety issues , the government said on Monday.
“A notification pertaining to e-rickshaw has been issued. We will put it on website and seek peoples opinion on it in the next ten days and will solve the problem immediately thereafter. We will issue (final) notification for plying of e-rickshaws after 10 days,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
The court had on July 31 banned plying of e-rickshaws on the roads of the national capital saying “prima facie they are a hazard to other traffic as well as citizens”.
Gadkari said the safety and other concerns raised over plying of e-rickshaws have been taken care of and necessary steps were on to bring their plying lawful with necessary modifications in rules and law.
He said he was pained that thousands of poor people were deprived of their livelihood due to ban on e-rickshaw but now the issue will be solved.
In reply to a query, Gadkari said, “I have nothing to do with the politics involving it.”
The Delhi High Court on September 9 has said that ban on e-rickshaws in the capital will continue as they are illegal as per existing laws and had rejected Centre’s plea to allow them to ply till rules are framed to regulate them.
A High Court bench had left it to Parliament and the Centre to decide what legislative changes need to be introduced to regulate the plying of e-rickshaws.
Seeking lifting of the ban, the Ministry of Transport and the association had pleaded that till the plying of erickshaws is made lawful by Parliament and Central Government, the court may permit their operation on the basis of temporary guidelines framed by the Centre.
It had said that lifting the ban would mitigate hardship caused to thousands of people who operate these vehicles and their families as well as to lakhs of citizens of the city who depend on erickshaws for last mile connectivity.
We will put notification on website and seek peoples opinion on it in the next ten days and will solve the problem immediately thereafter.

US safety chief raps GM s  flawed  culture o...US safety chief raps GM's 'flawed' culture on recalls
By Reuters | 16 Sep, 2014, 04.08AM IST
In recent months, Friedman said he has invited senior executives from 12 global automakers to talk about how to establish a "new normal" when it comes to recalls.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
The top US auto safety regulator harshly criticized General Motors Co for not promptly reporting and recalling cars now linked to at least 19 deaths and said he has been meeting with top global automakers to develop a "new normal" for safety recalls.
In his most pointed comments to date about GM's lapses, David Friedman , acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the automaker put its own reputation ahead of the safety of its customers.
"GM very clearly made some incredibly poor decisions when it came to their culture," Friedman said in an interview Monday. "They were more worried about us (NHTSA) getting information about problems than they were about actually fixing problems."
Earlier on Monday, the chief of GM's victim settlement fund raised the number of deaths from accidents caused by the automaker's defective ignition switches to 19, up from 13.
Friedman's comments come ahead of his appearance on Tuesday before a Senate panel in which he will likely be grilled about his own agency's failure to connect the dots on years of consumer complaints and accident data about GM cars with a deadly ignition switch flaw.
GM earlier this year recalled 2.6 million vehicles because of the risk the switches could unexpectedly turn off engines during operation and disable airbags.
Tuesday's hearing, chaired by Senator Claire McCaskill , is focusing on whether NHTSA is effectively implementing and enforcing highway and vehicle safety laws, and whether Congress should make additional reforms in the wake of GM recalls, said a staffer for the consumer protection subcommittee.
McCaskill has introduced legislation to increase NHTSA's authority to fine carmakers for safety violations.
Friedman said in the interview that his agency had started a program of "unprecedented oversight" with GM and other automakers.
"We're setting a system up where the minute they sneeze about a safety issue, we're able to be aware of it and make sure we understand how they're dealing with it," he said.
In recent months, Friedman said he has invited senior executives from 12 global automakers to talk about how to establish a "new normal" when it comes to recalls.
During those discussions, Friedman said he is "making clear that we have zero tolerance when it comes to automakers failing to act quickly and aggressively" on reporting and recalling defective cars.
As part of a settlement in May with NHTSA, GM agreed to pay a $35 million fine for its delayed response to the ignition switch problems. GM also was required to hold regular meetings with NHTSA to report on efforts to catch safety problems and it also must give the agency monthly reports on any emerging defect issues.
Friedman said GM had "a fundamentally flawed system and culture that was focused more on profits than on safety," but acknowledged the automaker has been overhauling its defect and recall reporting system under Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra .
He said the agency has been pressure-testing GM's revised system to make sure their new approach is rock solid.
"We ran them through their paces, ran them through a variety of scenarios," said Friedman. "We are trying to make sure that General Motors fundamentally changes both their practice and their culture" on finding and fixing defects.
GM did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Friedman said he was "not shocked" by attorney Kenneth Feinberg's initial report Monday that he has approved 19 of 125 death claims made to a GM fund established to compensate families of victims who died in switch-related crashes.

Govt to consider diesel deregulation & price...Government to consider diesel deregulation and price cut

(The government is weighing…)
NEW DELHI: The government will consider decontrolling diesel and cut the fuel's price by 40 paise per litre this month as the sharp fall in global crude oil prices has paved the way for a major reform in fuel pricing, government and industry sources said.
The fall in global prices has helped state oil firms make a profit on diesel, which has been a source of heavy subsidy burden for about a decade. The government is weighing the political impact of fuel pricing as elections in crucial states of Maharashtra and Haryana are due in weeks.
Officials said that the government has to take a call on whether or not it should announce price deregulation simultaneously with the cut in diesel prices. "Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan is expected to consult senior cabinet ministers on diesel price issue after he returns from Vietnam this week," one source said. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan have already expressed their keenness on fuel price reforms. Before the unexpected fall in global oil prices, Jaitley had told Parliament that the government would be able to decontrol diesel fully in a year if there are no international shocks in the oil sector.
Diesel price deregulation will be a major policy reform of the Narendra Modi government but, it is concerned about sudden spike in international oil prices in the near future that would adversely affect ruling BJP's polls prospects in Maharashtra and Haryana, sources said. Assembly elections in the two states are scheduled on October 15. ET first reported about an impending cut in diesel rates on September 9.
State oil marketing companies are currently gaining about 40 paise per litre revenue on diesel compared to its assumed market price. Companies have gained from fall in global prices and the gradual increase in retail price of diesel. But, petrol consumers will not gain from the sharp fall in global crude oil prices as its prices are likely to remain steady, sources said.
Crude oil prices tumbled below $98 last week, falling to the lowest in two years, but India's fuel pricing system links petrol and diesel rates to their respective international benchmarks, which don't always move in step with crude. Exchange rate also influences local prices.
Petrol prices may not be hiked this time, one of them said. The government has directed oil companies not to raise diesel prices by 50 paise by end of this month if over-recovery continues in rest of the month, an industry source said. In fact, a diesel price cut is expected by the end of this month after the cabinet reviews the fuel price scenario, the source said. But, the Election Commission may not allow a price cut ahead of assembly elections, the source added.
Government officials say that the oil ministry may have to take permission of the Election Commission to reduce diesel prices before assembly elections because of the model code of conduct.

Amazons fulfilment centre under taxmans sc...Taxman questions Amazon India’s fulfilment centre

Amazon
(This development highlights…)
BANGALORE: Amazon is facing more trouble from tax authorities in Karnataka who increased scrutiny of the Seattlebased firm's local operations and issued notices to nearly 50 merchants selling their wares on the company's online marketplace in India.
This development highlights the dissonance between prevailing tax norms and the demands of growth in India's fast paced online retail industry.
"We have sent notices to about 50 dealers asking them why we should not cancel their additional place of business. We will initiate the process of cancellation after hearing them," said a senior tax official. The authorities contend that hundreds of merchants cannot declare the Amazon warehouse as an additional place of business under current tax laws.
Amazon India has so far only stated that the company is working with the state tax authorities on this matter. "We look forward to an early resolution in order to avoid closing our local warehousing operations in Karnataka and to stay on course for bringing more investments in the state," said the company in a statement.
Amazon operates a marketplace model in India where it links merchants with customers through its technology platform. The company has seven warehouses across the country, including Bangalore, where it stocks the fastest-selling products at an additional cost to the seller.
Amazon does this so it can ensure speedy deliveries. This service is called Fulfilment by Amazon . About 60% of products listed onAmazon.in are eligible for nextday delivery because of this service. Amazon earns a commission on the services it provides to the merchants and pays a service tax to the Centre. Tax authorities are questioning this model of a "fulfilment centre".
"As per the Karnataka VAT laws, they (Amazon) are acting as commission agents, and hence should discharge their liabilities to the government under the fulfilment model. We have no issues with regard to the marketplace model," said Ajay Seth, commissioner of commercial taxes, whose department has initiated the process to cancel 'branch certificates' issued to the 50 dealers.
Experts said regulators seem to be out of step with the changes in the online retail industry and could end up killing the goose that lays the golden egg. "This is an area that needs urgent attention and clear-cut guidelines by the government.
Current laws don't cater to modern day ecommerce transaction," said Krishnan Ganesh, cofounder of investment platform GrowthStory, which has invested in online retail sites like grocery portal Big-Basket and jewellery site Bluestone.
Ecommerce companies have been facing trouble in various states primarily due to the fact that goods that originate in one state are delivered to customers in a different one. These customers also often pay cash at the time of delivery. Legal experts are of the view that Amazon's tax troubles in Karnataka, could have far-reaching consequences. "It seems that Amazon is not just stocking products of other merchants, it is also delivering from its warehouse to the customer.
That seems to have caused the trouble," Vaibhav Parikh, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates. "If it is found that they have violated law, they might have to change the way their fulfilment works." Flipkart and Snapdeal operate marketplaces and run warehouses.
Flipkart runs around six fulfilment centres or warehouses. Snapdeal launched 40 fulfillment centres in 15 cities in May and had said at the time that it would launch warehouses in 15 more cities. Flipkart and Snapdeal declined to comment for this story. Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak, said such issues are arising as the tax laws in the country are 'archaic'.
  "The government at the Centre needs to address the whole gamut of tax-related issues for the retail industry, not just ecommerce. Otherwise, the ecommerce firms will be at the mercy of local tax officials in different states," said Singhal. "Today it is Karnataka, tomorrow could be another state."
In fact, ecommerce firms have been dealing with various tax-related issues in different states. Most do not deliver to Kerala. "Since the logistics provider is making the delivery and collecting cashon-deliver, it is considered as a dealer and hence liable to pay VAT in the state," said the head of an ecommerce firm, who declined to be named. The company has now sorted out the problem by getting its courier partner to register in the state and remit to the merchant's account directly.
Such hurdles could stymie growth of online retail in India fear industry members many of whom are calling for speedy implementation of a uniform goods and services tax across the country.

Top 5 stocks that can return upto 36%Here's why CLSA is overweight on India; top five stocks to bet on

CLSA
(Chris Wood further added…)
NEW DELHI: India has been one of my favourite markets in Asia and remains so most particularly since the national elections 2014, said CLSA's Chief Strategist Chris Wood in an interview with ET Now.
"I am viewing India as a five-year story given the fact that Modi has been elected for five years," said Wood. In fact, he has allocated 41 per cent of his long only portfolio to India.
"We are coming close to the end of the QE tapering in the US. So, the nearer we come to the end of tapering, the bigger is the risk of a stock market correction. Even if there is going to be any trouble in the financial markets, it is going to be caused by rising credit spreads. If credit spreads do not rise, there would not be a problem," added Wood.
Chris Wood further said that he is viewing India as a five-year story given the fact that Modi has been elected for five years. "Modi is the most pro-business, pro-investment political leader in the world today. So in all likelihood he would get the investment cycle going again," he said.
The Modi administration is committed to lowering the fiscal deficit by 160 bps by FY17. The effect of his initiatives taken will become more visible from 2HFY15.
The early signs of the economic bottoming out are already in sight, which is good news for domestic recovery plays. CLSA is overweight on banks, autos and public sector undertaking companies.
In a recent report released last week, titled 'Bits & Pieces', CLSA said that the renewed investment cycle should significantly favour infrastructure asset owners and contractors such as Larsen & Toubro. Corporate lenders such as ICICI Bank and SBI should also benefit.
Among building material companies, they prefer Grasim. Ensuing job creation will be positive for discretionary consumption plays such as Bharti Airtel. State-owned oil companies will appreciate subsidy cuts and their favourite pick is ONGC.
The China Angle:
The size of the Indian equity market has surpassed both Australia and South Korea, making it the third largest ex-Japan market in Asia, behind China and Hong Kong, stated the report.
On most time-frames within the past 5 years, India's (the tiger) market has smashed China's (the dragon) China Enterprise index in local currency terms.
But due to the appreciation of the RMB and the INR's depreciation in USD terms, China has actually outperformed India over the past 3 years.
According to Chris Wood, the bad news is that China is cyclically slow, probably because the markets are correcting. But the good news is the government seems serious about reforms, which is a long-term positive.
If the anti-corruption campaign continues, that will be a short-term negative for growth, but that is again a long-term positive, he added.
A report authored by Francis Cheung of CLSA said that "we expected the market (China) rally to fade away by 3Q, but economy is weakening faster than expected. The government stimulus is having less of an impact which is highlighted by diminishing returns."
It will be difficult for China to meet this year's 7.5 per cent growth target, but another stimulus is unlikely for this year, added Cheung.
Although the market has rallied with government stimulus despite lacklustre results and slowing growth, but with weaker PMIs and continuing property correction, we are cautious on the market, added Cheung.

7 Habits of Highly Effective Job SeekersIn 1989, Dr.Stephen R. Covey wrote an excellent book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. I highly recommend this book to anyone, in a job search or in a job!
These are Dr. Covey's list of recommended habits, with descriptions adapted to apply to job search.
7 Habits of Highly-Effective Job Seekers
1.  Be proactive.
Passively sitting at a computer, clicking on the "Apply" button doesn't pay off often enough to spend more than an hour a day at it. That job search strategy is purely reactive because the only option is to search and to respond to what is available at the exact moment of that search.
Additionally, a job board-based job search is very highly competitive right now, because so many people are doing exactly (and only) that same thing. Rather than re-actively waiting to see what jobs are posted on a job board, pro-actively explore ways to discover where the job you want may be lurking, waiting for you to find it.
Get back in touch with old friends, former classmates, and former neighbors. See what they are doing. Perhaps you can help them. Perhaps they can help you.
Connect with former co-workers via a corporate alumni group (check for a LinkedIn Group or Google "[company name] alumni") to see how they are and what they have been doing since you worked together. Perhaps learn if they know of anyone - in your old gang or not - who might know who would be hiring someone doing what you want to do.
Find a job search support group where you can exchange leads and local job market news with other job seekers.
Go to that professional association meeting where you may learn something when you listen to a speaker, have the opportunity to talk with real live people, and perhaps discover who is hiring, what, where.
Schedule informational interviews to learn more about a field, an industry, or an employer, particularly if you are changing careers.
Or, better, do all of those things.
2.  Begin with the end in mind.
If someone asks you what you are looking for, your answer must be short, specific, believable, and memorable to be effective.
A general, vague answer ("Oh, I could do anything in retail or accounting" or "A regular paycheck!") leaves the impression that you don't know what you want or are not very knowledgeable. Being vague results in fewer opportunities, NOT in more opportunities.
Think about finding a good place to live, shopping for groceries, or fighting a war. None are easily accomplished without knowing what you want -- understanding what you goal is -- and focusing on that goal or target.
Please note: a paycheck is not a goal. A paycheck is the result of reaching the goal of finding a job. The best goal is the right job for you so you have a steady stream of paychecks.
Know the job you want and make a list of at least 10 to 20 target employers (which can change over time). Chances are very good that -- if you take that approach -- you'll end up in a job you like and will succeed in.
3.  Put first things first.
Prioritize your job search tasks. Set up a spreadsheet, or use a free web app, like  JibberJobber.com to keep track of your activities. Focus, and work at finding your new job.
4.  Think win-win.
This is the key to successful networking. Help the people in your network as much, or more, than they help you. Share information about networking events, leads that aren't appropriate for you, great articles (like this one!), news, LinkedIn connections, and other things that make someone else's job search easier.
This is also the key to connecting with employers. While it is easy in a job search to focus on why landing a job is good for you, it is as important - if not more - to show to the employer why hiring you would be good for them.  I call this the W-I-I-F-T: What's-In-It-For-Them if they hire you? How can hiring you solve problems for them? Focus on making sure that is clear to the employer.
5.  Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
Before you tell an employer how great you are, find out as much as you can about them, and what they need. In sales, this is called learning the client's "pain." This will help you see - and explain - how you can help them. If you immediately jump into how great you are, you may completely miss learning what they need so you can customize your explanation of your greatness to target their needs.
You explain how well you are at "leaping tall buildings in a single bound" but they need someone who can wash the building's windows. Oops!
Better, focus on learning what they need. In order to be the answer to their problems, you must understand what problems they have. Asking about the employers needs and goals - and really listening to the answers - can be a very effective approach in a job interview. Don't be afraid to take notes, either. Note taking demonstrates that you are really listening.
6.  Synergize.
Two heads are usually much better than one, that's why the saying is a cliche - because it's true.  It is often true in a job search as well.  Find one or more job search buddies. If you can afford to hire a job search coach, do it (after carefully checking references!). Join a job search support group. You will often find them - or postings about them - at your local public library, in local places of worship, even in city hall, and local high schools. We also have a large list of them on Job-Hunt.org .
If you went to college, perhaps the college career center can provide some help for you, even if it is only connecting you with the alumni association (which is excellent networking). If they don't provide help, ask for an alumni directory or list of alumni working for your target employers or working in your field so you can expand your network and get more help with your job search.
7.  Sharpen the saw.
Continue to learn and grow in knowledge and skill even when you don't have a job. This is SO important for job seekers, particularly if the job search drags on more than a few months, which seems to be more common these days.
Sign up for temporary work in your field (or as close as you can get to your field). Go after contract assignments if you can't get temporary work.
Volunteer in a role related to your job search goals for a non-profit - if your target job is social media marketing, help a non-profit with their social media marketing.
Look for internships (regardless of your age).
Take classes - free online webinars, local adult education, workshops at local colleges or universities.
Keep track of all your activities for your resume - these are great "gap" fillers. They also demonstrate that you haven't been "left behind" or "gotten stale."

When I Realized That I Was an Intrapreneur (No It s NOT a Typo)reddit
I have worked in the corporate environment my entire adult life. I have loved it and fell in love with it when I first stepped into one right out of university. But over the years I always felt like I was the odd one out. I could never put my finger on it. I never quite "fit" in. But what I did know -- was that I have always been disruptive -- I have gone about things differently -- I was never happy with NO as an answer.
I always wanted to do things better, if someone said do A, I would say well why not A+B+C?  I always pushed the boundaries and found creative ways of going about things. While in theory this may sound like what an organization would want to see in their employees, people were at times uncomfortable or at taken aback by my thinking. Never the less, I continued to do "well" according to the corporate standards...my career progressed and my work got recognized.
It was not until about a year ago a friend of mine said to me -- "Chitra you are operating like an entrepreneur in a large company" it then all made sense to me. How I had been thinking and operating over the past two decades.
An intraprenueur is someone who takes an entrepreneurial approach from within a large organization. Someone who challenges conventional thinking to drive innovation, creative thinking and new ways of approaching business.
Since then, I have become obsessed with the idea of this and have focused my PhD research on this topic. I look at why these people are so important now, what are their traits and how companies can really take advantage of this talent.
These people are disruptors, often challenging the status quo, finding new ways of doing things, pushing boundaries...they are essential within organizations...more so now than ever before.
The word disruption can often be taken as negative. I read an article recently by Virgin on disruption -- they refer to it as it being a "wonderful word.
It's about being stopped in your tracks and seeing something in a radically different light. Often this is something simple, yet once you see it turned upside down it can transform your life." I love this so much because it is so true. I think about this notion quite often, why are we so afraid of seeing things differently? I think it is the wonder and the magic of what our brains are capable of...if we can just allow ourselves to imagine the possibilities.

OECD cuts growth forecast for Eurozone to 0.8% from 1.2%Eurozone economic growth forecast cut by OECD
By AP | 16 Sep, 2014, 04.15AM IST
The OECD said "growth remains weak in the euro area, which runs the risk of prolonged stagnation if further steps are not taken to boost demand".
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
FRANKFURT/GERMANY: A major international organization has cut its growth forecast for the countries that use the euro and says the troubled currency union needs even more stimulus from the central bank and governments.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank dealing with the world's developed countries, cut its forecasts for the eurozone this year to 0.8 per cent from 1.2 per cent in its May assessment.
The Paris-based OECD also cut its growth forecasts for the US and several other large economies but said the global economy overall was continuing a moderate if uneven recovery. The outlook for the US was cut to 2.1 per cent from 2.6 per cent and for Japan to 0.9 per cent from 1.2 per cent. Italy, one of the more troubled economies in Europe, was downgraded from 0.5 per cent to minus 0.4 per cent.
The OECD singled out the 18-country eurozone for special attention, saying the European Central Bank needs to do more to help growth in the eurozone, including large-scale bond purchases, to expand the amount of money in the financial system - a move known as quantitative easing. It also called on governments to loosen spending within the flexibility afforded by European Union rules limiting deficits and debt.
The ECB has already taken a number of steps aimed at supporting a weak recovery. It has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.05 per cent, offered long-term cheap loans to banks on condition they lend to companies, and said it will buy bonds made up of loans to companies as another way to boost credit to businesses.
The OECD said "growth remains weak in the euro area, which runs the risk of prolonged stagnation if further steps are not taken to boost demand" and that "further measures, including quantitative easing, are warranted."
The US Federal Reserve , Bank of Japan and Bank of England have all tried quantitative easing. The ECB has not ruled it out, but the step is more complicated in a currency union with 18 countries.
The world economy continues to grow but forecasts are uneven across countries. China is expected to grow 7.4 per cent his year but Brazil only 0.3 per cent after falling into recession in the first half.
The OECD's acting chief economist, Rintaro Tamaki, said labor markets in the developed world were only slowly improving, "with far too many people still unable to find good jobs worldwide."

Oil hits two-year low of $97; dollar rises ahead of FedSave precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Brent crude fell below $97 per barrel on Monday, its lowest in more than two years, as weak Chinese economic data cut the prospect for global demand at a time of abundant supply, while expectations that the Federal Reserve will provide new details this week about its plans to raise interest rates lifted the dollar.
Chinese factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August as growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown.
The Brent contract for October delivery, which expired on Monday, fell as low as $96.21 a barrel, its weakest since July 2012. The contract later pared some losses to settle down 46 cents at $96.65 a barrel. The November contract for Brent fell 8 cents a barrel to settle at $97.88.
News that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak will meet OPEC officials on Tuesday in Vienna was cited as helping pull oil prices off lows.
"Maybe the pullback on the China data was a little overdone," said Gene McGillian, an analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, echoing the sentiment of other analysts.
US crude rose 65 cents to settle at $92.92 a barrel.
The dollar rose on expectations the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will affirm the US economy's steady recovery at the end of a two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday and possibly provide a timeline as to when it would start to raise rates.
US manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with steadily rising factory activity. That was confirmed by other data showing factory activity in New York state jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September.
The euro fell 0.21 per cent against the dollar to $1.2937, while the dollar index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, traded flat at 84.243. The Japanese yen slipped 0.12 per cent against the dollar to 107.19.
Most US stocks fell, dragged lower by the tech sector as investors made space in their portfolios for Alibaba's planned initial public offering later this week, and biotech shares weighed further on the Nasdaq.
"The Alibaba IPO is going to have a big effect, drawing money out of some stocks, and how it performs can help say a lot about the tech sector," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Oil giant Chevron, up 1.5 per cent at $124.53, added the most points to the Dow's rise.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.34 points, or 0.27 per cent, at 17,032.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.78 point, or 0.04 per cent, at 1,984.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 45.42 points, or 0.99 per cent, at 4,522.18.
MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance across 45 countries fell 0.18 per cent to 425.42.
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares closed down 0.05 per cent at 1,382.32.
US Treasury debt prices rose on bargain hunting encouraged by fresh signs of spotty economic growth, which might slow the Fed's shift away from loose monetary polices.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.5887 per cent.

Jet Airways  Qatar offer steep discounts on ...Jet Airways, Qatar Airways offer steep discounts on business class
Anirban Chowdhury, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 10.10AM IST

Abu Dhabi
(Under the same offer, one…)
MUMBAI: The price war in the skies has spread to the business class. Jet Airways and Qatar Airways are offering huge discounts in a desperate bid to take on Emirates and Singapore Airlines whose recently started A380 flights are scooping passengers in big chunks. Jet Airways is offering all-inclusive one-way business class fares to London at just Rs 28,382 from Delhi and Rs 27,727 from Mumbai, which are just onefourth of usual business class fares and almost half of regular economy fares.
The offer is effective for bookings between September 16 to 18 for travel between October 16, 2014 and July 31, 2015. Under the same offer, one can fly to Singapore in business class at just Rs 18,672 from Delhi and Rs 18,282 from Mumbai, about one-third of normal fares. Jet, however, clarified that none of these fares are valid on flights that operate via its new international hub Abu Dhabi. The airline made Abu Dhabi its global hub after selling 24 per cent stake to Etihad last year.
Earlier in the day, Qatar Airways wrote to travel agents offering an up to 25 per cent discount on all its 130 direct and indirect destinations from India on economy, business and even first classes on bookings made till September 17 for travel between September 21 and June 15, 2015. Industry experts said poor demand has forced airlines to this.
"Demand is a problem. Business class seats for many airlines have been going empty or half full at best," said an industry watcher who didn't want to be named. "What's more, the oncoming festive season never means the same spurt for business class as it does for the back end of the flight." Further, the 500-plus-seater A380 jumbo jet services started by Emirates and Singapore Airlines have made a dent in the market.
"The Emirates A380 flights are doing exceptionally well and so are the ones operated by Singapore Airlines although they have been quiet about it. Bookings are chock-full," said Manoj Samuel , director at Riya Travels, one of the biggest offline travel companies. And it's not as if Emirates is enticing passengers with its premium services alone. The airline recently wrote to travel agents offering base fares starting Rs 7,700 to destinations such as Jeddah, Doha and Bahrain.
Singapore started its daily flights from Delhi and Mumbai on May 30 while Emirates started operating a single daily A380 Mumbai-Dubai flight from June 21. Jet's business class offers are not limited to international routes. Under the scheme, a Delhi-Mumbai business class ticket comes for Rs 4,819, while a Mumbai-Bangalore ticket costs Rs 9,016.
Depending on the aircraft make, Jet Airways has anywhere between 8 and 34 premiere seats per flight. Only a miniscule percentage of the inventory would be on offer on these fares. Slowdown has forced airlines to force-fill their flights with discounts. However, slashing prices in the business class that doesn't depend on volumes is considered a desperate measure.

SAB's failure to combine with Heineken leaves it more vulnerable to takeover bid by InBev
Bloomberg Sep 16, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV
(SABMiller Plc is the world’s…)
LONDON: SABMiller Plc's failure to erect a defence against Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) by combining with Heineken NV (HEIA) has left the world's second-largest brewer even more vulnerable to a takeover by the industry leader.
Heineken said on Sunday that it rejected an approach from London-based SABMiller, an overture that intended to help fend off a possible bid for the Miller Lite maker by AB InBev, according to people with knowledge of the matter. SABMiller is assessing its next move, the people said, yet its options are now more limited and the ball is in the Belgian giant's court to move forward with a long-speculated takeover.
"That SABMiller's inorganic options have been so publicly lessened puts ABI in an even stronger position, should it choose to make a move on SABMiller," Eddy Hargreaves, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note on Monday. "SABMiller shareholders may be even more likely now to welcome a bid."
Karen Couck, a spokeswoman for AB In-Bev, declined to comment, as did SABMiller spokesman Richard Farnsworth. SABMiller shares surged as much as 13% in London on Monday, the most in almost 12 years, as speculation of an offer from AB In-Bev intensified. The gain boosted SABMiller's market capitalisation to more than 61 billion pounds ($99 billion), a valuation that would make a deal the industry's biggest ever.
BEER BEHEMOTH
Shares of drinks companies from Guinness brewer Diageo to Carlsberg also advanced as the approach for Amsterdam-based Heineken fueled excitement about the potential for more deals. Beer industry stocks, stoked by merger speculation, are trading at their most expensive levels in 10 years, based on forward price-earnings ratios, according to analysts at Nomura.
While SABMiller could still seek other partners, such as Carlsberg, "the fact that SAB's management seem so serious about the need to defend themselves does add credence to the ABI-is-going-to-buy-SAB story," Jonathan Fyfe, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said in a note. AB InBev, based in Leuven, Belgium, has spent close to $100 billion over the past decade to purchase brews from Corona to Budweiser
BOTTLING AGREEMENTS
SABMiller CEO Alan Clark told Bloomberg News in January that the case could be made for a tie-up, even though it would likely require selling some assets in the US, home of the company's MillerCoors LLC joint venture, to appease regulators.
One sign that a deal might be in the works is if AB InBev declines to renew a soft-drink bottling agreement with PepsiCo Inc in Latin America, which is similar to one that SABMiller has with Coca-Cola in Africa. AB InBev must give notice by next year at the latest if it does not want to continue with the agreement beyond 2017, at which point it automatically renews, according to Canaccord's Hargreaves.
BALANCE SHEET
Another indication is AB InBev's balance sheet. The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, or Ebitda, has declined to about 2 times, a level that makes a bid "feasible", according to Hargreaves.
That ratio could expand to as much as 7.2 times if a deal was funded entirely by debt, Fitch said, yet the combined entity's cash flow could bring that down to 3.3 times within two years.

Washington: Despite digital technology invading youngsters' life, US millennials are reading more books than the older generation, said a latest survey by Washington-based think tank Pew Research Centre.
"Eighty-eight percent of Americans under 30 years read a book in the past year, compared with 79 per cent of those aged 30 and older. Adults of 65 and over were the age group least likely to have read a book in the past year," the findings revealed.
The survey analysed the reading habits of over 6,000 Americans of age 16 and over.

The report found that despite their embrace of technology, 62 per cent of US millennials said there was a lot of useful, important information that is not available on the internet.
Over 43 per cent of millennials said they read on a daily basis compared to 40 per cent of older adults.
The Pew report titled "Younger Americans and Public Libraries" found that a 52 per cent of the youngsters said they purchased, rather than borrowed books.
The survey also found that 50 per cent of younger Americans used a library compared with 47 per cent of older Americans.
But youngsters were less bothered by the possibility of libraries closing down, Guardian reported.

Two Boston University graduates have developed a new smartphone app to turn job hunting into a thrilling social experience.
Using the app, job hunters share information about their expertise and personal interests, creating networks to make the quest more pleasant, and with any luck, quicker, media reports said.
A messaging feature lets compatible users instantly contact one another.
This app is very helpful for students who are just out of college and have no friends who can help them out in their job hunting.
"As most people find jobs through friends, relatives, and colleagues, this app will solve this problem and will also make an excellent career tool," co-founder Nathan Bernard was quoted as saying.
The Coffee app is currently available for iPhone and iPad.

New Delhi: After missing several deadlines, the National Optical Fibre Network project, which aims to link 2.5 lakh village panchayats, may finally be ready by a year in advance at the instance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wants it rolled out in early 2016.
Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had announced earlier that the project will be completed by March 2017. In a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister on Digital India last month, it was decided that target dates for completing National Optical Fibre Network project will be advanced to early 2016.
Following this decision, Department of Telecom has written to the three public sector units- BSNL, RailTel and Power Grid to expedite work so as to complete the project by
Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had announced earlier that the project will be completed by March 2017.
#dot #tracking the modi government #ravi shankar prasad #digital india
March 2016. "NOFN is a priority project for the government and DoT has been advised to accelerate the project implementation such as to complete the project in March 2016," DoT Additional Secretary (AS) and Administrator Rita Teaotia said in a letter to all the three PSUs.
The DoT has proposed to launch broadband services in 1,000 village panchyats by October 30 whereas NDA government has set a target to connect at least 50,000 village panchayats by the high-speed broadband network by March 2015. The UPA government had cleared the NOFN for Rs 20,000 crore to be rolled out through a special purpose vehicle BBNL but could not roll it out beyond pilot project in 3 blocks.
As per an official source, process of trenching is very slow and it has commenced only in 16 states and 1 union territory. "Out of total 2.46 lakh km of optical fibre that has to be laid for the project, only 4,334 kms of trenching and pipe palying work has been completed. Cable has been pulled for 2,059 kms only. Work has not even started for 18 states including union territories," the source said.
Circle heads of state-run telecom firm BSNL have shared that village Sarpanch and pradhans at many places are not allowing BSNL to lay optical fibre and install broadband equipment without any clear government order and many of them are also demanding rent. Another official source said that even orders of some important components like ducts required for laying optical fibre cable have not been placed by BSNL in many circles.
"Against requirement of 2.46 lakh km of PLB ducts for phase 1, purchase order for about 33,500 km has been placed and around 8,900 km has been received," the official said. The DoT AS reviewed work done by each PSU and pulled them individually for slow movement of the project.

Oil Hits 26-Month Low Under $97RBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
London: Brent crude oil fell below $97 per barrel on Monday to its lowest in more than two years as lacklustre economic data from China, the world's top energy consumer, cast a shadow over the outlook for oil demand at a time of abundant supply.
China's factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August, while growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown.
October Brent, due to expire on Monday, fell as low as $96.21 a barrel, its weakest since July 2, 2012. The futures contract recovered to around $96.70 by 1325 GMT (6:55 p.m. in India), down 41 cents.
US crude was down 40 cents at $91.87, after touching $90.63 - near a 16-month low of $90.43 hit last week.
"Struggling global economic growth has resulted in falling growth in global oil demand," PVM oil analyst Tamas Varga said, adding that concerns over conflict in the Middle East, North Africa and Russia had not translated into supply disruptions.
Chinese data, which showed a drop in power generation for the first time in four years, came on the heels of downward revisions in 2014 and 2015 global oil demand growth estimates by the International Energy Agency last week.
On the supply front, Libya's oil production is expected to rise to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in October. Libya was supplying almost nothing to world oil markets four months ago.
Oil ministers from the Middle East Gulf said last week the oil price drop was unlikely to spur action by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) unless crude fell below $85 a barrel.
A rally in the US dollar against major currencies has also helped weaken oil. Investors will be closely watching the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the United States will raise interest rates.
A stronger US currency makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Investors continue to keep an eye on geopolitical tensions for indications of any new threat to supply.
The United States and European Union imposed fresh sanctions on Moscow last week, hampering exploration of Russia's huge Arctic and shale oil reserves and setting rules on tougher financing of existing Russian projects.

Alibaba now plans to raise up to $25.03 billion in its upcoming IPO, making what was expected to be the biggest stock market debut even bigger.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Alibaba now plans to raise up to $25.03 billion in its upcoming IPO, making what was expected to be the biggest stock market debut even bigger.
The Chinese e-commerce company said it still plans to sell 368.1 million shares, but at $66 to $68 apiece, according to a regulatory filing, instead of its previously set range of $60 to $66 apiece.
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has emerged as a hot commodity because of its e-commerce bazaar, a shopping magnet for businesses and consumers alike as China's economy steadily grows. The company's network of sites includes Taobao, Tmall, and AliExpress, as well as Alibaba.
Most of Alibaba's 279 million active buyers visit the sites at least once a month on smartphones and other mobile devices, making the company attractive to investors as computing shifts away from laptop and desktop machines.
Investors have been salivating over the trifecta of growth that Alibaba offers: "There are very few companies that are this big, grow this fast, and are this profitable," said Wedbush analyst Gil Luria. He initiated coverage on the company with a 12-month price target of $80.
The company's revenue in its latest quarter ending in June surged 46 percent from last year to $2.54 billion while its earnings climbed 60 percent to nearly $1.2 billion, after subtracting a one-time gain and certain other items.
Alibaba has been meeting with potential investors over the past week, and demand spurred the increase. Alibaba is expected to be priced late Thursday and start trading Friday under the ticker `BABA' on the NYSE.
The fundraising target eclipses the $16 billion Facebook raised in 2012, the most for a technology IPO. It also would top the all-time IPO fundraising record of $22.1 billion set by the Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. in 2010, according to the research firm Dealogic.

Microsoft s $2.5 bn gamble: Will "Minecraft" maker help boost mobile reachThe maker of the much obsessed-over "Candy Crush Saga," for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game "Minecraft" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.
But the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the US, today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over "Candy Crush Saga," for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.
In addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind " Minecraft ," aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.
Then again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus "Notch" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.
"It certainly seems like the founders of `Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward," Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. "It was something too big for them. `Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user."
Microsoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses _ Windows and Office software installed on desktops _ slow down or decline. With "Minecraft," Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer _ mobile players.
"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile," Blau said. "It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung."
"Minecraft" is an "open world" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects _ thus the frequent Lego comparisons.
"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea," Minecraft's website explains.
Besides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make "Minecraft" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.
With an all-ages "E" rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.
Microsoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster "Halo" video game franchise. Unlike "Halo," though, "Minecraft" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.

Ahead of Chinese President Xi Jingping’s visit to India, India and Vietnam have called for freedom of navigation in the disputed South China Sea.
In a joint communique issued after President Pranab Mukherjee, who is on a four-day State visit to Vietnam, held talks with his Vietnamese counterpart Truong Tan Sang here, the two countries said the freedom of navigation in the East Sea/South China Sea should not be impeded. Without naming any country, they called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid threat or use of force and resolve disputes through peaceful means.
The two sides called for collective commitment of the parties concerned to abide by and implement the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and to work towards the adoption of a Code of Conduct on the basis of consensus.
On Monday, India and Vietnam signed seven agreements, including one for enhanced cooperation in the oil sector.
The two countries also signed an MoU on operating and jointly promoting direct air services under which Vietnam Airlines and India’s Jet Airways will operate flights. Both countries decided to strengthen bilateral cooperation with a focus on political, defence and security cooperation, economic cooperation, science and technology, culture and people-to-people links, technical cooperation and multilateral and regional cooperation.
The pacts include EXIM Bank of India’s extension of a dollar credit line to Vietnam, agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in Customs.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
When was the last time you were truly delighted by your smartphone?
I mean, when was the last time your smartphone did something so surprising that you smiled? Or you discovered a feature and actually thought, "Okay, THAT was awesome?"
It's been a while, right?
That's because today, most smartphones are exactly the same. They are all lighting-fast. They all have great screens. They all have the same apps. They all have good cameras. They all have 4G connections. They're all easy to use. Heck, they all pretty much look the same.
That's what makes the new Moto X so wonderful -- it's not just another smartphone. It's your smartphone. You can make the Moto X fit your needs.
Do you want your phone to be quiet during meetings and automatically respond with a custom text? You can do that. Or maybe you want it to automatically detect when you're driving and read your texts aloud? It'll do that if you want it to.

You can even set your Moto X to detect when you're home, then announce who's calling when your phone rings. That means you can leave your phone charging on the kitchen counter and you don't have to get up from your comfortable living room chair when your phone rings if you're screening your calls.
 
The Moto 360 in 60 (seconds)
And the Moto X will look exactly the way you want too. With Motorola's online Moto Maker tool, you can mix and match any number of combinations of colors and materials. You want a leather back and a white screen? How about your laser-etched signature on a seafoam green back with a black front? Or maybe you want your phone to be made out of wood. All those options are available with the new Moto X.
My favorite Moto X feature lets you set a unique name for your phone. Mine is "tippity spoons," which is some crazy name my three-year old daughter suggested. (Why not?) So I just yell "tippity spoons," and my phone will do whatever I tell it to. It's fantastic while driving -- I don't need to touch anything.

Beyond letting you customize it, the Moto X also comes with a handful of smart extra features.
When you take the phone out of your pocket, your phone will display the time -- you don't have to hit any buttons. When you get a call, just wave at your phone to silence it. To snap a photo, just shake your phone -- even if it's locked. And when you get a notification, you can tap your phone to get a quick glance at who's trying to bug you.
Other phones have better cameras (the Moto X's is fine but not outstanding like the Samsung ( SSNLF ) Galaxy S5, Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) Lumia or the Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) iPhone). Other phones have better speakers (the Moto X's are loud and clear, but no one beats the HTC M8). There are better sized phones too (the Moto X's 5.2-inch screen is a bit too big for my puny hands).
But other than the iPhone, the Moto X is the only phone that will delight you on a consistent basis.
That's why the Moto X is the best Android smartphone ever made.

Miss America: TV loser  Twitter queenMiss America: TV loser, Twitter queen
By Frank Pallotta   @frankpallotta September 15, 2014: 5:42 PM ET
Miss New York, Kira Kazantsev, was crowned Miss America Sunday night marking the third year in a row the winner has hailed from that state.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Miss America isn't just being judged by a panel of experts, but also by TV ratings, hashtags and snarky tweets.
Kira Kazantsev was crowned Miss America Sunday night, and while the show's television ratings weren't the best, this year's telecast absolutely blew up on Twitter.
Still, up against NBC's "Sunday Night Football," the 88th annual beauty pageant only pulled in 6.7 million viewers, a broadcast low.
This was a 22% drop from last year.
But the show's social performance, over 300,000 tweets and over 48 million Twitter impressions, according to Nielsen, is comparable to other "live event TV" hits.
SyFy's "Sharknardo 2: The Second One" and NBC's "The Sound of Music Live," brought in around 68 million Twitter impressions each.
One of the ways the ABC broadcast created social buzz was through the use of small fact boxes that would appear in the corner of the screen. Each box gave a fun tidbit or piece of trivia about the life of each Miss America hopeful.
The boxes were reminiscent of Vh1's "Pop-Up Video," and gave the pageant some much needed social chatter.
It's very hard to prove a social media lift for live TV, especially considering last night's awful ratings, but Miss America was unquestionably relevant on Twitter. Arguably, it was even more fun to watch along with the Twitter chatter.
During the broadcast, New York Times media and culture columnist David Carr posted a tweet saying, "Am amazed at Twitter's ability to build a campfire around anything and start snarking/smiling/smartalecking #MissAmerica #HighLoWorld."
Carr has a point. Twitter can be a snarky place, but looking at how well the show plays there, Miss America would be smart to embrace social media more, because if ratings continue to tumble, it may be one of the pageant's few saving graces.

Midcaps stands tall even as Sensex loses 244 points
ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 06.40AM IST

Foreign institutional inflows
(BSE’s Sensex declined…)
Mumbai: Mid and small cap shares may continue to outperform benchmark indices over the next few days with retail traders holding fort in the wake of slowing foreign institutional inflows .
On Monday, the broader market advanced while the Sensex and Nifty dropped, mirroring the weakness in Asian markets, which were dragged down by fresh fears of sluggish growth in China. Concern over the interest rate increases in the US ahead of the Fed's meet this week also spooked markets.
BSE's Sensex declined 244.48 points, or 0.90 per cent to close at 26,816.56. NSE's Nifty dropped 63.50 points, or 0.78 per cent, to close at 8,042.
The rupee on Monday saw its biggest singleday dip in nearly one-and-a-half months, mirroring weakness in other major Asian currencies against the US dollar. The sharp fall in domestic share market too added to the decline. The local unit closed at 61.13 per dollar, 48 paisa, or 0.79 per cent, weaker than its previous close at 60.65 last Friday. During the trading session, it touched an intra-day low of 61.18, a level last seen on August 13 this year.
Among the broader market measures, BSE's mid-cap index gained 0.2 per cent and smallcap index advanced 0.7 per cent. Advances outnumbered declines in the ratio 1762:1302, underlining the relative strength outside the blue chips. Brokers and fund managers said the sustained gains in mid and small cap shares are because of participation from retail investors and traders.
On Monday, foreign and domestic institutional investors net sold shares worth about Rs 75 crore each. Heightened retail investor participation may be a sign of fatigue on Dalal Street as a section of the market believes stock valuations are pricey.
"Valuations of Indian equities are looking stretched at this point of time," said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head multi asset, ING Investment Management. "India is not a good bet among emerging markets (EMs)," he said.
MSCI's Asia-Pacific index, excluding Japan, slid 0.9 per cent with South Korea's KOSPI dipping 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping 0.6 per cent. Surprisingly, Shanghai Composite Index managed to eke out gains of 0.2 per cent. Data showed China's factory output in August grew at the slowest pace in nearly six years.

After Android One  Google brings offline YouTube for India: PichaiIndia to be test bed for Google's new initiatives
By Pankaj Mishra & Jayadevan PK, ET Bureau | 16 Sep, 2014, 07.01AM IST
Google Senior V-P Sundar Pichai says India is a key market and the Android One launch heralds the start of many more initiatives here.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India will be the proving ground for many new initiatives by Google, the company's highest-profile Indian-origin executive said, highlighting the Internet giant's commitment to one of the world's biggest markets for technology.
On Monday, the Chennai-born Sundar Pichai launched cut-rate smartphones based on Google's Android One program tailored for India and likened the opportunities in this country to China, the world's second-largest economy.
"Like we are doing with Android One, we would want to do more such things India-specific. Just because of the scale and scope of the market," said Pichai, 42, a senior V-P who oversees the Chrome browser and apps. "You have seen what is happening in China, and you have seen how much investment has happened. I expect the same to happen for India and I expect Google to do the same."
At present, India contributes only a tiny fraction ($330 million) of Google's $55-billion revenue, but the country is all the more important because of the company's struggles in China. The USbased company has a minuscule share of the search engine market in the Middle Kingdom, and while its Android mobile operating system is popular, most apps are downloaded through third-party stores. "Soon we will be in that phase where it (India) is not just potential but a big market," said Pichai, pointing to the country's 500 million Internet users. "It is a big bet from our side. I think the thing that will really tip over is when I look at the numbers."
As an example of an India-specific initiative, Pichai, who reports to CEO and cofounder Larry Page, cited the launch of a service to make YouTube work even when there is no Internet connectivity. Pichai, who studied at IIT-Kharagpur, Stanford University and The Wharton School, began his career at Google in 2004.
He was the driving force behind Chrome, the browser which eventually became one of Google's most successful products. He then set out to build a whole ecosystem around Chrome — including Chromebooks (laptops running Chrome operating system) and applications that run on Chrome.
In many markets, including India, Google has faced tough questions from regulators on issues such as privacy, taxation and alleged anti-competitive practices. Pichai defended the company against criticism, saying it is not uncommon for a large company to face such scrutiny. All the same, "We never ever forget that we exist and do well because users trust us," he remarked.

The euro bought $1.2938 and 138.63 yen against $1.2940 and 138.69 yen in US trade.

Catalan activists look to ScotsCatalan activists look to Scottish campaign as an object lesson
By Tobias Buck in Barcelona
©AFP
It hangs from thousands of balconies overlooking the great avenues of Barcelona. It flutters outside millionaires’ beach villas on the Costa Brava and is draped over crumbling farm houses in the Catalan hinterland.
Known as the Estelada, the flag combines the red-and-yellow stripes of Catalonia with a Cuban-style triangle and star. It is the emblem of the Catalan independence movement – and no one in the region can recall a time when it was more ubiquitous than it is today.
More
Cracks appear in Nordic economic model
The Estelada’s proliferation just as Scotland is readying to vote on independence is no coincidence. Catalan activists have long looked to the Scottish campaign as a trailblazer – and to the UK in general as a model for how to resolve secessionist tensions. Indeed, the Catalans are determined to turn Scotland’s independence referendum into a precedent for their own struggle : the regional government in Barcelona says it will hold a regional plebiscite on Catalonia’s political future less than two months later, on November 9.
“It was feasible in the UK. It was feasible in Canada. So it should be feasible here in Spain,” says Albert Royo, the secretary-general of Diplocat, the Catalan body that handles public diplomacy.
Catalan officials and activists say a victory for the Scottish Yes campaign would give a boost to their own efforts. No less important, an independent Scotland would have to confront some of the very same legal and economic issues that would also be faced by a breakaway Catalan state. “If there is a Yes victory, certain issues such as membership of the EU and Nato would be easier for us,” says Mr Royo.
Yet despite the overlapping interests – and the proximity of the two plebiscites – officials say there is little co-ordination and communication between the two independence camps. Members of the Catalan government say they have very little contact with their Scottish counterparts. Artur Mas , the Catalan president, has never met Alex Salmond, Scotland’s first minister.
“The Scottish politicians have done something very intelligent. They have presented their case as a unique case. They have tried to say: we do not want to mix our case with other cases,” says Ricard Gené, a member of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), the grassroots body that has played a central part in the independence campaign.
Like other Catalan activists, he believes Scotland’s reluctance to ally itself in public with Catalonia reflects fears that this would antagonise the Spanish government. This matters because an independent Scotland would need the backing of Madrid to remain in or rejoin the EU. “Scotland does not want to stir the pot very much,” says Mr Gené.

Much to the frustration of Catalan politicians, it is far from certain the November referendum will go ahead. The Spanish government says the country’s constitution prohibits such regional plebiscites and insists it will block the vote. The confrontation looks likely to end up in front of Spain’s constitutional court in the coming months – and few believe the tribunal will side with the Catalans.

Northern League seeks Scotland boostItaly’s Northern League looks to Scotland vote for separation push
By Rachel Sanderson in Milan
©AFP
Italy’s anti-immigrant, anti-euro Northern League party is seizing on the Scottish vote for independence as an opportunity to “relaunch the battle” for secession of the north of Italy, planning a mass rally and stepping up its confrontation with Rome over its push for a referendum in the wealthy Veneto region.
The Northern League was founded 30 years ago calling for the recreation of a mythical Celtic state in northern Italy, known as Padania.
More
Cracks appear in Nordic economic model
Its national influence is much weaker than when the party was a key partner in the successive governments of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. However, it retains a stronghold in Italy’s richest regions in the north, with populist campaigning centred on immigrant bashing and pledges to protect its economic wealth from Italy’s “thieving” south.
Matteo Salvini , the 41-year-old leader of the Northern League, told the Financial Times that Scotland’s vote on September 18 on whether to sever its 307-year union with England was “a great boost for all movements for autonomy and identity in Europe, from Catalonia , to Flemish, to the Bretons and the Padanians”.
“The fact the vote is taking place at all is a positive thing for us in Padania. We are going relaunch the battle for independence,” he said, adding he intended to use Scotland’s vote as leverage to step up pressure on the government of Matteo Renzi to allow the northern region of Veneto its own referendum on independence.
“I’m convinced we are also going to be one of the protagonists in a historic period of change which is going to see the economic and geographic borders of Europe rewritten over the next few years,” he added.
The Northern League took 6.15 per cent of the national vote in the European elections in May, a tiny fraction of the 40 per cent won by prime minister Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party but more than expected after a campaign focused on bashing the euro and immigrant. The League won nearly 12 per cent of the vote in the north west of Italy and 10 per cent of the vote in the north east.
Its stronghold is the Veneto, one of the most wealthy areas in Europe, where the League typically takes at least a third of the votes. The governor, Luca Zaia, is a vocal League member who frequently rails against European banks, Brussels, immigrants and national institutions.
Mr Salvini said the League planned a mass rally of “militants” at the town of Cittadella, a stronghold of the League in the Veneto three days after the Scottish vote.
“In 20 years of our battle for federalism the Italian state has never given us a chance to vote in a referendum. We maintain that Italy as an idea needs a re-evaluation, that is several different countries, but with the Renzi government we are seeing even more power returning to the central state,” he said.
At dawn on April 2 this year, Italy’s antiterrorist squad raided a shed in a field outside Verona and found a homemade armoured vehicle equipped with a small cannon. Police arrested 24 people, including eight in Verona, in Veneto, under antiterrorist laws and accused them of sedition and possession of armed weapons.
Among the allegations from the authorities was that L’Alleanza, or the Alliance group, which is also pushing for independence for Veneto, planned to use the homemade tank for the “liberation” of Venice’s popular St Mark’s Square in the run-up to the European elections.
“Extremists? It was a ridiculous situation. Those people didn’t hurt anyone. If there’s anything wrong with our extremists it is that they are too moderate, that they are too peaceful,” Mr Salvini said.

Condoms to cold drinks: Late night cravings get doorstep deliveriesFrom condoms to cigarettes, late night cravings get doorstep deliveries
By Shweta Sharma | IANS –  Sun 14 Sep, 2014 1:06 PM IST

New Delhi/Gurgaon/Bangalore, Sep 14 (IANS) Advertising professional Manit Khurana pulls the graveyard shift often, which affects his sleep cycle along with his diet. But, with the mushrooming of many all-night delivery set-ups in the capital, he now has an option of thinking beyond chips and instant noodles.
From food and cold drinks to condoms and cigarettes, these delivery outlets offer it all, making it a win-win situation for late-night sleepers.
"Times have changed. People previously used to sleep by 10-11 p.m. Not any more. These days, they are either working through the night or are awake watching movies, TV shows or partying. Since they are up at odd hours, they often need things from shops much after they close - like midnight snacks, beverages, party items, medical essentials and more," Raghav Negi, marketing head, Batman Delivers, told IANS.
Launched in April 2013, Gurgaon-based Batman Delivers is one of the many such late-night delivering systems which operate across the country. Others include Mumbai-based express delivery service Fly By Knight and Bangalore-based Late Night.
"Such services are a blessing. Earlier, I either used to sleep having a cup of noodles or make unnecessary plans with friends so that I can eat something substantial. Now, no more. The days I get late at work, I no longer need to worry about a good meal being delivered at my door step," 28-year-old Khurana said.
Shalin Mishra, founder of Late Night, shared that their customers have the option of selecting between vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.
"Our menu includes a range of appetizers, Indian breads, a variety of rice and noodles, paneer/chicken/egg gravies, soft drinks, chocolates, pastries and smokes. We also deliver birthday/anniversary cakes at midnight on pre-booking," Mishra told IANS, adding that the service also delivers condoms, sanitary napkins and other essentials. Late Night operates from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. and can be contacted on : 8884-93-2323.
With their target group and clientele ranging from anyone from16 to 60 years old, the combo meals offered by these express delivery services range between Rs.299 and Rs.500.
"Over the last year we have been experimenting a lot with our product offerings to understand the market sentiment. Like any growing business, we faced a lot of challenges on all possible fronts, be it operations, logistics or product quality," Neha Jain, founder and director at Fly By Knight, told IANS.
"After a lot of feedback and testing, we will be launching a new product offering keeping in mind quality, taste, convenience and overall customer experience," she said. Fly By Knight operates from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and can be contacted 91-8080533836.
Moving beyond routine offerings, Negi of Batman Delivers said they keep innovating to deliver better value and service to customers. (Batman Delivers 0124-6543210,1 and 9910099925)
"Keeping the same thought we have launched services like plumber, electrician and driver at night," Negi added. They operate between 7 p.m.and 5 a.m.
So, what keeps the business going successfully?
"Unprecedented change in lifestyles, demanding and busy schedules and willingness to shed extra bucks for customised services are a major reason for the success of late night delivery services in India," Mishra explained.
Agreed Jain, who said that the key was "convenience".
"The demand for after-hours service has risen due to changing lifestyles, professions, constant need to be connected. Moreover, the ambiguity of the laws for extending services at night is extremely discouraging for businesses to take the segment seriously even if they see demand," she told IANS.
"Most start-ups and businesses are experimenting with newer formats to bring in a new wave of entrepreneurs who are ready to take up the challenge of solving this problem," Jain added.

Investing.com - Investing.com - European stocks were lower on Monday, as investors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's monthly policy meeting on Wednesday and the vote on Scottish referendum scheduled the next day.
During European morning trade, the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.24%, France's CAC 40 retreated 0.41%, while Germany's DAX slipped 0.22%.
Markets were jittery amid growing expectations for an early hike in U.S. interest rates.
The Fed was expected to cut its asset purchase program by another $10 billion at its upcoming policy meeting on Wednesday, which would keep it on track for winding up the program in October, and to start raising interest rates sometime in mid-2015.
Meanwhile, investors eyed the upcoming referendum on Scottish independence. Anopinion poll conducted last Wednesday showed that support for the no campaign was back in the lead with 53% of voters.
Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders BNP Paribas (PARIS:BNPP) and Societe Generale (PARIS:SOGN) declined 0.48% and 0.55%, while Germany's Commerzbank (XETRA:CBKG) retreated 0.85%.
Among peripheral lenders, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo (MILAN:ISP) and Unicredit (MILAN:CRDI) lost 0.04% and 0.83% respectively, while Spanish banks Banco Santander (MADRID:SAN) and BBVA (MADRID:BBVA) fell 0.25% and 0.48%.
Elsewhere, Heineken (AMS:HEIN) saw shares rally 1.74% after the brewer rejected on Sunday a takeover deal from Sabmiller (LONDON:SAB), whose shares surged 4.60%.
Clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz (ST:HMb) added to gains, up 2.25% after reporting a 19% increase in third-quarter sales.
In London, FTSE 100 lost 0.41%, weighed by losses in the financial sector.
Shares in Barclays (LONDON:BARC) and HSBC Holdings (LONDON:HSBA) edged down 0.11% and 0.12%, while Lloyds Banking (LONDON:LLOY) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (LONDON:RBS) tumbled 1.07% and 1.06% respectively.
In the mining sector, stocks were also broadly lower. Glencore Xstrata (LONDON:GLEN) slid 0.36% and Rio Tinto (LONDON:RIO) saw shares fall 0.25%, while Bhp Billiton (LONDON:BLT) declined 0.43% and Vedanta Resources (LONDON:VED) lost 1.06%.
Meanwhile, TUI Travel (LONDON:TT) saw shares jump 1.83% after it and Tui AG (XETRA:TUIGn) lifted the benefits aimed from their planned all-share merger after the board of the U.K. tour operator recommended its shareholders to accept the offer.
The combined entity is expected will realise €100 million from the combination.
In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a lower open. The Dow 30 futures pointed to a 0.25% fall, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.28% loss, while the NASDAQ 100 futures indicated a 0.26% decline.
Later in the day, the U.S. was to release reports on manufacturing activity in the Empire State and industrial production.

No ind director in CIL,MCL power project nod may be delayed
"The board may take up the matter in the next meeting on September 17. Once it is cleared, it would reach the Coal India board for approval," MCL Chairman and Managing Director AN Sahay had said.
Post your opinion here
 
Absence of any independent director in  Coal India Ltd may delay board approval for Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd's 1,600-MW maiden thermal power plant. The MCL pithead power project which had been delayed for various reasons in the past, was ready to take-off once it gets approval from its own board and its parent CIL board. "The board may take up the matter in the next meeting on September 17. Once it is cleared, it would reach the Coal India board for approval," MCL Chairman and Managing Director AN Sahay had said.
But, since 50 percent of the Coal India board strength remains vacant, the company may prefer to defer the decisions till new independent directors' posts are filled. Coal India board strength is of 14 members of which seven are for functional and seven are independent directors. Currently, there are no independent directors on the board.

Former Coal India chairman N C Jha said technically the board can take decisions with 50 per cent strength, but it might not feel prudent to do it. Ready with necessary infrastructure for the power project, Sahay said, "Once the CIL board gives its nod and clearances are received, it would take another three years for the power plant to come into operation."
He said around 800 acres has already been acquired and water linkages are in place. The plant would utilise coal from MCL's Basundhara coal mines.
Coal India stock price
On November 21, 2014, Coal India closed at Rs 346.75, up Rs 0.00, or 0.00 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 423.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 240.50.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 21.06 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 16.46. The latest book value of the company is Rs 26.04 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 13.32.

BJP doing nothing for welfare of Delhiites: Congress7
1
New Delhi: Accusing BJP-led Central government of failing to solve basic issues being faced by people of the national capital, Delhi Congress on Monday said that the saffron party was "doing nothing for the welfare of people".
"BJP leaders are making a futile bid to push back the development works in Delhi. People are fed up with long power cuts ranging from four to five hours everyday," DPCC chief Arvinder Singh Lovely said while addressing a gathering in Chawari Bazar area.
Singh alleged that BJP "misused" official machinery during the Delhi University Students' Union elections which resulted in the victory of its affiliated students' organisation Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).
"People are fed up with long power cuts ranging from four to five hours everyday," DPCC chief Arvinder Singh Lovely said.
#delhi #delhi government #congress #bjp
"Despite the entire Central government throwing its weight behind ABVP, our candidate from NSUI lost by only a small margin of 700 votes," he said. Accusing BJP leaders of issuing communal statements, DPCC leader Haroon Yusuf said, "such statements are being made in a deliberate and calculated manner to create rift among different sections of the society and hold back the development works."
Attacking Arvind Kejriwal's party, DPCC chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma said, "Why is Aam Aadmi Party silent on the communal statements made by BJP leaders? AAP and BJP are working hand-in-glove and simply wish to destabilise Congress. BJP is doing nothing for the welfare of people."

Beas tragedy: Array professors as respondents for wrong identification  says HC4
0
Shimla: The Himachal High Court on Monday directed that two Assistant Professors of a Hyderabad college be arrayed as respondents for allegedly wrongly identifying dead bodies in the Beas tragedy case.
The court also allowed the parents of deceased students to intervene in the case pertaining to the washing away of 24 B Tech students of VNR Vigyan Jyoti Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, and a co-tour operator in Beas river near Thalout in Mandi district on June 8 due to sudden discharge of water from Larji hydropower project.
A division bench comprising Chief Justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan passed these orders on a petition taking suo moto cognisance of news reports of the tragic incident.
The professors had identified a male dead body found on June 19 as that of M Shiva Prakash, which was handed over to his parents.
#himachal pradesh #manali #beas #himachal high court
ASP, Mandi, informed the court on Monday that investigations have been taken to the logical end and final report in terms of Section 173(2) CrPC has been filed in the competent court. The Advocate General informed the court that challan had been issued against the accused persons before the Judicial
Magistrate, Mandi.
An intervener Ajay Mohan Goel pointed out to the court the negligence of two Assistant Professors of the college CV Ram Babu and VNM Rao in identification of the dead bodies, citing the affidavit of the Chief Secretary.
The professors had identified a male dead body found on June 19 as that of M Shiva Prakash, which was handed over to his parents. But another dead body was recovered on July 13 in decomposed state with belongings of M Shiva Prakash.
The body was sent to Hyderabad and according to the report of Forensic
Science Laboratory there, on the basis of DNA test, the body was that of Shiva Prakash. The Chief Secretary has expressed apprehensions that the body recovered on June 19 may be that of K Shree Harsha as it matches his description. The photographs of the dead body recovered on June 19 had been sent to the district administration, Hyderabad, to compare with the group photographs of students taken before the incident.
The court has directed the respondents to clear the air on the subject within 4 weeks. The court also directed the Chief Secretary to file affidavit after meeting the concerned departments on steps taken by the government and also asked the parties to suggest measures to prevent such mishaps in future and posted the matter for November 17 next.
Eighteen boys, six girls and a co-tour operator were washed away in Beas waters on June 8. Following massive search operations by rescue teams for over a month, all their bodies were recovered from various spots in the river.

Delhi: Baby girl from Nigeria gets treated for rare disorder at city hospital6
1
New Delhi: A 15-month-old girl from Nigeria suffering from a rare genetic condition which was cause of much pain and agony for herself and her family now has doctors at a city hospital to thank for returning the smile to her face.
Oranye Chimweokwu Sayne, the baby girl from Nigeria, had a rare genetic condition which saw her clitoris growing at an alarming rate within 15 months of birth.
The clitoris was enlarged and was progressively increasing in size with every passing month. Worried and anxious after the initial treatment of her daughter failed to yield results, Sayne's mother Chisom Oranye decided to fly her to India for consultation.
Oranye Chimweokwu Sayne, the baby girl from Nigeria, had a rare genetic condition which saw her clitoris growing at an alarming rate within 15 months of birth.
#delhi #baby girl #oranye chimweokwu sayne #nigeria
Sayne's clitoris had by the time grown to an alarming penile shape, her appetite had decreased and her weight had dropped to 6-kg (the weight of a five-month-old baby).
On August 13, they arrived at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, where she met Dr Vaishakhi Rustagi, consultant, Paediatric Endocrinology. After going through Sayne's case, Rustagi diagnosed her condition as congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
"Clitoromegaly is an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris which is in most cases congenital. In the human body, the adrenal gland above the kidney helps in maintaining glucose and blood pressure and controls hormones.
"When one of the enzymes, 21-Hydroxylase, that helps in the control of hormones, is deficient in a newborn's body, it creates a blockage in the production of cortisol (which helps in maintaining glucose) and aldosterone (which helps in maintaining blood pressure).
"The deficiency of 21-Hydroxylase enzyme also results in a startling increase of testosterone in the child's body. If the child is a girl, it leads to an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris which, if not diagnosed in time, can also grow into a penis," explained Rustagi.
As the abnormal growth of a clitoris into a penis is the only physical symptom in a female child, the condition often goes amiss in boys and results in the death of the male child in most of the cases.
According to Rustagi, the deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is seen in one in 2575-6813 cases in India and, as the condition is genetic, the chances of the gene being passed on in consanguine relationships (marriage between two blood relatives of the same blood) are higher.
Rustagi immediately put Sayne on hormonal medication to control her glucose, which was being produced at a minimal rate, and her low blood pressure was brought to normal. Within 10 days, her weight increased by 500-gm and her appetite returned.
As her clitoris had grown by 3-cm to an almost penal shape, Sayne was scheduled for a vaginoplasty on August 26. During the surgery, normal female genitals were formed and the enlarged clitoris was brought back to its normal size maintaining its function.
On Monday, Sayne's weight has increased to 7.2-kg and she is no longer in pain. She is a healthy and bonny child who is back to her cheerful self and will be flying back to her country soon.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 43.63 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 17,031.14, the S&P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 1,984.13, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.70 points, or 1.07 per cent, to 4,518.90.

No case against Hafiz Saeed: PakistanPrint
India has maintained that Saeed is the mastermind behind Mumbai terror attack in 2008, conspiracy for which was hatched, planned and executed out of Pakistan. (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 3:39 pm | Updated: September 15, 2014 3:41 pm
On Monday Pakistan made it clear that there was no case against designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, and he is free to roam in the country.
“Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around. So what is the problem…he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned,” Pakistan High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit said when asked why Saeed was working alongside Pakistan army very close to Line of Control.
“Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him,” he told reporters after an event here.
India has maintained that Saeed is the mastermind behind Mumbai terror attack in 2008, conspiracy for which was hatched, planned and executed out of Pakistan. 166 people were killed in the terror strike. New Delhi has also protested the delay in the on-going trial of the case in Pakistan.
Recently, Saeed, known for his anti-India tirade and designated as a terrorist by the US, has also accused India of indulging in “water-terrorism”.
“On one hand, the Indian government has discharged water in rivers without notification and has given false information, and on the other is ironically offering help,” Saeed has said at a press conference in reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s offer to help Pakistan in the flood crisis.

Coal scam: CBI to file revised charge sheet on September 30CBI had earlier filed charge sheet against Navbharat Power Pvt Ltd (NPPL), its Managing Director and Vice-Chairman Harish Chandra Prasad and its Chairman P Trivikrama Prasad in the case.
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 6:24 pm
CBI on Monday told a special court that it would file a revised charge sheet on September 30 in a coal blocks allocation scam case allegedly involving Navbharat Power Pvt Ltd and others. Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar was informed by special public prosecutor R S Cheema that the agency would file the revised final report in the case which would be comprehensive and would address the lacunae pointed by the court earlier.
The court noted, in its order, that Cheema has informed the CBI Director that investigating officers (IO) should include in the final reports the reasons for arriving at a conclusion for filing a charge sheet or closure report in a particular case.
The court fixed the matter for further proceedings on September 30.
CBI had earlier filed charge sheet against Navbharat Power Pvt Ltd (NPPL), its Managing Director and Vice-Chairman Harish Chandra Prasad and its Chairman P Trivikrama Prasad in the case.
The charge sheet was filed against NPPL and its officials for offences under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) of IPC for allegedly misrepresenting facts, including inflated net worth, to acquire coal blocks.
CBI had also alleged that net worth of the firm applying for coal blocks was an important factor to determine its financial strength and NPPL had fraudulently claimed in its application form that it was supported by Globeleq Singapore Pvt Ltd, Navbharat Ventures Ltd and Mahalaxmi Group Ltd.
NPPL and its officials were named as accused by the agency for allegedly conspiring and cheating by misrepresenting facts to “embellish” its applications to get allotments between 2006 and 2009.
The FIR in the case was lodged after a preliminary enquiry was initiated by CBI on a reference by CVC.
The court had earlier asked the IOs in the coal scam cases to go through the August 25 judgement of the Supreme Court in which all coal blocks allocated during 1993 to 2010 were held as illegal.
The apex court, on August 25, has held that all coal block allocations made since 1993 till 2010 before pre-auction era during the previous NDA and UPA regimes were done in illegal manner by an “ad-hoc and casual” approach “without application of mind”.
Earlier, the special public prosecutor had told the court that he had informed the CBI authorities to prepare a comprehensive report giving all the details related to the case.
He had also said that he had informed CBI to examine and analyse the alleged role of private parties and public servants in the case in an objective and prudent manner.

All smiles: the chef in his new BMW i8. (Chris Tedesco)
Thomas Keller is more than a celebrity chef. He’s a juggernaut. The toque is not only one of the US’s most highly awarded chefs, with two  restaurants holding three Michelin stars, he is also a name on cookbooks, cookware and cooking oils, among other items.

He also loves BMWs, having owned a multitude since the late 1970s, when he bought his first new car, a 320i. No retiring enthusiast, Keller keeps his machines in prime sight at his California restaurants.
So it is not entirely surprising that a man known for experimentation and a love of the roundel badge would become one of the first owners of the new BMW i8 hybrid supercar.
Just before receiving the keys to his futuristic future ride (and preparing a dinner for other freshly minted i8 owners and assorted BMW VIPs), Chef Keller took time in California to give us his thoughts on cars, childrearing and, of course, cooking.
Brett Berk: How does your approach to food and cooking jibe with BMW's approach to the i8? Do you see any areas of overlap or connection?
Thomas Keller: I think that both of us are deeply rooted in tradition, but at the same time [are] forward thinking and on a constant quest for evolution. That’s the important thing. There are other things – integrity and quality. But it’s in the classic quest for evolution: what is going to make something better, what is the best.
(Chris Tedesco)
What attracted you to the i8?
I’ve always had a strong bond with BMW. My first car was a BMW and I still have it today, so I’ve had it for decades before this. It’s a 320i, and I bought it when they launched that, when they went from the 2002 to the 320 – the beginning of the 3 Series. I actually still have every BMW I’ve ever bought. It’s hard for me to let them go. I have a 5 Series Gran Turismo as well, and the i8 represents a total departure from just two years ago in terms of design and features. It represents evolution, and creativity.
How and where do you plan to use the i8? As your daily commuting vehicle? As a weekend car?
I’ll use it as much as I can. I don’t really commute because I live right next to the restaurant (The French Laundry, in the Napa Valley)! I’m going to display it in the parking lot of the restaurant so people can see it and get jealous. And then, I’ll use it for drives. The Napa Valley is a great place to drive.
We have several BMWs at French Laundry, and we want to be responsible for that relationship. Our roots go really deep. To have the cars in our parking lot really says a lot for our relationship. There’s a lot of synergy there, a great bond.
(Chris Tedesco)
Are there any cars on your dream list?
It’s coming. It’s right here now! This is my dream car. My first remembrance of the car was in the Tom Cruise movie. Mission Impossible. That was the first time I saw it.
What is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to you in a car?
Being pulled over when I was a youngster after I’d had a few beers. Fortunately, they let me go instead of taking me in or calling my parents. When you deal with the authorities at a young age without your parents knowing, it can be terribly frightening.
Do you have kids of your own?
No I don’t. And I’m the reason why!

Revenge of the breadsticks Darden strikes backFor the Sentinel coverage of Starboard’s plan, see Friday’s stories here  or here .
Below are highlights of Darden’s reponse on Monday:
--Food waste and quality: Food waste improvements made over the past 18 months. Food waste is in line with historical levels. “We have made significant investments in the quality of our beef, chicken and seafood over the past year.” Food costs are 26 to 28 percent of total food sales.
--Endless salad and breadsticks: “Olive Garden’s salad and breadsticks have been an icon of brand equity since 1982. It conveys Italian generosity and our salads have the highest loyalty rating of any menu item based on the menu satisfaction surveys we conduct.”
--Take-out packaging: “Our packaging is primarily designed to maintain food quality. It meets competitive standards, is a more sustainable alternative to Styrofoam, and complies with local waste regulations.”
--Menu too complex: “We recognize that striking a balance between menu complexity and variety requires constant focus. It is important that the menu remains broadly appealing.”
--General manager incentives: “Performance pay target is approximately 40% of general manager base salary and is uncapped.
--False customer waits at the front door: “Since beginning our focus on this issue over the past year, our false waits are now at historic lows and guest complaints regarding false waits are the lowest they have ever been.”
--Marketing costs: Darden has regular monitoring and analysis. “We are successfully reducing our non¿working media and continue to strike an appropriate balance between television and digital advertising”
--Improve guest experience before remodeling restaurants: Darden began a plan to improve customer experience a year ago. “We need to remodel our 300 oldest facilities as these restaurants lag in same¿restaurant sales.”

Investing.com - Investing.com - Natural gas prices rose on Monday after updated weather-forecasting models called for seasonably warm temperatures across the southern U.S., which should boost demand for air conditioning.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in October were up 1.44% at $3.913 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.840, and a high of $3.952.
The October contract settled up 0.89% on Friday to end at $3.857 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.786 per million British thermal units, Friday's low, and resistance at $4.016, last Tuesday's high.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to rising temperatures across most of the southern U.S. states in the next three to five days, likely boosting demand for air conditioning.
Still, prices came off earlier highs on concerns that temperatures will moderate in the coming two weeks.
"Overall, we see very comfortable weather patterns for the rest of the month, with the only real potential disruption to national prices being from a weather system around 10 days out that will affect the Midwest and Northeast with a quick couple day cool down," Natgasweather.com reported in its Monday midday update.
Reports of a pipeline explosion feeding the Henry Hub system pushed up prices as well, though gains from the incident were also seen as short-lived.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in November were up 0.27% at $91.62 a barrel, while heating oil for October delivery were up 0.13% at $2.7441 per gallon.

Cos to get more time to get women directors ...Companies to get more time to take women directors on board

(Rules on appointment of…)
MUMBAI: Companies have more time to place woman directors on their boards, with the capital market regulator extending the compliance deadline by another six months.
Small companies whose equity share capital does not exceed Rs 10 crore and net worth Rs 25 crore as on the last day of the previous financial year, have been excluded from complying with the new provisions of Clause 49. Also, those listed on the SME (small and medium enterprise) stock exchange have been exempted from the requirements.
Rules on appointment of woman director on company boards would be applicable from April 1, 2015, Sebi said in a circular on Monday posted on its website.
According to Indian Boards, a joint initiative of Prime Database and NSE, 755 of the 1,469 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange are yet to appoint women directors as on August 31, 2014.
The regulator has also aligned certain provisions on maximum tenure of independent directors and related party transactions with the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, an independent director can have a maximum of two tenures of five consecutive years, with a cooling off period of three years.
Related party transactions
Companies here are now required to seek prior approval from the audit committee. But the regulator said the committee could grant an omnibus approval to those transactions repetitive in nature.
Besides, the committee should satisfy itself that it is in the interest of the company. The omnibus approval must also be specific in nature about the name of the related party, nature, period and maximum amount of transaction that can be entered into, among other things.
In case such details are not available, the committee can approve transactions whose value does not exceed Rs 1 crore per transaction. The regulator said the audit committee should review related party transactions on a quarterly basis and the omnibus approvals would be valid for one year.
Transactions between two government companies have been exempted. Sebi has also clarified that a majority of members of the risk management committee of companies should be board members.
"Senior executives of the company may be members of the said committee, but the chairman of the committee shall be a member of the board of directors," Sebi said.
Companies planning to offload shares in subsidiaries that could reduce its shareholding to less than 50 per cent would have to do so after a special resolution is passed approving the same.

Why investors should say no to United Spirits and Maruti SuzukiWhy investors should say no to United Spirits and Maruti Suzuki
ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 09.53AM IST

(Vijay Mallya is chairman…)
By Sriram Ramakrishna
A few weeks from now, two companies, as different from each other as chalk and cheese, will hold shareholder meetings in order to take crucial decisions.
United Spirits , London-based Diageo's Indian outfit, has called shareholders on September 30 to approve annual accounts, while Maruti's meet will be all about getting minority shareholder okay for related-party transactions involving parent Suzuki.
The second is an old dispute which first reared its head in January when Maruti made a shock announcement that its forthcoming Gujarat factory will be built by Suzuki and not by the company.
The move triggered protests from institutional investors who questioned why Maruti, the listed entity, is not capable of handling the investment and expressed fears of higher royalty and lower transfer pricing of cars which would affect the Indian listed company's revenues.
The first is a recent development and comes from the decision of United Bank of India to declare Vijay Mallya, the chairman of the UB Group, as wilful defaulter. Mallya is also chairman of United Spirits.
RBI rules say that any company whose promoter or director is a wilful defaulter cannot get bank funding. Sebi is expected to soon issue guidelines saying that a wilful defaulter cannot be allowed to raise equity.
But Mallya has offered himself for reappointment as director, according to the USL notice, putting Diageo and USL shareholders in a delicate situation. USL shareholders trooping into Bangalore on September 30 need to keep one crucial issue in their minds. Mallya may have built USL into a world beater in the alcohol business and delivered stellar returns for long-time investors by selling to Diageo.
In normal circumstances, shareholders would have given him a standing ovation. But these are not normal circumstances and the wilful defaulter tag now carries with it reputational and business risk. If banks cannot lend money and capital markets shut the firm out, how will USL grow? If more banks follow UBI's lead, what will be the damage to USL's reputation?
Mallya is chairman of USL but holds very little stake in the firm. Ideally, he should have resigned and since that has not happened, shareholders should bite the bullet and send a strong message. They may not be able to vote him out if Diageo, the main shareholder, supports him. But they should vote in bulk and tell the world they care about the issue.
Maruti is more a complex issue. But nine months after they first proposed the move, the Maruti management has still not fully convinced investors about the correctness of its move. The explanation that Maruti will be able to conserve cash and insulate itself against risk does not wash.
Maruti is not a babe in the woods. It is a high quality car manufacturer which has time and again showed itself capable to besting competition and emerging on top.
Why does it need to conserve cash? Why does it need to play safe? Unless shareholders get a clear, satisfactory answer, they should say no to Maruti.

Anchor investors lap up Shemaroo IPO  raise Rs 36 crAnchor investors lap up Shemaroo issue, help it raise Rs 36 crore

(The IPO with a size of Rs 120…)
Mumbai: Content library player Shemaroo Entertainment is the first company to benefit from the recent Sebi move to double the investment bucket for anchor investors.
The issue, which opened to anchor investors on Monday, ahead of its initial public offering, was fully subscribed by domestic mutual funds, said a source.
The company has raised Rs 36 crore from two anchor investors — Birla Mutual Fund and HDFC MF . Anchor investors were allotted 21.17 lakh shares at Rs 170 apiece. The IPO with a size of Rs 120 crore is set to hit the market on Tuesday with a price band of Rs 155-170 ashare of Rs 10 face value. The issue will remain open till September 18.
The company has offered a 10 per cent discount to retail investors in the public offer in a price range Rs 139.5-148.5. The company will allot 35 per cent of the total issue size to retail investors, 15 per cent to high networth individuals and the remaining 50 per cent to qualified institutional bidders, including anchor investors.
In an attempt to increase the share of committed investors, the regulator recently enhanced the anchor investor's bucket to 60 per cent from the earlier requirement of 30 per cent of the institutional portion. The promoters will retain majority control but their stake will be diluted by 20 per cent.
Issue proceeds will be utilised towards inventory building of the company's content library which features movies like Madras Cafe, Queen, Ishqya and animated productions like Bal Ganesh.
The offer has received mixed reactions from analysts, with some recommending investors to buy even as some analysts argued that the offer is overvalued. Leading domestic brokerage IIFL has recommended subscribing the issue for a listing gain. IIFL believes Shemaroo can clock revenue CAGR of 26 per cent over the next three years.

Epirus, Ranbaxy win India approval for arthritis drug copy
The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.
Post your opinion here
 
Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc said India's drug regulator has approved its copy of a top-selling arthritis treatment, paving the way for its launch in the country early next year.
The company's Indian partner,  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd , will sell a copycat version of Johnson & Johnson's and Merck & Co Inc's infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug with annual sales of about USD 6 billion.
The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.
With changing regulations and a looming biotech patent cliff, the global market for biosimilars is forecast to rise to USD 24 billion in 2019 from about USD 1.2 billion last year, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
Infliximab, sold under the brand name Remicade, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. In India, it sells at about Rs 70,000 (USD 1,150) per month.
Like its main rivals, Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie Inc's Humira, the drug works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.
Epirus, a Boston-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing biosimilar drugs for sale, said it would launch the Remicade biosimilar in India under the name Infimab by the first quarter of 2015.
Chief Executive Amit Munshi, citing various estimates, said the Indian market for Remicade was worth USD 8 million to USD 10 million a year. He declined to say how much Infimab would cost or to estimate how many patients might use the drug.
The drug will be made in Mumbai by India's Reliance Life Sciences, part of billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Group Holdings.
Remicade copycats are already being sold elsewhere. South Korean drugmaker Celltrion Inc won approval in July for its version in Japan and is hoping for US approval in 2015.
Epirus is also in talks with Ranbaxy, as well as other Indian and international companies, about expanding sales of its biosimilar drugs in other regions, Munshi told Reuters.
"Ranbaxy has, under their license, quite a few markets in southeast Asia and North Africa," he said. "We're also working with other partners in places like Latin America."
Ranbaxy is not the only Indian drugmaker to explore production of biosimilar drugs. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd , for example, is developing biosimilars with Germany's Merck KGaA .
Biocon  Ltd has a tie-up with Mylan Inc , while Lupin Ltd has entered a deal to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster insulin, Lantus, in India.
Ranbaxy Labs stock price
On November 21, 2014, Ranbaxy Laboratories closed at Rs 617.60, down Rs 6.1, or 0.98 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 697.50 and the 52-week low was Rs 306.05.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 20.93 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 29.51. The latest book value of the company is Rs 25.84 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 23.90.

Lupin hits record high, may sign big deal with Merck Serono
Citi says business development remains a core part of Lupin's growth strategy, with the latest deal (Salix) providing it a good foothold in Canada.
Post your opinion here
 
Shares of  Lupin hit a record high of Rs 1,422 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on a media report that the company is in advanced talks to sign a blockbuster deal with Merck Serono. The stock gained as much as 4.6 percent intraday on Monday.
As part of the deal, Lupin will manufacture Merck Serono's USD 1.5 billion worth branded mature drugs at its facilities, a media report said quoting unnamed sources.
According to the report, the company will also get marketing rights for the drugs for emerging countries and European markets while Merck Serono will retain the rights to market these drugs in the developed markets.
Meanwhile, Citi says business development remains a core part of Lupin's growth strategy, with the latest deal (Salix) providing it a good foothold in Canada.
Lupin on last Friday entered into a definitive agreement with Salix Pharmaceuticals. Under this agreement, Salix granted Lupin the exclusive right to market, distribute and sell certain Salix products in Canada.
"This includes immediate rights to distribute Zaxine (rifaximin) for reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in patients of 18 years of age or older, and Relistor subcutaneous injection for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness," said the company in its filing.
The deal also gives the option to exclusively market, distribute and sell other gastroenterology products in Salix's Canadian pipeline once approved by Health Canada.
The brokerage said Lupin is in the process of setting up its Canadian business and these proprietary products would help mark its presence. It expects these efforts to target select, interesting markets/segments and consistently move up the value chain to drive valuations and maintain it as top large cap pick in Indian Pharma.
The stock closed at Rs 1,414, up Rs 54.75, or 4.03 percent on the BSE.

Shares of Just Dial climbed nearly 3 percent intraday Monday after Nomura reiterated top pick status on the stock on lead in local search and attractive value proposition in Search Plus/marketplace.
The brokerage house maintains buy rating on the stock with an increased target price at Rs 1985 (from Rs 1920), implying 17 percent potential upside. According to the report, in a bull case scenario, the upside could be around 50 percent.
Nomura reiterates positive stance on the stock on strong traction in its local search business driven by its leadership position and synergies from expansion into Search Plus services; and its marketplace business is a play on India’s e-tailing growth story (which is likely to grow 11x over the next five years).
The brokerage expects a strong revenue CAGR of 31 percent and an EPS CAGR of 37 percent over FY14-17F.
Nomura said key takeaways from meeting with the company's CFO Ramkumar Krishnamachari, are Just Dial has 20Search Plus services live on its website, and within the next one to one-and-half-month, all these services should be live on mobile as well.
"Management expects to spend Rs 25-40 crore on marketing these services after going live on mobile; EBITDA margins will rebound in Q2FY15F (following the 500 basis points Q-o-Q decline in Q1FY15 on account of one-off advertising/content acquisition costs) and will remain largely stable thereon as the company seeks to invest in sales and marketing/technology for its Search Plus business; and management believes it is possible to increase paid listing penetration in its local search business to 4-4.5 percent (versus 2 percent of overall listings being paid in Q1FY15) over the next 3-5 years," it added.
At 13:22 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,724.40, up Rs 34.20, or 2.02 percent on the BSE.

Early Fed rate hike no catastrophe for EMs: UBS Invst Bank02:30 pm
In an interview to CNBC-TV18’s Sonia Shenoy and Senthil Chengalvarayan, Ramin Nakisa, Senior Global Asset Allocation Strategist, UBS Investment Bank gave his view on whether an earlier-than-anticipated Fed rate hike is on its way. He also spoke about his reading of emerging markets and India in particular.
Below is a verbatim transcript of the interview
Sonia: The investors are looking out for two magical words which is "considerable time". The omission of that phrase could indicate that perhaps an interest rate hike could come in sooner than expected. What is your sense of whether this "considerable time" language will hold in this policy or will we get an indication of when the rate hikes can come?
A: Our central case is still that the first rate hike is going to be in the middle of next year. So, expecting a big policy shift at this point is fairly unlikely. However if you look at the dot plots and plug that into Taylor rule, what we see is that the Fed forward guidance is completely at odds with what the market is pricing and with their own forecast about the economy is pricing. In other words there is a kind of big mismatch. What we are concerned about is that there could be a jump up in yields, another kind of taper tantrum once markets adjust. So, that is the main concern at the moment this mismatch between what the markets are pricing and what the Fed's forward guidance is telling us.
Senthil: You are expecting a hike only in mid March but the market will be looking for signals and may completely misread signals or look for signals but there are no signals. So, that is a concern to you?
A: Certainly and what worries us is about a very sharp adjustment in rates because if you look back over history if you go into a hiking cycle with low inflation at low rates typically that has been very good for equities because you are moving away from deflation. So, that could be a very good scenario for equity. What worries me is that we are going to see a very sharp rise in rates. That kind of thing can't be absorbed by the equity market and that would promote a kind of risk off environment which would be bad for equity.
So, our central case is still going to be that the Fed will steer the course properly and that they won't cause this taper tantrum. However, a risk case is that we do see a very sharp adjustment and that would be a concern. Obviously, volatility would increase in all assets if that were the case and also we would see a sell-off in risk assets and high beta assets such as the yen.
Sonia: If your risk case plays out, then what could the near-term impact be on emerging markets? Do you just see a knee-jerk reaction where the extent of the downside could be about 5-10 percent at worst or do you think we could be in for a time wise correction in this market?
A: I think it will be more of a kind of 10 percent correction. This is not going to be a catastrophe because markets have been considering this rate hike for a very long time. The more people talk about it lesser the shock we will have if there is a change in language. More gradually, a kind of strategic view from us is that the dollar is going to strengthen obviously that will be bad for emerging markets, yields in the US are going to rise again – bad for EM. So, strategically it doesn’t look particularly positive.
However, having said that at the moment the flows are still very positive. We have seen 5 consecutive months of EM equity inflows and that hasn’t stopped even though we have seen a de-risking in developed markets. EM is still seeing inflows in the ETF market. So, I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of kind of further upside for EM in the next 3-4 months unless we see a very sharp change in policy from the Fed.
Sonia: When you say further upside in emerging markets what would your view be on India as a market because we have seen a considerable amount of outperformance, we are up almost 28 percent year to date. We have been the best performing market. Do you think that outperformance will come to an end now or will that continue?
A: There is an article in the FT today about Modi's honeymoon period ending because we haven’t seen the reforms with that momentum that swept him into office. He has had four months now and we haven’t seen any kind of major structural improvement, particularly in the infrastructure of India. There was a comparison between expenditure on telecom networks in India versus China. It is just one tenth of the investment over the last year. So, we have to see those structural reforms panning out.
Having said that, there is a lot going for India. The demographics are very positive and as you said it has been a very well performing market over the last six months or so. So, it still would be one of our preferred markets. We like North Asia. We like India and the flows have been rewarding in India for the kind of election results but whether that continues will depend on what we see with the structural reforms.

Relief  at last: Aug WPI inflation eases to near 5-year lowA vendor sells fish in a market in New Delhi September 12, 2014. REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/Files
By Rajesh Kumar Singh
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's wholesale price inflation eased to its lowest level in nearly five years in August, but the central bank is likely to keep interest rates on hold later this month to prevent a revival in price pressures once the economy gains momentum.
The wholesale price index (WPI) rose 3.74 percent year-on-year last month, helped to its slowest pace since October 2009 by a favourable statistical base and falling global crude oil prices, which dropped to a two-year low on Monday.
A Reuters poll of economists had expected annual WPI inflation of 4.50 percent in August.
This is the last major economic data before the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy review on Sept. 30.
Data released on Friday had shown consumer price inflation, which the central bank tracks to set policy lending rates, edged down marginally to 7.8 percent in August.
The RBI wants to reduce retail inflation to 6 percent by 2016. The central bank left the repo interest rate steady at 8.0 percent last month and is widely expected to do the same at its upcoming policy review to ensure sustained disinflation next year.
"Retail inflation is the main barometer for policy decisions and unless that tapers off towards the January 2016 target at 6 percent, rate cuts are unlikely to be in the picture," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS bank in Singapore.
"We maintain that the repo rate will be held unchanged for rest of the year to ensure recovery in growth does not disrupt the disinflationary trend."
Improved rainfall in recent weeks should help to moderate food price pressures, lower global oil prices and the favourable statistical base should help lower inflation, but there were counter-forces to consider.
Aside from prospects of a pickup in domestic consumption stoking price pressures, there was also the possibility that imported goods could become more expensive if the rupee weakens against the dollar, due to expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates sooner-than-expected.
Wholesale prices for fuel rose an annual 4.54 percent last month, sharply slower than a 7.40 percent year-on-year gain in July.
RBI chief Raghuram Rajan has said falling oil prices could be a "temporary phenomenon", and there are risks that prices could flare up again due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East or Ukraine.
Food inflation, meanwhile, eased to 5.15 percent in August from 8.43 percent in the previous month. However, the prices were up 2.6 percent from July.
"While all the current set of economic indicators indicate that inflation is heading lower, Rajan wants to temper expectations and highlight the possibility that prices may still go up in the future," said Killol Pandya, senior fund manager - debt at LIC Nomura asset management.
"We believe the central bank will wait for a couple of more prints before it definitively makes up its mind about the direction of inflation."

The trade deficit narrowed to USD 10.84 billion in August versus USD 12.2 billion in July. Exports and imports rose marginally on an annual basis, but gold imports surged over 175 percent in August on a year-on-year basis. Gold imports in August stood at USD 2.04 billion against USD 738.7 million, in the same month a year ago. Silver imports, however, fell to USD 245.14 million versus USD 265.8 million on a year-on-year basis.
Overall imports grew only 2.08 percent to USD 37.79 billion. Exports in May and June had registered a growth of 12.4 percent and 10.22 percent, respectively. In July, export
growth further fell to 7.33 percent. In April-August period, exports rose 7.31 percent to USD 134.79 billion, says Ministry of Commerce and Industry's data.
On the other hand, in the first five months of this financial year, imports dipped by 2.69 percent to USD 190.94 billion during. Oil imports declined by 14.97 percent in August to USD 12.83 billion. However, non-oil imports in August increased by 13.82 percent to USD 24.95 billion.
Reacting to the data, Dr Samiran Chakraborty, Head of Research, Standard Chartered Bank said that export growth of 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis at is a big disappointment and a cause of worry.
"There is some concern that European growth is slowing down due to Ukraine woes and there is worry that global growth could be impacted by geopolitical risks, that is probably driving the export growth numbers, there is not too much for domestic factor that could explain it," he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.
Shubhada Rao, Chief Economist, Yes Bank added that India-China trade dynamics are getting reflected in this trade data. "If you look at China's exports, China's imports have been slowing and to that extent we were anticipating some slowdown from India's exports to China for that matter. Contrary also their exports were also slowing. So, the India-China trade dynamics actually are getting more reflected in today's numbers is what I would like to reiterate. From a run rate of about USD 26-27 billion we were anticipating it to go to USD 28 billion for the month, however it has come in about a billion less which is a little bit of a worry," she added.
Both Chakraborty and Rao feel that restrictions on gold imports are unlikely to be eased anytime soon.

Exide: Charged to gain from revivalExide: Charged to gain from revival
Ram Prasad Sahu | Mumbai Sep 15, 2014 10:47 PM IST
Through the past three trading sessions, the Exide Industries stock has gained 10 per cent, as the company is expected to be a major beneficiary of a turnaround in the fortunes of the automobile sector (Exide is the largest supplier of batteries to car makers). A proposal to extend excise duty incentives to the automobile companies beyond December this year is also likely to help the company.
Exide Industries dominates the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment, with market share of 65-70 per cent. Given the momentum in automobile sales, the company should be able to see a rise in volumes. So far this financial year, passenger vehicle sales have risen 4.5 per cent, while the increase in two-wheeler sales is 15 per cent. For most sectors, sales in FY14 were either flat or lower than in FY13.
Analysts expect double-digit growth in FY15, led by a favourable base, an improvement in sentiment and latent demand. Nitesh Sharma of Reliance Securities believes Exide will post 23 per cent earnings growth through the next two years, given a volume-led revenue pick-up in the OEM segment, double-digit growth in the replacement market, a pick-up in the industrial sector and 200-basis point margin expansion.
The other trigger for the stock will be the passage of the insurance Bill, which will raise the foreign direct investment limit in the insurance segment from 26 per cent to 49 per cent. Exide Industries has 100 per cent stake in insurance arm Exide Life (in 2013, it had bought its erstwhile partner’s stake). While the business is profitable and does not require any investment from Exide, any divestment or sale could be a positive for the stock, as this will free cash for the company. About 11 per cent of Exide’s current valuation is attributed to the insurance business.
Strong recovery hopes
A large part of the run-up in the stock is on expectations there will be a recovery in the OEM segment, while growth in the replacement segment will continue to be steady. Exide is best placed to ride the OEM recovery cycle, with leading passenger vehicle makers Maruti, Honda and Hyundai sourcing 64-100 per cent of their battery requirement from Exide.
What is worrying is the loss in market share to smaller peer in the replacement segment. In the June quarter, while Amara Raja reported 15 per cent volume growth in this segment, Exide’s growth was muted---three per cent. The automobile segment accounts for about 65 per cent of Exide’s sales; two thirds of that is in the replacement segment. However, the company is expected to maintain its 30 per cent share in the replacement market, owing to new product launches, increased promotions in FY15 and a strong brand name. Analysts expect these measures to yield market share gains for Exide, albeit marginal. While growth in the replacement segment was 16 per cent between FY09-14, it is expected to stabilise at 11 per cent.
Also, it is expected the industrial segment, which accounts for 35 per cent of Exide’s revenue, will see a turnaround, as economic activity picks up in the second half of this financial year. Inverter sales have helped the company post growth of about 15 per cent in the industrial segment through the past five years. High inverter sales also helped the company post 18 per cent growth in revenue in the June quarter. During this period, the company also gained market share in the telecom segment.
Margin uptick
Driven by higher demand from automobile makers and increased volumes, the company is expected to benefit from higher capacity utilisation. Utilisation levels, currently at 70 per cent for passenger vehicles, are expected to rise to 85 per cent. Further, the sharpest turnaround is expected in the case of commercial vehicle makers, which bore the brunt of the slowdown. Increased off-take and utilisation should aid margin gains. The recent fall in lead prices should keep raw material prices benign in the short term. From current levels of about 14 per cent, margins are expected to rise to about 16 per cent by FY16.

To complete Trizetto deal by Q4; will enhance guidance06:00 pm
Cognizant on Monday said it will acquire US-based TriZetto Corporation for USD 2.7 billion in an all cash big-ticket deal, a move that will help the IT services firm tap the lucrative healthcare IT software and solutions market for revenue synergies.
Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gordon Coburn, President, Cognizant said revenues from TriZetto will add to incremental guidance, no matter how big or small. “TriZetto's margins are comparable to us; this is a topline play," he says.
He expects TriZetto deal to close by Q4 of the current fiscal along with all regulatory approvals."US healthcare clients are desperate to cut costs and therefore, there cannot be a better time than today to buy TriZetto,” he told the channel.
Cognizant-TriZetto combine can compete for larger deals, adds Coburn. Experts too believe that in terms of grabbing the healthcare pie, the firm may race ahead of Accenture, IBM, EMC and Capgemini, if the deal goes through.
Below is a verbatim transcript of the interview
Q: Can you break up the financial structure of this deal. It is a USD 2.7 billion deal, you have taken a financing of around USD 1 billion but the deal will be done in cash. Can you give us a break up of how you are funding this deal and how much of your cash reserves are you dipping into? You have a cash reserve of around USD 3.8 billion.
A: We are paying about USD 2.7 billion of cash for the deal. Obviously that is cash that is based in the United States. We have approximately USD 4 billion of cash on our balance sheet but that money is spread around the world. So, we do expect to take out about USD 1 billion in financing and the remaining USD 1.7 billion we will pay from our cash reserves that obviously leaves our balance sheet in very healthy shape to ensure that we the stability our clients are looking forward at. We continue to conservatively manage our business and it also leaves us cash available to continue with our share repurchase programme that we know is important to our investors.
Q: You have said that you will be completing the deal by Q4 of 2014. So, is it safe to say that the revenues from the deal will start coming in from Q1 of 2015 and can you tell us on an annual basis what is the kind of incremental revenue addition that you are expecting from this deal?
A: We expect the deal to close in Q4. We might get a little bit of revenue in Q4. Our guidance excluded any revenue that came from TriZetto. So, if we get any revenue that would be incremental.
TriZetto is currently for the last 12 months did a little over USD 700 million of revenue on a last 12 months basis. We would certainly expect growth in calendar 2015. We haven’t given specific numbers but as we said we think a combination of TriZetto's organic growth combined with the significant revenue synergies that we see over the next five years, we think that will be about USD 1.5 billion plus of revenue synergies. Some of that will kick in 2015. So, for next year we would expect that revenue from TriZetto plus the synergies would be neutral to positive to Cognizant's overall growth rate.
Q: Would this possibly mean that you may hike up your guidance for 2014 because you had given a guidance before the deal. So, is there a possibility that by Q4 of 2014 we could see a revision in your full year guidance?
A: I think that entirely depends on when the acquisition closes. If we get some revenue from TriZetto in Q4 that will certainly be incremental to any guidance we have already given. Obviously we don’t know the exact date that it will close.
Q: Can you give us an idea about the kind of approvals that are required and the timeline? Q4 is the higher limit that you are looking at or is there a possibility it could trickle into 2015 as well?
A: We think it is highly unlikely that it would roll into 2015. At this point we fully expect that the transaction will receive the necessary government clearances and remaining accounting things that have to be done post close during Q4 of calendar 2014.

Infrastructure finance company IDFC , which recently raised Rs 1,000 crore through QIP, will soon start the process of transferring its assets and liabilities to a new holding company as part of transforming itself into a bank.
"The next step (after QIP) in the process of opening of the bank is transferring the assets and liabilities on the IDFC's balance sheet to a subsidiary which will become the bank," IDFC chairman Rajiv Lall told reporters on the sidelines of an annual banking summit organised here by Ficci this evening.
The city-based IDFC recently completed its process to bring down the foreign holdings to meet the regulatory requirement of converting itself into a bank, the licence for which was bagged the infra lender in April along with the Kolkata-based microlender Bandhan.
The central bank has made it mandatory for all those NBFCs and other financial sector players which bag banking licences, to surrender their existing business by transferring the assets and liabilities into a non-operative financial holding company.
This stringent demand made some of the leading NBFCs like Tata Capital and Mahindra Finance to withdraw their application in the run-up to the licensing process that came after 11 years and saw just two out of the 24 applicants passing the RBI test.
"With Rs 1,000 crore which was raised, foreign ownership such as FIIs, FDI, NRIs, has come down to within the statutory limit that has been imposed upon us as part of the regulation to transform us into a bank," Lall said. He said that the foreign holding which was earlier 51 per cent has come down to 49 per cent now.
When asked why the QIP was offered at discount, he said, "the cardinal rule of raising capital is that the people you raise it from should be happy. So it is always good to leave a little bit of money on their table and not try to extract the last penny from investors. So in that spirit we gave a small discount and it was a very successful issue."
IDFC stock price
On November 21, 2014, IDFC closed at Rs 157.40, up Rs 0.10, or 0.06 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 166.70 and the 52-week low was Rs 88.10.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 10.11 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 15.57. The latest book value of the company is Rs 92.94 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 1.69.

Keen to push the GST Bill in the winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today took stock of the proposed new indirect tax regime and decided to soon clear the pending CST compensation for revenue loss incurred by states.
"Will make all efforts to introduce the Constitutional Amendment Bill for GST in the next parliament session," said a senior government functionary, who attended the meeting called by the Prime Minister to review progress towards implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The GST regime aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as states' level. The UPA government in 2011 introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to pave the way for introduction of GST.
In the meeting, sources said it was also decided to soon clear the compensation dues to state governments related to phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST).
"Some movement on CST compensation soon. We are looking at disbursing compensation arrears soon," the official said. Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between Centre and states. As part of the roll out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
Last month, Kashmir Finance Minister and Chairman of the Empowered Group of State Finance Ministers Abdul Rahim Rather had said Rs 13,000 crore has been pending as CST compensation with Centre as on March 2010.
Sources further said the Centre may also agree to keep petroleum products out of the GST network though it will not be a "constitutional right". States have been demanding that these products should be kept out of GST as including them would impact their revenue.
"Petroleum products may be kept out GST chain but not as constitutional right," the official said, adding "the tax rates are likely to remain same even as India moves to GST regime".
Among others, the meeting was attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and top officials of his ministry. While presenting the Budget, Jaitley had expressed hope that the government will be able to "bring a final solution in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables introduction of GST".
GST, he had said, would streamline tax administration and avoid harassment of business and result in higher tax collection both for Centre and States.

Murdered woman found alive with new boyfriend  and her husband is relieved‘Murdered’ woman found alive with new boyfriend — and her husband is relieved

A Jharkhand man’s joy knew no bounds when he spotted his runaway wife enjoying a meal with her new boyfriend last week, relieved that he could now prove to his in-laws that she had not been murdered by him for dowry.
 
For more than a week, Chandan Daruka, a 30-year-old resident of Old Dumka locality, had spent sleepless nights after his wife went missing and his in-laws filed a police complaint, accusing him of killing their daughter, Pinki Devi, for dowry.
 
The complaint, filed on September 8, sought the immediate arrest if Daruka and his parents for the ‘murder’ of Devi. The two had a ‘love marriage’ last year.
 
Police even launched an investigation but local police officer, Devbrat Poddar, said they had failed to recover Devi’s body.
 
While all of this went on, last Saturday Daruka suddenly spotted his 25-year-old wife with another man having a meal at a town restaurant. He immediately raised an alarm and his friends helped him detain his wife.
 
Her new boyfriend, however, managed to flee. The woman was promptly handed over to police.
 
Daruka, a native of Saray road, told police he was unaware that his wife had another man in her life. Devi was produced before a local court on Monday where she stated that she did ‘had fled her in-laws’ because she did not want to live with her husband.
 
The court ordered the police to send the woman to her father’s house.
 
Police said they would file another charge sheet before the court, possibly also holding the father of the woman for lodging a false case against Daruka.

Traffickers  sink  ship carrying migrants in Mediterranean  500 feared dead off Malta coast500 migrants feared dead in Malta shipwreck
Reuters

More than 700 people fleeing Africa and the West Asia may have drowned in the latest shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, bringing the death toll this year to almost 3,000, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Monday.
In the worst incident, as many as 500 migrants are believed to have died after traffickers rammed their ship off Malta's coast last week, an event that only came to light this weekend in testimony from two of the nine survivors.
The survivors said the traffickers ordered the migrants to change vessels in the middle of the Mediterranean. The migrants refused, leading to a confrontation that ended when traffickers rammed the ship carrying the migrants, IOM spokesperson Christiane Berthiaume told Reuters in Geneva.
"Some 500 people were on board - Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese. They were trying to reach Europe," Berthiaume said.
"That means that 700 people perished at sea these last days in the Mediterranean, the deadliest incidents in the space of a few days," she said.

The vessel had set off on Saturday, September 6 from Damiette, Egypt, and sank off Malta's coast on September 10, she said. The UN refugee agency also learned of the shipwreck, but said its information was the wreck occurred on Friday.
"In all, nine people survived and were picked up boats," Berthiaume said. IOM officials interviewed two Palestinian survivors who were taken to Sicily, Italy, while other survivors were taken to Malta and to Crete, Greece, Berthiaume said.
Four days later, another ship packed with up to 250 African emigrants sank off the Libyan coast, and most of them are feared dead, a spokesperson for the Libyan navy said late on Sunday. Some 26 people survived.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said the situation in the Mediterranean was unclear and it was trying to get confirmation of five shipwrecks in all. "At least 500 people have died or are missing in the last three days", UNHCR spokesperson Francis Markus said in an email.

"It was without any doubt the deadliest weekend ever in the Mediterranean," Carlotta Sami of the UNHCR said.
Some 130,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, compared with 60,000 last year, according to the UNHCR. Italy has received more than 118,000, most of them rescued at sea under its naval operation Mare Nostrum.
UN high commissioner for refugees Antonio Guterres and UNHCR special envoy Angelina Jolie visited the naval rescue headquarters in Malta on Sunday, meeting survivors, the agency said in a statement issued on Monday.
"Amidst concerns about the sustainability of the Italian Mare Nostrum operation, they also called for increased efforts by European nations to contribute to rescue efforts and reduce deaths at sea," the UNHCR said.
Half of those arriving in Europe by boat are refugees from Syria and Eritrea, according to the agency.

"We all need to wake up to the scale of this crisis. There is a direct link between the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere and the rise in deaths at sea in the Mediterranean. We have to understand what drives people to take the fearful step of risking their children's lives on crowded, unsafe vessels; it is the overwhelming desire to find refuge," Jolie said.
"It is also part of a bigger problem - the soaring numbers of people displaced by conflicts around the world today, which now stands at over 51 million. Unless we address the root causes of these conflicts, the numbers of refugees dying or unable to find protection will continue to rise," she said.

The Chinese are at it again. Days before President Xi Jinping's arrival in India, possibly with promises of huge investments, his troops were locked eyeball-to-eyeball last week with Indian security forces, an incident serious enough to be escalated to PM Narendra Modi's office.
The face-off started on September 10 around the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chumar sector of eastern Ladakh, an area which has seen a big increase in Chinese activity this year. According to authoritative government sources, a mixed patrol of Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) troops saw more than 200 Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops with 12 heavy vehicles including cranes, bulldozers and a Hummer trying to level a rivulet and construct a temporary road two kilometres into Indian territory.

According to the army assessment, this was part of a PLA plan to build a road connecting Manza and Kyenjung outposts on the Chinese side of the LAC with Chepzi on the Indian side and install a surveillance camera for area domination and patrolling.
In no mood to allow this, Indian forces confronted the PLA and asked them to withdraw, resulting in no fewer than seven face-offs and even shouting matches. Some 15-20 metres of the temporary track was demolished by the Indian forces during the night of September 10 using heavy equipment.
The latest incident highlights the bitter differences between the two Asian giants despite the likely bonhomie that will mark Xi's first Indian visit. Modi is flying to Ahmedabad to meet Xi, who lands on Wednesday — incidentally the Indian leader's birthday.

More than 130 Indian troops and 230 Chinese were involved in last week's standoff with additional men brought in on both sides as the situation threatened to deteriorate rapidly.  But both sides backed off, with the Chinese deploying two surveillance helicopters to confirm whether the Indian Army troopers had withdrawn to its original position. The whole incident spanned five days.
"The Chinese PLA have increased their troop strength  seven to nine times in Chumar over the past year and are involved in construction activity across the disputed LAC," said a senior South Block official, adding that between January and August, there had been 42 intrusions by the Chinese compared with nine transgressions during the same period last year.
Despite Indian efforts to exchange maps in the disputed eastern Ladakh or western sector with the Chinese side, Beijing has refused to exchange positions since 2002.

When flood waters were rising by a few feet every hour, the family of a Kashmiri Pandit, Ashok ji, as neighbours call him, was among the first to be rescued by Sohail Tabrez and Akil, the Muslims of the locality.
“Ashok ji had saved young Akil when there was a theft in his house. We went to the Pandit families here and asked them to leave their homes. The Sikh families too were rescued by army and locals,” says Sohail Tabrez.

The sprawling three-storied house of Ashok ji is being looked after by Shariq Mughal and Akil, both teenagers, who along with their friends take over a dozen trips a day on a boat taken from the army by depositing their identity cards.
When they reach the submerged Kalgi Dhar gurdwara in neighbouring locality, they call out to Inderjit Singh, the gurdwara’s old caretaker to take his supplies of the day.
Also getting their daily milk and food from the boat are Akil’s pet cats, Angrez and Rangrez, besides some pet dogs in Burzbagh. The few locals and migrant workers who continue to live on the top floors or rooftops of eateries and homes too call out for water and food.

Inderjit, the gurdwara’s caretaker only has Muslim friends,” said Tabrez whose throat has gone hoarse asking people to stand in a queue to be ferried on boat. “I will have to again take medicine from Tinni,” he says referring to the young Sikh homeopathic doctor of the locality.

Manish Tewari  Rashid Alvi defy Cong gag orderManish Tewari, Rashid Alvi defy Cong gag order

The Congress clamped on Monday a gag order to restrain its leaders from speaking out of turn, drawing a sharp response from two defiant leaders Manish Tewari and Rashid Alvi who said it is not time for fighting and humiliating each other.
    
"Only the spokespersons in the linked list are authorised to speak on behalf of the party", Ajai Maken, AICC general secretary and media department chief, said putting out a list of the five senior spokespersons and 13 spokespersons on Twitter.
   
The action was seen in party circles as a snub to party leaders like Tewari and Alvi, though at the AICC briefing, party general secretary and spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed repeatedly denied that the party is voicing any opposition to any particular leader.
   
Ahmed's refrain was that there are 18 designated spokespersons in the party and that it is they who are authorised to give the official line of the party.
   
Certain remarks by Tewari and Alvi were not found in tandem with the party's official line. Moreover, there is talk of an internal rivalry among young leaders for media space.
   
Unfazed by the party's gag order, a defiant Tewari and Alvi said they would continue to express their viewpoints even while maintaining that it's time to fight communalism and "not fight and humiliate" each other.
 
Stung by AICC's diktat, Tewari, who was acting chairman of the media department till sometime ago, hit back as did Alvi who was unceremoniously removed as spokesperson last year.
 
While Tewari said he does not require a "noun or an adjective" with his name to intervene in public discourse, Alvi said Congressmen "should not fight and humiliate each other", suggesting some sort of a rivalry among party leaders for media space.
 
"I ceased to be national spokesperson of the INC in Oct 2012. When I intervene in the public discourse I do as an ordinary Cong worker who has served the party for 34 yrs. There are certain core convictions I believe in.
 
"When they are assaulted, I do not require a noun or a adjective behind my noun to intervene in the public discourse as as a party activist I do not hold myself out as the spokesperson," Tewari said in three successive tweets.
contd or a adjective behind my noun to intervene in the public discourse as as a party activist I do not hold myself out as the Spokesperson
— Manish Tewari (@ManishTewari) September 15, 2014
 
Alvi said "I always defend Congress party as an ordinary worker and I will continue to defend Congress party. I feel it is my responsibility as this is a very crucial time as the communal forces have not only taken over the country but are spreading communalism."

Cognizants TriZetto buy to give it strong purchase in US healthcaremarketCognizant Technology Solutions’ all-cash acquisition of TriZetto for $2.7 billion will give it a cutting edge in the healthcare vertical. (Reuters)
Bangalore | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:35 am
Cognizant Technology Solutions’ all-cash acquisition of TriZetto for $2.7 billion will give it a cutting edge in the healthcare vertical, where it competes with global biggies like IBM and Accenture, at a time healthcare corporations are keen to cut costs. On Monday, the IT major walked away with the privately-held US healthcare IT firm in a buyout that will drive up revenues from the vertical to $3 billion and give it access to over 200 clients, including 16 of the top 20 US health plans.
The Nasdaq-listed Cognizant, which generates close to 26% of its revenues — $8.84 billion in 2013 — from the healthcare and life sciences, now has a stronger footprint in the US IT healthcare market, tipped to to touch $22.6 billion by 2017, driven by opportunities from Obamacare.

That’s probably why analysts believe the valuation at four times 2013 revenues of an estimated $676 million may not be too steep. “Surprising but sensible” is how Jefferies Equity Research described the deal, highlighting that TriZetto’s annual revenue per employee of $182,703 was way higher than its acquirer’s $51,800. Last month the NewJersey-headquarterd firm announced a seven-year deal with Health Net, a California-based company with a total contract value of $2.7 billion.
Indian IT players TCS and Infosys have a smaller presence in the healthcare and life science segment, which contributes around 6% to revenues.
Francisco D’Souza, CEO, Cognizant, which reported profits of $1.23 billion in 2013, said healthcare in the US was undergoing structural shifts due to reform, cost pressures and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers. “This creates a significant growth opportunity, which TriZetto will help us capture,” he said.
Cognizant will finance the TriZetto acquisition through a combination of cash in hand and debt, and has secured $1 billion of committed financing in support of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014. “The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Cognizant’s non-GAAP EPS, excluding one-time transaction costs and adjustments,” said Karen McLoughlin, CFO.
TriZetto, which was taken private by Apax Partners in 2008 for $1.4 billion has 3,700 employees based in US and India. It provides IT solutions to both the payer and provider segments of the healthcare industry. Cognizant expects to gain approximately $1.5 billion of potential revenue synergies cumulatively over the next five years.
Cognizant expects to leverage this acquisition to address three areas of business: Traditional IT services; high-growth areas management consulting, BPO and IT infrastructure services; and emerging delivery models.
The note by Jefferies said, “Over the long term, TriZetto should position Cognizant for enhanced top-line performance (organic growth has been slowing) while adding to Cognizant’s non-linear (ie, software) revenue base and generating continued…

India unlikely to give China market economystatusPrint
New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:32 am
Ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India beginning Wednesday, New Delhi has indicated that it was not inclined to grant China the coveted ‘full-fledged market economy’ status in the near future.
Also, though China is keen to make huge investments, especially in industrial parks, railways, telecom and infrastructure, India is unlikely to considerably relax the security norms for any of these investments.
For not granting market economy status, New Delhi cites factors such as China’s lack of transparency in minimum wages, property rights, huge government subsidies and loan rates, besides alleged absence of proper business accounting standards/principles in the country. Lack of a ‘free market’ and significant government interference in the market are also concerns.
“Discussions that we are having now is with the understanding that we (India) will not recognise them as a market economy in the near future. In the telecom sector, they (Chinese companies) agreed to reveal the ‘source code’ for their systems to assure that there is no security threat. Many foreign companies do not offer to reveal source code. But we will deal with it on a case-to-case basis. There could, however, be no relaxation of security norms for any Chinese investment,” an official said.
China considers grant of the market economy status as a pre-requisite for greater trade and investment ties with countries. Though 60-odd countries, including Brazil, have recognised China as a market economy, the remaining, including India, the US and the European Union, have not done so despite pressure and persistent demands from Chinese authorities.
Due to the Chinese economy having a strong government influence, the members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as per interpretations of China’s WTO accession protocol, can till 2016 treat China as a non-market economy for the purpose of anti-dumping probe.

WPI at 5-year low but Raghuram Rajan sticks togunsRaghuram Rajan says no point in cutting rates and then see inflation rising. (AP)
Mumbai | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:28 am
Growth in factory output may have collapsed to 0.5% in July and wholesale inflation may have touched a five-year low at 3.7% for August but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not ready to reduce policy rates just yet. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan made it clear on Monday he wanted to wait for a more “feasible” time to cut rates as upside risks to inflation persisted and the fall in global crude oil prices could turn out to be “temporary”.
“There is absolutely no point in reducing interest rates and then see inflation pick up,” Rajan said, responding to a query at a banking event organised by Ficci and the Indian Banks’ Association. WPI inflation plummeted to a five-year low of 3.74% in August, albeit on the back of a favourable statistical base and fall in oil prices, government data showed. The fall in WPI follows an easing, if a very small on, in CPI inflation to 7.8% in August from 7.96% in July.

“Inflation is high not only in food, but also in non-food items and the best solution for the country is to bring it down. Then I can cut interest rates,” Rajan said. Economists concur with the central bank’s stance, predicting a status quo at the upcoming bimonthly policy review on September 30. DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, believes that an interest rate cut may only be possible after April 2015.
“The WPI index does not capture prices at the consumer level and does not include services. Moreover, within WPI, the core inflation has not eased,” Joshi observed.
Under Rajan’s lead, the RBI has shifted its focus to consumer price index (CPI) inflation for a more effective impact of monetary policy measures in line with recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee on monetary policy.
In the bimonthly policy review on August 5, the central bank reiterated its forecast of a gradual decrease in CPI inflation to 8% by January 2015 and 6% by 2016. “I think reaching 8% is possible but whether we will reach 6% is not clear. One will have to see the economy more closely,” Joshi said.
“We continue to expect headline CPI inflation to follow RBI’s expected glide path and remain contained below 8% by January 2015. We maintain our call for no change in policy repo rate in FY15,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at YES Bank.
Rajan noted that recovery in the domestic economy was uneven and growth indicators still a long way away from alleviating concerns over the economy. While growth in gross domestic product in April-June rose to an 18-month high of 5.7% in April-June, latest data showed that the index of industrial production, a measure of output, fell sharply to 0.5% in July from 3.4% in June.

Cognizant-TriZetto raises hope of similar M&...Apax Funds
(Cognizant’s $2.7 billion…)
BANGALORE: Cognizant's $2.7 billion deal to acquire healthcare IT services provider TriZetto has raised hopes of similar transactions in the sector at home.
Analysts and industry players believe that growing healthcare spending in the US, after President Barack Obama ushered in new sets of reforms to include uninsured Americans, should see more such deals in the US as it represents an over a $3 trillion opportunity.
"Obamacare is opening up a vast new business opportunity as the role of technology is growing in importance as new demand is created from the different requirements of Obamacare," said Arnab Gupta , founder and executive chairman of Opera Solutions , a New Jerseybased data analytics firm.
Earlier this year, Opera, in which Bangalore-based Wipro has an over 14 per cent stake, won a $20-million (Rs 120 crore) one-year contract from the US government , which earlier this year adopted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise referred to as 'Obamacare' after President Barack Obama.
"It is almost impossible to build this capability from scratch, particularly from the current base that the IT companies possess," said Gupta. "There will be a flurry of activity in this space as it is a race. Both acquisitions and partnerships, because the pace of demand will grow rapidly over the next few years, and the first mover advantage will be significant." Another startup, SCIO Health Analytics, which has won over five contracts valued at $10 million under which the Chennai-based firm helps the government improve delivery models in the insurance space, said that other IT companies have to buy smaller companies to get their "feet wet and understand before diving in".
"They can't afford to take on Cognizant," said Siva Namasivayam, chief executive of SCIO Health Analytics. "There will be deal activity - only if the companies open up the purse. This is a growth market and Indian companies have not been aggressive in paying valuations and this has to change."
Bankers too estimate that this deal by Cognizant may force TCS, Infosys and Wipro to buy out healthcare-focused startups. "These (IT outsourcers) companies have been talking for a while to strengthening their presence in Smac space. But I'll like to believe it should be in healthcare space, as it gives a huge opportunity," said a Bangalore-based investment banker who has advised Apax Funds , the owner of Trizetto, in the past.
Opera, SCIO Health Analytics and another healthcare-focused startups, hCentive, believe that healthcare is the next "big industry" for growth of IT firms, as growth in the traditional service line of financial services financial services start moderating.

HUL, Everstone in talks to jointly run Modern Foods

(The move by Everstone Capital,…)
MUMBAI:India's largest soaps and detergent maker Hindustan Unilever has begun talks with private equity fund Everstone Capital for a possible equity joint venture for its Modern Foods division which makes bread and rusks under the Modern brand, three people involved with the plan said.
The move by the private equity fund, which jointly owns the India franchise of the American Hamburger restaurant chain Burger King, is to drive synergy from Modern Foods for the quick-service restaurant chain, these people added.
"HUL wants to partner with Burger King and has approached the India franchise for a possible equity partnership," a person with direct knowledge of the development said. "Depending on how the talks progress, a complete sellout can't be ruled out." An Everstone spokesperson did not respond to an emailed questionnaire from ET.
Last year, Everstone Capital, that manages more than $1 billion in Indiafocused PE fund, won the India franchise Burger King as part of its plan to invest in the Indian consumption space. The fund will soon open its first outlets in Mumbai and Delhi NCR and slowly grow the network to the Tier-II and -III cities where its rivals, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Dominos and Yum brands have already established their presence in the $48-billion industry.
"The deal values the bakery business anywhere between Rs 200 crore and Rs 250 crore," an investment banker with knowledge of the development said. "As a policy, we do not comment on future business plans and hence have no comments to offer for your query on future growth plans of Modern Foods," an HUL spokesperson wrote in an email.
HUL's bakery business sells variants of white, brown, milk and whole grain breads along with cream rolls, fruit breads, buns, cakes, cookies and rusks. The 42-year-old brand commands more than 45% of the market share. "Partnering with a large Indiafocused private equity fund will help the bakery business expand and increase its market share further," a third person involved in the deal said.
  Burger King, which is betting big on the fast growing restaurant market where every two out of three people eat out once a week, believes that having its own bakery unit will be cost-effective in the long run. According to a 2013 report by Technopak Advisors, the Indian food service market was estimated to be $48 billion in 2013. Quickservice restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Domino's accounts for around $2.5 billion of the market in 2013 and are projected to grow to $8 billion by 2020.
The retailing giant has been looking to divest its stake in the bakery business for some time now. In the past, it had explored various options, including a complete sale to strategic investors. Analysts say that HUL's move is logical.
"It would be logical for HUL to exit the bakery business, given Unilever's portfolio misfit," said Gautam Duggad, vice-president, research (FMCG & Retail), at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. "The stake sale or a complete sell-off would depend on valuations because HUL is not in dire straits to sell or hard-pressed for cash."
Since HUL bought Modern Foods in 2002 from the government under the disinvestment programme, the company had been struggling with the bakery unit as high costs and an unmanageable work force in the lowmargin business made it unviable.
Also, analysts said HUL's food strategy has always been half-baked in India, focusing largely on soups, ice-creams and beverages. "To turn it around calls for innovative strategy and focus, which is completely absent in HUL,'' said an HUL official. "It makes sense to exit the business soon."
HUL officials have in the past admitted that the acquisition was a complete misfit with the HUL culture and systems.

Bridges to span Amazons dominanceAugust 11, 2014 5:49 pm
Bridges to span Amazon’s dominance
By Henry Mance and Shannon Bond
What happens if your biggest customer is also your worst nightmare? That is the dilemma facing book publishers dealing with Amazon . Jeff Bezos’s company accounts for about a third of US book sales, publishers estimate, and the ecommerce titan has brought books into the digital age without significant piracy problems.
But Amazon is now exacting a huge price. Its success is bankrupting some of the publishers’ other customers, bookshops , it is deterring online entrants by keeping its margins low or negative, and it is pushing publishers to cut ebook prices. “Publishers are not terribly profitable,” James Patterson, the bestselling Hachette writer, said recently. “If those profits are further diminished, publishers will produce less serious literature.”
Publishers’ main fightback so far – a new ebook pricing model with Apple – was ruled by the US and European Commission to violate antitrust laws by extracting more money from consumers. Apple and five publishers – Hachette, HarperCollins, Holtzbrinck, Simon & Schuster and Penguin (the latter at the time wholly owned by Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times) – have abandoned those pricing agreements. So what would better strategies be?

Mission to bring US glitz to UK football
Threaten Amazon’s USP
Mr Bezos always wanted his creation to be the world’s largest bookstore. That ambition has helped make Amazon great; it has also left it vulnerable. If individual publishers withhold books from Amazon, one of the site’s unique selling points will be undermined. “Everyone expects Amazon to be comprehensive,” says Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, who has highlighted this vulnerability in Harvard Business Review .
Publishers would no doubt be wary of cutting off so much of their sales. And in the past Amazon has managed to source products from third parties. But publishers may struggle in negotiations with Amazon unless they can risk saying no. Doing so might drive consumers to Amazon’s incipient rivals, such as Google Shopping’s trial of same-day book delivery with Barnes & Noble in some cities.
Muscle up
The problem with threatening Amazon is that most publishers are too small to make a difference. Some consolidation has recently occurred. Penguin and Random House merged to create a single publishing group with about a quarter of the market for US trade book sales. (Pearson holds a 47 per cent stake in the enlarged group). News Corp ’s HarperCollins and Hachette, owned by Lagardère, have made sizeable acquisitions.
More video
However, more tie-ups – such as a rumoured deal between HarperCollins and CBS ’s Simon & Schuster – have not materialised, and last week Hachette’s bid to buy independent publisher Perseus collapsed.
Scale would not just help publishers negotiate with Amazon. It would also allow bigger investments in new online platforms, brands and
multimedia spin-offs, such as games.
On the downside, bigger companies can be less sensitive to developing authors, says Angus Phillips, an academic at Oxford Brookes University.
Sell direct to consumers
“In the online context, one can absolutely imagine one day publishers will provide books directly to consumers,” says Prof Edelman. Doing so could undermine Amazon’s market share and its buying power.
Some publishers agree. “We have to have a relationship with the consumer,” says Stephen Page, chief executive of British publisher Faber & Faber. “At London Book Fair this year, all the talk was about data.”
Understanding consumers’ habits could help publishers better decide what titles to acquire and how to market them. But there are obstacles. Even selling direct, publishers are unlikely to match Amazon’s prices. Individual houses also lack Amazon’s brand and range. “It’s very, very hard to create a destination site because we don’t represent the entirety of the market,” says Chantal Restivo-Alessi, chief digital officer at HarperCollins, which started selling books direct to US consumers last month.
Discovery, discovery, discovery
Why would a rival site to Amazon work? Mr Bezos’s company is ideal for finding the book you know you want. But it is not ideal for finding the book that you don’t yet know you want.
In the online context, one can absolutely imagine one day publishers will provide books directly to consumers
- Ben Edelman, Harvard Business School
“A large part of the profit in the industry comes from the mid-list – the stuff that’s at the back of the bookshop and sells reliably for years, and this risks being invisible on Amazon,” says Benedict Evans, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “The concern is that as physical [bookselling] goes away, more and more sales get concentrated in best-sellers, both for print and ebooks.”
That leaves an opportunity to publishers who want to “recreate the serendipity of browsing a bookstore”, as Andrew Rhomberg, founder of ebook discovery site Jellybooks, puts it.
Dedicated discovery sites are yet to become potential rivals to Amazon. Last month Apple acquired, and shut down, one such site, BookLamp; Amazon bought another, Goodreads, last year. Los Angeles-based start-up Small Demons, which carried books from Random House UK, shut down last year after failing to find a buyer.
Mr Rhomberg says one difficulty is that the plethora of social networks and messaging apps means “the majority of people discover books by other means than browsing a dedicated website”.
But publishers, which have set up consumer insight divisions, should see discovery as fertile ground for rivals to Amazon.
Learn some law
While publishers fell foul of antitrust rules with their earlier attempt at a new ebook pricing model, that does not mean Amazon will always have the legal upper hand. For instance, Amazon’s ability to strong-arm publishers in pricing talks could come under the scrutiny of competition authorities. “The bigger you get, the more of a target you become,” says Alan Bates, a barrister at London’s Monckton Chambers. “It’s almost inevitable that in the coming years they do things that attract adverse attention.”
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office is investigating a complaint from booksellers about Amazon’s negotiating tactics, following a dispute about delays to physical book sales during talks over rights to ebooks. The EU Commission says it is “trying to understand the issues involved” in that case.
Other disputes could emerge. Competition law often looks in unlikely places: no one expected Microsoft to be investigated for bundling Internet Explorer. In Amazon’s case, its Kindle ereaders give preference to its Kindle ebooks. Therefore one area of future scrutiny could be whether the retailer is using its dominance in one market – ereaders – to boost its dominance in another – ebooks.
Further reading: In a new twist, authors write themselves into the fray
Publishers are not the only ones pushing back against Amazon. A full-page advertisement in Sunday’s The New York Times carried the signatures of Stephen King, Donna Tartt and more than 900 other authors calling on their readers to lobby Jeff Bezos to resolve Amazon’s pricing feud with Hachette, writes Shannon Bond.
Amazon wants publishers to reduce US ebook prices to $9.99 or less, except for “a small number of specialised titles”. When Hachette refused, the battle spilled out into the open as Amazon retaliated by charging more for some books, taking longer to ship and removing pre-order buttons from some forthcoming titles.
“Without taking sides on the contractual dispute between Hachette and Amazon, we encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,” the authors wrote.
The advert, which cost $104,000, was the most public move by Authors United, a campaign against the ecommerce giant spearheaded by Douglas Preston, the Hachette thriller writer. Amazon has shot back that Mr Preston is “rich and already successful” and accused Hachette of using its authors as “human shields”.
Amazon appealed to its own readers at the weekend on its Readers United website, urging them to email Hachette’s chief and tell him: “We have noted your illegal collusion. Please stop working so hard to overcharge for ebooks.”
Amazon has its own defenders among writers, however, including Hugh Howey, whose self-published books have become bestsellers. Mr Howey has been vocal about the profits publishers make from ebooks and has put his name to a petition backing Amazon . “Boycotting Amazon is unavoidably a call for higher ebook prices,” the petition says.

MUMBAI: The primary market is likely to witness a deluge of fresh paper worth over Rs 2 lakh crore within the next year as the government looks to trim stakes in its companies and private firms aim to raise fresh capital.
But, sceptics are not sure whether the market would be able to absorb the extent of share sales amid a slowdown in foreign institutional inflows , though bankers remain confident of their success.
Of the stake sales planned over the next 12 months, the government would be the largest contributor. About Rs 45,000 crore worth of shares could be sold by the government to meet its disinvestment target. This is in addition to its probable share sales in Balco and Hindustan Zinc worth Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore from SUUTI stake sales.
Banks — public and private — may raise about Rs 40,000 crore, while various companies plan to raise almost Rs 50,000 crore from institutional investors. In private, bankers accept that the extent of fund-raising is a steep task but they expect it to scrape through once pension funds enter the picture.
"This is not a worrisome figure as FIIs and private equity players are continuously pumping in funds into Indian equities. Domestic mutual funds have already turned net buyers whereas insurance companies are likely to turn positive," said S Subramanian, MD, investment banking, at Axis Capital. "Moreover, pension funds will enter the equity market once government gives the final go ahead".
Some market participants were worried with the quantum of the supply of shares in the wake of the recent drop in foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows. There is a concern that the tighter monetary policy in the US may slow FII flows into the country.
During the calendar year 2013, FIIs invested Rs 1.13 lakh crore while domestic institutions sold stocks worth Rs 74,000 crore. The net investment from both the institutions was about Rs 39,000 crore.
So far in 2014, FIIs have invested Rs 86,000 crore, while DIIs sold shares worth Rs 34,000 crore with a net investment of about Rs 51,500 crore. Brokers said FII inflows have slowed down because of rich valuations but once the economy and corporate earnings recover, more foreigners would be keen on investing in fresh papers.
"Even during the difficult time, India has received about $10-15 billion investment from FIIs. However, with improving economic conditions, Indian market should get about $25 billion inflow — $15 billion in primary and $10 billion in the secondary market," said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
The government has already announced its plan to sell 10 per cent stake in Coal India, 5per cent in ONGC and 11.36 per cent stake in NHPC to raise about Rs 45,000 crore in the next few months. The other offer from the government will come in the form of residuary stake sales in Hindustan Zinc and Balco, worth an estimated Rs 20,000 crore.
The government is also planning to raise about Rs 10,000 crore by selling a part of SUUTI's holding in ITC and L&T. SUUTI owns around 11.3 per cent stake in ITC, which is worth over Rs 31,500 crore, while its 8.2 per cent in Larsen & Toubro is valued at over Rs 12,100 crore.
"There is strong investor interest in Indian equities and with limited opportunities to buy quantities in the secondary market, investors would look for fresh offerings to increase their exposure," said Ravi Sardana, EVP—Investment Banking, ICICI Securities.
Indian corporates, which have raised about Rs 26,000 crore so far this year by a way of institutional placement, plan to raise about Rs 50,000 in coming months going by corporate announcements and board meeting resolutions.
"We expect more QIPs to follow in the rest of the year as there is a strong demand of equity capital by India Inc." said Nilesh Shah, CEO & managing director, Axis Capital. "The primary market in the mean time has seen strong revival as seen in response to recent IPOs."

US stocks closed mixed on Monday as the tech sector dragged the Nasdaq to its worst day since July and kept the S&P 500 near the unchanged mark as investors cleared the decks for Alibaba's debut planned for later this week.
Alibaba's could be the largest initial public offering in history and has seen "overwhelming" interest, meaning Yahoo's 23 percent stake could be worth more next week than it is now. Yahoo stock pulled back from a 14-year high and fell 0.8 percent to 42.55 with 71.7 million shares traded, more than double its 10-day average of 34.2 million.
"There is some nervousness out there, so some money is coming out of the high-flyers and some of it is people getting ready to raise some cash to put to work to Alibaba," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.
 
Heavily-traded Facebook and Netflix lost nearly 4 percent each. The S&P technology sector lost 0.6 percent as the worst performing of the 10 major S&P sectors.
Investors also exercised caution ahead of the policy statement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which could provide clues on the timing of an interest rate hike.
"There is a lot of wait-and-see for what happens Wednesday, if anything new happens," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 43.63 points, or 0.26 percent, to 17,031.14, the S&P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,984.13, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.70 points, or 1.07 percent, to 4,518.90.
The decline for the Nasdaq marked its biggest drop since July 31.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was DRDGOLD Limited, which gained 20 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was BANKRATE INC, down 13.75 percent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Bank of America, down 0.30 percent to USD 16.74; Nokia Corp ADR, up 2.27 percent to USD 8.56; and Petrobras, up 0.98 percent to USD 16.54.
On the Nasdaq, Avanir Pharma, up 85.3 percent to USD 12.49; Yahoo Inc, down 0.8 percent to USD 42.55; and Apple Inc, down 0.03 percent to USD 101.63, were among the most actively traded.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,021 to 1,031, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio to the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,092 issues fell and 638 advanced for a 3.28-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The broad S&P 500 index was posted 14 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 97 new lows.
Volume was modest, with about 5.51 billion shares traded on US exchanges, slightly below the 5.6 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

New Delhi: The Congress's story of turmoil and infighting continues. There is now controversy over the latest list of Congress spokespersons released by the party which does not have the names of Manish Tewari and Rashid Alvi.
Embarrassed by a string of public disagreements, the party has issued a gag order with the Congress media department head Ajay Maken ruling that only spokespersons were authorised to speak. His diktat was directed at Manish Tewari, Rashid Alvi and many others. But a miffed Manish Tewari hit back, adamant that he would continue to speak.

"There are certain core convictions I believe in. When they are assaulted, I do not require a noun or an adjective behind my name to intervene in the public discourse. As a party activist, I do not hold myself out as the spokesperson," Tewari said.
#congress infighting #manish tewari #rashid alvi #rahul gandhi
Moments after Manish showed his defiance, the Congress released a new list of spokespersons featuring Anand Sharma and P Chidambaram amongst others, but Tewari and Rashid Alvi's names were missing.
"It is responsibility of every Congress worker to defend the party. I am doing that and I will continue to do so," Alvi said.
The Congress is expected to go in for organisational changes following party Vice President Rahul Gandhi's path and it is also preparing for the election battles in Maharashtra and Haryana. But for now, the party is bogged down by its internal battle, a sign that it has yet to see 'acche din'.

New Delhi: Counting of votes will be held on Tuesday in three Lok Sabha and 33 assembly constituencies spread across 10 states where bypolls were held on September 13, with stakes high for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The three Lok Sabha seats are in Vadodara (Gujarat), vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) and Medak (Telangana) while 11 assembly constituencies are in UP, nine in Gujarat, four in Rajasthan, two in West Bengal, five in Northeastern states and one each in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. 24 of these assembly seats were held by BJP and one each by its allies Apna Dal and TDP.
It is the first test for BJP after it's big win in the Lok Sabha elections. After BJP's near total sweep in Lok Sabha polls in UP, it is to be seen whether the party can retain its 10 seats.
After suffering a jolt in recently concluded bypolls in three states, it is to be seen whether the BJP can retain its hold on other states.
#bypolls #gujarat #up #telangana
In August, the saffron party had received a jolt in assembly byelections suffering a 4-6 defeat at the hands of the RJD-JD(U)-Congress alliance in Bihar and yielding two strongholds to Congress in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.
Tuesday's bypoll results, seen as yet another test of Narendra Modi government's popularity since it assumed power in May, are also important as BJP is preparing for polls in Haryana and Maharashtra in October where it hopes to oust the Congress.
Around 53 per cent votes were polled in the seats in UP, including Mainpuri vacated by Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav. SP has fielded Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, the grandson of Mulayam's elder brother and the challenge for it is not just to win the seat again but also to maintain the big margin.
The 11 assembly seats in UP, whose outcome may be a pointer to which way the political wind is blowing in the run up to 2017 assembly polls, are Saharanpur Nagar, Noida, Thakurdwara, Bijnor, Nighasan, Balha, Sirathu, Rohaniya, Hamirpur, Charkhari and Lucknow East.
In Rajasthan, it is a close contest between main opposition Congress and the ruling BJP, which would try to retain all four seats and maintain a tally of 163 in the House of 200. The four assembly seats in Rajasthan saw a voting figure of 66 per cent.
The counting of votes would begin in four district headquarters of Jhunjhunu, Ajmer, Kota and Bharatpur on Tuesday at 8:00 AM, Chief Electoral Officer Govind Sharma said in Jaipur.
Trinamool Congress is hoping to retain two assembly seats of Basirhat Dakshin and Chowringhee in West Bengal in the face of Saradha chit fund scam that has already ensnared some of its leaders.
In Gujarat, Narendra Modi's successor as chief minister Anandiben Patel is facing her first big test with the bypolls in Vadodara LS seat and in nine assembly constituencies, all held by BJP earlier.
It is the first election in Gujarat in more than 12 years that BJP fought without its star campaigner Modi.
In Medak, TRS' K Prabhakar Reddy contested against BJP's T Jayaprakash Reddy in Medak, the seat vacated by KC Chandrasekhar Rao on becoming Telangana Chief Minister.
TDP is trying hard to prove it won't be easy to conquer its bastion Nandigama assembly in Krishna district where it is in a direct fight against Congress.
Congress again faces challenge in Assam against BJP as well as perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal's All India United Democratic Front. The assembly seats were bypolls were held are Lakhipur and Silchar, both held by Congress earlier.
Jamunamukh was held by AIUDF. Counting of votes will also be held for Rangang-Yangang seat in Sikkim, Manu in Tripura and Antagarh in Chhattisgarh.

Srinagar: Over two lakh people have been rescued in the flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir but the big challenge ahead was to supply food and relief to the people. The locals continue to battle with uncertainity without the basics and have accused the government of ignoring their plight.
Indian Air Force Chief Arup Raha will be visiting Srinagar on Tuesday to review the ongoing rescue and relief operations. Over 80 transport aircraft have been deployed by the forces for relief work. It could take another three days for the Jammu-Srinagar Highway to reopen.
Meanwhile, some Kashmiri-Americans were trying to help by offering telemedicine facility through video-conference and phone to the affected people in the state.
#jammu and kashmir #jammu and kashmir floods #floods #army
As the flood water has started receding, the apprehension for water-borne diseases is rising and now demand for filtered water has increased, PRO Defence Col SD Goswami said.
Twenty RO plants with a capacity to filter 4 lakh litre water per day are being sent to Srinagar from Hyderabad and four RO plants with a capacity to filter 1 lakh litre per day are being sent from Delhi, Goswami said.
Thirteen tonnes of water purifying tablets and six water filtration plants with a capacity to filter 1.2 lakh bottles per day have been sent to Srinagar earlier, he said, adding that more heavy duty suction pumps are being airlifted from Jodhpur and Raipur.
So far, 2,527 sorties have been undertaken by the helicopters and aircrafts of the armed forces and 3,673 tonnes of relief materials have been dropped by the Indian Air Force, he said
Nearly 6 lakh litres of water and over 1,313 tonnes of food packets and cooked food and ration have been distributed.
A total of 224 boats of the Army and NDRF's 148 inflatable boats are actively involved in the rescue operation, he said
The armed forces have established 19 relief camps in Srinagar and Jammu regions.
To restore road connectivity, five task forces of Border Roads Organisation, comprising 5,700 personnel, have been deployed in Srinagar, Rajouri and Akhnoor.
They have restored the road connectivity from Batote to Bijbiara. The connectivity from Srinagar to Sonamarg has been opened for all vehicles, while, between Srinagar and Baramulla, the road has been opened for light vehicles.
The Jammu-Poonch road has been cleared for traffic. On the Jammu-Srinagar highway, BRO personnel have cleared the road up to 172 km (Ramsu) and work is in progress to clear fresh landslides in the areas that were cleared earlier.

Exclusive: How India is managing its tiger reserves20
2
There are 47 tiger reserves in India that are key to the survival of the beautiful beast, who continues to face threats from poachers and loss of habitat in the name of development.
In those reserves lives not just the tiger but the world's hope as India, where 60 per cent of the world's wild tigers are found, leads the endangered animal's conservation efforts.
That makes tiger reserves a component whose vital signs need to be continuously monitored, not just in terms of the tiger count but also the health of tiger habitat and prey population, which is critical to its survival.
#tiger census 2014 #save the tiger #tiger #tiger habitat
The need was recognised by the Government of India that gave the responsibility of rating India's tiger reserves to Dr. Vinod Mathur - Director of the Wildlife Institute of India.
Dr. Mathur and his team has championed the project called Management Effectiveness and Evaluation of the Tiger Reserves (MEETR), having completed this four-year cycle twice.
Here, Dr Mathur himself decodes MEETR and how it's ensuring that the tiger's habitat stays healthy.
How you pioneered the Management Effectiveness and Evaluation of the Tiger Reserves in India in the year 2005-06?
All the tiger reserves have been established for conserving the tiger, and they are under good management, but how good is this management? Because the society is spending resources, both time and money, and manpower; and it wants to know whether these tiger reserves are being managed efficiently and effectively or not.
So this term - Management Effectiveness and Evaluation - is a a global framework, which, I would say, more than 100 countries in the world have adopted - not only for tiger reserves but for national parks and sanctuaries as well.
We looked at this framework and we realised that in a very objective manner, this framework helps us in assessing the level of effectiveness of management. But we then realised that the global things have to be, if I can say so, tweaked to meet the Indian situation. So we used the same framework but developed our own indicators. Over a period, we developed 30 such indicators, which basically, in common language, explain the health of the park or health of the tiger reserve.
We developed these indicators when the Project Tiger and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) asked us.
In short, we can say these are the vital signs for tiger reserves.
Exactly, for the tiger reserve habitat and management. Not for the tiger but for their habitat and management.
But we wanted to keep this process independent. And that is where we went back to the Ministry, went back to the NTCA and said: "We as an institute will provide all technical back-stopping but our scientists and researchers will not be part of the actual evaluation process. So that was one way of looking at the independence of the system.
To make it more authentic
Yes, and to make it more vigorous. All assessments have to vigorous. If they lose vigour, they lose credibility. So we said framework is fine, indicators are fine, let's also put up a mechanism where assessment is also through an independent process. So we suggested a string of names to the government, they selected the names, and we thought we should put up a combination of a manager and a scientist. So there is a three-member team that goes to evaluate these parks based on the framework that we are providing. But that team is independent because they are not part of the government. Managers have experience of working (with wildlife) in the past, but they are not on the current payroll, i.e., they have retired but they have experience of tiger management. Same is true with researchers. They work independently, either as independent scientists or in civil society or in a scientific institution, but not as part of the government.
On that basis we have been able to do this evaluation for all 39 tiger reserves in 2010-11, and as we speak, there is a process going on for 2014-15. The tiger  reserves will be evaluated and by end of this year, we will be in a position to know how well they are doing, rate them and compare with results of 2005-06, when we first did, and in 2010-11, when we did it for the second time. So a trend might also emerge when we look at these results.
Thanks for explaining the process. But there is a Phase IV in tiger estimation, which is an ongoing process - annually. So do you think this management effectiveness and evaluation should be implemented specifically for Phase IV as well to check it's effectiveness.
We are talking about two things, but they have a correlation. It's true that Phase IV monitoring is also being done and led by WII. We have scientists and teams in place, which are doing that, trying to estimate (tiger population). There is a very tenuous link between tiger numbers and management of effectiveness.
For a common man, it's like if the management is good, it should be reflected in higher tiger numbers. That's a common understanding. Though this understanding is correct, it may not always hold good. I will give you two examples.
Take the case of tiger population or numbers in a park called Ranthambore or Bandhavgarh. There the habitat and prey base is such that you will always find a higher number of tigers. Take the case now of Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, take the case of Periyar Tiger Reserve. Even if the management is good, their tiger numbers cannot compete with the numbers in Ranthambore or Bandhavgarh. The dynamics are different, habitat are different, vegetation types are different.
So if a park gets a high score on MEE, it must have good population (of tigers) but that doesn't mean it will always have the highest number of tigers.

Remove hurdles on road to Mission Modi: Auto firmsRemove speed breakers on road to Mission Modi: Auto firms to govt
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 13, 2014  | 20:09 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a meeting with the Honda Motor Company chairman Fumihiko Ike in New Delhi on Thursday.
Global carmakers, including Honda and General Motors (GM), said on Friday that the government should make its policies more business friendly if the country wants to succeed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's 'Make In India' mission. They highlighted a host of obstacles such as difficulty in getting business permits, complex tax structure, poor infrastructure and logistics which are holding back growth of the auto industry.
"There are a considerable number of obstacles to doing business in this country. It is hoped that such obstacles will be cleared away under the new leadership of Prime Minister Modi," chairman of Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and Honda Motor Company Fumihiko Ike said at the annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
Many Japanese auto parts suppliers were keen to establish operations in this country, Ike further said. However, these suppliers as well as auto manufacturers often encounter problems in obtaining business permits and completing paperwork required for acquisition of the business property, he lamented.
The complicated process of obtaining a plant construction permit in some cases has seriously hindered business plans, Ike added. These problems are further compounded by India's complex domestic taxation system, which varies from one state to other. These taxes, which are far more burdensome than international taxations standards, are also impending investment in India, Ike further added. Nissan senior vice-president and chairman for Africa, Middle East and India Takashi Hata said, "India must also modernise its creaking rail, port, road and other infrastructure and ease bureaucratic red tape.
Logistics and infrastructure are a clear disadvantage of the country." General Motors executive vicepresident Stefan Jacoby also said that to realise the full potential of the industry, "we would like the government to reform overall Central and state taxation policies in a timely manner".

physical fitness
Sitting is the new smoking warn fitness experts
Do you sit all day at a desk? If yes, then you’re encouraging muscle stiffness, poor balance and mobility, and lower-back, neck and hip pain. But to understand why, you’ll need to know what happens to some specific muscles when you are seated.
Think about where your hips and thighs are in relation to your torso while you are sitting
They’re bent, which causes the muscles on the front of your thighs, known as hip flexors, to contract slightly, or shorten. The more you sit, the more your hip flexors get shortened. Some people walk with a forward lean; it’s often because of shortened hip flexors. The muscles don’t stretch as they naturally should. As a result, they are not walking tall and straight because their hip flexors are more adapted to sitting positions.
This same effect can be seen in other areas of your body. For instance, if you spend a lot of time with your shoulders and upper back slumped over a keyboard, this eventually becomes your normal posture. This frequently leads to chronic neck and shoulder pain. Also, people who frequently cross their legs a certain way can experience hip imbalances. This makes your entire lower body less stable, which decreases your agility, mobility and increases your risk for injuries. So, a person who sits a lot is less efficient not only at exercising, but also at simply moving from, say, the bed to couch, to the refrigerator.
Turning off the burners
If you spend too much time in a chair, your glute muscles 0r butt muscles will forget how to fire. This is called gluteal amnesia. Your butt muscles are your body’s largest muscle group. So if they aren’t functioning properly, you won’t be able to squat or dead-lift a suitcase or a baby from the floor comfortably. And, you won’t burn as much fat either. After all, muscles burn calories and that makes your glutes a powerful furnace to burn fat. Unfortunately, this furnace is switched off by those who spend most of their day seated.
Just moving constantly may keep you out of that doctor’s office and medications
Think of your body as a computer: As long as you’re moving the mouse and tapping the keys, all systems are ready to respond, But let it idle for a few minutes, and the machine goes into power-conservation mode. Your body is meant to be active, so when you sit and do nothing for too long, it shuts down, and when your muscles are not active, they become stiff and weak.
Posture and spine health
When you sit all day, your hip flexors and hamstrings shorten and tighten, while the muscles that support your spine become weak and stiff. It’s no wonder that the incidence of chronic lower-back pain has increased threefold since the early 1990s.
Weak glutes as well as tight hip flexors cause your pelvis to tilt forward. This puts stress on your lumbar spine, resulting in lower-back pain. It also pushes your belly out, which gives you a protruding gut even if you don’t have an ounce of fat. The changes to your muscles and posture from sitting are so small that you won’t notice them at first. But as you reach your 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond, they will gradually become worse and a lot harder to fix.
So what’s a desk jockey to do?
There are two spectrums of activity. One represents the activities you do that are considered regular exercise at the gym, such as stretching, strengthening and your cardio activities such as walking, biking, swimming, etc.
The other denotes the amount of time you spend sitting Vs the time you spend on your feet.
Even mini frequent moves through the day plays a big role in keeping you pain free
Make the small choices that will help you move in the right direction on that sitting-versus-standing spectrum.
Create some work to stand up or just take a few steps to fetch a glass of water, move around while you’re talking on the phone, walk to your colleague’s table at work, etc. There are a hundred useful reasons to be on your feet.
Just because one works out for an hour or day, one can’t declare that it is okay to be seated for the rest of the day. Make it a challenge.
Just as you make goals for running a marathon or doing 100 push ups, you also have to do the same for everyday movements, if you want a pain free and carefree life.
So get off that chair and start moving.

India inks seven agreements with VietnamIndia inks seven agreements with Vietnam, including one in oil cooperation
Neelabh Srivastava     Hanoi   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 14:40 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
India and Vietnam on Monday inked seven pacts, including one to enhance cooperation in the strategic oil sector, as they called for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, a remark which could irk China which has been claiming territorial sovereignty over the high seas.
The agreements were signed during the second day of the four-day state visit of President Pranab Mukherjee who held talks with his Vietnamese counterpart Truong Tan Sang here.
Both the countries decided to strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation on the basis of the strategic partnership with focus on political, defence and security cooperation, economic cooperation, science and technology, culture and people-to-people links, technical cooperation and multilateral and regional cooperation.
In a subtle message to China, the two countries, who established strategic ties in 2007, asserted that the freedom of navigation in the disputed waters of the South China Sea should not be impeded and called all the parties concerned to exercise restraint in this context.
The leaders reiterated their desire and determination to work together to maintain peace, stability, growth and prosperity in Asia. They agreed that freedom of navigation in the East Sea/South China Sea should not be impeded and called the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid threat or use of force and resolve disputes through peaceful means in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the UNCLOS-1982, said a joint communique issued after the meeting.
China has been exerting its influence in these waters which is not taken well by Vietnam and other bordering countries like the Philippines. The two sides urged for collective commitment of the concerned parties to abide by and implement the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and to work towards the adoption of a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea on the basis of consensus.
They called for cooperation in ensuring security of sea-lanes, maritime security, combating piracy and conducting search and rescue operations, it said. Both the nations also agreed to continue closer interaction under the institutional architecture of the strategic partnership, particularly the Joint Commission meeting, the Foreign Office consultations and strategic dialogue, security dialogue and other dialogue mechanisms between the two countries, the communique said.
After the delegation-level talks, both the leaders oversaw the signing of pacts on seven different subjects in the presence of dignitaries and senior government officials.
Apart from a Letter of Intent (LoI) signed between the ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Vietnam Oil, the other pacts include extending a dollar credit line between Vietnam and EXIM Bank of India, agreement on co-operation and mutual assistance in customs matters, MoU on animal health, MoU on setting up of Pangasius breeding and farming in India, MoU on operating and jointly promoting direct air services between Vietnam Airlines and domestic Indian air carrier Jet Airways and MoU on cooperation in youth affairs and skill development.
The two sides also agreed to undertake a focussed cooperation in defence related procurement. The leaders agreed that defence and security cooperation was an important pillar of the strategic partnership between the two countries. They expressed satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation between the two sides in this field and noted that the signing of the MoU for the Line of Credit of $100 million for defence procurement extended by India to Vietnam would open new avenues for cooperation, the joint statement said.
They also reiterated their desire and determination to work together to maintain peace, stability, growth and prosperity in Asia, it said. It said official talks between the leaders were held in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual trust.
President Sang and President Mukherjee exchanged views on the socio-economic developments and foreign policy of their respective countries, bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest, it said.
Mukherjee also congratulated the government and people of Vietnam on the remarkable achievements recorded in recent years while Sang saluted India on the successful completion of the recent Lok Sabha elections and expressed his belief that under the leadership of the new government in India, the people of India will attain greater achievements in national development.
The two leaders also agreed to enhance the economic partnership and strengthen the trade and investment linkages between the public and private sectors of both countries, including forging joint ventures.
They welcomed the strong growth in bilateral trade in recent years and urged business to further expand and diversify trade to achieve the bilateral trade target of $15 billion by 2020.
They identified tourism, garments and textiles, pharmaceuticals and agriculture as important areas of potential growth in bilateral trade, the statement said.
The two leaders highlighted scope for expansion in ICT, science and technology, space and other areas.
The MoU on line of credit of the Exim bank signed on Monday will explore opportunities for this cooperation in the future. Details of equipment to be purchased by Vietnam are under finalisation, the joint statement said.
Also, under the new air connectivity deal, both Jet Airways and Vietnam Airlines will fly a daily flight connecting Delhi, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh city starting November 5.
Before meeting his Vietnamese counterpart, Mukherjee visited the Ho Chi Minh's residential complex here and laid wreath at the memorial of National Heroes and Martyrs.
Upon his arrival to the Presidential palace, Mukherjee was given a guard of honour. He and Sang jointly planted a sapling of the Holy 'Bodhi Tree' which was gifted to Vietnam as a mark of respect and recognition of India's strong-rooted and growing ties with it. The Indian delegation comprises Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and five other Parliamentarians.

RBI Chief Says Need to Lower Inflation Before Cutting Rates
Reuters | Updated On: September 15, 2014 11:38 (IST)
China Surprises With Interest Rate Cut to Spur Growth
Mumbai:
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Dr Raghuram Rajan said on Monday inflation in Asia's third-largest economy was still high and there was no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation pick up again.
The RBI wants to bring down interest rates when it is "feasible", Dr Rajan told a banking conference.
Retail inflation, which the central bank tracks for setting lending rates, edged down marginally to 7.8 per cent in August from 7.96 per cent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in prices of fuel and clothes.

 Inflation on Target but Investment Needs to Pick Up: RajanChina Surprises With Interest Rate Cut to Spur Growth
Mumbai:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Dr Raghuram Rajan said India's macroeconomic indicators are improving and inflation has been coming down consistent with the central bank's forecast, but Asia's third-largest economy needs investment growth to pick up.
Dr Rajan, however, said Friday's industrial output and inflation data suggested that recovery was "uneven."
Output from mines, utilities and factories grew by a much slower-than-expected 0.5 per cent year-on-year, government data showed on Friday, down from June's revised 3.9 per cent rise.
Retail inflation, which the RBI tracks for setting lending rates, edged down marginally to 7.8 per cent in August from 7.96 per cent a month earlier.

PSBs against increase in ATM interchange feeBanks that have fewer ATMs will have to incur cost. So, naturally there is general reluctance from public sector banks to increase the interchange fee, says a banker.
RBI leaves it to banks to reach a consensus
Mumbai, Sept 15:  
With most public sector banks unwilling to increase the interchange or the interbank ATM usage fee, the charges are likely to stay at Rs 15 per transaction. In effect, banks may not pass on charges to their customers.
On asking if the Reserve Bank of India is not keen on the increase in interchange fee by banks, a senior RBI official said "it is absolutely wrong information".
The central bank does not intervene on the interchange fee and it is up to the banks to decide on increasing the charges, the official said.
Interchange fee is the amount charged if a consumer uses the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) of the non-home bank, that is, the bank, whose ATM is being used, charges the card-issuing bank.
At present, the fee is Rs 15 per financial transaction. This has been recommended to be revised to Rs 16.50, plus service tax (12 per cent), taking the amount to Rs 18.48.
According to a private sector bank official, “We would be more than happy to raise the interchange fee to recover our incremental costs. So, as net acquirers, we keep pushing for higher interchange fee and have asked for a minimum increase to Rs 16.5.”
The banks have yet to reach a consensus. However, most public sector banks are against raising the fees.
“If we raise the interchange fee, it is an additional cost to us and passing it on to the customers can lead to more branch visits, which in turn may also increase the costs. Hence, we are at the receiving end in both the cases,” said a public sector bank official.
It is always an ongoing battle between net issuers and net acquirers. The net issuers pay interchange fees and net acquirers are the ones who make money from the issuers when customers use other than their own bank ATMs.
Most public sector banks are net issuers.
“Banks which have fewer ATMs will have to incur cost. So, naturally there is general reluctance from public sector banks to increase the interchange fee,” K Subrahmanyam, Executive Director, Union Bank of India.
As for Union Bank of India, "we are net acquirers and at least not against increasing the fees", he added.
A quarterly committee meeting under National Payment Corporation of India’s National Financial Switch will likely review and decide on the interchange fee next quarter. Till such time, the fee will remain at Rs 15, the official said.
The issue of interchange fee became known after an attack on an ATM user in Bangalore that prompted states to ask banks to beef up security at ATM machines. Some banks have been seeking to increase interchange fees to compensate the consequent rise in costs.
On an average, the cost of maintaining an ATM is about Rs 35,000-40,000 per month.
Last month, the RBI cut the number of free transactions that savings bank customers can avail from other bank ATMs from five to three a month. It also allowed banks to charge customers if they use their own bank ATM more than five times a month.

Death toll at Nigeria church building collapse rises to 45Rescue workers gather at the site of a collapsed building belonging to the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria. (Source: AP)
Agence-France Presse | Lagos | Posted: September 15, 2014 7:27 pm
Rescue workers have pulled three more bodies from a collapsed guesthouse at a megachurch in Nigeria’s financial capital Lagos, raising the death toll to 45, emergency services said on Monday.
Ibrahim Farinloye, southwest coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), told AFP by text message that 45 bodies had now been removed from the rubble on the sprawling campus of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in the Ikotun of Lagos.
About 130 others were injured when the building, which housed visiting followers of the church’s preacher and televangelist TB Joshua, came down on Friday.
TB Joshua, dubbed “The Prophet”, has an almost fanatical following among Nigerians and across the world, attracted by his purported healing powers and prophecies.
Joshua preaches to massive crowds at his megachurch in Ikotun every week and, according to his website, SCOAN “hosts thousands of national and international visitors” each year.
Joshua has suggested that a mysterious low-flying aircraft could be to blame for the collapse.
But rescuers said a more likely cause was that extra floors had been added to the facility without strengthening the foundations.
Building collapses are common in Nigeria because of the use of substandard material and flouting of construction regulations.
The state government has ordered an investigation but said it was too soon to draw conclusions.
“The governor (Babatunde Fashola) was at the scene yesterday (Sunday) with some officials to inspect the collapsed structure,” his spokesman Hakeem Bello told AFP.
“An investigation has commenced into the incident. As for whether there was sabotage, I think the investigation will unravel that,” he said.
State officials would determine whether Joshua’s organisation had been given approval for the addition of the extra floors.
“The government has asked for the building plan to determine if necessary regulations are complied with,” said Bello.

Pak army kills 15 militants; 3 die in attacks targeting policePress Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: September 15, 2014 7:46 pm
On Monday Pakistani military choppers pounded militant hideouts and killed 15 insurgents in the restive North Waziristan tribal region, once considered a bastion of Taliban fighters, even as three persons died in attacks targeting police in the country’s northwest.
“Army Aviation Combat helicopters in precise strikes in Tabai area of North Waziristan Agency destroyed 10 explosive laden vehicles and 5 terrorists hideouts, 15 terrorists were killed,” a military statement said.
The military says it has cleared Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) militants from more than 80 per cent of the North Waziristan tribal region, including its regional headquarters Miramshah, the now ruined sub-district Mirali.
A communication line spreading over 80 kilometres up to Dattakhel, 35km west of Miramshah, has also been cleared of militants, according to the military.
Hours before the military pounded the suspected TTP hideouts, militants killed three people in attacks targeting police in the restive northwest, officials said.
A suicide bomber killed one policeman in Tahl, about 100 kilometres southwest of Peshawar, while two brothers of a police station chief died in a separate attack on his home in Dera Ismail Khan.
Separately, gunmen attacked the residence of Safiur Rehman, chief of Kolachi Police Station in Dera Ismail Khan district and killed his two brothers and wounded the third.
Authorities believe the attack was mounted in revenge for an operation today in which one militant was killed and another wounded.
However, no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but the Taliban, which rose against the state in 2007, often carry out such attacks against the police and other law enforcing agencies.
Meanwhile General John Campbell, Commander International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Raheel Sharif at General Headquarters.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest were discussed that included progress of ongoing Operation Zarb-e-Azb, latest situation in Afghanistan and coordination along Pak-Afghan Border,” the military said.
This is his first visit to the General Headquarters after he assumed the command of the ISAF.
Pakistan began a much-awaited military campaign to clear insurgent bases from North Waziristan tribal region bordering Afghanistan, following a bloody assault on Karachi airport ended faltering peace talks with the rebels.
The militant attack on the airport killed 37 people.
Pakistan’s Air Force has spearheaded the operation to wipe out militants’ hideouts in what until recently was the epicentre of terrorism in the country.
The military claims it has killed nearly 1,000 militants and lost 82 soldiers since the start of the operation.

No existence of Love Jihad in UP: Govt tells High CourtPress Trust of India | Lucknow | Posted: September 15, 2014 8:46 pm
On Monday the Uttar Pradesh government informed the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court that that there is no existence of “Love Jihad” in the state.
The submission came during hearing of a PIL, filed by one Pankaj Tiwari, which sought a ban on word “Love Jihad”.
A division bench comprising Justices Imtiyaz Murtaza and Narain Shukla directed the UP government counsel to file reply within two weeks with regard to the PIL.
The Election Commission of India, the UP government, BJP MP Adityanath and Union Minister Kalraj Mishra have been made respondents in the petition.
Petitioner’s counsel C B Pandey contended that through the word “Love Jihad”, a new type of communality was spreading in the state for polarisation of society and, hence, the use of word should be banned.
On behalf of the state government, Additional Advocate eneral Bulbul Godiyal informed the court that there was “no existence of Love Jihad” in UP.
The AAG further said a CB-CID probe was underway against Adityanath.
On AAG’s request, the court provided two weeks’ time to the state to file a counter affidavit.

Arundhati Roy gets wrongly listed as co-author with Ambedkarbooks and literature
A series of misleading author listings for B.R. Ambedkar’s seminal text The Annihilation of Caste on web portals has generated a lot of flak against writer and columnist Arundhati Roy and publisher S. Anand.
The webpage of VersoBooks.com, a U.K.-based publisher of the book advertised it as Annihilation of Caste: The Annotated Critical Edition by B.R. Ambedkar and Arundhati Roy.
The listing on Amazon.co.uk made no mention of the annotated version and simply announced the title as: The Annihilation of Caste (Hardcover – October 7, 2014) by Arundhati Roy (author), B.R. Ambedkar (author).
A similar version also appeared on the popular online shopping portal Home Shop 18. Not only did the site misrepresent the author, but a brief description of the book in its overview section said, “About the Author – Arundhati Roy’s books include, most recently, Listening to Grasshoppers.”
The Ahmedabad-based website Infibeam went a step further. Its listing made no mention of Dr. Ambedkar and mentioned Ms. Roy as the author with the original title, without even mentioning the annotated version.
Ms. Roy has written an introduction to the annotated version of the original 1936 text published by the Indian publishing house Navayana. The publisher has sold the publishing rights to Verso.
Ironically, the publisher’s website itself listed Ms. Roy as the co-author, without making any distinction between the author and the introducer.
A section of the online community cried foul over this misleading attribution of authorship to Ms. Roy, accusing her and the publisher of serious copyright violation and plagiarism.
“Arundhati Roy suddenly becoming co-author of AoC…What is colonization of Ambedkar? The process of appropriation through which the ‘introducer’ of Dalit writing becomes the primary author, for instance,” wrote Kuffir Nalgundwar (nom de plume), contributing editor on Round Table India, a platform for Dalit-Bahujan issues, who first posted these listings on Facebook.
When The Hindu reached Verso for a clarification by phone, it acknowledged the listing as a “mistake” and assured that it would be corrected on all websites, where the book was advertised.
In an email reply, Leo Hollis, editor at the Verso London office said, “These errors have resulted from a computer feed from our system to the U.S. Amazon information system. I fear that Amazon has inconsistencies which we will aim to rectify in the next 24 hours. We are publishing the Navayana edition of Annihilation of Caste by Ambedkar with an introduction from Roy. We have also acknowledged Mr. Anand as the editor. This is how the project was presented to us by Navayana and how we plan to proceed.”
Publisher Anand termed the listing “technical errors.” He said he was writing to the websites for correction.
“It’s a sensitive issue because factually it is wrong. In the book, the hierarchy has been maintained as to who is the author and the introducer,” he told The Hindu. Verso, Amazon and Infibeam have rectified their listings.
Mr. Nalgundwar, however, did not buy the argument. “How can this so-called error be on multiple websites? Even Mr. Anand’s website carries the same thing. The negligence is deliberate. The Annihilation of Caste is a major text of the oppressed classes, which provides substance to their politics.”

Government may move Aadhar Project to IT ministry
Yogima Sharma, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 03.59AM IST

IT
(Sources say, the only hurdle…)
NEW DELHI: The government is looking for a new parent for the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) as it prepares to wind up the Planning Commission, which had so far been the administrative authority for the body that has been tasked with issuing chip-based, biometric photo ID cards, called Aadhar, to all Indians.
Senior government officials told ET that the government can move UIDAI to the information technology (IT) ministry. They said discussions are on between the Planning Commission and the IT ministry on the feasibility of moving out UIDAI from the commission. "This is necessary since the government is working on the process of closing down the commission. Besides, placing UIDAI under the IT ministry will ensure greater synergy between the authority and the Centre," one of these officials said on condition of anonymity. IT secretary RS Sharma has, however, said no such proposal was being considered by the ministry.
But some officials said the idea of putting UIDAI under the control of the IT ministry was mooted by Sharma, who was the director-general of UIDAI when it was launched in 2009. These officials also said that Sharma not only persuaded the Narendra Modi government to retain UIDAI but also convinced it to fast-track generation of Aadhar cards for 100 crore-plus Indians. According to the official quoted earlier, the only hurdle before the government in attaching UIDAI to the IT ministry is co-ordination with states, which, until now, was done by the Planning Commission.
Soon after taking over as home minister, Rajnath Singh had said that the government will merge UIDAI with the National Population Register, which is under his ministry. But days later, the Prime Minister announced that his government has decided to retain UIDAI and given it a target to issue Aadhaar cards to 100 crore citizens by the end of 2015.

ET 500 reflects revival sweeping across Indi...ET 500 highlights resurgence in India Inc as companies post higher revenue, profits over 2013
Ramkrishna Kashelkar, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 11.03AM IST
(The ET500 features India…)
MUMBAI: Watershed — that's what 2014 feels like. A time of uncertainty, fear, stasis and overall gloom is giving way to hope, renewal and good cheer as various auguries point to an economic resurgence after a prolonged slump. The stock markets, racing ahead of the curve, shot up to an all-time high earlier this month.
There's no better time to unveil this year's ET500 — the definitive ranking of India's biggest listed companies — than right at the cusp of this transformation as Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready to deliver on his promise of economic deliverance from years of policy paralysis and excruciatingly slow growth.
The ET500, in broadsheet format for the first time, features India Inc's biggest companies in terms of revenue, which saw an 11% increase at the aggregate level to Rs 67 lakh crore since the last list. Nevertheless, it reflects the sluggishness through FY14 as the cut-off for this year's listing remained unchanged from the previous level. Similarly, the number of companies posting losses jumped to a record high of 85 and their combined losses, more than Rs 36,700 crore, turned out to be 18 times what it was in 2007.
On the brighter side, quite a few companies expanded profits significantly. TCS, for example, became the third-biggest in terms of profit in FY14, after energy giants ONGC and Reliance Industries. In fact, for private sector firms, the reported profit for FY14 was the highest ever. However, their public sector counterparts failed to keep pace.
The year also recorded the highest amount distributed as dividends by ET500 companies.
Coal India and Strides Arcolab paid out hefty special dividends and the big information technology companies were also generous to shareholders after turning in healthy performances. A record Rs 1.26 lakh crore was paid out as dividend in FY14, translating into 30% of the year's aggregate profits.
The petroleum sector's dominance of the ET500 continues with six of the top 10 companies belonging to that industry. The supremacy of stateowned companies could be slackening, as only five of them made it to the top 10 as against six last year.
Tata Motors became India's biggest non-oil company by revenue while State Bank of India retained its position as the biggest non-manufacturing company in the country. The top eight companies in the ET500 remain a class apart, with each reporting revenue that exceeded 1% of India's GDP.
Rivals have a long way to catch up, with an almost Rs 50,000 crore gap separating Tata Steel in eighth position and Essar Oil in the ninth. The ET500 also clearly captures the changing face of India Inc — the gradual shift away from the metro cities, as an increasing number of companies from tier-2 and tier-3 cities make it to the list.
Pune, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are gaining while Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are losing ground.

The Indian equity market is likely to open trade today on a flat, albeit, slightly negative note today. The SGX Nifty, an indicator of the market opening was trading at 8034.50, down 24.50 points at 7:50.
The market saw consolidation on Monday with the Sensex shedding over 240 points to slip below 27,000. Nifty also slid below 8,100 but midcaps continued to outperform.
Global cues, meanwhile, are mixed with the US markets closing mixed with Nasdaq slipping to a one-month low, as investors booked profits ahead of the crucial two-day FOMC meeting that begins today.
Asian markets too are trading in the red as all eyes stay glued on the start of the Federal Reserve's meeting. Europe too closed lower over concerns on the Fed meet and the Scottish independence vote.
In other asset classes, brent crude is trading well below USD 97 per barrel, its lowest since July 2, 2012 as investors are concerned of a possible weakening oil demand. The dollar, meanwhile, held steady with investors reluctant to do much as they wait for fresh guidance on interest rates from the Fed. Precious metal gold continued to trade near an eight-month low of USD 1235 dollars per ounce.
Back home, August trade deficit dropped to USD 10.8 billion- the lowest level in four months.  Export growth remains tepid as imports rise thanks to a 175 percent surge in gold imports.
The tax registers are ringing once again as the top 15 companies reported a 19 percent surge in advance tax payments. Banks, pharmaceutical and information technology (IT) companies took the lead. Auto companies, however, were among the laggers.

Five Slain Innocents Mourned at Prayer Vigilfive slain innocents mourned at prayer vigil
House Republicans back Syrian rebeltrainingThe US President said that in an important second step he ensured protection of American personnel, embassies and consulates. (AP Photo)
Associated Press | Washington | Posted: September 16, 2014 9:16 am
U.S. lawmakers raced Monday to authorize an expanded mission to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels before heading back to the campaign trail, with House Republicans preparing legislation backing a central plank of President Barack Obama’s strategy against the Islamic State group.
The Obama administration says the training operation is needed to establish credible, local ground forces to accompany U.S. air strikes against the militants who have conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria, beheaded two American journalists and become a top U.S. terrorism threat in the region and beyond. The House and Senate are both on a tight schedule, looking to wrap up work Friday before an almost two-month recess in preparation for November’s elections.
The authorization under consideration will likely be included as an amendment to a spending bill Congress must pass to keep the government open until mid-December. That would give lawmakers the opportunity to hold a separate debate and vote on the matter _ something members of both parties want.
The measure doesn’t authorize U.S. combat troops in Iraq or Syria or explicitly ban them, reflecting a congressional divide between hawks seeking tougher action than that proposed by Obama and lawmakers weary from more than a decade of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also compels the Pentagon to present Congress with a plan 15 days before any training begins, according to a House Armed Services Committee aide, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about ongoing deliberations and demanded anonymity.
Democrats are reviewing the proposal, which would enable the military to take over what has previously been a limited, covert operation to beef up rebels battling extremist groups and President Bashar Assad’s army. The administration isn’t likely to protest the conditions. It has sent more than 1,000 troops to Iraq to provide military assistance and bolster security of U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel. But Obama, too, opposes any U.S. ground offensive.
Republicans were to gather for internal talks Tuesday morning. A House vote could be held as early as Wednesday, by which time lawmakers will have had opportunities to question the administration’s top national security officials. The House Rules Committee voted late Monday to have six hours of debate on the amendment, once it is taken up. The Senate is expected to follow after a House vote.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel briefs House and Senate committees Tuesday and Thursday, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey also testifying. Secretary of State John Kerry appears before separate panels Wednesday and Thursday.
Obama’s approach to fighting the Islamic State group largely sidesteps Congress. The president isn’t asking for permission to expand strikes in Iraq and target the militants’ operational bases and command structures in Syria, a source of consternation for some Democrats continued…

Chances sub-15% credit growth by FY15-end slim: HDFC08:00 am
With  State Bank of India cutting deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent , could other banks soon follow suit? Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of  HDFC sees more banks cutting deposit rates in the next two months. He believes SBI decided to cut rates on the back of lower-than-expected credit offtake.
According to him, in another quarter or two, credit growth will take off. He says traditionally, credit offtake is highest in the fourth quarter. "I would be surprised to see sub-15 percent credit growth by FY15 end," Mistry told CNBC-TV18.
According to him, if deposit rate across the system is lowered, then HDFC too will have to lower it. However, he was unable to give a timeline for a cut in deposit rates.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Keki Mistry's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We got early morning news from State Bank of India (SBI) that they have dropped their big bucket of deposit their one-three year deposit rates by a quarter percentage point, is this the first sign that rates are headed lower?
A: Inflation numbers clearly have come down. So with inflation numbers coming down and the credit off take probably not being as quick as or as fast as expected, they have cut down deposit rates. So yes, I think the expectation would be fair that over the next month or two we could see a few more rate cuts in the system on deposits. However, it’s too premature to say that this a long-term thing because my sense is that as the sentiments in India had got so much better in the last four or five months, it is only going to be a matter of time may be a quarter or two quarters before we see credit off take begin. When credit off take picks up, maybe some of these banks may again need to look at revising the rates upwards a little bit.
Latha: As a veteran money man how would a banker think? As soon as they cut rates, they usually pass it as lower loan rates as well, lending rates as well?
A: Not necessarily because again when you cut the rate it is only incremental deposits which come in at that lower rate. The existing loan rates don’t get revised downwards till the cycle plays out. So it may not translate into an immediate cut in anyway but over a period of time, if these rates were to prevail and the credit offtake was not to be very sharp then yes, it would translate into cuts in lending rates also.
Sonia: Over a period of time, how much do you think credit growth could pick up to? A banker was telling us earlier that credit growth is extremely sluggish about not even 10-13 percent. How much do you think it could pick up to?
A: I would be surprised if credit growth is lower than 15-16 percent for this year and my sense would be that real offtake in credit tends to pick up in Q4 of the financial year, which is January to March. Historically, if you take the last ten years, most of these ten years will find credit offtake in rupee terms is highest in Q4.
I would think that you will see a similar kind of thing emerging this year. So I would say, the reduction in interest rates on the lending side, one may have to wait a little bit till we get a more clear sense on how much further liquidity RBI is going to inject if any and how the credit offtake pays off in the system.
Latha: Once banks start their rate cutting cycle, do you think they are in a better place than finance companies, which depend on wholesale deposits because wholesale market money is not moving down so much, so do they steal a march over you when this cycle starts?
A: We have also deposits - many of the finance companies also have deposits.
Latha: You will drop the rates there?
A: Obviously, if the deposit rates overall in the banking system are lower, of course we will lower our deposit rates. May not be right away.
Latha: Should we hear from you before the month is out?
A: I don’t know about the month in particular. This is something which we review on a regular basis. So once we feel that there is enough room and that money will be available even at slightly lower rates, we can look at that. I cannot give you a time limit for that.
Sonia: What is the situation on the ground as far as liquidity is concerned? Has liquidity improved considerably such that the banks don’t want to pay higher deposit rates?
A: I would say that banks are sitting on surplus cash because credit offtake is lower, then what is the point of paying higher rates and deposits and continuing to sit on more surplus cash. That is perhaps the reason why the deposit rate cut has been in place. But if credit offtake picks up, which also can happen in the January to March quarter then banks will have to look at the liquidity position and see whether they can continue to get liquidity at those low rates that we are offering in deposits.
SBI stock price
On November 21, 2014, State Bank of India closed at Rs 305.05, up Rs 7.95, or 2.68 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 2977.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 291.05.

1:55 pm Interview: Bajaj Electricals has secured fresh orders worth Rs 518 crore in the Engineering and Projects (E&P) division. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Shekhar Bajaj, CMD of Bajaj Electricals , said the company has received eight orders for rural electrification in the Madhya Pradesh region. The company’s order book stands at Rs 3,178 crore as on September 13, which is at the highest-ever level.
Bajaj said that orders have been coming too fast for the company, hence the management has consciously decided on slowing down on the order intake as it wants to focus more on the execution aspect. Bajaj Electricals is targetting Rs 1,500 crore of revenues in FY15 and may earn Rs 500 crore (revenue) from the E&P project in H1FY15. Bajaj said the company is not participating in any low-margin orders currently.
1:30 pm Market outlook: Mahantesh Sabarad, Deputy Head of Research at SBI Cap Securities says it is unlikely that Nifty will go beyond 8300 in a hurry because the macro triggers are not in place yet to propel the market higher. Would wait for a correction to buy into, he adds. According to him the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year could be just below 6 percent.
Answering a query on pharma sector, he says the house is overweight on the pharma sector. Although the healthcare in US is set to growth only by 4-5 percent in value terms, Indian companies are likely to get much bigger market in the US. The house prefers Dr Reddy's over Cipla because the stock has been a lagging its peers in terms of valuations but has a very strong ANDA pipe lines, says Sabarad.
Amongst midcap stocks, the house is bullish on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 13,150.

Inflation across board still too high to begin easing: Rajan
By PTI Sep 15 2014 , Mumbai
Tags: News
Stating that it is not just food prices that are persistently high but even those of other items which remain elevated, Reserve Bank governor Raghuram Rajan today said prices across the board have to come down to enable him to reduce key rates.
"Inflation is high not only in food, but also in non-food items and the best solution for the country is to bring it down. Then I can cut interest rates," Rajan told bankers at a summit organised by industry body Ficci here.
"I have no desire to keep interest rates high for even a second longer. I want to bring down interest rates when it is feasible and that would be when we have won the fight against inflation," he said.
"There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation pick-up again," Rajan said, adding that right now he thinks the central bank is continuing the way it proposed recently.
Taking a dig at the industry for its persistent demand to cut lending rates even when there is a price increase in the sector, the Governor asked them to bring down prices.
"When you do that then we will do that, we have no problem. Clearly you will have no consensus on this," he said.
The August wholesale price inflation sharply declined to a near five-year low of 3.74 per cent on declining prices of vegetables and other food articles from 5.19 per cent in July and 6.99 per cent in August 2013.
However, the consumer price inflation which the RBI has adopted as a monetary policy gauge, still remains high. For August, it inched down marginally to 7.8 per cent from 7.96 per cent a month earlier.
The RBI is targeting retail inflation of eight per cent by January next year and six per cent by January 2016.

Gold  silver prices rebound on global cuesGold, silver prices rebound on global cues

Snapping its three-day losing streak, gold staged a comeback to close higher by Rs 80 to Rs 27,450 per ten gram in the national capital on Monday amid a firming trend overseas.
Besides, buying at prevailing levels by jewellers also supported the upside.
Silver followed suit and recovered by Rs 250 to Rs 41,500 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said sentiments turned better after gold recovered from an eight-month low in global markets on speculation that reduced prices may spur purchases before the Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, rose by 0.4 per cent to $1,235.07 an ounce and silver traded a shade higher at $18.64 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity was up by Rs 80 each to Rs 27,450 and Rs 27,250 per ten gram, respectively. It had lost Rs 430 in the previous three sessions.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 24,400 per piece of eight gram in limited deals.
In a similar fashion, silver ready recovered by Rs 250 to Rs 41,500 per kg and weekly based delivery by Rs 150 to Rs 41,450 per kg, after losing Rs 920 in last three days.

Bangalore: US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has handed out promotions and salary hikes to its senior management team at a time when the New Jersey-based company is struggling to match its high growth rates of the past five years and starting to see some top-level exits.
In an email sent out to senior employees earlier this week, Cognizant handed out what was its second round of promotions and hikes this year. The first tranche of bonuses and hikes was announced in the first week of July for employees up to managerial levels.
All the hikes and promotions have been made effective from 1 July, a Cognizant spokesperson said.
“The average salary hike for offshore associates is around 10%. Those who are exceptional performers and have niche skills that are in high demand will get more than 10%,” Cognizant said in an email.
Onsite employees, who oversee software development projects at client locations, have been given single-digit hikes, Cognizant said.
“We do not disclose the number of promotions. We remain confident in our long-term prospects. We have promoted around a third of our programmer analysts to ensure that our people grow with the company. At higher grades, promotions are anchored around performance, potential and consistency,” said Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India.
Since Cognizant just about met its revenue growth target in 2013, all its top-level managers will be eligible for 85% of their total bonus payouts. In a regulatory filing earlier this year, Cognizant had said chief executive Francisco D’Souza and other top employees would receive 85% of their payouts if the company met revenue targets.
Cognizant’s average salary hikes compare favourably against those given by peers such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. While Infosys gave hikes of about 6-7% to offsite employees and about 1-2% to onsite employees, Wipro hiked pay by 6-8% for offsite and 2-3% for onsite employees.
“This year’s salary revisions are designed to be market competitive, differentiate niche and critical talent, and reward high performance. Our salary increments are at the higher end of the industry range,” Cognizant said in the email.
The salary increments and promotions for senior employees come weeks after Cognizant warned of the slowest revenue growth in its 20-year history. On 6 August, Cognizant cut its guidance for the third time in the past six years and said revenue would grow by 14%, instead of the 16.5% it had forecast earlier in the year.
The guidance cut surprised investors, who pulled down shares of Cognizant and those of other rivals such as Infosys and Wipro and are now paring down their expectations from the software services sector for this year. Industry lobby Nasscom has forecast software export revenues to grow by 13-15% during the 2014-15 fiscal year.
Cognizant also has seen some top exits during this year, including those of former innovation head Sukumar Rajagopal and social, mobility, analytics and cloud computing head Mahesh Venkateswaran, who used to report directly to chief executive D’Souza.

Inflation dips to 5-year low of 3.7 per cent13

New Delhi: Softening prices of food items, including vegetables, pulled down the WPI inflation to five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, but it may not bring relief to the industry as the RBI is insisting that "there is no point in cutting interest rates" to see prices go up again.
The August inflation, measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined from 5.19 per cent in July, while the same was 6.99 per cent in the same month last year. The August WPI inflation is the lowest since October, 2009 when it stood at 1.8 per cent.
According to the official data released on Monday, inflation in the food segment saw a significant decline to 5.15 per cent in August from 8.43 per cent in July.
The August inflation, measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined from 5.19 per cent in July, while the same was 6.99 per cent in the same month last year.

Vegetable prices contracted 4.88 per cent in August, registering the third continuous month of decline. Onion prices were down by 44.7 per cent.
Potato prices, however, were on the rise as inflation in the kitchen essential jumped to 61.61 per cent in August from 46.41 per cent in July.
With WPI inflation coming down to five-year low level, India Inc has raised the pitch for lowering of the interest rate to boost industrial output that slipped to four month low of 0.5 per cent in July.
Speaking at a function in Mumbai, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, however, said prices across the board have to come down to enable the central bank to cut key rates. "There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation picking up again," he said, adding that right now he thinks the RBI is continuing the way it proposed recently.
The RBI is targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by January next year and six per cent by January, 2016.
The retail inflation, measured on Consumer Price Index, (CPI) had also eased to 7.8 per cent in August compared to 7.96 per cent in July.

Raghuram Rajan bats for more freedom to state-run banks6
0
Mumbai: Batting for greater autonomy to state-run lenders, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that the government should look at them as truly "independent entities" that take their own commercial decisions and not as an extended arm of the administration.
He also said that while it was fine for the government to involve banks to further the social sector agenda, it should ensure that such schemes should be financially feasible for the lenders. "You cannot get a mandate and cannot fund it. After all, public sector banks also have private shareholders and are not any longer an extension of the government. They should be seen as independent entities," Rajan said, addressing bankers at an annual industry conference.
"By all means, the public sector banks are there to undertake social actions when necessary but those mandates should be backed by financial gains," he said. RBI is working with the government on issues regarding the governance at central banks, Rajan said, adding: "We are in constant dialogue with the government, we are discussing these issues on governance improvement, etc and let us see how much progress the government and the RBI make".
RBI is working with the government on issues regarding the governance at central banks, Rajan said.

He further said that RBI has forwarded the recommendations of the PJ Nayak committee on corporate governance to the government for necessary action. The panel called for radical changes in the functioning of banks, including those within the top management and running of boards.
Some of its major suggestion are splitting the position of chairman and managing directors of the PSBs, giving longer fixed terms to the top management, paying them market prices as remunerations and having a transparent, merit-based system of appointments on the boards. "We have to change the appointment process and expand the talent pool for management and boards of public sector banks, it has to be much more transparent and driven by people with strong capabilities. We have to strengthen board oversight and powers, boards have to be empowered and made more accountable," Rajan said.
The comments come amidst a slew of scandals plaguing PSBs involving top management. Last month, the CBI had arrested Syndicate Bank CMD SK Jain for allegedly receiving a bribe of Rs 50 lakh from Bhushan Steel to enhance the steel firm's credit limits.

Sebi eases corporate governance normsSebi eases governance norms, extends woman director deadline
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 21:06 IST
To ease process of implementing stronger corporate governance norms by listed firms, regulator Sebi on Monday eased various provisions of the new law, especially for smaller companies, and extended the deadline for appointing at least one woman director to April 1, 2015.
Changes have been made to the new regulatory regime, which would come into effect from next month, following numerous representations received by the regulator with regard to these regulations that would vastly change the way listed companies function and are regulated in the country.
While amendments have been made to various provisions of this Corporate Governance Code to align them with the relevant sections of the new Companies Act, the deadline would remain unchanged at October 1, 2014, except for requirement of a minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies.
The listed companies would have time till April 1 next year to comply with the woman director-related provision.
Sebi has also exempted smaller companies-those having equity share capital of up to Rs 10 crore and networth not exceeding Rs 25 crore, as also listed on SME platforms of the stock exchanges-from the mandatory compliance to the new Code "for the time being".
Among others, the proposed regulations related to tenure of independent directors, as also the definition and exemption from mandatory prior approval for certain related party transactions, have also been amended to align them with the Companies Act.
Announcing the changes, Sebi said it has "received representations from market participants including companies and industry associations, highlighting certain practical difficulties in ensuring compliance, seeking clarifications on interpretation of certain provisions and suggesting various options to ease the process of implementation."
These issues were examined and discussed in the Primary Market Advisory Committee of Sebi and "in order to address the above mentioned concerns and facilitate the listed companies to ensure compliance with the provisions of the revised Clause 49 (which deals with the Corporate Governance norms at listed companies), it has been decided to make certain amendments to Clause 49," the regulator said.
The new corporate governance norms were proposed after detailed discussions by Sebi and with concerned stakeholders for over a year and had prescribed stronger regulations for listed companies than those prescribed under the Companies Act for general classes of companies.
Since implementation of the new Companies Act with effect from April 1, 2014, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued various circulars on matters related to Corporate Governance clarifying certain provisions of the new law.
These include clarification on rules relating to appointment and qualification of directors and independent directors, matters relating to related party transactions, and the rules governing meetings of board and its powers.
These amendments and clarifications have been taken into account by Sebi also to make necessary changes in the new norms. Besides, Sebi had also sought earlier this year the status of preparedness of top 500 listed companies by market capitalization for ensuring timely compliance with the new corporate governance norms.
According to the new norms, related party transactions entered into between two government companies and between a holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary would not be applicable for prior approval from audit committee.
Moreover, Sebi has allowed an audit committee to "grant omnibus approval" for related party transactions proposed to be entered into by the company subject to certain conditions.
For the same the audit committee would have to lay down the criteria "for granting the omnibus approval in line with the policy on related party transactions of the company and such approval shall be applicable in respect of transactions which are repetitive in nature".
Among others, the committee would also have to satisfy itself the need for such omnibus approval and that whether such approval is in the interest of the company and would have review atleast every quarter the details of transactions entered pursuant to the approval.
On modifications with regard to tenure of independent director, Sebi said that "the maximum tenure of independent directors shall be in accordance with the Companies Act, 2013 and clarifications/ circulars issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in this regard, from time to time."
Under the Act, an independent director can have a maximum of two tenures of five consecutive years (a total of ten years), with a cooling off period of three years.
Other than this, the watchdog has said that the terms and conditions of appointment of the independent directors have to be placed on the website of the company as against the earlier norms that required firms to disclose the letter of appointment along with the detailed profile of the director.
Besides, it has also asked the firms to disclose the details of "familiarisation programmes" for independent directors and policy on dealing with related party transactions not only in the company's annual report but also their respective website and a web link.
Additionally, Sebi has brought in norms that allow the chairperson of the company to be appointed in the nomination and remuneration committee. However, the chairperson is not permitted to chair such a committee.
Sebi also noted that the risk management committee would be constituted by the firm "through its board of directors".
"The majority of Committee shall consist of members of the Board of Directors" and "Senior executives of the company may be members of the said Committee but the Chairman of the Committee shall be a member of the Board of Directors," Sebi said.
For norms on subsidiary companies, the market regulator has said that a company can dispose of shares in its material subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting in cases "where such divestment is made under a scheme of arrangement duly approved by a Court/Tribunal."
"Selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20 percent of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by way of special resolution, unless the sale/disposal/lease is made under a scheme of arrangement duly approved by a Court/Tribunal," Sebi added.
Moreover, the norms would require companies to "formulate a policy for determining 'material' subsidiaries and such policy shall be disclosed to stock exchanges and in the annual report".
Meanwhile, the market regulator has done away with norms that require disclosure related to resignation of directors, disclosure of formal letter of appointment of independent director and certain disclosures like details of establishment of vigil mechanism in the annual report.

MCX-SX gets conditional 1-year renewal; Sebi seeks biz plan
Besides, the exchange would not be allowed to introduce any new contract till it meets minimum networth requirement of Rs 100 crore, for which it has been given three-months time.
Post your opinion here
 
As crisis at its erstwhile promoter group continues to cast a shadow,  MCX Stock Exchange today got a one-year conditional renewal to function as a bourse and regulator Sebi asked it to submit a long-term sustainable business plan and take other remedial actions. Besides, the exchange would not be allowed to introduce any new contract till it meets minimum networth requirement of Rs 100 crore, for which it has been given three-months time.
The current recognition of MCX-SX, which was set up by Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies group, expired today, but Sebi has now decided to extend it for a period of one year, commencing tomorrow and ending on September 15, 2015.
The renewal is subject to five specific conditions and compliance to other conditions specified by Sebi from time to time, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a statement.
"The exchange shall  build its networth (undisputed) to the level as prescribed in Sebi (SECC) Regulations 2012 within a period of three months from the date of renewal of recognition. Further, the exchange shall also submit a business plan to satisfy the regulator about the long term sustainability of the exchange," the regulator said.
While the exchange has been claiming to have a networth of Rs 100 crore, the regulator does not share the same view and pegs the figure at about Rs 56 crore, sources said. Sebi further said that MCX-SX "shall not introduce any new contracts till fulfilment of networth requirement" and it would have to comply with Sebi's directions with regard to entities which have been declared not 'fit and proper' person.
The regulator also asked the exchange to "take immediate steps to rectify the deficiencies pointed out in the systems audit as well as special audit." Besides, the exchange will have to take necessary steps for compliance with shareholding requirement by all the shareholders as per SEBI (SECC) Regulations 2012, Sebi said.
Earlier in March this year, Sebi ruled that Financial Technologies group was not "fit and proper" to own stakes in any stock exchange and directed it to divest existing holdings in MCX-SX and four other entities.
This order followed Shah-led group coming under scanner of various agencies, including CBI, for alleged irregularities in the grant of license to MCX-SX, as also for the payment crisis worth thousands of crores at National Spot Exchange (NSEL), also set up by the same group.
While FTIL group has challenged the Sebi order on their 'fit and proper status', they no more qualify as 'promoter' in MCX-SX and some other entities such as Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).
Last year also, while granting a one-year renewal to MCX-SX, Sebi had asked the exchange to strengthen its governance structure to continue remaining a recognized bourse. Sources said that it might be difficult for MCX-SX to meet some of the conditions set by Sebi for the latest renewal.
The bourse earned total revenue from operations of Rs 91.83 crore for the latest fiscal 2013-14, down from Rs 155.23 crore in the previous year.
It incurred a loss of Rs 154.53 crore for the last year, as against a profit of Rs 21.42 crore in 2012-13. The exchange has attributed the loss to commencement of new segments and fall in volumes in the currency derivatives segment.
"The sentimental fallout of the defaults in another Exchange floated by the erstwhile promoter and introduction of zero pricing by competitor among other events leading to negative publicity also contributed to the fall in volumes," MCX-SX said in its annual report.
"With the management and Board level changes as well as relaxations in the regulatory regime for CD Segment, your Directors feel the company would be able to see better volumes in the CD segment and consequently improve its financial performance in the coming years," it informed its investors.
MCX-SX was notified a 'recognised stock exchange' on December 21, 2012. Its shareholders include top public sector banks, private sector banks and domestic financial institutions who, together hold over 88 per cent stake. It offers trading in Capital Market, Futures & Options, Currency Derivatives and Debt Market segments. It has also received in-principle approval from Sebi for operationalizing SME trading platform.
It commenced operations in the Currency Derivatives Segment on October 7, 2008. It launched Capital Market Segment, Futures and Options Segment and flagship index 'SX40' on February 9, 2013 and commenced trading from February 11, 2013.
The Debt Market Segment was launched on June 7, 2013, and trading commenced from June 10, 2013. The Exchange started live trading in cash-settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF), on 10-year Government of India security, in its Currency Derivative Segment from January 20, 2014.
MCX-SX had first got a license from Sebi to operate as a stock exchange in September 2012 and this permit was to expire on September 15, 2013, before getting extended by a year.
The bourse began operations in February 2013. However, the trading volumes of the exchange has been quite low as compared to rivals BSE and NSE, while problems at group entity NSEL in July 2013 further worsened the situation.
While Sebi has decided to renew its license twice now, the regulator has been asking MCX-SX to work towards strengthening its governance practices and comply with all applicable regulations to operate as a stock exchange. Sebi also previously warned that the licence can be withdrawn in case of any non-compliance to its directions.

RSS leaders murder puts CPI(M) in a spot  againRSS leader’s murder puts CPI(M) in a spot, again
KPM Basheer
Tweet
Kochi, September 15:  
The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which suffered a huge popularity setback in Kerala following the May 2012 murder of TP Chandrasekharan, has now landed itself in another crisis after the murder of an RSS leader in Kannur district a fortnight ago.
E Manoj, the district head of the RSS’ physical training wing, was killed by a gang on September 1. Manoj was a key suspect in the 1999 attack on P Jayarajan, CPI(M)’s current Kannur district secretary and the murder is generally believed to be an act of revenge. The RSS enforced a State-wide hartal the following day. A CPI(M) man, Vikramana, has been arrested. The CBI will soon take over the probe.
Manoj’s murder has caused concern that Kannur is in for another round of violence and counter-violence between the cadres of the RSS and CPI(M). For a quarter century since the early 1980s, scores of lives have been lost in Kannur in the clashes between the CPI(M) and RSS-BJP.
A few months ago, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, hundreds of disenchanted BJP men crossed over to the CPI(M) at a public function, causing alarm in the BJP-RSS. After its spectacular victory in the Lok Sabha elections (though not in Kerala), the BJP retaliated by luring hundreds of CPI(M) cadre into its fold across the State.

National parties cannot guarantee welfare: CMNational parties cannot guarantee welfare: CM

Coimbatore, September 15:  
National parties could not focus on the welfare of the people within municipal corporations, AIADMK supremo and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa stated here. She pointed out that no good would be done by electing a non-AIADMK candidate as the mayor of Coimbatore when more than 80 per cent of the councillors in Coimbatore Corporation belonged to AIADMK, she said.
Speaking at an election meeting in support of party candidate P Rajkumar for the Coimbatore mayoral poll, she said people here would not get any benefit by voting for candidates of national parties or for independents in the fray. She said generally, the focus of the national parties was around Delhi and the Central Government and not on the State. She said when national parties did not even think about Tamil Nadu, how would they think about people of Coimbatore.
‘Joint family’
The Chief Minister said ‘India is like a joint-family’ that could be ruled by a single party. But there were smaller families like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andra Pradesh and Telengana. It will be only the heads of families of these sub-families who would be interested in their welfare and not the head of the joint family, she said.
She asserted that it was only AIADMK that was interested in the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu alone.
She said the CPI(M) too, which has put up a mayoral candidate in Coimbatore, had on the Mullaiperiyar dam issue took different stand in Kerala and Tamil Nadu while its Central leadership chose to be silent.
The Chief Minister also detailed welfare measures taken up by her Government and infrastructure projects under implementation/announced for Coimbatore and sought people’s mandate for the AIADMK candidate.

Stop what youre doing and look at this cowdogBy Elahe Izadi September 15 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Oh, I’m sorry, are you having trouble figuring out the meaning of the existence we lead on the  tiny pale blue dot of an Earth where we reside? Here’s a dog dressed as a sheriff to make you feel better about it!
Look out. There’s a new sheriff in town. (Mindy Schauer/Orange County Register via Associated Press)
It worked, didn’t it?
This is Sake Sue, a therapy dog. Her owner, Colleen Rahn, dressed her up for a Walk for the Animals event Sunday in Huntington Beach, Calif., sponsored by the Orange County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. According to the Associated Press, “the theme was cowdog” and “she’s furry and very sweet.”
We’re not sure why this dog would wear anything other than this costume at all times.
Cowdog would make for an excellent Halloween costume: Go dressed up as a dog dressed up as a cowboy (you’d be at least one of two such cowdogs). Or, if you want draw inspiration from some troubling gender norms that have developed in recent years, go as a sexy cowdog.
Other notable cowdogs in American history include Huckleberry Hound’s brief stint in law enforcement and Hank the Cowdog , a character in a children’s book series. You can also eat cowdogs . (Don’t worry, they aren’t made of real dogs.)

Growing digitisation to replace cash use  says BCGGrowing digitisation to replace cash use, says BCG
Nupur Anand | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:47 AM IST
With customers increasingly opting for the electronic mode for transactions, a recent study by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) says much of the cash in circulation is likely to be replaced by digital transactions.
The report said in 2012-13, about 29 per cent of the number of transactions in the banking system was cash-driven and 22 per cent was by cheque. In 2013-14, the number of cash transactions had already come down to 26 per cent and cheque transactions to 19 per cent.
“Paper money, that has dominated transactions for centuries, could be on its way out. We see the warning to cash. There is a clear possibility of 30-40 per cent substitution of cash in circulation in India with digital transactions,” said the report.
Banks have been working at making their branches and back-end functions more digital. Experts believe this will boost productivity and that proper use of technology can be an important factor in trimming the rise in bad loans the sector has been battling with.
“By digitising processes end-to-end, engaging customers on the digital channel for sales and transactions, and collectively working towards eradication of cash, banks can achieve up to a 30 per cent jump in sales productivity, reduce administrative staff by 10-15 per cent and improve back-office staff productivity by 20 per cent,” added the report.
ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private lender, said lower use of cash would improve its cost to income ratio.
“For instance, we introduced tablet banking and it helped us by giving a much larger share in current account and savings account deposits, by improving the overall efficiency and productivity,” said Chanda Kochhar, managing director (MD).
Apart from making the process of customer acquisition more cost–effective, improving the technology has also helped in risk management, believe bankers, by making the process more standardised.“With the use of technology, we can minimise the error rate and it can also lead to better risk control and fraud management,” said Shikha Sharma, MD of Axis Bank.
BCG believes banks that have strong control over the payments system will be more successful in the process of digitisation. This is because most of the payments growth is likely to be on the digital channel, such as internet, mobile, points of sale, electronic clearance, etc. Going ahead, these channels are expected to serve specialised purposes and the global consulting firm sees it as a "tectonic paradigm shift".
Banks believe that apart from making the transaction process more digital, even customer acquisition and cross-selling can be done through this medium.
“We are always looking at engaging more on this medium. The challenge is not only technology but content management. One needs to continuously innovate,” said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, State Bank of India.
Foreign lenders, which can only open a restricted number of bank branches, believe digitisation has helped them bridge the gap with other lenders. “With less number of branches, taking the digital route is a survival issue for us. To reach out to more people and to improve the customer acquisition process, we have had to do so,” said Pramit Jhaveri, chief executive here of Citibank.
The report says the competitiveness of public sector banks (PSBs) could decline further decline, unless concerns such as talent constraints and overarching control in decision making is addressed. "The smaller PSBs are at a particular risk of rapid decline, given their poor investment in transformation. They lag significantly on virtually every dimension of digital preparedness. In our view, this should be a primary consideration in the blueprint for consolidation of PSBs in India," stated the report.

After Android One  Google to bring offline YouTube for India: Pichai | InterviewIndia to be test bed for Google's new initiatives
By Pankaj Mishra & Jayadevan PK, ET Bureau | 16 Sep, 2014, 07.01AM IST
Google Senior V-P Sundar Pichai says India is a key market and the Android One launch heralds the start of many more initiatives here.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India will be the proving ground for many new initiatives by Google, the company's highest-profile Indian-origin executive said, highlighting the Internet giant's commitment to one of the world's biggest markets for technology.
On Monday, the Chennai-born Sundar Pichai launched cut-rate smartphones based on Google's Android One program tailored for India and likened the opportunities in this country to China, the world's second-largest economy.
"Like we are doing with Android One, we would want to do more such things India-specific. Just because of the scale and scope of the market," said Pichai, 42, a senior V-P who oversees the Chrome browser and apps. "You have seen what is happening in China, and you have seen how much investment has happened. I expect the same to happen for India and I expect Google to do the same."
At present, India contributes only a tiny fraction ($330 million) of Google's $55-billion revenue, but the country is all the more important because of the company's struggles in China. The USbased company has a minuscule share of the search engine market in the Middle Kingdom, and while its Android mobile operating system is popular, most apps are downloaded through third-party stores. "Soon we will be in that phase where it (India) is not just potential but a big market," said Pichai, pointing to the country's 500 million Internet users. "It is a big bet from our side. I think the thing that will really tip over is when I look at the numbers."
As an example of an India-specific initiative, Pichai, who reports to CEO and cofounder Larry Page, cited the launch of a service to make YouTube work even when there is no Internet connectivity. Pichai, who studied at IIT-Kharagpur, Stanford University and The Wharton School, began his career at Google in 2004.
He was the driving force behind Chrome, the browser which eventually became one of Google's most successful products. He then set out to build a whole ecosystem around Chrome — including Chromebooks (laptops running Chrome operating system) and applications that run on Chrome.
In many markets, including India, Google has faced tough questions from regulators on issues such as privacy, taxation and alleged anti-competitive practices. Pichai defended the company against criticism, saying it is not uncommon for a large company to face such scrutiny. All the same, "We never ever forget that we exist and do well because users trust us," he remarked.

The Marijuana ShowBy Elahe Izadi September 15 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Wild marijuana (AP Photo/South Bend Tribune, Robert Franklin)
Nearly every industry has a reality show dedicated to it.  Shipping stuff? Yes . Dog whispering? Check . Bounty hunters named Dog? Of course . Now, prospective legal marijuana tycoons can get in on the action.
As  Fox 31 Denver reported , 200 people showed up Saturday in Denver to audition for a new, Web-based marijuana reality show named “The Marijuana Show.” (No pot puns here, folks.)
Here’s how it works: People pitch their marijuana business ideas to investors, who will back projects by investing $25,000 to $1 million or more, co-creator Wendy Robbins told the Fox affiliate.
In their online pitch, show co-creators Karen Paull and Robbins  describe their project as “The Shark Tank” meets “The Apprentice,” but emphasize it’ll be more like a dolphin tank rather than shark tank. They also have a higher vision in mind: to combat negative connotations around marijuana use. “It’s really an important and potent herb and medicine and it needs to be legal,” Robbins told Fox 31. “That’s why we are doing this.”
“We’re the puff the magic dragon of reality pitch shows. Basically, we don’t wanna be rude,” Robbins told 303 Magazine . “It’s really about educating, and us getting educated too, the world about the whole industry.”
On Saturday, people pitched ideas to a panel, which will then choose six winners to head to a boot camp in New Mexico. From there, the contestants will prepare for October, when they will pitch investors back in Denver, the Fox affiliate reported. Audition pitches ranged from movie projects to a woman who wants to use cannabis in her flower shop designs, and the show will air online in November,  CNN reported .
Colorado voters approved recreational marijuana use in 2012, and since then, the legal marijuana industry across the country has been booming; as The New York Times pointed out , the legal industry is expected to grow to $2.6 billion this year, per marijuana research firm ArcView Group.

Explained: A vote and a union in troubleAlex Salmond (Scotland First Minister, face of ‘Yes’ campaign) and Aalistair Darling (Labour mp, face of ‘Better Together’ campaign)
Written by Aleesha Matharu | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:42 am
What is Scotland voting for? How did it come about?
On September 18, 4.1 million people living in Scotland will vote to answer the question: “Should Scotland be an independent country?”. The result will be determined by a simple majority vote, and is expected to be announced on September 19. British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to a referendum a couple of years ago when he and Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, who is also the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), signed the Edinburgh Agreement that set in motion plans for the vote.
Why do Scots want independence?
In 2011, the pro-independence Scottish National Party won the 2011 Scottish Parliament election by a landslide. The Salmon-led government believes independence would make Scotland one of the world’s richest countries, thanks to its oil wealth. According to him, the Scots should be set free of the “shackles” of a London-based UK parliament.
Who are the main faces?
The official campaigns are ‘Yes Scotland’ (with party support from SNP and Scottish Greens) and the unionist ‘Better Together’ (supported by Labour, Liberal Democrats, and Conservatives). Salmond has been the primary face of the ‘Yes’ campaign, while Alistair Darling, Labour MP and former chancellor of the exchequer, has headed ‘Better Together’.
What powers does the current Scottish government have?
The Scottish Parliament came into existence in 1999, following a “yes” vote in a referendum on “devolving” some powers to a Scottish elected body. The Parliament was initially controlled by the Scottish Labour Party, but since 2007, SNP has held most of the seats. Under the terms of the Scotland Act of 1998, the Scottish government can pursue its own policies in a broad range of areas, including education, health, agriculture and environment. But the Parliament at Westminster controls foreign policy, defence, immigration, most government benefits, corporate regulation, and energy. It also sets most of the tax rates for the UK as a whole.
Will a ‘yes’ vote mean Scotland becomes a country straightaway?
No. There is still a lot of ground to cover. There will be 18 months of negotiation on a range of issues: currency, division of assets and liabilities, borders, movement of people, EU membership, and the distribution of welfare agreements. A declaration of independence would take place on March 24, 2016 (chosen because it was exactly 309 years to this date that the union was signed). An election would follow in May. Until then, current laws will stay.
What happens if people vote ‘no’?
The SNP will remain in office in Edinburgh until the Scottish parliamentary elections in May 2016. All three Westminster parties have promised more devolution to Scotland. But Queen Elizabeth II will still be head of state.
Would independent Scotland be part of the European Union?
There isn’t continued…

Why investors should say no to Mallya & MarutiWhy investors should say no to United Spirits and Maruti Suzuki

(Vijay Mallya is chairman…)
By Sriram Ramakrishna
A few weeks from now, two companies, as different from each other as chalk and cheese, will hold shareholder meetings in order to take crucial decisions.
United Spirits , London-based Diageo's Indian outfit, has called shareholders on September 30 to approve annual accounts, while Maruti's meet will be all about getting minority shareholder okay for related-party transactions involving parent Suzuki.
The second is an old dispute which first reared its head in January when Maruti made a shock announcement that its forthcoming Gujarat factory will be built by Suzuki and not by the company.
The move triggered protests from institutional investors who questioned why Maruti, the listed entity, is not capable of handling the investment and expressed fears of higher royalty and lower transfer pricing of cars which would affect the Indian listed company's revenues.
The first is a recent development and comes from the decision of United Bank of India to declare Vijay Mallya, the chairman of the UB Group, as wilful defaulter. Mallya is also chairman of United Spirits.
RBI rules say that any company whose promoter or director is a wilful defaulter cannot get bank funding. Sebi is expected to soon issue guidelines saying that a wilful defaulter cannot be allowed to raise equity.
But Mallya has offered himself for reappointment as director, according to the USL notice, putting Diageo and USL shareholders in a delicate situation. USL shareholders trooping into Bangalore on September 30 need to keep one crucial issue in their minds. Mallya may have built USL into a world beater in the alcohol business and delivered stellar returns for long-time investors by selling to Diageo.
In normal circumstances, shareholders would have given him a standing ovation. But these are not normal circumstances and the wilful defaulter tag now carries with it reputational and business risk. If banks cannot lend money and capital markets shut the firm out, how will USL grow? If more banks follow UBI's lead, what will be the damage to USL's reputation?
Mallya is chairman of USL but holds very little stake in the firm. Ideally, he should have resigned and since that has not happened, shareholders should bite the bullet and send a strong message. They may not be able to vote him out if Diageo, the main shareholder, supports him. But they should vote in bulk and tell the world they care about the issue.
Maruti is more a complex issue. But nine months after they first proposed the move, the Maruti management has still not fully convinced investors about the correctness of its move. The explanation that Maruti will be able to conserve cash and insulate itself against risk does not wash.
Maruti is not a babe in the woods. It is a high quality car manufacturer which has time and again showed itself capable to besting competition and emerging on top.
Why does it need to conserve cash? Why does it need to play safe? Unless shareholders get a clear, satisfactory answer, they should say no to Maruti.

HUL, Everstone in talks to jointly run Modern Foods

(The move by Everstone Capital,…)
MUMBAI:India's largest soaps and detergent maker Hindustan Unilever has begun talks with private equity fund Everstone Capital for a possible equity joint venture for its Modern Foods division which makes bread and rusks under the Modern brand, three people involved with the plan said.
The move by the private equity fund, which jointly owns the India franchise of the American Hamburger restaurant chain Burger King, is to drive synergy from Modern Foods for the quick-service restaurant chain, these people added.
"HUL wants to partner with Burger King and has approached the India franchise for a possible equity partnership," a person with direct knowledge of the development said. "Depending on how the talks progress, a complete sellout can't be ruled out." An Everstone spokesperson did not respond to an emailed questionnaire from ET.
Last year, Everstone Capital, that manages more than $1 billion in Indiafocused PE fund, won the India franchise Burger King as part of its plan to invest in the Indian consumption space. The fund will soon open its first outlets in Mumbai and Delhi NCR and slowly grow the network to the Tier-II and -III cities where its rivals, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Dominos and Yum brands have already established their presence in the $48-billion industry.
"The deal values the bakery business anywhere between Rs 200 crore and Rs 250 crore," an investment banker with knowledge of the development said. "As a policy, we do not comment on future business plans and hence have no comments to offer for your query on future growth plans of Modern Foods," an HUL spokesperson wrote in an email.
HUL's bakery business sells variants of white, brown, milk and whole grain breads along with cream rolls, fruit breads, buns, cakes, cookies and rusks. The 42-year-old brand commands more than 45% of the market share. "Partnering with a large Indiafocused private equity fund will help the bakery business expand and increase its market share further," a third person involved in the deal said.
  Burger King, which is betting big on the fast growing restaurant market where every two out of three people eat out once a week, believes that having its own bakery unit will be cost-effective in the long run. According to a 2013 report by Technopak Advisors, the Indian food service market was estimated to be $48 billion in 2013. Quickservice restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Domino's accounts for around $2.5 billion of the market in 2013 and are projected to grow to $8 billion by 2020.
The retailing giant has been looking to divest its stake in the bakery business for some time now. In the past, it had explored various options, including a complete sale to strategic investors. Analysts say that HUL's move is logical.
"It would be logical for HUL to exit the bakery business, given Unilever's portfolio misfit," said Gautam Duggad, vice-president, research (FMCG & Retail), at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. "The stake sale or a complete sell-off would depend on valuations because HUL is not in dire straits to sell or hard-pressed for cash."
Since HUL bought Modern Foods in 2002 from the government under the disinvestment programme, the company had been struggling with the bakery unit as high costs and an unmanageable work force in the lowmargin business made it unviable.
Also, analysts said HUL's food strategy has always been half-baked in India, focusing largely on soups, ice-creams and beverages. "To turn it around calls for innovative strategy and focus, which is completely absent in HUL,'' said an HUL official. "It makes sense to exit the business soon."
HUL officials have in the past admitted that the acquisition was a complete misfit with the HUL culture and systems.

Bypoll results: Counting begins for 3 LS  33 assembly seatsComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered a major blow in a clutch of assembly by-elections on Tuesday, ceding ground even in its traditional strongholds barely four months after its spectacular Lok Sabha victory.

The loss piles pressure on the BJP brass and party president Amit Shah to deliver in crucial assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana next month. It also hands a stronger bargaining chip to its allies, especially the Shiv Sena which is eyeing a larger share of seats and the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra.
The results signal a waning of the BJP’s tide. And while it also confirms that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal may broadly hold nationally, some of his party’s controversial, divisive strategies like the so-called ‘love jihad’ campaign may have backfired, especially in Uttar Pradesh where the elections were fought in the backdrop of shrill right-wing rhetoric.
The BJP’s biggest humiliation came from UP, where it lost seven seats to the Samajwadi Party. It even failed to win the prestigious Rohaniya seat which falls under Modi’s constituency, Varanasi, for its ally Apna Dal.
 
The reverses overshadowed the entry of the BJP’s first member in the West Bengal assembly in 15 years.
“The Modi government’s honeymoon period is over,” Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said. “This is perhaps (the) first government whose anti-incumbency has begun within 100 days of coming to power. Alarm bells are ringing for the BJP. This is a good omen for secular forces that people have started rejecting them.”
The results help the Congress reinforce its position as a credible opposition. It breached the BJP strongholds without much help from its star campaigners, signalling that the party could do well if it groomed state leaders.
Hours after the results were out, Prime Minister Modi told a pre-scheduled party workers’ meeting, “The BJP’s specialty is the sincerity of its workers, their hard work and organisational strength.”
The BJP could retain just 13 of the 23 assembly seats it held earlier. The SP and Congress improved their tally by seven and five seats, respectively. In both Gujarat and Rajasthan, the BJP lost three assembly seats to the Congress. Mulayam Singh Yadav’s SP turned the tables on the BJP to win a surprising eight assembly seats in UP.
“The BJP leaders thought voters were in their pockets. This is an eye-opener for the BJP government,” said Congress’ Rajasthan unit chief Sachin Pilot.
In the BJP camp, there was a call for introspection. “State workers and leaders need to introspect on this,” said union minister Uma Bharti.
“The reasons behind the defeat will be reviewed. It has given us a lesson for the Vidhan Sabha polls,” said UP BJP president Laxmi Kant Bajpai.
By-elections were also held for three Lok Sabha seats — Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, Vadodara in Gujarat, which had been vacated by Modi, and Medak in Telangana.
 
The BJP won the Vadodara seat while the SP won in Mainpuri. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi won the Medak seat. In Vadodara, the winning margin slipped to 3.29 lakh votes from Modi’s 5.7 lakh votes.
The saffron brigade won one assembly seat in Assam. The CPI(M) lost one more seat in West Bengal but won a seat in Tripura.

Chances of sub-15% credit growth by FY15-end slim08:00 am
With  State Bank of India cutting deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent , could other banks soon follow suit? Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of  HDFC sees more banks cutting deposit rates in the next two months. He believes SBI decided to cut rates on the back of lower-than-expected credit offtake.
According to him, in another quarter or two, credit growth will take off. He says traditionally, credit offtake is highest in the fourth quarter. "I would be surprised to see sub-15 percent credit growth by FY15 end," Mistry told CNBC-TV18.
According to him, if deposit rate across the system is lowered, then HDFC too will have to lower it. However, he was unable to give a timeline for a cut in deposit rates.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Keki Mistry's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We got early morning news from State Bank of India (SBI) that they have dropped their big bucket of deposit their one-three year deposit rates by a quarter percentage point, is this the first sign that rates are headed lower?
A: Inflation numbers clearly have come down. So with inflation numbers coming down and the credit off take probably not being as quick as or as fast as expected, they have cut down deposit rates. So yes, I think the expectation would be fair that over the next month or two we could see a few more rate cuts in the system on deposits. However, it’s too premature to say that this a long-term thing because my sense is that as the sentiments in India had got so much better in the last four or five months, it is only going to be a matter of time may be a quarter or two quarters before we see credit off take begin. When credit off take picks up, maybe some of these banks may again need to look at revising the rates upwards a little bit.
Latha: As a veteran money man how would a banker think? As soon as they cut rates, they usually pass it as lower loan rates as well, lending rates as well?
A: Not necessarily because again when you cut the rate it is only incremental deposits which come in at that lower rate. The existing loan rates don’t get revised downwards till the cycle plays out. So it may not translate into an immediate cut in anyway but over a period of time, if these rates were to prevail and the credit offtake was not to be very sharp then yes, it would translate into cuts in lending rates also.
Sonia: Over a period of time, how much do you think credit growth could pick up to? A banker was telling us earlier that credit growth is extremely sluggish about not even 10-13 percent. How much do you think it could pick up to?
A: I would be surprised if credit growth is lower than 15-16 percent for this year and my sense would be that real offtake in credit tends to pick up in Q4 of the financial year, which is January to March. Historically, if you take the last ten years, most of these ten years will find credit offtake in rupee terms is highest in Q4.
I would think that you will see a similar kind of thing emerging this year. So I would say, the reduction in interest rates on the lending side, one may have to wait a little bit till we get a more clear sense on how much further liquidity RBI is going to inject if any and how the credit offtake pays off in the system.
Latha: Once banks start their rate cutting cycle, do you think they are in a better place than finance companies, which depend on wholesale deposits because wholesale market money is not moving down so much, so do they steal a march over you when this cycle starts?
A: We have also deposits - many of the finance companies also have deposits.
Latha: You will drop the rates there?
A: Obviously, if the deposit rates overall in the banking system are lower, of course we will lower our deposit rates. May not be right away.
Latha: Should we hear from you before the month is out?
A: I don’t know about the month in particular. This is something which we review on a regular basis. So once we feel that there is enough room and that money will be available even at slightly lower rates, we can look at that. I cannot give you a time limit for that.
Sonia: What is the situation on the ground as far as liquidity is concerned? Has liquidity improved considerably such that the banks don’t want to pay higher deposit rates?
A: I would say that banks are sitting on surplus cash because credit offtake is lower, then what is the point of paying higher rates and deposits and continuing to sit on more surplus cash. That is perhaps the reason why the deposit rate cut has been in place. But if credit offtake picks up, which also can happen in the January to March quarter then banks will have to look at the liquidity position and see whether they can continue to get liquidity at those low rates that we are offering in deposits.

US warplanes carried out their first air strike on the Islamic State near Baghdad, as world diplomats pledged to support Iraq in its fight against the militants. The United States early last month began air strikes against IS positions in northern Iraq, but Monday’s announcement that the campaign had targeted the jihadists near the Iraqi capital marks an escalation in the scope of the mission.

It comes less than a week after US President Barack Obama, in a primetime television address to the nation, ordered a “relentless” war against the Islamic State, including air strikes in Syria and expanded operations in Iraq to “destroy” the marauding jihadist army.

“US military forces continued to attack ISIL (IS) terrorists in Iraq, employing attack and fighter aircraft to conduct two air strikes Sunday and Monday in support of Iraqi security forces near Sinjar and southwest of Baghdad,” US Central Command said in a statement.
“The air strike southwest of Baghdad was the first strike taken as part of our expanded efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions to hit ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense, as outlined in the president’s speech last Wednesday.”

President Pranab Mukherjee lands in Hanoi on four-day visit
President Pranab Mukherjee arrived here on Sunday for a four-day state visit during which India and Vietnam are expected to sign agreements on oil exploration and air connectivity. The President will also visit the historic city of Ho Chi Minh. The visit marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two nations.
Mr. Mukherjee was received at the Noi Bai International Airport by the Vietnamese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and Chairman of President’s Office Dao Viet Trung and was given a guard of honour.
On Monday, Mr. Mukherjee is scheduled to meet President Truong Tan Sang and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. Ahead of his visit, Mr. Mukherjee said that the key areas of cooperation between the two countries are security and defence.
Key agreements between ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Petro Vietnam for joint oil explorations in the South China Sea blocks are expected to be signed during the visit. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is part of the delegation accompanying the President.
The President’s visit assumes particular significance, as it closely precedes Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Indian visit that starts on September 17. India’s oil exploration in Vietnam has been a point of contention with China and safeguarding the country’s interest amid the Pacific conflicts remains a key strategic challenge for India.
Mr. Mukherjee has brought from India a sapling of the holy ‘bodhi tree’ as a gift.

Here s PM Modi s to-do list during his US visit(Modi has to use data and facts…)
By NR Narayana Murthy
I believe our Prime Minister's visit to the US will be one of his most important foreign trips, if not the most important foreign trip he will make during his tenure as PM. There are several reasons for it.
First, he will have to show that he does not carry any biases from prior transactions. He has already shown that he is a graceful leader even though the US was very discourteous to him when he was the chief minister of Gujarat.
Second, at this stage in India's economic development, we have to build close relations with the US, the No. 1 country in higher education and innovation. The only way we can secure our future is through our focus on becoming increasingly better in higher education, research and innovation. That cannot happen unless we work closely with the US. We have to enhance interactions between students, researchers and academicians of both countries.
Getting Along with No. 1
Third, the US is the only superpower in the world today, with almost nine times our GDP and with a per-capita 33 times ours. The US is also the best example of the power of entrepreneurship enhancing prosperity of its people.
Finally, it is our second-largest trading partner and the largest customer base for our software industry, contributing $40-45 billion to our software exports every year. This figure has to be seen in the context of the recent euphoria in India when Japanese corporations agreed to invest over $35 billion in India over five years.
The software industry has created over 3.2 million jobs, with 2-3 times that number of jobs created in the secondary and tertiary sectors. This industry has raised the image of India much more than all other Indian industries put together. Therefore, any Indian government — whether left, right or centrist — has to carefully nurture this relationship, and make it stronger.
I am sure our PM knows better than most of us how worked up the US Congress is about Indian companies using H1B and L1 visas to bring in Indian labour to service their US clients. This has been a hot issue that has troubled the legislators in the US for some years now. The immigration bill over which there has been much haggling between the Republicans and the Democrats has some onerous clauses for Indian software companies.
Despite all of this, a large number of well-known US corporations depend on our software industry to help them in building their information systems. Therefore, this is an opportune time for our PM to impress upon President Barack Obama the importance of our software industry in making the US corporations even more efficient to benefit their customers not just in their own markets but also in third-country markets. He has to use data and facts to communicate to the president and the pivotal members of the US Congress how Indian companies are working hard to create job opportunities for US citizens and permanent residents.
He has to show data on the nonavailability of talent in the US. He has to show how our software industry is good for the US economy. He has to develop deep friendship with several key members on both sides of the aisle in the Congress. He has the charisma to do it. It is good to invite several important members of the US Congress as state guests to visit India and roll out the red carpet.
  Get the Visa Power
Today, many senior executives and academicians in the US feel that obtaining visa for visiting India is both tortuous and torturous. I had to personally intercede to accelerate the visa process for several high-profile people in academia and the corporate world from the US. According to many Indian visaseekers in the US, the Indian government has employed a very inefficient and disorganised visa-handling agency. I hope our government has changed the agency in the last few months. The foreign minister has to change this perception and create a more hospitable reality.
An India that Works
Most senior executives in the US feel that we have a very slow bureaucracy and the most complicated rule set in the world. The PM has to change that. He has to make it easy and comfortable for foreigners to live in India. He has to show data on how hard India is trying for a balance of trade between the two countries.
It is necessary for Indian software companies to provide the PM data on how many jobs they have created for US citizens and permanent residents. In other words, he has to make US legislators, civil servants and corporate leaders feel that India is important, India is predictable, India is desirable and India is easy to do business with.

(Modi may not have forgotten,…)
By Arun Kumar
WASHINGTON: Not long ago, Narendra Modi was not welcome in the US. But the US is now pulling out all stops to woo him when he comes calling at the White House as India's prime minister at the end of this month.
President Barack Obama will host a dinner for him September 29 before bilateral talks at the White House the next day and this will be followed by a lunch hosted by Vice President Joe Biden at the State Department.
What a difference an election makes! Long forgotten is Modi's alleged inaction or complicity in the 2002 Gujarat riots that led the State Department to revoke his visa in 2005.
Modi may not have forgotten, but he too is not letting his personal feelings come in the way of repairing India-US ties which touched a low last December over the arrest and strip search of India's then deputy consul general in New York for alleged visa fraud and underpaying her nanny.
For, if Obama has called India "one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century, one which will be vital to US strategic interests in Asia-Pacific and across the globe", India's ties with Washington are its most important relationship.
Obama and his predecessors, Republican George Bush and fellow Democrat Bill Clinton all visited India, underscoring the increasing importance of the bilateral relationship that has broad bipartisan support across the aisle.
But despite the optics, there is cautious optimism on the outcome of the Modi visit which is expected to be primarily focused on economic ties, defence, trade and technology exchanges.
Trade between the two countries has grown from only $5.6 billion in 1990 to over $63 billion in 2013, according to the US Census Bureau.
And as a State Department backgrounder noted, the two are "developing their defence partnership through military sales and joint research, co-production and co-development efforts".
"India has moved forward, albeit haltingly, with market-oriented economic reforms that began in 1991," the backgrounder said noting, "Recent reforms have included an increasingly liberal foreign investment regime in many sectors."
But nothing major is expected in regard to the landmark India-US nuclear deal that has stalled over India's tough liability law.
Addressing the liability issue still remains "the biggest and most pressing issue on trying to advance the civil nuclear cooperation," according to Nisha Desai Biswal , assistant secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs.
As the 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain told a Washington think tank recently, "Too often, our relationship has felt like a laundry list of initiatives, some quite worthy, that amounts to no more than the sum of its parts."
"... Our strategic relationship has unfortunately devolved recently into a transactional one," he said.
But McCain, who met the Indian Prime Minister last month, also felt "Modi wants India to do its part to change this - and that he wants India and the US to lift our sights once again, to think bigger and do bigger things together."
"I fully agree. And I see the prime minister's visit to the US this month as an opportunity to renew our partnership and regain a proper strategic focus," he said.
Mark R. Warner, Democratic co-chair of the bipartisan Senate India Caucus, who published a "First 100 Days" plan to strengthen US-India relations has also praised the progress made at the 100-day mark of Modi's government.
Meanwhile, the Indian community is planning to accord Modi a grand public reception at Madison Square Garden, a huge multi-purpose indoor arena in Midtown Manhattan in New York City with a capacity of over 20,000 Sep 28.
The event will be emceed by the first Indian-American Miss America Nina Davuluri and PBS Weekend Newshour's Indian-American anchor, Hari Sreenivasan.
Given "an overwhelming response for this historic event" and "the tremendous interest from the Indian American community" general admission tickets are being distributed through a lottery.
The event, organised by the Indian American Community Foundation, will be broadcast live on a number of TV channels as well as streamed online on pmvisit.org website.

PM Modi s US Visit: Red carpet welcome awaits Narendra Modi in USBarack Obama
(Administration here is…)
WASHINGTON: The Obama Administration is leaving no stone unturned to woo Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his maiden visit to the US which is expected to take the strategic bilateral relationship to the next level and unleash the potential of economic and trade ties.
The administration here is gearing up to give a red carpet welcome to Prime Minister Modi when he arrives in Washington on September 29 from New York where he would attend the annual General Assembly session of the United Nations .
The discussion between Modi and Obama over two days in Washington is expected to result in taking the bilateral relationship to the next level in terms of defense and strategic ties, co-operation in the field of space and counter-terrorism and unleash the potential of economic and trade ties, sources familiar with the preparations told.
On September 29, Obama is likely to host Modi for a small working dinner, which is rarely accorded to a visiting foreign leader.
The maiden meeting between the two leaders on September 29 would help Obama and Modi to know each other and prepare the ground for the next day's meeting at the White House.
Soon after his electoral victory, Obama had called Modi to congratulate him and invited him to visit Washington.
Thereafter the two leaders have not spoken over phone, but there has been an exchange of letters between the two.
Obama, who of late has been tied up on the foreign policy front over developments in the Middle East - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Ukraine - is looking forward to meeting Modi and exchange views on international issues of concern.
Encouraged by the steps taken by the Modi government in its first 100 days, the Obama Administration sees an India that is of great strategic significance and can act as a stabilising force in the entire Asia Pacific region.
A strong and prosperous India, US officials argue, is in the best interest of the United States.
India, US officials say, under Modi would play a key role not only in South Asia, but also in South East Asia.
In fact, India-US relationship has been identified as one of the top four priorities by both Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry this year, officials said.
Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met Modi in New Delhi in quick succession this summer. The meetings generated excitement in the US as well.
"The two leaders will discuss a range of issues of mutual interest in order to expand and deepen the US-India strategic partnership. They will discuss ways to accelerate economic growth, bolster security cooperation, and collaborate in activities that bring long-term benefits to both countries and the world," the White House had said in a statement earlier while formally announcing the visit.
"They will also focus on regional issues, including current developments in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, where India and the United States can work together with partners towards a positive outcome," the White House had said adding that Obama looks forward to working with Modi to fulfill the promise of the US-India strategic partnership for the benefit of both their citizens and the world.
After a dinner on September 29, the two leaders are scheduled to meet at the White House for a substantive talk on September 30.
"The fact that there will be interactions over two days is a signal of the importance we place on the US-India relationship," said Caitlin Hayden, Spokesperson of the National Security Council.
While Modi's Joint Address to the US Congress could not happen due to the November elections, a large number of lawmakers are believed to have requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
Organisers of Modi's trip are having a tough time in scheduling these meetings.
Modi has also received a request for meetings from the top American business community both in New York and Washington DC.
With economic development his key priority, Modi is expected to interact with the American business community in both New York and Washington DC.
The visit will mark Modi's first trip to the US since his party swept to victory in general elections in May.
In 2005, the US State Department had revoked a visa that Modi had for travelling to the US in the wake of the 2002 riots in Gujarat. He never applied for an American visa after the move.

J&K floods: State s tourism prospects take a beatingBookings
(Yatra.com cancels 70% of…)
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Kashmir won't be the destination of choice for many travellers during the upcoming Dussehra holidays and beyond. In the aftermath of the recent floods, the state could lose a major chunk of the tourism business, one of its main sources of revenue, as travel companies and agents cope with enquiries and cancellations for the coming months. Many fear the impact will be felt right up to next year.
The valley town of Srinagar, the state's summer capital, was hit by the worst floods in five decades, denting its chances to become one of the favourite destinations for Indians and foreign travelers just as tourism to the area had been regaining popularity.
Online travel portal Yatra.com has cancelled about 70% of the air and hotel bookings for September end and plans for the coming months look bleak as tourists wait to see how the situation pans out.
Leisure travel firm TUI has seen a 75% drop in new bookings for Kashmir compared with the same period last year. WelcomHeritage Hotels, which has a franchise agreement with Gurkha Houseboats owned by the Kashmirbased Ghulam Wangnoo family, had all its bookings for next month cancelled.
Travel companies and agents say the floods will have a negative impact not only in the coming months but also during the peak season between April and June next year. Apart from tourism, the floods have derailed industries such as textiles, handlooms and handicrafts, which are popular among tourists.
"Almost all sectors of business have been impacted. Don't know what will happen to small businessmen and the loans they have taken," says Sameer Kaul, the chief national spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party in Jammu & Kashmir and a leading cancer surgeon.
Shafi Goroo, managing director of Atsar Exports, which sells Kashmiri carpets and pashmina shawls in Delhi and abroad, says his manufacturing facility in Srinagar is totally destroyed. About 20% of the stock for his exports business came from his facility while the rest was sourced from artisans and weavers in the region. "All that is gone for now. We don't know how it will be when the waters recede. I don't think there will be any business for the next 8-10 months," he says.
Many areas were flooded after heavy rain caused the Jhelum river and other water bodies to breach their embankments at several places. Power supplies and communications were disrupted as water levels rose to over three metres in Srinagar, the Dal Lake area, Anantnag, Pulwama and Baramulla, among others.
  "We have 15 houseboats of our own at Dal Lake and at the moment, most of them have been impacted. Some houseboats, which were 50-70 years old, have been submerged and can be recovered only once the water recedes," says Shah Nawaz Siah, director of sales and marketing at De-Laila Group of Houseboats. Siah expects at least 100 houseboats to be affected.
Shahid Rah, owner of Lotus Retreat Group, which also has a fleet of houseboats on Dal Lake, is an anxious man. "Houses of people have vanished. We don't know what is the situation of the houseboats on Dal and Nagin lakes," says Rah, who is based in Delhi. "We are more worried about our people back home. We are trying to find out if family and friends are safe."
Events scheduled in the state in September and the months ahead have been thrown out of gear. In the past few years, there had been an upward trend in the number of domestic tourists visiting Kashmir. According to recent reports, there were 13.6 million domestic visitors in 2013, a 9.8% increase from the previous year.
The Paradise Music festival in Sonamarg, which was to be held from September 11 to 15, was cancelled. The Twitter feeds of the organisers say they were stuck at Sonamarg for six days without any communications. They finally found a way out and planned to travel to Leh to catch a flight to Delhi.

Don t celebrate my birthday  instead help in J&K relief work: PM ModiBJP
(Narendra Modi's appeal…)
NEW DELHI: Those curious to how Modi will celebrate his first birthday as the Prime Minister got the answer from his favourite medium of interaction - Twitter.
Tweeting in both Hindi and English, Modi who turns 64 on Wednesday, asked people to not indulge in his birthday celebrations but instead focus on relief work in Kashmir. "My humble request- do not celebrate my birthday. Instead, dedicate yourselves towards relief work in J&K through your time & resources," he said.
Modi's another tweet said,"On 17th, President Xi Jinping will be in Guj. We look forward to extending a warm welcome to him but there will be no birthday celebrations." The PM also asked people to cancel any planned parties in his honor and also request people to donate generously for relief work in the floods.
Modi has always chosen his birthday to surprise people. In 2011, as the Gujarat CM he began his much famous 3-day Sadbhavna fast on his birthday after visiting his mother. The fast that he said was aimed at building harmony and brotherhood was reported widely.
In 2013, incidentally, Modi paid an unexpected visit to senior BJP leader Keshubhai Patel, who had rebelled against him and quit the BJP to float his own party.
However, in a blog post written on his 62nd birthday he said that throughout his life the birthday has been no different from any other day of his life.

(The Roads and Buildings…)
JAMMU: Over 2,500 roads and 163 small bridges have been damaged in the Jammu province alone due to the flooding in the state.
"In Jammu province, out of 3,517 roads having length of 9,851 kms, about 2,553 roads have been damaged due to heavy rain and flash floods ," Roads and Buildings Minister Abdul Majid Wani told reporters here today.
A total of 163 foot-bridges and motorable bridges have also been damaged in the region, Wani said.
The Roads and Buildings department is mobilising all the resources and so far about 375 machines have been put into service to restore 1,800 road links, he said.
In addition to this, about 64 bridges, including one motorable bridge over the Niki Tawi river, were washed away and 163 foot bridges and motor bridges have been damaged in various parts of Jammu province, he added.
"The restoration work of the damaged bridge has been started on war-footing," the minister said.
Wani inspected various bridges and roads in Jammu to assess the damages caused by flash floods.
During his inspection of fourth Tawi Bridge the minister was told that the bridge has not suffered any structural failure or damages, however, the left side approach towards Belicharana side (Ware House side) got damaged to a length of about 60 metres.
Chief Engineer R&B Abdul Hamid told the Minister that the cost of temporary restoration will be approximately 1.25 crore.
He said permanent restoration work shall be taken up after proper design and study of hydraulic data to ensure its safety.
The Minister also inspected Niki Tawi bridge , which has been washed away due to incessant rains and flash floods.
Forty-five villages located in Tawi islands, having a population of about 20,000 were cut-off due to damages on the bridge but PWD had taken up construction of an alternate road to provide the shortest possible connectivity to these areas.

Android One: Google bets on low-cost smartphonesMicromax, Karbonn and Spice will be the first three handset makers to sell these devices to customers, as Google aims to extend the reach of Android into emerging markets.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: In a few hours from now, Google will launch in India the first set of Android One smartphones, devices that it believes will give existing and first time smartphone buyers, and, new and existing mobile internet users, a high-end internet experience on smartphones, without burning a hole through their pockets.
One of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets will become ground zero for Google's Android One initiative over the next few months, as the world's most popular search engine takes a giant leap from connecting the next billion, not just through the internet but also through smartphones.
Android One is a program announced by Google's head of Android, Chrome web browser and apps Sundar Pichai back in June which promised rich smartphone experience on low-cost devices as Google will set minimum standards on hardware and software to be used by handset makers.
By controlling hardware and software, akin to what Apple does, Google aims to bring user experience found on high-end smartphones to the affordable end of the device spectrum.
Micromax , Karbonn and Spice will be the first three handset makers to sell these devices to customers, as Google aims to extend the reach of Android into emerging markets, especially India where only 29% of about 920 million mobile phone users own smartphones, offering a far higher potential than markets like China or the US where smartphone penetration is nearing its peak.
With Android One's adoption in India, where smartphone market doubled to 44 million last year and has touched 36 million devices in the first half of 2014, Google will be able to deliver latest OS updates faster, reduce variations of the OS, which in turn will help them to update apps.
Google also hopes to counter the threat from growing forked Android devices, and against new entrants including China's Xiaomi and rejuvenated Motorola, both of which have made significant inroads in the affordable smartphone segment with the Red Mi 1S priced at Rs 5,999 and Moto E priced at Rs 6,999.
The smartphones, one from each handset maker, are expected to be priced under $ 100 or Rs 6,000, even as some industry insiders believe that price for end customers may be somewhere around Rs 7,500.
"It will be interesting to watch if they are able to maintain that Rs 6,000 price band or whether it will go to Rs 7,000 - Rs 7,500 since Google is also specifying the hardware," said Karan Thakkar, senior market analyst- mobile phones and tablets at research firm IDC.
The devices that the vendors are offers are likely to have 5-megapixel cameras, quad-core processors, 1 GB RAM with 4.3-4.5 inch screens, powered by Android Kitkat 4.4.4 version operating system apart from a 1700-mAh battery, dual SIM slots and SD card slot to expand memory.
A leaked preview of one such Android One smartphone by Spice - Spice Android One Dream UNO Mi-498 - showcased same specifications, priced at Rs 6,999 on online retail store Flipkart on Sunday. The listing was promptly removed soon after.
But sources privy to latest developments say that the three handset makers may well tie up with Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon to sell these devices online to gauge consumer response before going full steam through the well-established traditional retail routes used by the Indian vendors.
The devices may also come bundled with Hindi language support for voice commands, typing messages and almost all major mobile applications. Users will not have to download any external application to access their smartphone in Hindi.
With high stakes riding on the launch, Google is said to have set aside more than Rs 100 crore with its partners on advertising and marketing.
"What they (Google) need to look at is having a tie-up with the telco providers, so that internet also comes to them," said Vishal Tripathi, principal analyst at Gartner. Reports suggest that Google has tied up with India's leading carrier Airtel to offer bundled internet usage. Details of plans are likely to come out in a few hours.

Microsoft gears up to take on Android One; plans to rejig handset bizThe company aims to revive its share in key markets and bridging the gap between its Windows OS and market leader Android and iOS from Apple worldwide.
ET SPECIAL:

NEW DELHI: Microsoft is reshaping its handset strategy as Google introduces its Android One phones. Microsoft is dropping the iconic Nokia brand name from some models, culling the popular Asha range and looking to aggressively cut prices of smartphones, apart from launching its 'First' category of feature phones priced under $40 (Rs 2,400) in a bid to target the billion first-time buyers in emerging markets such as India.
This aggressive pricing strategy is aimed at reviving the handset maker's share in key markets and bridging the gap between its Windows operating system (2.5% market share, as per IDC) with market leader Android (84.7%) and No. 2 iOS from Apple (11.7%) worldwide.
The strategy rejig comes as Google launches Android One devices in collaboration with top Indian handset makers Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, which between themselves had about 30% of the country's fast-growing smartphone market at the end of June, according to IDC. These handsets are expected to cost less than $100. Others like Firefox have introduced smartphones for as little as Rs 1,999, again with Indian handset partners.
"We're just beginning a refresh of the entire portfolio," Chris Weber, vice president of mobile device sales at Microsoft, told ET. "We aim to push the price point of Windows phones significantly lower - we certainly see that happening on the Android ecosystem - without impacting quality and experience."
Microsoft, which bought Nokia in April for $7.5 billion, has made several changes to the strategy of selling devices, including shutting down Nokia X smartphones and the Asha range, which was split between feature phones and smartphones and also competed on price points.
While customers who bought these devices will still get aftersales and service support, Microsoft will not launch any further products under these banners. At the same time, Nokia X designs that were on its roadmap will be converted into Windows Phones.
Over the next 12-18 months, Weber said, Microsoft will work on pushing the price points of Windows smartphones lower than those available in the market. At the same time, it will drive innovation in the affordable flagship area and combine design, software and services from Microsoft at the high-end, which will trickle down the portfolio.
Jo Harlow, corporate vice president for phones at Microsoft, said that there are still a billion people globally who don't have mobile devices and 2 billion who don't have access to the Internet on mobile devices, which is what the company intends to target. "On the 'First' side, we will continue to introduce new devices - First Bing, First Internet devices, First mobile phone devices," Harlow added.
Microsoft launched the 'First' set of ultra-affordable mobile phones in early August with Nokia 130 priced at Euro 19 or Rs 1,498, which will be soon brought to India, and recently added the Nokia 225 Internet-enabled feature phone. These devices run on the Symbian 30+ operating system.

Atul Singh
(India is geographically…)
NEW DELHI: Late last year, soon after Atul Singh was elevated as Coca-Cola's group president for Asia, he remarked at a celebratory party to friends and family: "This is not my farewell from India. China is barely five hours away." Singh's new role meant he was overseeing 21 markets, including China.
But Singh didn't have to go through the tedious process of relocating bag and baggage to another country. Meanwhile, ad man Prasoon Joshi's decision to continue operating out of Mumbai isn't just because of his "love for the country".
"Diversity in management is becoming very important for global firms," said Joshi, who was named chairman of ad agency network McCann Worldgroup's Asia-Pacific region, which includes Greater China and Australia, late last week. "I have learnt and continue to learn so much from the cultural nuances of small-town India - I would want my clients and team to continue to benefit from that," he said.
Singh and Joshi are not alone. The growing league of highfliers choosing to stay put in India after landing plum global roles include Reckitt Benckiser's Chander M Sethi, Abheek Singhi of Boston Consulting Group, Group M's Vikram Sakhuja, Whirlpool's Arvind Uppal, Adobe's Naresh Gupta and Dheeraj Sinha of Grey.
Their reasons range from personal ones to India being a key emerging growth hub and geographical convenience. For Singhi, senior partner and director, Boston Consulting Group, and leader of its consumer and retail practice in Asia Pacific, it was a mix of professional and personal reasons that kept him back.
Singhi was elevated to the new role one and a half years ago. His travel schedule is packed with monthly trips to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul and Japan. "You need to get used to doing calls across different time zones - installing video equipment and soundproofing a room in the house would help," he said with a smile.
Four-hour sleep cycles, going to meetings straight from the airport and queuing up for a new passport when the pages run out because of all the visa stamps are a small price to pay for him.
The other compelling reason is the importance India commands on the global business map. "With India and China emerging as nodal points of the world economy and almost half the world's population centred in Asia, India offers a great vantage point as an operational hub for global CEOs," said Coca-Cola vice president for human resources, Sameer Wadhawan.
  A point of view Singhi echoed. "India and China are going to be drivers of the most significant increase in consumption - so there's a need to have a leg in the market. Finally, there's greater interest of global clients in India and China," added Singhi. Search firm executives said staying in India means dealing with extreme business challenges and consumer demands, something these leaders relish. "These officials have been able to command respect within institution. They are not seen as a local resource, but a global resource," said Sanjiv Sachar, consultant at search firm Egon Zehnder.
Naresh Gupta wears many hats at Adobe—senior vice president for print and publishing and managing director of the company's India operations. He also oversees R&D operations in China, Romania and Japan. "Though I handle multiple global responsibilities, one of them is to look at the India campus," he said. "We have a significant employee base here, and being here sends the right message to employees about how critical India is for us." Gupta has chosen to stay on despite the trauma of his son being kidnapped from outside his Noida home in 2006. "Lightning doesn't strike at the same place twice. It could have happened anywhere."
According to Dheeraj Sinha, chief strategy officer for South and Southeast Asia at Grey, who looks after strategic planning across markets, those who occupy such roles should be aware of the pitfalls.
"The danger with a wider role like this is that one can end up being a helicopter who comes in, works at a surface and goes away," he said. "But for real impact, it's important, especially in a function like strategy, to get into the depth and details. Then it doesn't matter whether my base is India or any other place."
Sinha travels almost 15 days a month—and he has a long day at the office. "You are working with people and on projects in different time zones. My day starts 2.5 hours earlier because that's when Southeast Asia wakes up and goes on till late because India sleeps late."
It's also a lot easier to operate from India now. "India is geographically convenient, ranks high on the hospitality index, has emerged as a travel hub and technological infrastructure is on par with most developed markets. This helps CEOs network and be virtually connected to markets outside of India," said Coca-Cola's Wadhawan.

Hotels put in the extra yard to woo women business travellers

Eva rooms
(Luxury chain ITC Hotels…)
MUMBAI: Businesswomen are one of the fastest-growing traveller segments. With this potential, hotel chains are leaving no stone unturned to attract and retain the loyalty of female business travellers who are moving up the career ladder and now travel more often.
While luxury chain ITC Hotels was the first to conceptualise Eva rooms exclusively for women travellers in the 1990s, the concept has evolved from being just a room category at ITC Maurya in New Delhi to a dedicated wing and floor in ITC Hotels across the country. Early this year, ITC Maratha in Mumbai revamped the women-only floor to incorporate new design elements and introduced workout options such as Steppers within these rooms.
"The endeavour is aimed at going beyond the expected and ordinary to cater to the 'unspoken needs' of this segment," says Dipak Haksar, chief operating officer of ITC Hotels. The hotel chain's upcoming property, ITC Grand Bharat at Manesar near Gurgaon, has special packages on golf, yoga, spa, beauty treatments and culinary classes crafted for women travellers.
Other hotel chains are now also adopting the trend of women-only floors and introducing newer and customised services for this segment. "Travel packages for women have been there for years and it's the same everywhere. But those can't work anymore as the female travellers have evolved and their needs are changing," says Louis Sailer, general manager of The Leela Palace New Delhi.
The luxury hotel has crafted a new package for single lady travellers, which includes an array of services such as dedicated female housekeepers, butlers, concierges and personal shopping assistants and tour guides along with access to a personal chef who curates personalised menus during their stay. "We spent months to refine our offerings and came up with the new one, which includes preferences of women travellers from across the globe," says Sailer.
With business from women travellers growing by 50% every year, hotels say this segment cannot be ignored. "Once a single lady traveller stays at the hotel and is comfortable with the personalisation and environment, then she is a 100% repeat customer to the hotel," says Saji Joseph, general manager at the Le Meridien in Kochi. Some hotels are designing areas specifically for women travellers. For instance, the Hyatt Regency in Chennai has started a women-only bar in its lobby called 'Escape Bar'.
Movenpick Hotel & Spa Bangalore is planning a women-centric area in its 'Club Lounge' on the executive floor, which will offer wines, juices, health food and magazines preferred by women.
"In the evenings, women like to connect with other women and they look for a special place — that's the reason behind opening a women-only bar," says Sunjae Sharma, area director for Chennai, Hampi, Kathmandu, Kolkata and Bangalore at the Hyatt Hotels.
Hotels are becoming more dependent on this segment as women travellers are more liberal with their purse strings and indulge in quality lifestyle amenities including spas, beauty, health and wellness.
"The net revenue realisation per room is higher of women travellers vis-a-vis men," says Vinesh Gupta, general manager at the Movenpick Hotel in Bangalore, which gets about 15% of its business from single lady travellers.
Gupta added that the hotel gets about 80% of its salon revenue and 60% of its spa revenue from women guests.

(Data processed by MCA21…)
By Rajat Arora
NEW DELHI: The corporate affairs ministry will share its data of more than 10 lakh companies with regulators and enforcement agencies in abid to check corporate frauds at an early stage, a senior official has told ET. The ministry will convert statutory filing of registered companies into simpler information that can be used by regulators and enforcement agencies for clamping down on frauds, the official said.
"We will be converting statutory information of 1.39 million registered companies into readable statistical information. Primary use of this data will be to ensure effective and efficient regulation of companies," the official said.
MCA21 project, the flagship e-governance initiative of the government under the National e-Governance Plan, has fully automated all filling processes related to compliance and enforcement of the Companies Act, creating an electronic repository of Indian corporate sector information. The government has been under pressure to create an early warning system following the Saradha scam. in which lakhs of investors were defrauded of thousands of crores. The Supreme Court had questioned the failure of regulators in spotting the scam this big, saying that "a larger conspiracy" was in play.
The corporate affairs ministry is of the view that a good start can be made by sharing data with regulators. "We are in talks with all regulators and looking to set up a reciprocal arrangement with the Central Board of Excise and Customs , the Central Board of Direct Taxes , the Securities and Exchange Board of India , the Reserve Bank of India and Financial Intelligence Unit for mutual exchange of data," said the official quoted earlier.
The sectoral reports prepared by the ministry will also be shared in a customised manner with different stakeholders in response to their specific requests. "We expect external users such as investment banks, credit rating agencies and financial institutions to use the corporate sector information to assist investors for informed and objective decision-making on Indian companies," the official added.
Experts, however, advise caution. "The MCA proposal may be well meaning in intention but the ministry should be circumspect in how it goes about analysing company data since the new Companies Act already has significant obligations cast on key management personnel and external auditors to address any possible fraud," said Rajat Mukherjee , Partner at Khaitan & Co.
The processed data will also be shared with RBI and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) for enabling estimation of the macro-economic aggregates, which is expected to help the government in framing macro and sectoral-level policies.

Guest list case: Reveal source s name  asks SCGuest list case: SC asks Prashant Bhushan to reveal documents' source against CBI Director
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 15:22 IST

The Supreme Court on Monday directed advocate Prashant Bhushan, who has levelled allegations against CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) Director Ranjit Sinha of protecting accused in the 2G case, to reveal the name of the whistleblower from whom he got CBI documents and guest list at the top cop's residence.
A bench headed by Justice H L Dattu asked Bhushan to name the whistleblower in the sealed envelope on the next date of hearing and said that it will go into the merits of allegations after knowing the source of information, as it may have ramification on the reputation of the director and also affect the ongoing trial in the 2G scam.
It said that the affidavit filed by Bhushan is not in consonance with the Supreme Court rules and asked him to reveal the source from whom he got all the documents.
The director questioned the very existence of the diary before the apex court and said that 90 per cent of the entries were fudged though some entries may be genuine.
Advocate Vikash Singh, appearing for the top cop, submitted that somebody else is controlling the proceedings in the case and raised questions on how a media group published a story in advance that Bhushan will be depositing the original guest list before the apex court.
He alleged that a corporate house is working behind all these controversies and it is intended to benefit the accused in the 2G scam .
The bench also wanted to know the stand of CBI in the controversy but the senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for the agency, refused to get into it, saying that it is a matter between advocate Prashant Bhushan and the director.
It then directed its registry to keep all documents and affidavits filed by the CBI director in a sealed cover and deposit them with the Secretary General for safe custody.
The apex court posted the matter for further hearing on September 22.

undefinedAfter what at one stage earlier this month looked like a vast game of musical chairs, reigning champions India ended up topping the world rankings when the five-month countdown to the 2015 World Cup started on Sunday.
With just three rating points separating the top four nations, however, the 11th version of the quadrennial showpiece of 50-overs cricket, which is being co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, looks like being one of the closest ever.
We look at how the 10 Test-playing nations (in order of world ranking) are shaping up before New Zealand meet Sri Lanka in Christchurch to launch the February 14-March 29 tournament.
ALSO SEE—Full Coverage: 2015 World Cup
INDIA
Led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and boasting some fearless strokemakers in their ranks, the top-ranked ODI side in the world look serious contenders to defend their title.
A much-improved fielding side, India appear to have benefitted from the Indian Premier League, which has given their players the opportunity to play regularly against the leading bowlers in the world.
Even the most junior batsman in the Indian side has faced the likes of Dale Steyn and Mitchell Johnson in the Twenty20 tournament and have gained enough confidence to hit them out of the park when the need arises.
With their pace bowling underwhelming, India will once again build their attack around their spinners, who made a big impact in their World Cup win at home in 2011.
A lot will depend, though, on how the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and the plethora of part-time spinners fare on the relatively bouncy pitches in Australia and New Zealand.
SOUTH AFRICA
Recent series victories in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, where they played a triangular tournament involving Australia, have boosted the confidence of the Proteas, even if both were achieved in conditions they will not find at the World Cup.
Their strong batting line-up has been solidified by the emergence of Faf du Plessis at number three, coming in after proven openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock.
In AB de Villiers they have arguably the best one-day batsman in the world, but there is concern over their one genuine power-hitter, David Miller , who is out of form.
The South Africans also lack an all-rounder to bat at seven, with this duty shared in recent times by Ryan McLaren and Wayne Parnell with mixed success.
Dale Steyn remains the lynchpin of the bowling line-up and rarely has an off-day, and in JP Duminy and Imran Tahir there are also genuine spin options too.
SRI LANKA
Sri Lanka will be hoping next year is third time lucky after being beaten in the final of the last two World Cups and the 1996 champions seem to have the resources to achieve that.
Mahela Jayawardene, 37, and Kumar Sangakkara , 36, got a fitting 20-over farewell when Sri Lanka won the World Twenty20 title in Bangladesh in April but winning the 50-over event in Australia would be an even better parting gift.
Sri Lanka's compact batting side is complemented by a balanced bowling unit which is likely to include the mercurial Lasith Malinga , whose yorkers, delivered with his sling-shot action, can make him almost unplayable on occasions.
The rise of Thisara Perera and Dhammika Prasad have eased the pressure on Malinga but Sri Lanka have been forced to have a fresh look at their spin options after off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake was banned for an illegal action.
AUSTRALIA
Australia relinquished the number one ranking, lost captain Michael Clarke to injury as well as a match against Zimbabwe on their recent trip to Harare but that will do little to dent optimism they can win a fifth world title next March.
With the likes of openers David Warner and Shane Watson to return to the side before the World Cup, Australia can afford to be circumspect about the setbacks suffered by an understrength and experimental side in Zimbabwe.
There remain concerns, not least about whether Clarke's back will be up to the amount of cricket he will be asked to play over the next five months and whether they will ever unearth another world-class spinner.
On the plus side is the prospect of Mitchell Johnson and his fellow pacemen renewing their often lethal relationship with Australia's hard and bouncy decks.
Coach Darren Lehmann has laughed off talk of a split with Clarke over selection and will be satisfied that the likes of all-rounder Mitch Marsh have given him more depth in his squad should he need it next year.
ENGLAND
England go into the World Cup, which they have never won, with minimal expectations after a dismal run of form in the 50-over game.
The lowest average net run rate of all test-playing nations in recent times, an outdated approach to the format and huge question marks over the captaincy and make-up of the team hardly inspire confidence.
Former spinner Graeme Swann said recently the team have "no chance" of winning the tournament and there is a strong case for replacing Alastair Cook as skipper due to doubts about his leadership style and limitations with the bat.
England do have talented one-day players. Alex Hales is a destructive opening batsman, Eoin Morgan a specialist finisher, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler a flamboyant middle-order player and Harry Gurney a potentially imposing death bowler.
With test batsmen Joe Root and Ian Bell also skilled in the one-day game, there is a solid core to the team but the approach needs to change because 240 metronomic runs do not win 50-over matches at international level in the modern game.
PAKISTAN
A bunch of talented but unpredictable players with a tendency to implode inexplicably, Pakistan suffered a huge blow to their preparations when spinner Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal bowling action earlier this month.
Ajmal has about five months to correct the action and seek a reassessment but whether he will ever again show the form that has made him the top-ranked ODI bowler in the world is something only time will tell.
The 1992 champions are also grappling with a captaincy dilemma. Misbah-ul-Haq has remained a rare stable figure in a volatile dressing room but his modest sub-74 strike rate is no longer tailor-made for the format.
After last month's ODI series defeat in Sri Lanka, the clamour has grown to replace him with all-rounder Shahid Afridi, whose batting and personality are the polar opposite to Misbah's.
NEW ZEALAND
New Zealand's batting has been settled for a number of years with Martin Guptill , Kane Williamson , Ross Taylor and captain Brendon McCullum likely to fill four of the top-five positions.
The biggest issue is finding a new opening partner for Guptill with few expecting hard-hitting batsman Jesse Ryder to be recalled to the side due to his behavioural issues.
Tim Southee , Kyle Mills, Trent Boult and Mitchell McClenaghan are likely to be the main pace bowlers with young quicks Adam Milne and Matt Henry vying for the fifth spot.
Former captain Daniel Vettori, who is still one of the most economical bowlers in limited overs cricket and a handy lower-order batsman, is also likely to be included, if fit.
WEST INDIES
West Indies are without a coach after the sudden departure of Ottis Gibson last month and caretaker Richie Richardson could still be in place when they warm up for the World Cup with trips to India and South Africa.
A series of top-order collapses in recent limited overs matches mean the fitness and availability of the often brilliant opener Chris Gayle would appear to be vital to the hopes of the twice champions enjoying any success at the World Cup.
Likewise, persuading mystery off-spinner Sunil Narine to put West Indies before lucrative Twenty20 contracts would further bolster an otherwise solid bowling unit.
BANGLADESH
The 50-over format remains Bangladesh's best chance to impress at the world stage but their growth as a force in world cricket has stagnated in recent years.
The team rely heavily on spinners, who might find it difficult to ply their trade effectively on the seamer-friendly conditions in Australia and New Zealand.
Bangladesh also have had their problems with all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan over disciplinary issues but the former captain remains their best bet to surprise a higher-ranked opposition and cause an upset during the World Cup.
ZIMBABWE
Zimbabwe showed they can be competitive in the recent home triangular series against South Africa and Australia where they defeated the latter and came close to upsetting the Proteas.
The batting line-up could be described as flakey at best but they do have decent hitters and in Brendan Taylor, who relinquished the one-day captaincy to Elton Chigumbura last month, a player to build an innings around.
Consistency in performance with both bat and ball has been elusive and that is not something likely to change between now and the World Cup.

I think one-day cricket is seriously strugglingTweet
0
Rahul Dravid believes bowlers who have been banned for suspect bowling actions are suffering from kinks, which once corrected should allow them to reintegrate with international cricket. He added that he would always give a bowler the benefit of the doubt before he passes a judgment on his action.
Rahul Dravid also expressed his fears for one-day cricket. (Getty Images)"Personally I don't think we should see chucking as a crime as such. It is just a technical fault that people have. So if you have a technical fault in the action, you correct that and come back. When you overstep the line, nobody says you are cheating. You say, okay, come back behind the line. And here we are saying, come back within 15 degrees [of elbow flexion] and play the game," Dravid said in an interaction with the audience after delivering the annual Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture.
In the past few months, several bowlers have been called up for tests by the ICC and subsequently banned if they failed to demonstrate a legal bowling action. The most notable examples have been Sri Lanka offspinner Sachithra Senanayke and his Pakistan counterpart Saeed Ajmal , arguably the best spinner in the world at the moment.
"I think the ICC has a rule in place," Dravid said. "They reviewed a lot of the old footage and they found out that the elbow bent to about 15 degrees was pretty normal and that is what everyone was doing. Glenn McGrath had a slight bend in his elbow up to 15 degrees. I am not suggesting that Glenn McGrath was chucking. They have a system in place and what I am glad about is that they are really enforcing it strictly.
"They are reviewing people, they are getting people caught. I give them the benefit of the doubt. I always give the bowler the benefit of the doubt. Murali went through every test possible at that time so you have to give him the benefit of doubt. What the ICC is doing now is they are being vigilant. What they are saying is that if once you are cleared in 2009, you can't [not] be checked again. You have got to keep monitoring, watching it closely and they see bowlers developing new types of deliveries, then why not go into the lab and have it checked."
The discussion then veered to the health of the three formats of cricket and Dravid said ODIs were being put under pressure by "meaningless games"
"I think one-day cricket is seriously struggling," he said. "I definitely think that one-day cricket without a context is struggling. When you think of one-day cricket from a point of view of Champions Trophy and the World Cup, it is relevant. But I think all the other one-day cricket should be given towards playing the Champions Trophy and the World Cup. And then you've got Test cricket and you've got the T20 format of the game. Meaningless one-day games and too many one-day games can actually be a problem and it is something that can be cut off. You should play lesser one-day cricket and play more tournaments. So Champions Trophy and World Cup, I would go for it, definitely."
Questions were also raised regarding young Indian cricketers' seriousness towards playing Tests after the team's meek surrender in the recent tour of England. Dravid, however, backed the next generation, saying he never got a sense of them not being serious about Tests during his week-long stint as a consultant with the Indian team ahead of the five-Test series.
"When people say that some of our boys don't care about Test cricket, that's completely wrong. Because all they are asking me is, 'how did you do well?'. They are not worried about a T20 game coming up. They are only interested in knowing how did we do well in England, how did we do well in Australia. Virat Kohli is asking those questions all the time. I don't think it is that they don't care. They care deeply but they were found out against a really good bowling attack on a difficult wicket. And they were not good enough in those particular Test matches. But I think they do care [about Tests] and they ask those questions."

Fund need-based innovation to tackle climate changeFund need-based innovation to tackle climate change, says Harish Hande
E. Kumar Sharma        Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 20:21 IST
Harish Hande, Managing Director of solar lighting solutions company SELCO-India and a Ramon Magsaysay Award winner.
India must focus on sustainable energy and channelise funds and resources into need-based innovation if it wants to make a difference in the fight against climate change, says Harish Hande, Managing Director of solar lighting solutions company SELCO-India and a Ramon Magsaysay Award winner.
Speaking to Business Today on Monday, he said, "There is need to invest in building human resources in rural areas in the field of sustainable energy. For instance, we need to have energy technicians in rural areas. Then, there has to be focus on end-user financing. To top it all, money is needed to fund need-based innovation as against a want-based innovation."
Giving an example, he said: "We could, for instance, encourage innovations that look at the motors that run rice mills. Today, they use diesel. How can there be innovation to make motors that run efficiently on sustainable energy."
Hande was speaking in the light of a call for action given on Monday by 160 environmentalists from 44 countries. They have "called on foundations and philanthropists to use endowments worth billions of dollars to turn the tide on global warming".
This becomes important in the wake of a major climate meeting coming up this month that will reportedly be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has invited world leaders from government, finance, business and civil society to the New York Climate Summit on September 23, and has urged them to make bold commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build political momentum towards a global climate change treaty at the December 2015 Paris Climate Summit.

Pilot strike affects Air France flights from Bangalore  Delhi and MumbaiPilot strike affects Air France flights from Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, September 15:  
Air France flights to and from Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai to Paris were cancelled on Monday and could be affected till September 22 following a strike call given by several of the airline’s pilots unions.
The strike has been called to protest against the airline’s decision to shift jobs and operations to low-cost carriers so that the airline is in a better position to face competition.
In a statement, the airline said passengers booked on Air France flights from Delhi and Mumbai were being accommodated on KLM and Delta flights and also on flights of other partner airlines from these two cities.
The airline has recommended that a passenger verify the information on the flights being operated before going to the airport. “Our flight schedule is updated 24 hours before the departure, in the ‘Flight schedules’ section and on our mobile sites,” the airline said in a statement.
The airline has also proposed that those travelling between September 15 and 22, modify their departure so as to travel between September 23 and 30. If they decide to do so, passengers will be allowed to travel between September 23 and 30 in the same cabin as booked earlier at no extra cost.
If passengers postpone their travel beyond September 30 or change their origin or destination or decide not to travel, they can get the benefit of a non-refundable voucher valid for one year on Air France or KLM. Passengers have been advised to contact their travel agent for these changes.

Jet Set Go: Now  travel club class at econom...Jet Airways, Qatar Airways offer steep discounts on business class
Anirban Chowdhury, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 10.10AM IST

Abu Dhabi
(Under the same offer, one…)
MUMBAI: The price war in the skies has spread to the business class. Jet Airways and Qatar Airways are offering huge discounts in a desperate bid to take on Emirates and Singapore Airlines whose recently started A380 flights are scooping passengers in big chunks. Jet Airways is offering all-inclusive one-way business class fares to London at just Rs 28,382 from Delhi and Rs 27,727 from Mumbai, which are just onefourth of usual business class fares and almost half of regular economy fares.
The offer is effective for bookings between September 16 to 18 for travel between October 16, 2014 and July 31, 2015. Under the same offer, one can fly to Singapore in business class at just Rs 18,672 from Delhi and Rs 18,282 from Mumbai, about one-third of normal fares. Jet, however, clarified that none of these fares are valid on flights that operate via its new international hub Abu Dhabi. The airline made Abu Dhabi its global hub after selling 24 per cent stake to Etihad last year.
Earlier in the day, Qatar Airways wrote to travel agents offering an up to 25 per cent discount on all its 130 direct and indirect destinations from India on economy, business and even first classes on bookings made till September 17 for travel between September 21 and June 15, 2015. Industry experts said poor demand has forced airlines to this.
"Demand is a problem. Business class seats for many airlines have been going empty or half full at best," said an industry watcher who didn't want to be named. "What's more, the oncoming festive season never means the same spurt for business class as it does for the back end of the flight." Further, the 500-plus-seater A380 jumbo jet services started by Emirates and Singapore Airlines have made a dent in the market.
"The Emirates A380 flights are doing exceptionally well and so are the ones operated by Singapore Airlines although they have been quiet about it. Bookings are chock-full," said Manoj Samuel , director at Riya Travels, one of the biggest offline travel companies. And it's not as if Emirates is enticing passengers with its premium services alone. The airline recently wrote to travel agents offering base fares starting Rs 7,700 to destinations such as Jeddah, Doha and Bahrain.
Singapore started its daily flights from Delhi and Mumbai on May 30 while Emirates started operating a single daily A380 Mumbai-Dubai flight from June 21. Jet's business class offers are not limited to international routes. Under the scheme, a Delhi-Mumbai business class ticket comes for Rs 4,819, while a Mumbai-Bangalore ticket costs Rs 9,016.
Depending on the aircraft make, Jet Airways has anywhere between 8 and 34 premiere seats per flight. Only a miniscule percentage of the inventory would be on offer on these fares. Slowdown has forced airlines to force-fill their flights with discounts. However, slashing prices in the business class that doesn't depend on volumes is considered a desperate measure.

(At 7 per cent per annum growth,…)
By Jaspal Singh Sabharwal
German existential philosopher Karl Jasper in his book, The Origin and Goal of History, called 800 BC to 600A D the "axial period" of mankind. He became fascinated by the fact that figures like Pythagoras, Buddha and Confucius were all alive at exactly the same time, and that China, Greece and India, in the axial age, saw emergence of contending intellectual schools, each group apparently unaware of the other's existence.
In India, Asoka embraced Buddhism; in Rome, Constantine turned to the Christians; in China, Han emperor Wu-Ti adopted Confucianism. Of the three, only Wu-Ti was ultimately successful: the Chinese empire flourished for 2000 years, almost always with Confucianism as its official ideology.
In Constantine's case, the western empire collapsed but the Roman church blossomed. Asoka's project foundered; his empire fell apart and got replaced by fragmented kingdoms.
Fast forward 1400 years, both China and India are focused on regaining their rightful place under the sun. Let us first analyse the journey of the two countries in last 30 years.
In 1980, India's GDP per capita was $266 comparable to $307 of China. And now China's GDP per capital ($6,807) is 4.5 times that of India's ( $1,499).
India and China are very different from other countries in the world. Both India and China are vast, varied, and confusing; no different from what they were during axial age.
Today, PM Modi's biggest challenge is to put India back on sustainable high growth track. Growth rates take some time getting used to and India is learning the same.
There is a rule used by statisticians called the rule of 72 (ref. Michael Spence's book on The Next Convergence): it says that the time it takes in years to double in size at a specific annual growth rate is that growth rate divided by number 72. It sounds weird but it works.
So, for example, at 1 per cent growth, income doubles in 72 years. At 7 per cent growth, income and output double every 10 years. It takes decades for countries to make the transition from poor to advanced. The poorest countries have median income of $500 per person and advanced countries have incomes of $20,000 above.
At 7 per cent per annum growth, China is all set to enter the advance country club in 25 years and it will take India 35 years to get there. PM Modi and team are trying to fire up the economy by focusing on

SBI cuts deposit rates for 1-3 yrs to 8.75% from 9%Will keep reviewing other rates as well
Arundhati Bhattacharya
Chairman
SBI
State Bank of India has revised interest rates on retail term deposits below Rs 1 crore. The country's largest bank has cut the deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent, while for the period of 180-210 days, it has hiked the rates to 7.25 percent from 7 percent. 
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SBI  Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the reason for a revision in rates is based on the availability of liquidity, while the credit demand has been low.
“We have lot of liquidity in the 1-3 years band, thus we thought it right to cut the rates at that end. Also given the fact that inflation trajectory seems to be in the right direction, we will still be giving a real rate of return to out investors/depositors,” she said, adding that the bank will keep reviewing other rates as well.
Below is the transcript of Arundhati Bhattacharya’s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: What was the reason for this revision and what would the impact be of this revision on the margins?
A: The reason for the revision is the fact that we have a lot of liquidity, we have not seen that kind of credit demand and therefore this is basically adjusting our asset liability management (ALM). The small increase we have seen in six months to 210 days, is also to address ALM mismatch but on one to three year we have a lot of liquidity there and therefore we thought it right that we needed to cut the rates at that end also given the fact that the inflation trajectory seems to be in the right direction, we will still be giving a real rate of return to our investors, to our depositors.
Latha: You have hiked one portion which is six to seven months but you have cut the one to three year?
A: That’s right.
Latha: I would assume that a lot more money comes in the one to three year than in the six to seven months?
A: Absolutely.
Latha: Can you give us an idea, what might be the six to seven month, what proportion, is it 5 percent?
A: That would be very small. Actually, most of the deposits are in one to three year bucket.
Latha: That means you are actually comfortable now that depositors will stay Put even if you cut interest rates by 25 bps. You think that inflation is sufficiently on a downward path that you won’t scare away depositors?
A: I feel that’s the case because yesterday the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was at a five year low, 57 month low, core consumer price index (CPI) is also at 32 month low, so hopefully going forward we will see this trending downwards.
Latha: Are you the leader in the pack; are you the first one to bring rates below 9 percent?
A: I think so.
Sonia: What would the impact be because of this on the margins?
A: It depends upon what is the inflow because this will only impact those who are coming in now – that is it is something that affects prospectively but if the inflow remains at the same rate then over a period of one year it would impact to the extent of around Rs 700 crore-800 crore.
Latha: Are you going to immediately drop lending rates on any product?
A: Not immediately but we will keep reviewing to see what we can do.
Latha: Will it be product wise or will it be the base rate?
A: It is very difficult to say at this point of time.
Latha: Is this the first of some more such cuts that we will see, is the trend firmly set on ensuring that money will be cheaper?
A: It is difficult to say right now because the rest of the market is still at 9 percent. It will depend upon what will be the inflow in our deposits. If that goes down drastically then we might have to relook at it. This is basically a management of what is the amount available to me for lending. Therefore, to that extent we have to see how it goes. It is difficult to predict all of these things at this moment. 
Sonia: Since you did say that credit growth is slacking not just for SBI but perhaps for the whole industry as well. What would the impact of this be on credit growth?
A: Impact on credit growth at this point of time is difficult to call. At this point of time we find that the credit growth is very low, demand is very low. We are hoping that things will turnaround post January, so we have to see how it is.
SBI stock price
On November 21, 2014, State Bank of India closed at Rs 305.05, up Rs 7.95, or 2.68 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 2977.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 291.05.

Omar in control of situation: Centreflood
We expect the government to explain if adequate steps were taken: SC
Under fire from victims of the floods in Jammu and Kashmir for its perceived inability to tackle the calamity, the beleaguered Omar Abdullah government, however, received an endorsement from the Narendra Modi government, which informed the Supreme Court on Monday that the Chief Minister had “taken control of the situation” in the ravaged State.
In a written submission, Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi said the Chief Minister and the State machinery were functioning from Hari Niwas near Raj Bhawan since the State secretariat was inundated.
Mr. Rohatgi said the 15 Corps headquarters of the Army was coordinating with the State administration.
The Army Chief was supervising and coordinating rescue-and-relief operations and visited the area twice.
The submission came even as reports from the Kashmir Valley spoke about the “missing” local administration and the anger among flood-affected people.
Expressing its concern over the slow pace of relief, the Supreme Court observed that top priority for the State government was to bring drinking water and medicines to the flood victims. The observation by a three-judge Bench of the apex court, led by Chief Justice of India R. M. Lodha, came after Mr. Rohatgi’s submission.
The court also wanted the State government to make ex-gratia payments to victims for immediate life support. Mr. Rohatgi told the court that the Central government was “standing with the State government shoulder-to-shoulder and the Chief Minister is in control.” Mr. Rohatgi said rain had washed away forward border posts. “This is the time of maximum infiltration. Forces have to be diverted there and these are sensitive parts.”
The Bench pointed out that petitioners’ have contended that people were rescued and dumped without basic life support.
There were only a few health camps and banks have also stopped functioning.

Strong quake of 5.6 magnitude hits JapanPress Trust of India | Tokyo | Posted: September 16, 2014 10:03 am
Buildings in Tokyo shook on Tuesday as a strong quake hit Japan, reports said, but there was no immediate risk of a tsunami and no damage was reported. Seismologists said the epicentre was around 44 kilometres north-northeast of the Japanese capital and was located around 50 kilometres below the surface.
The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.6. Their Japanese counterparts said there was no danger of a tsunami from the tremor, the effects of which could be felt in buildings for more than a minute after the initial shaking began.
The operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant, which was battered by a tsunami after a powerful undersea quake in 2011, said nothing unusual had been noted at the still-fragile site. “There was no abnormality in our monitoring at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following the earthquake. Also, we have not received any reports of damage from the latest quake,” spokesman Keisuke Murakami said.
The Japan Atomic Power Co. said the Tokai No.2 Power Station, which was nearest to the epicentre of the quake, showed no signs of any problems. An official at the Ibaraki prefectural government said checks were ongoing, but that so far there appeared to be nothing amiss in the wider area.
“We have not received any reports of damage, injuries or casualties following the earthquake. We are still checking if the quake could result in damage,” he said. Japan is hit by around a fifth of the world’s powerful quakes every year and sits at the conjunction of several
tectonic plates.
Building codes are rigorous and regular disaster drills are held, helping to ensure that despite their frequency and their violence, quakes usually pass without loss of life or significant damage to property in Japan. However, the 9.0 magnitude undersea quake of March 2011
sparked a huge tsunami that smashed into the country’s northeast coast, killing around 18,000 people and creating the world’s worst nuclear emergency in a generation.

Car  components cos differ on CCI orderCar, components cos differ on CCI order
Sumant Banerji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 14, 2014
First Published: 23:45 IST(14/9/2014) | Last Updated: 23:55 IST(14/9/2014)

The recent Competition Commission of India (CCI) order to impose a Rs. 2,545 crore penalty on 14 major carmakers in India has divided the domestic automobile industry down the middle with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) criticising the order barely a week  after the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) welcomed it.
SIAM president Vikram Kirloskar on Thursday hit out at CCI for the order and said that it completely ignores safety of consumers. Ironically, his statements came at sidelines of the annual session of ACMA that had lauded the verdict last Thursday.
“The safety of consumers has been completely ignored by the CCI … the aftermarket for spare parts is just not structured. There is a wide chasm between strict quality standards of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and the independent free for all garages,” Kirloskar said. “It also demonstrates that government departments are working in isolation and on narrow mandates.”
Vinnie Mehta, director general of ACMA, meanwhile said that it was critical that there is an open market for auto-components as it would be in the best interest of the consumers.
“Similar regulatory frameworks have also been established in Europe and certain states in the USA,” said Mehta.
“Further, the aftermarket in India is plagued with counterfeit and spurious components and allowing larger number of organised players in the market will not only improve the product offering but will also enrich the customer experience of vehicle ownership, thus positively impacting the overall image of the automotive industry,” Mehta added.
The anti-monopoly watchdog had found 14 car manufacturers including market leader Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota and Honda, guilty of violating trade norms by restricting sale of authorised spare parts in the open market. While the Delhi High Court has already put a stay on fine imposed on Maruti Suzuki by CCI, Tata Motors and M&M have said they would challenge the order. CCI also believes that manufacturers price spare parts arbitrarily with very high mark up from an average 100% to as high as 5,000%.
According ICRA, the size of the component industry in India is around two-thirds that of the OEMs while in developed countries, where restrictions are minimal, it is almost as big or in some cases bigger.

Final call on thorny tax avoidance rules and GAAR likely by Feb 2015Final call on thorny tax avoidance rules and GAAR likely by Feb 2015
Mahua Venkatesh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 15, 2014

The Centre is likely to take a final call on the controversial General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) only by next February. The decision may well be announced by finance minister Arun Jaitley in his next Budget presentation.
“The finance ministry has started holding discussions on the issue but no hurried decision will be taken on the matter. We will study it carefully and come to a fair and appropriate conclusion,” a senior government official who did not wish to be identified told Hindustan Times. “It is not a simple matter and will take some time,” the official added.
According to existing rules, GAAR will come into effect from April 1, 2015.
In a press conference recently, Jaitley said the issue would now be studied in detail. He also said that retrospective tax was a “retrograde idea”, which sent a negative signal to the world at large and resulted in the drying up of investments.
The implementation of GAAR was announced by Pranab Mukherjee in 2012-13 when he was the finance minister. It gives power to the revenue department to invalidate any transaction that has been undertaken to deliberately to avoid tax and was made applicable to those claiming tax benefits of over Rs. 3 crore.
Foreign investors in particular are wary that the ambiguous wording of the rules gives tax authorities the power to misuse the law. This is one of the reasons why investments in India have dried up in the last few years.
Following the widespread outcry against GAAR, the UPA government set up a panel headed by economist Parthasarathi Shome, which recommended, among other things, that GAAR be deferred by three years to 2016-17.
After the new NDA government tool charge at the Centre in May, there was widespread hope that GAAR would be abolished. That has not yet happened but Jaitley has said the Narendra Modi-led government will not create fresh liabilities for investors by levying taxes with retrospective effect.

FIIs pour in 17K cr in two weeks of SeptemberComments
Continuing to bet on the government's reforms agenda, overseas investors have pumped in a whopping Rs. 17,000 crore in the Indian capital market since the beginning of September.
Net investments by foreign investors in the equity market were Rs. 6,665 crore (USD 1.1 billion) from September 1 to 12, while they infused a net amount of Rs. 10,432 crore (USD 1.72 billion) in the debt market during the period, taking the total to Rs. 17,098 crore (USD 2.8 billion), as per the latest official data.
Market analysts maintain that overseas investors (Foreign Institutional Investors, sub-accounts or foreign portfolio investors) have been betting on the Indian market mainly on account of the reforms agenda of the new government at the Centre.
They anticipate that inflows would continue in the coming months on a slew of measures announced by the government.
Since the beginning of the year, foreign investors have made a net investment of Rs. 1.98 lakh crore (USD 33 billion) into the country's securities market. This includes a net investment of Rs. 85,000 crore in equities and Rs. 1.12 lakh crore into debt market.
FIIs, the main driver of the equity market, have helped push up the benchmark BSE Sensex by 1.58% so far this month and is now moving above 27,000 level.
Strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of FIIs into India to USD 204 billion, or Rs. 9.88 lakh crore, in nearly 22 year period.
This is based on the data since November 1992 when the FIIs began investing into Indian markets and includes about USD 160 billion investments into equities and about USD 44 billion in debt markets.
From June, FIIs along with sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by market regulator Sebi to create a new investor category called Foreign Portfolio Investors.

New five-year foreign trade policy by September-endComments
The government will announce a new five-year foreign trade policy this month, which is likely to include incentives for domestic value-added products, new rules for special economic zones (SEZs) and a probable review of free trade agreements (FTAs) that India had signed with various countries and group of nations.
Last week, commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the new foreign trade policy (2014-19) will be “different”.
The export policy is also likely to have incentives for “domestic value addition (DVA)” — the proportion of exports truly produced in India that will be dovetailed with the “Make in India” programme, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil later this month.
A higher DVA component in exports is important for job creation and boosting domestic manufacturing. “The DVA component in exports has been declining — alternatively the foreign value-added (FVA) portion of exports has been on the rise due to greater integration with the global supply chain,” Crisil, a credit rating and research firm, said in a recent research report.
In the textile sector, for instance, the FVA component of exports has more than doubled from 8% in 1995 to 18% in 2009. A similar trend was seen in electrical equipment and other manufacturing exports as well.
The government was also examining the tax policies governing SEZs including the minimum alternate tax (MAT) and the dividend distribution tax (DDT) levied on these export-focussed duty free enclaves.
“The SEZ norms could be relaxed and made more flexible to allow units to sell their products in India also,” a source said.
The SEZ developers have been demanding a roll-back of MAT, which was first imposed in 2012, as well as easing of the DDT on SEZs.

India, Pakistan settle gas pricing formula as trade talks gain ground

(India is considering a proposal…)
NEW DELHI: Islamabad has agreed to a pricing formula for import of natural gas from India, a silver lining in an otherwise fractious relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours. The agreement follows discussions last month between GAIL India and the Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS) of Pakistan.
In 2012, India had offered to export up to 5 million cubic metres of gas per day to Pakistan for an initial period of five years. The two nations, however, had failed to fix a price. "Gas pricing was the biggest hurdle, but it is finally settled. This will provide gas at an economical price to our neighbour once the pipeline operationalises", said an Indian official.
India will import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and send it to energy deficient Pakistan via a pipeline between Jalandhar and Wagah. The pipeline, in which GAIL is investing about Rs 500 crore, is likely to be operational in a year. LNG will be imported from Qatar through terminals in Maharashtra or Gujarat and then moved through GAIL's existing pipeline network to Jalandhar. Under the agreement, LNG will be gassified by the Indian side as Pakistan does not have an LNG import facility.
In this year's budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has granted basic customs duty exemption of 5 per cent on re-gasified LNG for supply to Pakistan. "Pakistan will be offered the LNG without charging the marketing premium", the official said. The development gives a fillip to bilateral energy talks after India last month called off foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan in protest against Pakistan envoy's meeting with Kashmir separatists.
Later this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of UN General Assembly in the US. India is also in talks to supply electricity to Pakistan through a grid corridor that can carry 500-1,000 mw electricity.
"A small part of Pakistani grid will connect with the Indian grid system. The mechanism is being worked out," the same official said. According to a Pakistani newspaper, the country's is able to meet only 65 per cent of its energy needs through its own resources.
"The commercial decisions are preceding the dialogue process. Energy trade will be the game-changer and trade will automatically follow," said Nisha Taneja, professor at research organisation ICRIER .
"Instead of forcing trade, we are giving a lifeline to their economy. The government is not announcing it, but these signals are far stronger. It is a paradigm shift again."
The official quoted earlier said, "The India-Pakistan gas pipeline will give confidence to get into an agreement with Pakistan for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline, which will bring Turkmen gas to India."
India is also considering a proposal to allow Indian and Pakistani businessmen to meet at the Wagah border so proposals can be discussed in neutral territory without travel visas. "This will provide opportunity to businessmen to discuss proposals and exchange samples without having to go through the hassles of a visa," said another official. However, this will go through once official-level talks resume.

Parties get ready for assembly polls in MaharashtraAssembly polls
(The elections to the assembly…)
MUMBAI: A day after Shiv Sena MP and party's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut made a public statement claiming that the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra will be only from the Shiv Sena, the leader of opposition in Maharashtra assembly and one of the senior most MLAs of BJP Eknath Khadase said on Sunday that the chief minister of the saffron alliance will be decided on the basis of who (Shiv Sena or BJP) gets more seats in the next assembly. The tussle between two senior leaders of the saffron alliance has exposed the differences between them over key issues.
After the war of words between two of the senior-most leaders from both sides of the Sena-BJP alliance exposed the differences between them, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray stepped in on Sunday evening to say that since the Sena-BJP alliance is over 25 years old, it will not break and the two saffron alliance partners will go into elections together. BJP leader Amit Shah will arrive in Mumbai on Wednesday meet top leaders of the Sena to resolve the issue, said a Sena leader.
"Sena and BJP have been together for a long time and we have earlier shared power at the Centre and in the state, but it is obvious that the next chief minister of Maharashtra will be only from the Shiv Sena" Sanjay Raut said on Sunday. Earlier, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, of which Raut is the Editor, had taken a hardline in its editorial claiming that there will be no compromise in the seat-sharing talks and the Sena would not concede any more seats to the BJP.
The BJP too took a tough stand on Sunday by saying that the CM's position will be decided on the basis of who wins more MLAs in the new assembly. "It's a formula that is accepted all over. In any alliance, it is a thumb rule that the party that wins more seats will get the chief minister's position. Nobody should take anything for granted," said BJP's Eknath Khadase. While senior alliance leaders were making statements, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray stepped in to calm down the situation on Sunday. "This is an alliance which has lasted for 25 years. Perhaps there is no other political alliance in the country which is so old. We have been together through thick and thin so we will contest these polls as partners, Uddhav said.
Five Battlegrounds
Vidarbha
With 60 assembly seats, the cotton producing region infamous for farmers suicides is crucial to the Congress's political fortunes. Of the 10 Lok Sabha seats, the BJP won in six and the Sena in four. BJP backs the agitations for a separate state, even if ally Sena is against it.
Western Maharashtra
This sugar bowl and pocket borough of the NCP is the reason why the party saved some face in the recent Lok Sabha polls, winning four of the seven candidates fielded. However the victory came as a wakeup call: Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule won with a thin margin of 67.000 votes. NCP's use of sugar co operatives to ensure its hold over voters is no longer working with many of the NCP leaders jumping ship and joining the BJP. Pawar's arch rival and Swabhimaani Shetkari Sanghatana(SSS) chief Raju Shetti, who is an important reason why NCP influence is on the wane across the region with 78 assembly seats.
PUBLIC SUPPORT: Too close to call in Western Maharashtra. Only if the Sena-BJP manages to placate the SSS and field proper candidates would the saffron combine be able to effectively challenge Pawar's fiefdom.
Marathwada
This land has provided most Congress chief ministers, helping the party consolidate its hold in the region. Following the death of Vilasrao Deshmukh and Adarsh scam-tained Ashok Chavan losing CM post, the party has lost its clout in the region. During Lok Sabha polls, the Congress managed to win only two seats, Nanded and Hingoli.
PUBLIC SUPPORT: More tilted towards the Sena-BJP due to Modi wave and Munde's death
North Maharashtra
BJP's fortunes have been on the upswing in North Maharashtra for a number of years, but this year it managed to create a huge upset when party candidate Heena Gavit defeated nine time Congress MP Manikrao Gavit from Nandurbar.
PUBLIC SUPPORT: BJP dominates
  Mumbai-Thane
The urban region comprising 60 seats is what could hurt the Congress-NCP most. In 2009, the Congress won 17 out of 36 seats in Mumbai, this time top party leaders have put the best estimate at six. They predict a similar result for Thane.
PUBLIC SUPPORT: Congress-NCP leaders fear their washout.
ALL THE TALL MEN
Ajit Pawar
Dy. CM, Maharashtra and NCP's most influential leader
The man said to be driving the hard bargain with Congress over seat sharing. Ajit is pushing for more seats as he feels his time has come for becoming the Chief Minister. Ajit has been feeling nervous with the ascent of Supriya Sule's entry and wants the top post to consolidate his hold. The elections are crucial as a section of the party has been blaming him for the Lok Sabha debacle.

(A pronounced Modi wave swept…)
Jat Strongholds
A pronounced Modi wave swept Haryana during Lok Sabha elections, 2014 and the BJP won seven out of the eight seats it contested. But the Jat strongholds of Jind, Sonepat, Rohtak and Hisar lived up to their reputation of being anti-BJP, which lost on account of not having any prominent Jat leaders.
Both the BJP and HJC lost in Rohtak and Hisar, respectively. Rohtak seat was won by Deepender Hooda, son of chief minister Bhupidner Singh Hooda. In Sonepat, BJP's Ramesh Chander won the Lok Sabha seat. But the Congress managed lead in the three assembly segments.
Ahir or Yadav strongholds
Modi wave and induction of Congress rebels by the BJP augured well for the party in the region comprising districts of Gurgaon,Rewari, Mehendargarh. The BJP's strategy of fielding the Congress rebels paid off well.
THREE STRONGMEN
Bhupinder S Hooda
Chief Minister and campaign's most prominent leader
Having been Chief Minister for two continuous terms, Bhupinder Singh Hooda has odds stacked against him as he seeks public mandate for the third term in state assembly. In the electoral battle this time, the Jat strongman will have to overcome defections by senior leaders, a resurgent BJP, antiincumbency and corruption allegations against his decadeold rule. Adding to his woes is the dismal performance by the Grand Old Party during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.
During previous state assembly election, the Congress barely managed to get enough numbers for forming a government (it won 40 out of 90). Five defectors from the Haryana Janhit Congress and seven-independents were taken on board to muster enough numbers. Backed by the high command, Hooda has emerged as the undisputed Jat leader within the party in the second term. But the growth has come at a price. The party lost senior colleagues who joined rivals.
Abhay Chautala
INLD's most active politician and its public face
Chautala holds the fort for the main opposition party Indian National Lok Dal, since 2013 when its top leaders like. former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala and son Ajay were jailed in teachers' recruitment case. In the absence of his father, he had led the party into the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He is credited with the party's win in two seats in parliamentary polls.
He will again represent the Chautala clan, in absence of OP Chautala. The INLD's adversity has moulded him into a diplomatic leader. Under his supervision, the party will strive to repeat or improve its performance of 2009 when it won 31 seats. With the BJP likely to play a prominent role in the multi-cornered contest, the road will be tough for the local party. The party will rely on the star campaigners from its ally Shiromani Akali Dal during campaigning, in absence of its charismatic leaders.
Kuldeep Bishnoi
HJC's supremo faced with an unenviable task of leading the party to victory against its erstwhile ally BJP's resurgence.
The political fortunes of Haryana Janhit Congress supremo have gone downhill after he called off his alliance with the BJP. The separation with the BJP has marginalised the appeal of his party to a few pockets mainly with concentration of non-Jat voters. But the breakaway has brought another dimension to the political scenario. Distanced from the BJP, the HJC could cosy up to the Congress, especially in a post poll scenario.
In 2009, five out of six-MLAs of HJC had defected to Congress after the ruling party failed to muster up numbers in the 90-seat state assembly.

India to get industrial parks with China s helpChina
(China, which will clinch…)
QUANZHOU: Smart cities are just one aspect of a modern India that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dreaming. The other crucial element of the 21st century India will be the massive industrial parks that would also contribute significantly to make the country a manufacturing hub as planned by this NDA government.
China, which will clinch a deal to set up two industrial parks in Gujarat and Maharashtra during President Xi Jinping's visit from September 17, has expertise in creating such zones. Currently, there are 200 industrial parks across the world's most populated country and the biggest one with 200 firms over 200 sq kms is coming up on the outskirts of this city.
Shanghai, the commercial hub of the country alone boasts of 39 industrial parks and zones. These parks are of varying sizes and manufacture range of products However, a critical aspect associated with the industrial park is the displacement of local people while acquiring the land. Displacement and rehabilitation of locals could be the challenge for the Modi government while setting up the industrial parks. Gujarat had earlier faced decadeslong agitation over rehabilitation of local residents over Narmada dam.
Several other Indian states have faced strong opposition over rehabilitation of residents following land acquisition over industries. A 10-sq km industrial park near Ahmedabad will be set up with Chinese assistance and this will attract investments in excess of one billion USD, sources informed.
This park would have main focus on power transmission and generation equipment manufacturing. This park will also have banks, hotels, schools, recreational centres and other facilities.
Gujarat has the presence of Chinese companies in this sector, including Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co.(TWBB), China Light and Power Company, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co. Ltd(TBEA), Highly etc. Interestingly, Adani group has a unit in China for power sector machine manufacturing.
During Xi's trip China will also sign an MoU for another Industrial park in Pune which will be in 6 sq kms and will attract $5 billion investment mainly in automobile manufacturing sector in phases over the next decade. First phase of Pune park which would require investments in excess of $500 million will be completed in three years.
Last June during vice-president Hamid Ansari's visit, India and China had signed an MoU which outlined the work to set up four industrial parks.

India may seek help from G-20 to endorse its black money driveBlack Money
(Swiss National Bank reported…)
NEW DELHI: India will try and rally the G-20 in its drive to unearth black money salted away by its citizens in Switzerland and other tax havens by pushing for the inclusion of a provision related to this on retrospective sharing of information. The latter, aimed at tackling tax avoidance and evasion, will be based on the new global information sharing format prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD .
Finance ministers of G-20 will meet later this week in Australia where they will endorse the information-sharing proposal. India's attempts to seek information from Switzerland, which has strict secrecy laws, on the black money purportedly stashed in its banks have run into a dead end.
Switzerland has said the information sharing pact it has with India became effective from 2011 and it will not provide any information about accounts before that date. India will be represented by minister of state for finance Nirmala Sitharaman at the G-20.
"We have made huge progress with regard to information sharing... We want this to become more meaningful and for that it's important that countries share data on bank accounts with retrospective basis," said a finance ministry official, adding India will try and rally the G-20 on the issue.
Illegal Indian money said to be in Swiss banks has long been a political issue and the new government does not want to ease up on efforts to chase the funds down, particularly with the courts also taking an interest. India entered into a new treaty with Switzerland that came into effect in November 2011, providing for sharing of information on bank accounts.
The Swiss National Bank has reported on its website that the total deposit of Indians increased to about Rs 14,100 crore at the end of 2013 from about Rs 8,547 crore a year ago. Apart from refusing to share information prior to 2011, it has cited domestic laws to stonewall queries from India on bank account holders.
Frustrated by this, India had raised the issue of information sharing on tax offenders at the G-20 earlier as well, arguing that countries and tax havens were citing these provisions as an excuse.
"You need information on bank accounts prior to the agreement becoming effective... Sometimes tax offenders close one account and shift to another jurisdiction," said the official cited above. "For effective and meaning full exchange of information this is important." The official said a global agreement would be more effective in making countries reluctant to share information come on board.

(Rahul Gandhi is all set to…)
NEW DELHI: Nearly four months after its crippling defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress central leadership is set to begin work on a blueprint of action-plan to revive the Grand Old Party by giving it new thrust areas and a new working style. Congress VP Rahul Gandhi , who is returning to Delhi on Tuesday after a brief trip abroad, will initiate consultations from September 20 with party leaders for framing Congress' roadmap.
The leadership has set an October end deadline - around Diwali - to formally unveil its post-defeat action-plan for recovery by calling a special AICC session or a chintanshivar (brain-storming session), a senior Congress leader told ET.
"By the second half of October, the leadership is hoping to come out with an action-plan that will give Congress a new direction and thrust areas to make the party cope with challenging times ahead and to help the party respond to aspirations of a rapidly changing Indian society," the source added.
During his consultations, Gandhi will underline the importance of unity in the party. The findings of the AK Antony panel that probed the Congress LS poll defeat will be an additional input for the consolations.
"By October 19, the results of the Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections will be out. The leadership may call a special session around Diwali, which is on October 23," the source added. The much-anticipated reshuffle of the Congress Working Committee and AICC secretariat too could take place only around that time even though some sections in the party are pressing for making early changes.
Sources said Rahul "will play the central role" in framing the new action-plan with party president Sonia Gandhi playing a supporting role. Some senior Congress leaders will play an active role in aiding Rahul to finalise the plan.
On the thrust of the blueprint, the source recalled how Gandhi had publically stated last December - after the Congress defeat Delhi, MP and Chhattisgarh polls - the need to reform Congress functioning. Gandhi had then said: "Congress has the ability to stand up to the expectations of the people. I am going to put all my efforts to transform the organisation of the party. I am going to make sure that a transformation happens, and I will do it in ways in which you cannot even imagine. We will involve people (in the party) in a way you cannot even imagine right now."
Following the LS poll defeat, there has been a lot of in-house criticism about the new experiments the Team Rahul had introduced. After scripting the 'Old Vs Young clash', the 'Rahul Brigade' was recently forced to cancel its part-II of protest after the Gandhis indicated their strong disproval of their conduct.

Congress moves PM Modi for re-probe into Centaur Hotels saleCongress
(In the wake of CBI action…)
NEW DELHI: In the wake of CBI action in the sale of Udaipur's Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel , Congress has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the probe agency to reinvestigate the sale of two Centaur Hotels in Mumbai some 14 years ago.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, AICC Secretary Sanjay Nirupam said that CBI should file an FIR in the matter so that the perpetrators including government officials and the ministers concerned are brought to book.
Making a strong plea for a reinvestigation, he said this was needed as the probe into the sale of two Centaur Hotels at Airport and at Juhu in Mumbai belonging to the Hotel Corporation of India during the BJP-led NDA government in 2001-2002 has not seen the light of the day.
He said that the Airport Centaur Hotel was first sold to Batra Hospitality Pvt Ltd for Rs 83 crore.
"However within four months of the disinvestment, Batra Hospitality Pvt Ltd resold the property to Sahara Hospitality Pvt Ltd for a profit of Rs 32 crore despite a specific clause in the agreement that it was non-assignable for two years," Nirupam claimed.
Thus the sale agreement signed between private entity Batra Hospitality Pvt Ltd and the Govt of India was "clearly breached", he wrote.
Similarly the 317-room Juhu Centaur Hotel, a prime property on Juhu Beach, was sold to Tulip Hospitality Service Pvt Ltd for Rs 153 crore.
"The fact that Centaur Hotel, Juhu is now up for resale with a base price of Rs 1300 crore in the tender issued proves beyond doubt that they were grossly unvalued in the previous sale," Nirupam wrote.
He said he wrote the letter in view of the fact that the CBI has booked the then Disinvestment Secretary in connection with the sale of the Udaipur hotel.

UPA government blocked reforms to empower CAG: Vinod RaiCAG
(Vinod Rai says CAG’s office…)
NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the finance ministry stymied a critical five-year old reform proposal to strengthen the office of the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) of India by enabling it to audit all public private partnerships (PPPs) while setting deadlines for the government to provide information to the auditor and table its findings, ex-CAG Vinod Rai told ET.
Rai expressed optimism that the Narendra Modi government elected to power on 'its avowed declaration of fighting crony capitalism and corruption', would take up the necessary 'minimalistic amendments' to the 1971 CAG law in order to empower the auditor's office, which he claimed had been backed by former finance minister and the present President Pranab Mukherjee in September 2009.
But months later, under intense scrutiny from the auditor over myriad corruption scandals such as the 2G and Coal block allocation, the UPA put CAG's formal request for strengthening its hand in cold storage. Mukherjee, his successor P Chidambaram and Singh didn't respond to any communiques about the reform proposal from the CAG. "I don't understand why (the UPA chose to ignore the issue)...At first, I thought they were not willing to implement it because of me. But if that were the case, they could have done it after I retired," the ex-CAG told ET, hinting at the animosity displayed towards him by Congress ministers. In his book, Rai elaborates the various derogatory barbs used by ministers to describe him such as the 'R-virus' and the 'Bhumihar from Ghazipur', calling it a sign of the lack of decorum and respect politicians now have for constitutional authorities.
"The CAG's office made numerous enquiries. I wrote reminder letters to finance ministers, with no response. No finance minister has had time to reply. I wrote to the Prime Minister. Silence," Rai said. "The minimalistic amendments we had sought are still pending and I hope they are now taken up," he said.
He stressed that the joint ventures, PPPs and other new delivery models used for government spending were not envisaged in the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act of 1971. Whether CAG can audit PPPs, a model the government hopes to build half of its trillion dollar infrastructure target with, has been a bone of contention between the auditor's office and private sector firms working on government projects and contracts. When the CAG kicked off a performance audit of gas blocks awarded under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy, 'some of the operators and, in particular, Reliance Industries Limited , questioned the mandate of the CAG', Rai notes in his book.

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who is under fire from the former CAG Vinod Rai over the 2G spectrum scam and Coalgate , today said he has done his "duty" and refused to respond to charges levelled against him.
"I, indeed, did my duty. Well, I do not want to comment on other people what they have written," Singh told reporters on the sidelines of an event here to celebrate the publication of a book titled 'Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan', authored by his daughter Daman Singh.
Singh was asked about the scathing criticism by Rai who held the former PM responsible for the controversial decisions to allocate 2G spectrum on first-cum-first serve basis and coal blocks without auction.
Interestingly, Daman skirted questions about the ex-CAG's comments.
"Actually, I do not know anything about that. So I cannot comment. I have no idea about that. I have not heard what they have said. I cannot say anything. I really do not know and I have not heard what they have said. So, there is no point in saying anything," she said.
Daman charts the journey of her parents in her book providing new insights into the couple but keeps away from the last 10 years when Singh was heading the UPA government.
The function was attended among others by former Deputy Planning Commission chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and ex-minister Shashi Tharoor.

02:30pm Lupin at record high
Shares of Lupin hit a record high of Rs 1,386 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on a media report that the company is in advanced talks to sign a blockbuster deal with Merck Serono.
As part of the deal, Lupin will manufacture Merck Serono's USD 1.5 billion worth branded mature drugs at its facilities, a media report said quoting unnamed sources.
Meanwhile, Citi says business development remains a core part of Lupin's growth strategy, with the latest deal (Salix) providing it a good foothold in Canada.

02:20pm Rupee weakens further
Indian rupee is trading at 61.10 a dollar, down 45 paise compared to Friday's close.
Brokerage house Emkay Share & Stock Brokers feels a combination of global events, slower-than-expected GDP growth and a fairly valued rupee could drag the currency down to 63-64 to the dollar over the next six months.
In the last few months, the dollar has strengthened against developing market currencies, mainly the Euro, due to the diverging monetary policies being followed by the US Fed and the ECB.
The dollar index has been now climbing for 9 weeks in a row and is currently trading above 84, with the US dollar quoting close to a six-year high against the Japanese.
But the strength in emerging market currencies is unlikely to sustain, and a trend reversal is on the cards, feels Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Research, Emkay.

Further, August fuel inflation also hit a five-year low with the fuel and power group inflation declining to 4.54 percent versus 7.40 percent (MoM).

Govt considers closing some loss-making state firmsSanjeev Miglani and Manoj Kumar        Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 21:58 IST
Government officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals to shut down some loss-making state-owned companies, risking a conflict with powerful trade unions.
After two decades of halting privatisations, the central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level, involved in activities ranging from generating nuclear power to making condoms.
Some of them, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Steel Authority of India are successful, but there are dozens more that have been bleeding cash for decades and kept afloat by budgetary support each year.
On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 24,500 crore ($4 billion) in 2012/13.
The list includes Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Air India , Hindustan Photofilms and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation, according to a note prepared by the Department of Public Enterprises.
Officials at the department have drawn up proposals to close some.
They include Hindustan Photofilms, a company set up in 1960 to make film rolls and take on the likes of Kodak but declared a sick company in 1996 and recommended for closure by the department in 2003 on the grounds that it could not compete with private players.
The company, based in the southern town of Ottacamund in the Nilgiri hills, went to court and won a stay order on any further proceedings that could lead to its closure.
In 2010 the firm proposed a recovery plan but the government has been sitting on it, with no decision having been made since about the company's future. In the meantime the company's accumulated losses have piled up to 82.32 billion rupees, about 40 times its paid-up capital.
"There is no future for this company in the current environment. It is a fit case for winding down," said a government official at the Department of Public Enterprises, which is overseeing the privatisation of state firms. The official did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The department will be making a presentation at Tuesday's meeting.
The government is also considering a proposal to wind down the watch-making division of HMT Machine Tool Limited after years of losses that have forced it to borrow from the government to pay wages.
UNIONS
Trade unions are opposed to any moves to shut down state firms and the Bharatiya Mazadoor Sangh (BMS), a body affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would work with other unions to block the move.
"We are co-ordinating with all central trade unions on the matter. We are fortunate that all trade unions are on the same page when it comes to these issues," said Vrijesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the BMS.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which took office in May pledging to reignite growth, has embarked on a cautious course of shedding stakes in state firms although it has eschewed big moves.
The government increased its privatisation target for its fiscal year 2014/15 budget to Rs 63,000 crore from the interim budget's target of Rs 48,000 crore. The target is nearly four times larger than total government divestments in the past four years.
Officials said the government was also looking for ways to revive some of the sick companies through capital infusion, joint ventures and by bringing in new management.

Gold Imports Surge to $2.03 Billion in August
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 23:03 (IST)
RBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
New Delhi: Gold imports surged to $2.03 billion last month from $738.7 million in August 2013.
However, in July, gold imports declined 26.39 per cent to $1.81 billion. Last time in June, imports were up after declining for continuous seven months.
The high imports have marginally pushed up the country's trade deficit to $10.83 billion in the month under review. ( Read more )
The government had imposed restrictions on inbound shipments of the precious metal to narrow the current account deficit.
India's current account deficit, which is the excess of foreign exchange outflows over inflows, touched a historic high of 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, mainly due to rising imports of petroleum products and gold.
However, it narrowed sharply to 1.7 per cent of GDP in the April-June quarter of this fiscal year due to decline in gold imports.
The government had increased customs duty on gold to 10 per cent and banned import of gold coins and medallions, while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) linked imports of the metal to exports.
India is the largest importer of gold, which is mainly utilised to meet the demand of the jewellery industry.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry is pitching for easing of the gold import restrictions to boost gems and jewellery exports, which dropped 10.31 per cent in August to $3.23 billion.

Offer for Lucchini Below $100 Mn: JSWFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Mumbai/London: JSW Steel has offered less than $100 million (Rs 600 crore at 1 dollar = 60 rupees) for troubled Italian steelmaker Lucchini's core assets in Piombino and will not take on any of the company's debt, JSW chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Monday.
The comments were Mr Jindal's first since Lucchini, Italy's second-largest steelmaker by capacity, announced late last week that it was considering a binding offer from JSW.
"The Lucchini acquisition cost will be sub-$100 million," Mr Jindal told reporters on the sidelines of a Mumbai lecture series, adding that JSW would not take on any debt.
A spokesman for Lucchini declined to comment.
Lucchini, previously owned by Russia's Severstal, was declared insolvent in 2012 and placed under special administration - a procedure designed to save large companies and avoid heavy job losses.
Italian media reports had previously speculated that heavy liabilities and a need to protect jobs meant that Lucchini could be sold for only one euro.
"The fact that JSW are not assuming any debt is positive. EU steel demand is about 30 per cent below the 2008 financial crisis, and Italy was back in recession in Q2 2014, so JSW are not buying something that has upside in the short or even the medium term," said VTB Capital's head of commodities research, Wiktor Bielski.
The Piombino complex employs about 2,000 people and can produce 2.5 million tonnes of steel a year. The Italian government has taken a keen interest in its sale as it struggles to pull the country out of its third recession in six years.

Microsoft buys Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion  founders to leaveSep 16, 2014 at 06:41am IST
Microsoft buys Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion, founders to leave
24
0
Stockholm/Seattle: Microsoft has agreed to acquire the Stockholm-based developer of the wildly popular Minecraft video game for $2.5 billion, as it tries to lure a new and mostly young audience into its mobile world.
Minecraft - a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world - has spread like wildfire since its full release by developer Mojang in 2011.
ALSO SEE Why Microsoft is buying Minecraft-maker Mojang for a reported $2.5 billion
Minecraft is the top paid-for app both on Apple's iOS and Google's Android systems and helped Mojang, which employs just 40 people, bring in 2.05 billion crowns ($287 million) in revenue in 2013, giving it an 896 million crown ($126 million) operating profit for the year.
Minecraft was launched as a PC game, but about 40 per cent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets.
#mojang #minecraft #mictosoft #acquisitions
Director of website Gamesbrief Nicholas Lovell described Minecraft as a hugely successful product which has "captured the imagination of pretty much everybody under the age of 15", saying the game could help Microsoft broaden its appeal.
While the Mojang team will join Microsoft studios behind global franchises such as Halo and Fable, its three co-founders, who have been chased by the likes of Napster co-founder and early Facebook investor Sean Parker, will be leaving to start new projects.
As if to erase any doubts about the importance of gaming, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was a "top activity" spanning devices from PCs and consoles to tablets and mobiles, with billions of hours devoted to it each year.
"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise - it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft," Nadella said on Monday.
Microsoft has spent lavishly in the Nordic region in recent years, buying the handset business of Nokia for $7.2 billion in a deal which closed this year. In 2011, it spent $8.5 billion on Skype, which has its roots in Scandinavia and the Baltics.
Some analysts were positive about the acquisition.
"The news robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of Microsoft's strategic direction and also underlines the growing importance of independent titles alongside big-budget games," Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Technology, wrote in a note.
FBR Capital Markets said the deal gave Nadella "the right product at the right time," as Microsoft invests in its Xbox strategy and moves into the intensely competitive mobile phone sector with Nokia under its hood.
Just five years old, Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, who developed the hit Minecraft game after previously working at Sweden's King Digital Entertainment, maker of the Candy Crush Saga game.
Not about the money
News of the Microsoft deal surprised some Minecraft players who know Persson, or "Notch" as he is commonly known, more for his anti-big business stance. But he explained the reasons behind the deal in a blog shortly after the deal was announced.
"As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately," Persson said in the blog posted on his Twitter feed.
"I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can't be responsible for something this big," he said. "It's not about the money. It's about my sanity."
Notch, 35, owns 71 per cent of Mojang through his company Notch Development AB and stands to become a billionaire if the deal goes through. JP Morgan was the sole advisor to Mojang on the sale.
Analysts have said Microsoft's purchase of Mojang is more aimed at pulling users onto its obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console.
Minecraft was launched as a PC game, but about 40 per cent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets.
In accounting terms, Microsoft expects the acquisition, which should close late in 2014, will break even in its current 2015 fiscal year.
A $2.5 billion deal for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year, is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments. But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions.
Japan's SoftBank paid $1.53 billion for a 50 per cent stake in Finland's Supercell last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales. Electronic Arts' (EA) $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued at around 10 to 11 times sales.
The Nordic region, also home to Angry Birds maker Rovio, has emerged as an important player in the gaming world, thanks to its long, dark winters and highly connected societies.
EA snapped up Swedish video game maker DICE, best known for the Battlefield franchise, in 2006, and the sale of Mojang comes hard on the heels of King's listing on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.
"It's another acknowledgement of the Swedish games industry and the technology that we produce, that a company like Microsoft wants to invest enormous amounts here," said Per Stromback, spokesman for the Swedish Games Industry.

CBI Chief alleged to have met 2G accused at his house
The Supreme Court on Monday told lawyer Prashant Bhushan that it would consider his allegation that CBI Director Ranjit Sinha frequently met people accused in the 2G scam, provided he named the source of his information in a sealed cover.
A Bench comprising Justices H.L. Dattu and S.A. Bobde said the affidavit filed by Mr. Bhushan, as the lawyer for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, whose petition led the court to cancel 122 2G licences, was not in consonance with procedures on how information from whistleblowers should be passed on to the court as evidence. Mr. Bhushan had handed over the visitor register at the CBI chief’s residence and other documents to the court. He said a person dropped them at his house at night.
Bhushan’s charge will tarnish image: CBI chief
In response, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha told the Court that lawyer Prashant Bhushan’s allegation he met several persons accused in the 2G scam should be dismissed with “exemplary costs” as the source of his information was unknown.
“Unless the identity of the whistleblower is known, further proceedings based on the allegations raised would affect the sanctity of this court’s proceedings and the reputation of the CBI director,” senior lawyer Vikas Singh, appearing for Mr. Sinha, contended.
Mr. Bhushan hit back saying, “Why do you want to know the identity of the whistleblower? Identity of the whistleblower needs to given only if the court doubts the authenticity of the evidence.” “If we find there is something hanky-panky, we will order an investigation,” Justice Dattu observed.
The next date of hearing is September 22. Mr. Singh likened Mr. Bhushan’s explanation to someone saying, “I found a packet lying on the road, opened it to find these sensitive documents.” He also alleged that Mr. Bhushan was being “controlled by someone.”
“On the day Mr. Bhushan revealed to the court about the visitor’s register, a newspaper had already reported it that morning. How did they know Mr. Bhushan was going to do exactly that in court,” Mr. Singh asked. The court told Mr. Bhushan to part with the name of whistleblower in a sealed cover.

New Delhi keen on avoiding incident ahead of Xi Jinping’s visit
Keen on avoiding a diplomatic incident two days ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s arrival in India, the government played down allegations of incursions by Chinese soldiers and civilians in Jammu and Kashmir’s Chumar and Demchok sectors of Ladakh.
Refusing to confirm the reports, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said, “All I will say is our brave sentinels at the border will address any issues there are.” He also denied reports that the Defence Ministry had asked the External Affairs Ministry to take up the alleged incursions diplomatically.
Earlier in the day, an official in Leh complained that Chinese civilians had entered India and opposed work on a bund under the MGNREGS. On earlier occasions, Chinese soldiers had opposed projects along the Line of Actual Control, but this time, Divisional Commissioner S. Singh told ANI that “Chinese civilians have also come to oppose work and are showing banners.” Last month, similar reports of incursions were denied by Army Chief General Dalbir Singh.
The government is preparing for what it calls a “once-in-a-decade” event when the Chinese President lands in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. This is only the third visit by a Chinese President.

New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party Core Committee to meet at Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's residence in the national capital on Tuesday to discuss seat sharing issue in Maharashtra ahead of Assembly elections.
The meeting will take place at 11 AM.
The trouble has been brewing in the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance as the former rejected the 135-seat sharing compromise formula offered by the latter for state Assembly elections. The Sena was adamant and said it will contest on at least 150 seats in the 288-member Assembly.
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.
#bjp #bjp core committee #maharashtra #maharashtra seat sharing
The BJP had offered the compromise formula after the Sena threatened to snap ties.
Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had said, "We are already holding discussions with BJP. Whenever something will be decided you will know."
On Sunday, BJP leader in-charge of Maharashtra affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy said the party had proposed that after allotting respective share of seats to smaller alliance partners, including RPI (Athavale) and Swabhiman Party led by Raju Shetty, the remaining seats should be divided equally between BJP and Shiv Sena.
"Based on this, we expect to contest about 135 seats, leaving the same number to Shiv Sena", Rudy had said.
Traditionally, Shiv Sena gets a larger chunk of seats in the Assembly elections, while the BJP contests more seats in Lok Sabha polls. In the 2009 Assembly polls, Shiv Sena had contested 169 seats and won 44, while BJP bagged 46 despite putting up candidates in only 119 seats.
Thackeray also sought to become the next Maharashtra Chief Minister. "I want the people to give me a chance and they will not be given a chance to complain," he had said on Saturday during an interaction organised by a private news channel.

Chances of sub-15% credit growth by FY15-end slim: HDFC08:00 am
With  State Bank of India cutting deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent , could other banks soon follow suit? Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of  HDFC sees more banks cutting deposit rates in the next two months. He believes SBI decided to cut rates on the back of lower-than-expected credit offtake.
According to him, in another quarter or two, credit growth will take off. He says traditionally, credit offtake is highest in the fourth quarter. "I would be surprised to see sub-15 percent credit growth by FY15 end," Mistry told CNBC-TV18.
According to him, if deposit rate across the system is lowered, then HDFC too will have to lower it. However, he was unable to give a timeline for a cut in deposit rates.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Keki Mistry's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We got early morning news from State Bank of India (SBI) that they have dropped their big bucket of deposit their one-three year deposit rates by a quarter percentage point, is this the first sign that rates are headed lower?
A: Inflation numbers clearly have come down. So with inflation numbers coming down and the credit off take probably not being as quick as or as fast as expected, they have cut down deposit rates. So yes, I think the expectation would be fair that over the next month or two we could see a few more rate cuts in the system on deposits. However, it’s too premature to say that this a long-term thing because my sense is that as the sentiments in India had got so much better in the last four or five months, it is only going to be a matter of time may be a quarter or two quarters before we see credit off take begin. When credit off take picks up, maybe some of these banks may again need to look at revising the rates upwards a little bit.
Latha: As a veteran money man how would a banker think? As soon as they cut rates, they usually pass it as lower loan rates as well, lending rates as well?
A: Not necessarily because again when you cut the rate it is only incremental deposits which come in at that lower rate. The existing loan rates don’t get revised downwards till the cycle plays out. So it may not translate into an immediate cut in anyway but over a period of time, if these rates were to prevail and the credit offtake was not to be very sharp then yes, it would translate into cuts in lending rates also.
Sonia: Over a period of time, how much do you think credit growth could pick up to? A banker was telling us earlier that credit growth is extremely sluggish about not even 10-13 percent. How much do you think it could pick up to?
A: I would be surprised if credit growth is lower than 15-16 percent for this year and my sense would be that real offtake in credit tends to pick up in Q4 of the financial year, which is January to March. Historically, if you take the last ten years, most of these ten years will find credit offtake in rupee terms is highest in Q4.
I would think that you will see a similar kind of thing emerging this year. So I would say, the reduction in interest rates on the lending side, one may have to wait a little bit till we get a more clear sense on how much further liquidity RBI is going to inject if any and how the credit offtake pays off in the system.
Latha: Once banks start their rate cutting cycle, do you think they are in a better place than finance companies, which depend on wholesale deposits because wholesale market money is not moving down so much, so do they steal a march over you when this cycle starts?
A: We have also deposits - many of the finance companies also have deposits.
Latha: You will drop the rates there?
A: Obviously, if the deposit rates overall in the banking system are lower, of course we will lower our deposit rates. May not be right away.
Latha: Should we hear from you before the month is out?
A: I don’t know about the month in particular. This is something which we review on a regular basis. So once we feel that there is enough room and that money will be available even at slightly lower rates, we can look at that. I cannot give you a time limit for that.
Sonia: What is the situation on the ground as far as liquidity is concerned? Has liquidity improved considerably such that the banks don’t want to pay higher deposit rates?
A: I would say that banks are sitting on surplus cash because credit offtake is lower, then what is the point of paying higher rates and deposits and continuing to sit on more surplus cash. That is perhaps the reason why the deposit rate cut has been in place. But if credit offtake picks up, which also can happen in the January to March quarter then banks will have to look at the liquidity position and see whether they can continue to get liquidity at those low rates that we are offering in deposits.

State elections  divestment next big triggers for market: Mehraboon Irani08:00 am
Despite the slip in the Nifty and the Sensex, Mehraboon Irani of Nirmal Bang Securities does not think it is going to be a deep correction.
He with the US Federal Reserve meet round the corner, markets tend to become volatile. But he does not see the Fed hiking rates anytime soon. “It is going to be many quarters away according to me,” he told CNBC-TV18.
He believes the next positive triggers for the market will be the state elections, divestment dues and the gas price hike.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Mehraboon Irani's interview to CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy
Sonia: What is the view on the index? Yesterday we saw the first signs of a cool off, do you think we could slip going ahead?
A: I would term it as a dent in the market and I always maintained that in a bull market or a bear market the Nifty and the Sensex don’t depict the true picture. So while the Nifty went up 30 percent, a whole lot of stocks have gone up 100-150 percent and nobody is complaining. And if you see the Nifty come down by 5-7 percent, the dent which I am referring to, you and I will term it as a correction but a whole lot of people will cry foul because quite a few stocks could come down by 20-30 percent from their present levels, it is distinctly possible. But if you ask me I don’t see that it is going to be a deep correction.
The reasons are simple, we have the Scotland referendum, then we have the Fed meet and around these events the market always becomes volatile. But with whatever data I have, I don’t see an interest rate hike coming in the US in the foreseeable future. It is going to be many quarters away according to me.
Point two is the appreciation of the US dollar. A hike in interest rates in the US even if it happens next year will coincide with a fall in interest rates in India which has never happened in the last 20-25 years. There is whole lot of expectation from this government, they are functioning well, fiscal consolidation is taking place without divestments.
I think the next positive triggers for the market will be the state elections, will be the divestment dues and will be the gas price hike. Gas price as a third factor according to me is not going to come so easily. Therefore ONGC could be the last on divestment list because there are a whole lot of factors involved in it. But all said and done there are more positives than negatives right now, the momentum is in favour. So after this minor correction I think the market should find its way back.
Latha: Yesterday the Nifty and the Sensex lost nearly 1 percent but midcaps actually rose by 0.25 percent. Do you think you can expect some severe correction in the midcaps just to keep pace?
A: Midcaps is very vast but if the Nifty corrects by 5 percent, there are a whole lot of stocks that are going to correct by 30-40 percent. And that is where people are going to say ‘my portfolio has not gone up, it has come down.’
As far as the performance goes, as of now midcaps have done much better in the last few days as compared to the frontline indices only because there is still a lot of value to be seen in certain midcaps. So as I mentioned midcaps is very vast but there are a whole lot of companies which have gone up in valuations which are absolutely crazy and even if we are 10 percent higher in the Nifty over the next 12 months, at least 25 percent of the stocks listed on the markets will be around these levels or lower than today’s levels a year later. That is where people will feel stupid and cheated because people are buying into the momentum, they are not bothered. People talk about scrip’s after they start moving and people go on chasing it. Look at some of the auto ancillary names, they have gone up four-five times without any reason. Now are these valuations justified? May be for the moment they continue to move ahead but a year later when I look at it I think the stock is at the same level or lower and that is where the problems will come and people will feel stupid.

FB app knows when you sleep and wake up'Facebook app knows when you sleep, when you wake up'
Javed Anwer        Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 11:42 IST
"Messenger knows when you are sleeping. It knows when you're awake. It knows when you're at home too, so delete it for goodness sake."
This is what Jonathan Zdziarski, a forensic researcher and iOS jailbreaker, tweeted on Thursday after pouring over the code of Facebook Messenger app for iOS. Though he did not specify if it was true for the Android app or not, it is almost given that what the Facebook app does on iOS devices, it would also do on Android phones and tablets.
According to Zdziarski, he discovered a number strings-code that tells an app to carry out several functions-within the Messenger app that are targeted at tracking a user. "Messenger appears to have more spyware type code in it than I've seen in products intended specifically for enterprise surveillance," he tweeted.
"Messenger performs analytics on everything - windows you view, everything you tap, icon badge number, application state, everything you do," added Zdziarski.
As more and more people connect their lives to the world wide web through devices like tablets and smartphones, concerns have been raised about the privacy of individuals. Smartphones are packed with sensors like accelerometer and GPS that can measure location and physical activity of a user in real time. Apps can then use information collected from these sensors in various ways.
Both Google and Apple , which make Android and iOS, respectively, have created certain rules on how apps can access and use sensitive data collected from a phone but the whole ecosystem built around smartphones is so complex that serious privacy risks remain.
For example, Google and Apple approve an app before users can download it. But the security is lax and rules are rarely enforced.
In the case of Facebook, Zdziarski hinted that it was too big a company. "I am pretty sure though that if average developers used some of the APIs Facebook is using to collect data, their app would be rejected," he tweeted.
This is not the first time, privacy concerns have been raised over a Facebook app. Last year Norton, which develops security software, flagged off the main Facebook app as a risk.
"Mobile Insight (a product created by Facebook) automatically flagged the Facebook application for Android because it leaked the device phone number. The first time you launch the Facebook application, even before logging in, your phone number will be sent over the Internet to Facebook servers. You do not need to provide your phone number, log in, initiate a specific action, or even need a Facebook account for this to happen," a Norton researcher said in a blog post.

Reliance Growth Fund Net Asset Value Crosses Rs 700 Level
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 14, 2014 18:55 (IST)
Future Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: Soon to embark on its 20th year of existence, Reliance Group Fund has seen its net asset value or NAV cross the Rs 700 level - becoming the first mutual fund scheme in the country to reach this milestone.
This also makes the per-unit-price of this midcap sector-focussed MF scheme, managed by fund house Reliance Capital Asset Management Company, higher than that of nearly half of the 30 biggest blue-chip stocks of the country that form part of the benchmark index Sensex.
"Our research team has been able to constantly remain ahead of the curve in identifying the right stocks and investment opportunities. This has given us a strong edge to offer superior returns to our investors."
"Many of our funds are among the best performers in their category. We will continue to keep our focus on intelligent and balanced stock picking," RCAM head of equities Sunil Singhania said.
The fund was launched 19 years ago in October 1995 and its value has appreciated by nearly 71 times since inception. The fund has delivered a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 25 per cent and has a corpus of over Rs 4,846 crore from lakhs of investors.
The closest competitor to this fund, in terms of vintage, is Franklin India Prime Fund that was launched in December 1993 and SBI Magnum (launched in September 1994).
Franklin India Prime Fund has a corpus of about Rs 2000 crore and has generated a CAGR of 21 per cent thereby multiplying the investors wealth by 55 per cent. The fund has an NAV of Rs 563.
SBI Magnum Global Fund 94 has an NAV of Rs 114 and has given a CAGR of 13 per cent on an AUM of Rs 1249 crore.
Reliance Growth Fund, a midcap fund, is primarily invested in financial, information technology, industrials and healthcare companies. The most invested stocks in the fund today are ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies and Aditya Birla Nuvo. 
Some of the early identifiers for the fund that have given exponential returns include Lupin, Jindal Power and Steel, United Phosphorous.
RCAM's another equity offering in large cap category - Reliance Vision Growth Fund - has crossed Rs 400 for the first time.
HDFC Equity Fund, with an NAV of Rs 460, leads the pack in this category. The two other funds that follow Reliance are Franklin India Prime Plus at an NV of 381 and HDFC Top 200 at NAV of Rs 335.
Reliance Vision Fund has a corpus of Rs 2,953 crore. HDFC Equity Fund has a corpus of Rs 14,994 crore, Franklin India Prima Plus-Growth Fund has a corpus of Rs 2,661 crore, while HDFC Top 200 Fund has a corpus of 12,430 crore.

MFs Plan More Equity-Oriented Funds to Cash in on RallyFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Mumbai: Enthused by the ongoing rally in the stock markets, mutual fund houses are bullish about industry growth driven by equity-oriented funds.
It may be noted that the Sensex has been the best performing index so far this fiscal year, rallying over 32 per cent in dollar terms year-to-date.
Despite concerns over "tapering", foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been pumping money into domestic equities, which have crossed $13 billion, making India one of the largest recipients amongst emerging markets.
MF players like ICICI Asset Management Company and Union KBC Asset Management Company plan to launch more equity-oriented funds to cash in on the boom.
Union KBC Asset Management Company, which at present manages six funds including three funds in the mid and small-cap categories in equities alone, plans to launch two more funds by FY15-end, including an equity fund and a capital protection fund.
"We have plans to launch two more products by the fiscal-end. While the first one will be in the equity category, the other one will be a capital protection fund falling under the fixed income category," Union KBC AMC chief executive G Pradeepkumar told PTI on the sidelines of an industry event in Mumbai over the weekend.
Union KBC AMC has a customer base of 1,25,000 and plans to take it to 30 lakh over the next five years.
"We are looking at adding 50,000 folios to our current 1,25,000 folios by the end of current fiscal itself. Moreover, we are looking at taking at least 10 per cent of the 3-crore odd customer base of Union Bank of India over next five years," he said.
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund said that it has launched ICICI Prudential Growth Fund-Series 3, a three-and-a-half year close-ended equity fund that aims to provide capital appreciation by investing in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and equity-related instruments.
The new fund offer will be open for subscription between September 17 and October 10.
Macro stability conditions are expected to improve further with key drivers being sustained deceleration in consumer price inflation. This pick up in sentiment is likely to actuate revenue growth for companies which would have a positive correlation for the MF industry, ICICI Prudential AMC managing director and chief executive Nimesh Shah said.
"We believe there is an opportunity available for equity markets with the earnings growth likely to improve going ahead," he said.
However, Edelweiss AMC, which currently manages six funds in equity and three in debt categories, doesn't have any plan to launch new funds this fiscal, since its arbitrage fund launched right before the Budget is performing well.
"We launched the fund with a new fund offer of Rs 60 crore late June. However its fund value has gone up at Rs 170 crore as on date," Edelweiss MF chief executive Vikas Sachdeva said.
According to DSP Blackrock MF, the Sensex is all set to cross the 50,000-mark over the next three years. 
"We do believe that the Sensex may cross the 45,000-50,000-mark over next three years if the present rally continues which will help the industry," DSP Blackrock chief investment officer S Naganath said.
The mutual fund industry will get another leg-up if the Reserve Bank of India cuts interest rates a bit, which it sees likely happening by the first quarter of next year, as inflation is trending down. This could bring respite to investors, he said.

Employees Generate Ideas Worth $500 Million: HCL TechFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: HCL Technologies, India's fourth largest IT firm, is now focussing on "ideapreneurship" to encourage employees to come up with innovative solutions to customers' business challenges.
Under the initiative, the Noida-based firm has generated over 32,000 innovative ideas since 2008 to deliver approximately $500 million of value to customers.
"It is a platform where our employees can share, collaborate and shape ideas in a structured manner to deliver value to our customers. It is at the heart of grassroots' ideas led revolution we are experiencing," HCL Technologies chief HR officer Prithvi Shergill told PTI.
This culture is a key enabler of the company's strategy, he added.
"In a growth-constrained, post-recession world where many traditional sources of advantage are not as relevant, the best investment to succeed is the power of ideas."
In 2005, HCL Technologies had introduced a new management model - Employees First, Customers Second (EFCS), aimed at making managers as accountable to employees as employees were to their bosses and transfer responsibility for change and value creation to front-line employees.
HCL acknowledges that putting the Employee First and engaging and empowering remains vital in today's environment, Mr Shergill added.
"The ideas we see emerging could be something that helps solve a business problem, brings in a new way of doing business, or helps create competitive differentiation, it can be anything that adds value to the client," he said.
He further said that by channelising the energies of 95,000 employees, innovation was happening across teams.
"By giving them the right tools, and creating the right environment, HCL is enabling employees to collaborate, communicate and create value freely across teams and across boundaries," Mr Shergill said.
The EFCS management model continues to attract the attention of academics (with Harvard Business School doing a case study) as well as analysts who continue to highlight the customer benefits emerging given the adoption of the tenets of this model, according to Mr Shergill.
"HCL is working with Cornell University to further enhance the yield of the ideas as they see this delivering to the promise they make to client of building 'relationships beyond the contract'."

Modis bonding with Japan will spur Chinese interest in IndiaModi’s bonding with Japan will spur Chinese interest in India

Walking the talk: Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS Summit in July (file photo) PTI
Key investments to be announced during President Xi Jinping visit this week
New Delhi, September 14:  
By warming up to Japan to meet India’s infrastructure needs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have put several Western politicians — who shunned him post 2002 Gujarat riots — on notice.
However, Modi’s strong engagement with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month is expected to propel the Chinese to further expand its economic ties with India.
The emergence of Asian axis could impact the US influence on moulding the balance of power within Asia, say economy watchers.
China now sees the Indo-Japanese industrial collaboration as more “strategic”.
Modi’s coziness with Japanese leader Abe has clearly led to some eye-catching deals this month — assurance of $35 billion Japanese foreign direct investment into India over next five years, more Japanese soft loans besides collaboration in defence industry and rare earth exploration.
Japan will also play a strong role in the development of industrial corridors and may nudge its automakers and electronics companies to expand their Indian operations.
Japan, formerly a big donor for China, now counts India as its largest aid recipient.
Modi’s visit to Japan has certainly put India on a strong diplomatic wicket, raising its bargaining power with China (during the forthcoming visit of President Xi Jinping to India) and also the US (when Modi embarks on an official visit this month-end).
China is now clearly looking to match the investments promised by Japan into India.
After dilly-dallying for a long time, China has suddenly started walking the talk on its intention of pumping money into India. A team of Chinese officials has already identified two locations — one in Gujarat and the other in Maharashtra — to set up industrial parks with Chinese investments.
The country is also set to pledge its investments into railway infrastructure. Related MoUs will be signed during the Chinese President’s visit this week. China is already a large lender when it came to commercial loans, especially for the power sector.
India’s power sector has had the largest share of Chinese loans.
Look beyond Japan: UK
The United Kingdom, which is seeing the changing dynamics amongst the Asian biggies, does not seem all that happy with the growing India-Japanese collaboration on the industrial front.
UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in a meeting with representatives of think tanks and the Indian industry, during his recent India visit, indicated that India needed to think beyond Japan when inviting foreign investments.
“Since all countries are not able to invest by giving soft loans like Japan, the UK wants India to keep in mind the terms and conditions under which other countries can invest,” said a person who attended the meeting.

Taxi companies like Olacabs, Uber cut fares in Delhi, others may follow

(According to industry estimates,…)
BANGALORE: The fight to win over the Indian taxi passenger has intensified with aggregator Olacabs and cab hailing app Uber slashing prices by a fourth in Delhi—a development that is likely to force rivals to follow suit.
While Ola has cut rates in its lowerend car business—Ola mini—to Rs 10 /km, Uber has cut prices for its premium segment Uber BLACK. Separately, the San Francisco-based taxi hailing app also announced that it will be launching its affordable ride service UberX in three more Indian cities: Mumbai, Chennai and Pune. "We are pushing our efficiency system to the maximum," said Shailesh Sawlani , general manager of Uber in Mumbai. "We see this as a daily commute option for our riders and plan to maintain these prices if customers ride with us as much as we anticipate."
UberX Mumbai fares are Rs 15/km with a minimum base fare of Rs 50 and total minimum fare of Rs 125. The latest moves come after Uber cut its prices in Bangalore by 25% last month. Ola also reduced fares to Rs10/km for its Ola Mini service in the Garden City . "We have been able to optimise our inventory," said Pranay Jivrajka, vice president of operations at Olacabs.
According to industry estimates, taxi companies are struggling to keep pace with the rising demand and on average cannot accommodate a fifth of the bookings. To address this problem Ola said it will increase the number of cabs available on its mobile app by about 35% to 3,200 in Delhi alone. Ola's total fleet size is about 15,000.
"These price cuts are just a starting point to acquire customers and establishing the brand image till the time you hit a critical mass," said Arvind Singhal , chairman of Technopak. "At Rs 10/km Ola is making losses on each Ola Mini ride," said a source directly familiar with the matter. Same is the case with Uber, according to another source. Uber's price drop in Bangalore is, however, for a limited duration.
The company has not specified the timeframe. Other competitors like TaxiFor-Sure are focussing on discount codes to expand the customer base instead of cutting prices. "We keep doing event-related promotions and offer discount vouchers from time to time," said Aprameya Radhakrishna, founder and chief executive of TaxiForSure .
"Till the time, taxi aggregators will not face pressure to turn profitable, the freebies will continue," said Jaspal Singh, cofounder of Valoriser Consultants, which provides market research services for transportation companies. "These companies are looking to build valuation by expanding geographic reach, recruiting more number of drivers and attracting bookings to increase revenue."
However other aggregators like Meru Cabs and Savaari cabs feel that price cuts is not sustainable long-term. "Meru does not believe in price wars," said Siddhartha Pahwa, CEO of MERU Cabs. "Consumers will not take a cab because it's cheap but for its reliability, safety and professional service."

How Mytaxiindia.com is making life easier for the Indian travellerAnshuman Mihir
(With the Rs. 7 crore Mytaxiindia.com,…)
A team player, Anshuman Mihir had the ability to bond strongly with people due to better understanding and professional ethics. This, coupled with his penchant for challenges, made him a favourite with his employer, Voyages India, a Delhibased B2B travel company. So, when he decided to start out on his own, it volunteered to fund his dream project. "An on-the-job entrepreneurial opportunity is rare, but I feel I was lucky," says the 30-year-old founder of the Delhi-based Mytaxiindia.com , a car rental and leasing portal that clocked a turnover of Rs. 7 crore in 2013-14.
After completing his BCA and MBA in marketing and finance in 2009, Mihir took up his first job with Voyages India as product head in August 2010. "In November 2010, we got a contract to organise a seven-day conference in Hyderabad. We booked flights and hotels , but found it extremely difficult to book the 122 cabs required for the event. We called almost every big transporter in the city, but no one could provide us with so many cars for seven days. Finally, after a series of phone calls, we managed to rope in people at the last moment. It was frustrating, but it was also the Eureka moment for me," he says.
The Indian car rental market was estimated to be around Rs. 55,000 crore, of which only 4-6 per cent was organised. Mihir's plan was to bring the unorganised local agencies and individuals under one roof and set up a car rental portal with pan-India presence. The promoters of Voyages India were quick to recognize the prospects of the business and offered Rs. 20 lakh to set up the website and logistics for the company. "There was no looking back. I started travelling and networking with taxi owners in major cities and smaller towns, and started tapping corporates who could use my services," he says. Within five months, the site was up and so was his fleet of hired cars.
As Mihir started meeting people, he realised that there was one problem common to most travellers, be it corporate executives on a business trip or those on an outing with family and friends—they faced problems while booking cabs. It was not so with other modes of travel. IRCTC was synonymous with train bookings, while a few other private portals had succeeded in promoting themselves as a one-stop shop for flight and bus bookings. "Likewise, I wanted Mytaxiindia to become the first choice for anyone who needed a taxi, and to have presence in the remotest corners of India," says Mihir.
Within six months of the launch on 25 March 2011 at Karol Bagh, Delhi, Mytaxiindia clocked a turnover of Rs. 28 lakh and went on to post Rs. 1 crore as revenue in 2011-12. The site comes with a complete rental solution, be it city tours, outstation visits or holidays. "We also give cars on lease," he says. Mihir feels he needs to focus on the services offered by his partners in tire 2 and tier 3 cities. He plans to expand his cab service to overseas locations as well. "Five years from now, we will have taxi outlets at all Indian airports and 300-plus railway stations. We also plan to start operations in Europe with a target of reaching 12.5 million customers worldwide," he adds.

Uber in talks with other firms to integrate digital wallet in IndiaUber in talks with firms to integrate digital wallet in India

(Uber is in talks with firms…)
BANGALORE: Global taxi-hailing company Uber is in talks with firms providing digital wallets and payment gateways in India as it looks to become compliant with local regulations.
The Reserve Bank of India shut a loophole last month by clarifying that online payments taking place between two Indian 'residents' cannot bypass two-factor authentication. Besides the additional authentication, the central bank also wanted transactions to be carried out in Indian rupees and not dollars.
Uber stores credit card details of passengers and automatically charges the card once the taxi ride is over without two-factor authentication as it uses an international payment gateway. Companies such as Uber now have until October 31 to become compliant.
"They are working on integrating a mobile wallet into their application," said a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. "It will most likely be Paytm. The integration will take some time as it has to go through the Uber process." Paytm and Uber, when contacted, declined to speak on this matter.
Mobile internet services company One97 Communications, founded by 34-year-old Vijay Shekhar Sharma in 2010, launched the Paytm mobile wallet in February. Last year it received a licence to launch a semi-closed wallet, where users can digitally store cash for mobile and online transactions but cannot withdraw money.
Paytm has 12 million mobile wallet users. Uber, which launched India operations last year, will also most likely partner with payment gateway PayU, owned by South African internet giant Naspers, said two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
PayU is run by Nitin Gupta, 31, a graduate of IIM Ahmadabad and former investment banker at Lehman Brothers. Its customers include Snapdeal, Jabong, Bookmyshow, BigBasket and Groupon India. The company declined to comment. While these partnerships will help Uber become compliant, it could open up a lot of other issues, said experts.
"Consumers do not like keeping significant amounts with wallet service providers. That will be a challenge," said Rahul Chowdhri, partner at Helion Venture Partners.
Helion is an investor in taxi aggregator TaxiFor-Sure , which has introduced electronic card swipe machines in the taxis on its network. While RBI allows users to store up to Rs 50,000 in semi-closed wallets, about 50 per cent of all telecom wallet users keep less than Rs 50 in their accounts, according to industry estimates. Bad internet connectivity in India is another issue.
"The one-click smooth seamless payment offering of Uber will vanish," said Alok Mehta, director at payment processing firm Atom Technologies. He said the biggest challenge will be the customer getting the onetime PIN required for the two-factor authentication, quickly.
"Ecommerce companies, unlike Uber, first take the payment and then deliver the service or goods. A passenger is not going to wait for more than two minutes to authenticate payment and would rather pay in cash and move on."
Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures backed Uber has been facing a backlash from local taxi operators and regulators in many countries including Germany, Singapore and lately India. In August, Indian radio taxi providers, including Meru Cab, Easy Cabs and Mega Cab, filed a complaint with the RBI alleging foreign exchange violations by the American firm.
But the company has so far powered ahead with its expansion — launching in four cities in India simultaneously last month. It now operates in 10 cities in the country, making India its largest market outside the US.

How to interpret what your recruiter means

decoding recruiter
(Keep your job search on while…)
It is not just the candidates who are found wanting on the honesty quotient. Often, it is the recruiters too. Their motivations, though, are vastly different. Recruiters, like most of us, dislike having to say 'No' or 'You are rejected' to eager job seekers. Struggling against tight deadlines, they don't have the time or the motivation to keep everyone updated. By decoding recruiter speak, you can reduce uncertainty and respond appropriately.
STAGE 1: CONNECTING
"Consider you for future vacancies"
When a recruiter says that there is no suitable vacancy, he means it. He adds your resume to the database and forgets you along with the hundred others who apply. When a vacancy turns up, he finds you in the database and also looks for candidates from other sources.
RESPONSE: Can you help the recruiter by referring suitable candidates for the current assignment? Keep track of news about your target firm and remain connected with the recruiter through professional networking sites to seize opportunities quickly.
"Salary depends on interview and experience"
The recruiter has little say on your salary since he is merely a facilitator. However, salary bands are usually fixed and the recruiter believes that you are in the target range and may accept an offer after negotiation.
RESPONSE: If you have rigid salary expectations, make it clear at the beginning. Better still, avoid salary discussions till you have had a chance to sell yourself to the hiring manager. Meanwhile, conduct thorough research on standard salaries for that position.
"Got your reference from somebody"
Some recruiters may lie if they believe that candidates are more open when told that they have been referred by someone instead of being told that they are found through a job portal, networking site or a company page.
RESPONSE: This does not affect your chances of getting the job. If it is a concern, clean up your online profiles.
"We have a great working culture"
This is standard marketing speak. Neither the recruiter nor you can accurately evaluate this.
RESPONSE: Ignore what the recruiter says. Ask around in the industry to find out whether the attrition rates are lower than industry averages, thus indicating a contented bunch of people at work.
STAGE 2 DELAYING "Interviews are still on"
This is usually true, but can mean different things. Either the firm will wait till all shortlisted people are interviewed, or they are not completely sure about any candidate, including you. They would like to search some more.
RESPONSE: This is an excellent time to share additional relevant information with the recruiter like your latest sales breakthrough or the employee of the quarter award you received. Also, ask if there are any specific concerns regarding you and address them.
"Awaiting a reply from the hirer"
Sometimes another candidate has been selected and they are negotiating to see if he will accept the offer. If their first choice drops out of the race, you may be in the reckoning as their second or third choice.
Keep your job search on while you wait for the cards to play out. If you get an alternate offer, let your recruiter know that you have a deadline and will move on.
RESPONSE: Keep your job search on while you wait for the cards to play out. If you get an alternate offer, let your recruiter know that you have a deadline and will move on.
 
"Position is on hold"
Sometimes employers figure out that there is a budget constraint or that there is no urgency to fill a vacancy. At other times, this simply means that you were not selected for the position and the recruiter is extremely uncomfortable in conveying the bad news to you.
RESPONSE: In either case, you are unlikely to make any headway. Let the recruiter know that you will be interested if it opens up again.
STAGE 3 DISCONNECTING
"You will hear from us"
This is usually followed by a complete silence from the recruiter's end. This could simply mean that the employer is having trouble deciding on the best candidate. On many occasions, a recruiter turns silent when you are no longer in the reckoning for the role.
RESPONSE: Follow up with a call to the recruiter. Ask if he can share a deadline for the decision to be made. If not, follow up subsequently on e-mail to signal your interest in the role.
"The job description has changed"
For new and untested roles, employers often learn a lot during the interview process and thus make mid-course changes to the job profile. At other times, employers are not happy with the candidates they speak to and tweak the profile to attract a fresh set of applicants.
RESPONSE: You have not been selected for the role that was available when you applied. Indicate your availability in case the role comes up again; continue with your job search.
"We filled it internally"
This may be true or may indicate that someone else was selected. This statement is the nicest way for the recruiter to close communication and avoid unpleasantness.
RESPONSE : Thank the recruiter for the clarity and carry on with your job search.

"Location preferences will be noted"
You will be asked to fill a form with your top three location preferences. However, you will be staffed only where there is a business requirement. Your choice is not the top priority. Ask for a location guarantee if it is critical.
"Your salary will be..."
The salary promised to you is likely to be the cost to company, which will include gratuity and PF, medical insurance, travel reimbursements, performance-linked bonus, even training costs. Ask what your actual monthly cash in hand is likely to be.
"You will get a bonus"
Your bonus could be a sign-on bonus, a retention bonus or even a guaranteed bonus, all of which come with a payback clause in case you decide to quit early. Performance bonus may depend on both your own as well as that of the team or company.
"You have a job offer from us"
But not necessarily a job. Many job offers come with a deadline for acceptance, deadline for joining, and are subject to background verifications coming clear. Miss out on deadlines at your own peril.
"Everyone is hired at the same level"
This is a false impression students carry. Most firms, if asked, are willing to give due credit to work experience, additional qualifications, and also offer special incentives to get the right person. Always explore and negotiate.

Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: Enterprising lawyers and gender equality experts have spotted a business opportunity in the new law against sexual harassment of women at work. With the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013 raising major concerns with respect to corporate liability and a potential threat to reputation on non-compliance, organizations are turning to the pros.
This new breed of consultants helps companies with gender sensitization training, removal of unconscious biases among employees, and getting a clear understanding of the law—for a stiff fee, of course.
"In-house legal teams and HR may not have the necessary training and understanding to handle cases. Also, these require a lot of time and effort," said Devika Singh, who founded Cohere which specializes in issues like sexual harassment and workplace discrimination. Cohere's client list includes leading banks, pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers, insurance companies and multinationals.
Nirmala Menon, founder of Interweave, a Bangalore-based consultancy that helps corporates with diversity-inclusion solutions through policy formulation and workshops for employees, says she has been getting requests from corporates to help them do the right thing. Lack of awareness about what constitutes sexual harassment is the biggest hurdle, she says. "Gawking, leering, innuendos or dirty jokes are still not seen as harassment," says Menon. So, she helps employees understand the nuances. Managers are told to look out for behaviour that could spell trouble later. "If people cracking off-colour jokes in office, it is better to spot it early and warn them of the risks," says Menon.
Rainmaker, an online learning and content company, has developed an anti-sexual harassment training solution called WorkSafe which is a hybrid of online and in-person training.
"For companies with a large employee base, it is a struggle to create awareness. Our product enables companies to conduct training for all its employees no matter where they are geographically situated. Therefore, the company is in complete compliance with the law," said Antony Alex, CEO, Rainmaker, which uses videos with dramatized sequences to create awareness.
Given some high-profile cases of sexual harassment (like Phaneesh Murthy and Tarun Tejpal of Tehelka) in the recent past, the dominant fear among organizations is loss of reputation, which can have a bearing on profitability and share prices. Better than tarred reputations and a financial fallout, companies are focusing on prevention.
Which is why Alex sees this as a multi-million dollar business opportunity. Depending upon the number of employees a corporate has, myLaw.net charges companies anywhere between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh. Rainmaker has already tied up with 25-odd companies and is hopeful of taking the number to 100 by the end of next year.
Alex, who is a corporate lawyer by training, realized there was a huge vacuum in the market when Rainmaker conducted a dipstick survey among corporates who felt there was an urgent need to have a high quality, scalable training tool on this subject.
While some forms of sexual harassment are obvious—a demand for sexual favours, for instance—others are more difficult to define. "An innocent action of one person might be seen as harassment by another. We need to educate employees and that can only be done by a consultant who is well aware of the laws of the land," said Deepa Nair, VP-HR (Asia & Middle East), Aurionpro Solutions , which has 1,000-odd employees.
One of Rainmaker's clients, Philip Morris International ( PMI ), which has a diverse global workforce of over 91,000 employees, adheres to the best practices internationally. But the Act, which introduces finer nuances and more procedures, is unique to India. Siddharth Yadav, PMI's head, HR (India & Nepal), said: "This partnership has enabled us to structure a framework that is fully compliant with the local Act while helping create a healthy, sensitized and gender-neutral work environment."
Sonal Mattoo, an advocate who specializes in workplace harassment and diversity issues, said the companies she supports are committed to ensuring full compliance and go beyond the mere tick in the box.

Parental advice on financial savings can be a no-noParental advice on traditional savings and investment may not work for Gen Y

(The reluctance to fall back…)
NEW DELHI: When Rajeev Kishore Dubey started his career as a management trainee in 1977, his father advised him to start a recurring deposit of Rs 100 a month. The chairman and managing director of Canara Bank recalls how difficult it was to spare Rs 100 out of his monthly stipend of Rs 700. "After paying the rent and basic living expenses, I was left with barely anything," he says. It was only years later when the deposit matured that Dubey realised the wisdom of his father's advice.
Now, 37 years later, the veteran banker is proffering the same advice to his children. "But instead of putting money in recurring deposits and bank FDs, they want to invest in SIPs (systematic investment plans) of mutual funds," he says, derisively.
In Pune, Satyam Chawla gets a weekly sermon from his father Ashok on why stocks are not good for his financial health. The senior Chawla's aversion to equities is rooted in his own experience with the asset class. He invested in the stock markets in 1991 and lost heavily when the Harshad Mehta scam sent the market into a tailspin in 1994.
Like Dubey's children, Satyam too is not following his parent's investment advice. "The stock market has changed drastically since the time he was an investor. It is well regulated and the possibility of fraud is significantly lower," says Satyam. The younger Dubeys understand that recurring and fixed deposits are very tax inefficient compared with debt mutual funds and fixed maturity plans (FMPs). Even though the Budget has changed rules, long-term investors in debt funds and FMPs still enjoy a significant tax advantage over bank deposits.
Parents mean well, but the financial advice they offer to their children today is often flawed. One can't really blame them be-cause they lived in an era which was very different from the present. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the stock market was an opaque establishment, mutual funds were unknown and insurance agents were trusted advisors. Life insurance policies, bank deposits and small savings schemes were the instruments that helped them create wealth in the past.
Amajor problem with parental guidance is that it doesn't match the expectations of the younger generation (and not just when it comes to investment!). A young person may wish to put money in an equity fund SIP while her father insists that the Public Provident Fund is a better and safer option.
"Parents often take upon themselves the investment decisions of the earning children even though the risk profiles of the modern youth and that of the parents could be vastly different," says Uma Shashikant, financial trainer and managing director, Centre for Investment Education and Learning. Gen Y investors are at the greatest risk. Hyderabad-based Arthayantra.com estimates that some two out of every three professionals aged 21-27 years base their financial decisions on his parental advice.
Traditional life insurance policies are an all-time favourite investment choice. It's common for parents to buy an insurance policy for their child as a gift, paying the premium in the initial years. Once the child starts earning, the onus of paying the premium shifts to him. "Parents might think they are giving their child a great gift. In reality, they are saddling him with a sub-optimal investment for the next 15-20 years," says Nitin Vyakaranam, founder and CEO of Arthayantra.com.
  Meet Naveen Parashar, a public sector unit manager based in Delhi who pays almost Rs 1 lakh a year for seven life insurance policies that give him a combined life cover of Rs 14 lakh. Two of these policies were bought for him by his father. He repeated the mistake by buying two policies for his children. The traditional insurance plans fall between two stools, offering neither good returns nor adequate life cover. Parashar realised this and bought a pure protection term plan of Rs 50 lakh for himself. He still feels shackled by the premium that flows into the other seven policies. To be fair, not all the financial advice given by the older generation should be ignored.
In fact, some time-tested tenets can ensure prosperity. Jyoti Kumar's father did not tell him where to invest. "He just said instead of saving what is left after your expenses, you should spend what is left after you have saved for the month. It's a golden rule I have diligently followed," says the Hyderabadbased IT professional. Similarly, the deep aversion the older generation has for discretionary spending and debt can have a positive influence on finances of young set. Though not all forms of debt are bad, living beyond your means and over-leveraging your income are surefire ways of falling into a debt trap.
Bangalore-based hospitality professional Rajesh Prasad would have also ended up in one had his father not advised him not to blow away his salary and start saving. If Prasad's finances are on even keel today, it is largely due to the savings he started on the advice of his father.

Have an unsteady income? Here's how you can secure a stable funds inflow

(The other way for keeping…)
The Bhatts have jobs that bring in uncertain incomes. They might make a lot of money one month, but have very little for the next month or two. However, their fixed monthly expense remains pretty much the same. They don't have to worry when they make more money than their mandatory expenses. Their finances go awry, when they make less. They need to figure out how to make the good times cover the lean periods. There are two ways in which they can deal with this problem.
The first is by examining their occupations and the incomes they generate to identify if there is a scope for a steady revenue stream. For example, a set of core customers in a business can bring in a small but steady income—charging a small recurring fee may create such a revenue steam. Stacking of orders can also create less volatility. Further, if they manage to get an overdraft account, it can help balance fund inflows and borrowings, and can reduce funds volatility. They need to rework their business strategy to secure the inflow of funds.
The other way for keeping income volatility in check involves creation of alternate income avenues by way of income-earning assets. If there are assets such as interestpaying bonds, dividend-paying mutual funds , rent-yielding property or circulating bank deposits, they will be able to meet their expenses via cash inflows from such assets. During the good times, they should take money out of the business to build such assets. The challenge for those in business, is to set aside much-needed capital into assets outside the business. An investment corpus can cushion the family from the risks of wild fluctuations in business income, and provide for its needs. It also serves to diversify their assets.
The Bhatts need to ensure that they work towards securing a minimum level of stable income to run their household, even if it calls for one of them to get a salaried job. The personal finances of the household need to be secure, to allow for business risks.

All you need to know to use a large sum of money judiciouslyHow to use a large sum of money judiciously

(Several surveys have revealed…)
Most people are careful with their hard-earned money, but when it comes to windfall gains there is a tendency to splurge it. Though the behavioural aspects behind the spending habits of Indians have not been mapped in a formal study, several surveys conducted in the US have revealed that almost one-third of those who won a lottery ended up seeking some sort of bankruptcy relief within a few years. Here, we have identified a few steps that would help you manage your lump sum gains judiciously.
After all it's your money
The unanticipated nature of windfall gains is responsible for the way it is spent or invested. Many people view a windfall as 'found money' and treat it differently than money that they earn, such as salary and profits from businesses.
They don't seem to understand that an unexpected income, such as the annual bonus your company pays during the festivities or your income tax refund from the IT department, is nothing but a part of your own hard-earned money.
Similarly, the money raised through selling of your ancestral property should never be seen as a windfall. The next step is to convince yourself that even windfall gains, such as winning a lottery, is as valuable as the money you have earned through sheer hard work. If the amount is big, most financial planners would advise you to stash it in a safe place for 3-6 months before taking the final call on what you would like to do with it.
This, however, does not mean that you do nothing with it. "Instead of leaving it idle in a savings bank account, invest in a liquid fund and evaluate your options slowly," says Tanwir Alam, founder & CEO, Fincart.
Tax planning
Some of the money that comes your way may be tax-free, while others may be taxable in your hands. While the big amounts that you receive by way of provident fund withdrawals or gratuity amount will be tax free if you complete five years with the same company. There may not be much of a problem with your annual bonus because what you get in hand from the employer is the amount after tax deduction.
However, if you are working as a consultant, and it is only the TDS that was deducted, then you would have to pay the remaining taxes yourself. If the sudden gains is from sale of assets, find out how much of that is capital gains and the tax rates applicable on it.
Repay debt
Repaying debt is one of the best ways to use a windfall. However, here again, you need to distinguish between different types of debt. "You should immediately repay high-cost debts, such as personal loans or credit card outstanding and debts taken to buy depreciating assets, such as a car or white goods," says Alam.
But, what about housing or educational loans, where you get tax benefits? One way is to leave them alone, the other is to make a partial repayment. Says Manish Shah, co-founder and CEO, Bigdecisions: "Fully prepaying the mortgage debt on a self-occupied house may not be a good decision, but you can make a partial repayment and bring it down to the optimum amount of mortgage debt of Rs 30 lakh to 40 lakh."
The interest on self-occupied homes is exempt up to Rs 2 lakh, and at 10 per cent interest rates, Rs 20 lakh loan is enough to generate that. We are suggesting a slightly higher optimum mortgage loan because the outstanding loan will keep coming down over the years.
Revisit your goals
If there's anything left after repaying your debts, it can be considered for investments or meeting some of your other goals. Says Anil Rego, CEO, Right Horizons: "All unanticipated income should be invested or should be allocated to upcoming goals." For example, if you were planning to buy your own house in, say, five years, a windfall may allow you to fulfil your dreams in advance.
Similarly, you could allocate this money for your child's higher education, that you were planning to fund through loans, three years away. In this case, the allocated amount could be invested in some debt funds for the duration.
 
Don't splurge
While it is perfectly fine to meet your goals with windfall gains, resist that temptation to splurge. "Just because you got a lump sum, you should not buy something which you do not need or cannot afford to own or will not be in a position to service in the future," says Rego.
Also be realistic with costs involved with the purchases. Says Shah: "Most people have a tendency to buy one mega house just because they got a large sum." This move may be detrimental because it can exhaust the entire money you received and, therefore, jeopardise your other goals. Some may even end up taking a bigger loan to maintain the house.
Buying a bigger car is another common mistake people commit. In addition to the cost of the car, other costs associated with it, such as maintenance, insurance, petrol bills, etc., may incur additional costs that you would have to bear.
Be conservative
You have also got to be careful while investing the money. "Be conservative and don't risk or gamble away the luck you got," says Shah. The biggest mistake people make is to invest without considering their risk appetite: While they may be conservative with their hard-earned money, they tend to take considerable risks with windfall gains.
Don't invest everything into one asset class, whether it be real estate, equities or debt. Also, don't invest in the stock market at one go: First invest in a liquid fund and transfer small amounts regularly to equity funds using the systemic transfer plans (STPs).

PM Modi asks railways to achieve 90% operating ratio in current FYPM Narendra Modi asks railways to achieve 90% operating ratio in current fiscal year

An operating ratio of 90% means from every Re 1 earned, the railways will spend 90 paise and retain 10 paise as surplus. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked railways to achieve an operating ratio of 90% in the current fiscal year, making the top brass at the state-run transporter jittery over how to realize the ambitious goal.
An operating ratio of 90% means from every Re 1 earned, the railways will spend 90 paise and retain 10 paise as surplus.
Lower operating ratio helps generate higher internal resources for safety, amenities and modernization of the system. The best-ever operating ratio achieved by the railways was 74.7% in 1963-64.
The target, set by the PM who has been periodically reviewing progress in the infrastructure sector, is higher than the one set in the rail budget which pegged operating ratio at 92.5% for the 2014-15 financial year.
Railways recorded an operating ratio of 93.5% in 2013-14 which signifies its deteriorating financial health as higher operating expense left meagre funds to finance upgrade and modernization of rail infrastructure.
The ambitious target has raised eyebrows as many railway officials think it is "unachievable" under the existing scheme of things.
Officials feel the functioning of the state-run transporter has not changed even under the new dispensation as it still struggling with departmentalism (living in silos) and inter-cadre rivalry, which is the biggest hurdle in improving its financial performance.
The budget announcements were seen as steps in the right direction as new railway minister Sadanand Gowda refrained from announcing any new projects in his maiden budget and promised to restructure the railway board to make it more professional.
"Railways needs drastic restructuring to meet this ambitious target. We have not heard anything on restructuring of railway board," a senior railway official said.
He added, "Out of the box thinking is needed to push railways out of financial mess."
While reports of several committees, including recent ones like Anil Kakodkar and Sam Pitroda panels, are gathering dust in the Rail Bhavan corridors, the new regime has constituted a few more committees, which will go into various issues, including resource mobilization, ways to reduce operational costs and IT initiatives.
The committees have been asked to submit their reports within three months.
Emphasizing on accelerating infrastructure development, Modi, in the last review meeting on Friday, argued that railways has been granted clearance for 100% FDI, now the transporter should come up with a comprehensive plan for facilitating FDI in the sector.

The leaders of Asia's three biggest economies - China, India and Japan - have crisscrossed the region this month, lobbying for strategic influence, building defence ties, and seeking new business opportunities.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI/BEIJING: China will pledge to invest billions of dollars in India's rail network during a visit by President Xi Jinping this week, bringing more than diplomatic nicety to the neighbours' first summit since Narendra Modi became prime minister in May.
The leaders of Asia's three biggest economies - China, India and Japan - have crisscrossed the region this month, lobbying for strategic influence, building defence ties, and seeking new business opportunities.
Beijing's bid to ramp up commercial ties in India comes despite a territorial dispute that has flared anew in recent years, raising concerns in New Delhi, where memories of a humiliating border war defeat in 1962 run deep.
It follows a pledge by Japan to invest $35 billion in India over the next five years - including the introduction of bullet trains - and a drive to deepen security ties during talks earlier this month between Modi and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.
India and China are expected to sign a pact that will open the way for Chinese participation in new rail tracks, automated signalling for faster trains and modern stations that India's British-built rail system desperately needs, having barely added 11,000 km of track in the 67 years since independence.
China, which added 14,000 km of track in the five years to 2011, is also pushing for a share of the lucrative high-speed train market in India, which it says would be cheaper than Japanese proposals.
"India has a strong, real desire to increase its cooperation with China and other countries to perfect and develop its rail system, and has concrete cooperation ideas," Assistant Chinese Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao told reporters ahead of Xi's trip.
"India is considering building high-speed railways, and China has a positive attitude towards this."
China's consul general in Mumbai, Liu Youfa, told the Times of India last week that Chinese investment in the modernisation of India's railways could eventually touch $50 billion.
Beijing is looking to invest another $50 billion in building India's ports, roads and a project to link rivers, part of an infrastructure push that Modi has said is his top priority to crank up economic growth.
Chinese investment will also help narrow a trade deficit with India that hit $31 billion in 2013.
From economic parity in 1980, China's growth has outstripped India's fourfold. Beijing is now seeking to recycle some of its vast export surpluses into foreign investment in resources and infrastructure in South Asia to feed its industrial machine.
DISTRUST
New Delhi's ties with Beijing have long been held back by distrust, mostly over their contested border. India has reported a rise in incursions by Chinese troops in recent years across a military control line, prompting a drive to beef up defences.
India also views Chinese military collaboration with its arch-rival, Pakistan, as a security threat.
Beijing, for its part, is concerned about the activities of Tibetans led by the Dalai Lama who fled to India following a failed uprising in 1959.
Xi kicks off his visit in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Modi's home state, Gujarat, on Wednesday when the nationalist Indian leader will be marking his 64th birthday.
Xi is set to launch one of two industrial parks focused on building power equipment in the booming state, which topped India's growth rates when Modi was its chief minister. China will set up another park in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra that will be mainly involved in the autos sector.
The informal setting of the first meeting between Xi and Modi is expected to bring a personal touch, much like the friendly get-together of the new Indian leader and Abe in Kyoto before their formal summit in Tokyo.
"We hope that during this visit the Chinese and Indian relationship of the last 50-60 years would see a directional change," India's Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
For all that, Modi's bonhomie with Abe and his plans to meet
U.S. President Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to relations with big powers.
"Modi is playing his cards very close to his chest, first by visiting Japan ahead of Xi coming to China, and also by planning a U.S. visit later this year," said a Beijing-based diplomat who follows the China-India relationship.
Before he arrives in India, Xi will visit the Maldives, the Indian ocean island which India has long considered its area of influence.
He will also travel to Sri Lanka, where China is building a port less than 200 km from India's southern coast, part of a drive to build ports across the Indian Ocean that some have dubbed a strategic "String of Pearls".
Earlier this month, Abe visited Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Nissan Faces Battery Plant Cuts as Electric Car Hopes FadeYou are here: Home Corporates
Nissan Faces Battery Plant Cuts as Electric Car Hopes Fade
Reuters | Updated On: September 15, 2014 14:32 (IST)
Future Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Paris:
Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn is preparing to cut battery manufacturing, people familiar with the matter said, in a new reversal on electric cars that has reopened deep divisions with alliance partner Renault.
The plan, which faces stiff resistance within the Japanese carmaker, would see US and British production phased out and a reduced output of next-generation batteries concentrated at its domestic plant, two alliance sources told Reuters.
In what may also prove a politically sensitive blow to Japan Inc., Nissan would follow Renault by taking cheaper batteries from South Korea's LG Chem for some future vehicles, including models made in China.
"We set out to be a leader in battery manufacturing but it turned out to be less competitive than we'd wanted," said one executive on condition of anonymity. "We're still between six months and a year behind LG in price-performance terms."
A decision on the Nissan battery plants in Sunderland, England, and Smyrna, Tennessee, is due next month, the sources said, following a tense procurement review with 43.4 per cent shareholder Renault, the smaller but senior partner in their 15-year-old alliance.
"Renault would clearly prefer to go further down the LG sourcing route, and the Nissan engineers would obviously prefer to stay in-house," another insider said. "The write-off costs are potentially huge."
Renault-Nissan "remains 100-per cent committed to its industry-leading electric vehicle programme" and has no plans to write down battery investments, spokeswoman Rachel Konrad said.
"We have not taken any decision whatsoever to modify battery sourcing allocation," Konrad said, adding that the alliance "does not confirm or deny procurement reviews."
But Nissan is already negotiating with manufacturing partner NEC Corp. on the shift to dual sourcing, with Chief Executive Ghosn's backing, the sources said. Nissan currently makes all its own electric car batteries.
One option being explored would see LG, which supplies some Renault models, invest in its own battery production at one of the overseas Nissan plants as the carmaker halts operations at the sites.
The alliance is also in talks with LG on a deal to supply batteries for future Renault and Nissan electric models in China, one of the sources added.
NEC and LG declined to comment.
Under Ghosn, who heads both companies, Renault-Nissan bet more on electric cars than any mainstream competitor, pledging in 2009 to invest 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) to build models including the Nissan Leaf compact and as many as 500,000 batteries per year to power them.
Nissan and NEC invested 23 billion yen ($215 million) in their Zama, Japan battery plant and electrode manufacturing, backed by government aid. US and British taxpayers also helped with the $1 billion invested in Tennessee and 210 million pounds ($341 million) in Sunderland.
But the mass consumer was largely unmoved - or deterred by the sluggish rollout of recharging networks - despite generous sales incentives in key markets.
Global electric car sales will remain shy of 1 million in 2020, according to forecaster IHS Automotive, less than one percent of the total vehicle market, and one-tenth of the demand Ghosn had predicted.
"Renault-Nissan were definitely ahead of their time - in a bad way," said Stuart Pearson, an Exane BNP analyst.
"There's nothing wrong with ambition, but when that involves excess investment then it's also a risk," he said. "Their targets were really excessive on volume and battery capacity."
The alliance has begun a belated push into faster-selling hybrids, combining electric and combustion-engine propulsion. Upscale electric rivals such as Tesla's Model S meanwhile hog the limelight, backed by big investments in newer, cheaper battery technologies.
Internal Rivalries
Ghosn dropped extra battery sites planned for both alliance carmakers, leaving Nissan with the entire production capacity of 220,000 power packs through the NEC joint venture, AESC.
But that still far exceeds the 67,000 electric cars Renault-Nissan sold last year, and even the 176,000 registered to date. A pledge to reach 1.5 million by 2016 has been scrapped.
The coming hybrids will fill some of the excess plant capacity, although they use fewer power cells per vehicle. An all-electric Tesla rival is still planned for Nissan's premium Infiniti brand in 2018 with batteries as big as 60 kilowatt-hours (kWh), more than twice the energy capacity of the Leaf, which is due for replacement the previous year.
Nissan is seeking to unwind a ruinous NEC contract that requires it to purchase electrodes for the full capacity of 220,000 Leaf-sized 24 kWh batteries regardless of actual sales, sources said. The joint venture partner's consent is also needed to bring LG production or other activities onto the Tennessee or Sunderland sites, which together employ 500 workers.
The financial hit for Nissan "will depend on what else we can do with the plants", with heavy charges likely if both are closed, one manager added.
Renault has already taken at least one writedown of 85 million euros on its over-investment in electric cars following the collapse of Better Place, a charging startup that had ordered 100,000 of its battery-powered Fluence sedans.
The Nissan procurement shift could still be thwarted by capacity-cutting costs including repayment of US and British government support. Next-generation battery manufacturing at Zama would also likely need fresh Japanese aid to compete with LG and its subsidies from Seoul, sources said.
Navigating the battery backtrack is a key test for CEO Ghosn as he demands closer Renault-Nissan integration from executives mandated to pursue savings across the alliance.
For Nissan, the plant cuts would be a partial retreat from the automotive battery market - expected to top $20 billion by 2020 - just as California-based Tesla builds its $5 billion "Gigafactory" with Panasonic in Nevada.
Japanese engineers are still smarting from Renault's 2010 move to drop Nissan batteries and purchase LG for its flagship Zoe model, worsening the overcapacity problem.
"It was a 15-20 per cent cost gap," said one of the people involved in the Renault decision. "In purchasing, 3-4 per cent is usually enough to choose a partner for."
Today's Nissan batteries come in at $270 per kWh, based on replacement prices thought to be below cost, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. The true manufacturing cost is believed to be over $300, inflated by the amortisation of unused plant capacity and the burdensome electrodes deal.
The next generation will have lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathodes, as used by LG, rather than the current lithium manganese oxide (LMO) chemistry. The alliance cost target is $200/kWh, whether made or bought, sources said.
With a clean slate and sufficient volume, Nissan engineers insist, their next generation of batteries could be competitive on price as well as keeping crucial know-how at the company.
"When you're developing cutting-edge technology, the best way to know about that technology is to build it in-house," said one. "That's what Tesla is doing."
Many of the past missteps can be traced to internal rivalries of the kind Ghosn is only now moving to stamp out.
Former Nissan second-in-command Carlos Tavares, racing to beat the Renault Zoe to market, cut Leaf development by a year and skipped a critical battery redesign, according to alliance veterans. Nissan later cut prices, settled a class action and offered retroactive warranties to answer customer concerns about battery deterioration. Tavares now heads PSA Peugeot Citroen.
His Renault archrival at the time, Patrick Pelata, signed a confidentiality deal with LG that meant Nissan battery engineers never even knew what they were up against.
Against that backdrop, the atmosphere may be charged when Nissan engineering boss Hideyuki Sakamoto puts final arguments against the outsourcing plan in a presentation to Ghosn as soon as this week.
But the CEO's mind may be all but made up.
"We're in the process of opening up battery sourcing to a range of suppliers," Ghosn said last week when asked whether Renault could buy batteries from France's Bolloré.
In future some batteries will likely be outsourced "within the framework of alliance procurement", he added. "What's important to us is that electric car performance fully meets customer expectations."

Google launches Android One devices at Rs 6 399Google launches Android One phones, to be priced at around Rs 6,399
Reuters –  Mon 15 Sep, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Google Inc launched in India on Monday a $105 smartphone, the first device from its "Android One" initiative which is aimed at boosting sales in key emerging markets through cheaper prices and better quality software.
After launching in India, Google said it plans to expand Android One to Indonesia, Philippines and other South Asian countries by the end of 2014 and in more countries in 2015.
The company is working with partners including Acer Inc, HTC Corp and Panasonic Corp to build more devices under Android One, Sundar Pichai, who heads Google's Android and Chrome units, told reporters at the India launch event in New Delhi.
"When (handset companies) look to make a phone, they will get a menu. They can put together a device in a much quicker fashion, knowing we've already tested the software," he added.
With Android One, Google aims to improve the quality of hardware and software by giving handset makers a frame of reference. Strong sales of Android One smartphones should mean more Internet access, and more usage of Google's suite of products.
Currently, many cheap smartphones in India and other emerging markets run different and somewhat customised versions of the Android operating system. The many variations they produce make the phones prone to glitches, and leave Google with almost no control over its platform.
Pichai said eventual software upgrades on the Android One phones would come directly from Google. This gives the company better control of the operating system and ensures users get a consistent service.
"After China and the United States, India is the third largest smartphone market in the world and Google won't like to leave such a huge market in control of brands looking to use a custom-forked Android OS as is happening in China," said Neil Shah, research director for devices and ecosystems at Hong Kong-based technology research agency Counterpoint Research.
LOW COST AND LOCAL
India is an attractive market for companies that make low-cost smartphones because more people are now able to afford a smartphone, often for the first time.
Just 10 percent of the India's population currently owns a smartphone, brokerage Nomura said in a recent research note, and that figure is likely to double over the next four years.
There are at least 80 smartphone brands in India and analysts say the Android One phones must offer customers more than just affordability if Google wants to compete with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, Motorola and China's Xiaomi, which all make similarly priced devices.
"The initial pricing never sticks but it'll be tough for them to compete if they don't come down further," said Counterpoint's Shah.
Customising web content to suit Indian customers is a priority for Google, country head Rajan Anandan told Reuters last month. The new Android One phones can be used in seven Indian languages, including Hindi.
Google is also working on allowing users to watch YouTube videos offline in a country where access to the internet is often pricey and patchy.

Government to Discuss Closing Some Loss-Making PSU Firms TodayFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: Government officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals to shut down some loss-making state-owned companies, risking a conflict with powerful trade unions.
After two decades of halting privatisation, the central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level, involved in activities ranging from generating nuclear power to making condoms.
Some of them, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Steel Authority of India are successful, but there are dozens more that have been bleeding cash for decades and kept afloat by budgetary support each year.
On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 24,500 crore ($4 billion) in 2012-13.
The list includes Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Air India, Hindustan Photofilms and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation, according to a note prepared by the Department of Public Enterprises.
Officials at the department have drawn up proposals to close some.
They include Hindustan Photofilms, a company set up in 1960 to make film rolls and take on the likes of Kodak but declared a sick company in 1996 and recommended for closure by the department in 2003 on the grounds that it could not compete with private players.
The company, based in the southern town of Ottacamund in the Nilgiri hills, went to court and won a stay order on any further proceedings that could lead to its closure.
In 2010 the firm proposed a recovery plan but the government has been sitting on it, with no decision having been made since about the company's future. In the meantime the company's accumulated losses have piled up to 82.32 billion rupees, about 40 times its paid-up capital.
"There is no future for this company in the current environment. It is a fit case for winding down," said a government official at the Department of Public Enterprises, which is overseeing the privatisation of state firms. The official did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The department will be making a presentation at Tuesday's meeting.
The government is also considering a proposal to wind down the watch-making division of HMT Machine Tool Limited after years of losses that have forced it to borrow from the government to pay wages.
Unions
Trade unions are opposed to any moves to shut down state firms and the Bharatiya Mazadoor Sangh (BMS), a body affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would work with other unions to block the move.
"We are co-ordinating with all central trade unions on the matter. We are fortunate that all trade unions are on the same page when it comes to these issues," said Vrijesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the BMS.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which took office in May pledging to reignite growth, has embarked on a cautious course of shedding stakes in state firms although it has eschewed big moves.
The government increased its privatisation target for its fiscal year 2014-15 budget to Rs 63,000 crore from the interim budget's target of Rs 48,000 crore. The target is nearly four times larger than total government divestments in the past four years.
Officials said the government was also looking for ways to revive some of the sick companies through capital infusion, joint ventures and by bringing in new management.

D-Day nears: Isro prepares for crucial Mangalyaan insertionComments
Roopa MV looks at the screen in front of her in the mission control room at the Isro Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network, as it shows a graphical representation of the Mars Orbiter Mission’s (MOM) entry into Mars.
“We have finished uploading the commands to the spacecraft, which are now being verified,” says Roopa, the spacecraft operation manager for MOM — better known as Mangalyaan.
There is visible anxiety among the scientists as the nine-month period after the launch of Mangalyaan comes to an end next Wednesday. “Anxiety will obviously be there.  But if you are well prepared for the exam, your confidence level also increases,” says M Annadurai, programme director, Isro.
Before the Mangalyaan enters Mars on September 24, Isro scientists will have to endure nail-biting prelims on September 22, when the spacecraft enters the sphere of influence of Mars, which will essentially involve ‘waking ‘ up the 440 Newton liquid apogee motor (LAM) that has been in slumber for nearly 300 days.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro.
“We are confident that it will work. But just in case it does not, we have a Plan B which involves firing the eight thrusters. This however will entail a longer firing period and will need more fuel,” he adds.
Besides the LAM firing, the fourth and the final trajectory-correction manoeuvre has also been planned for September 22.
Isro launched Mangalyaan on November 5 last year to find evidence of life on the red planet and position itself as a budget player in the global space race. If the mission succeeds, India will receive the first photographs of Mars by the afternoon of September 24.

Dalal Street gears up for new share sales worth Rs 2 lakh crore

(Sceptics are not sure whether…)
MUMBAI: The primary market is likely to witness a deluge of fresh paper worth over Rs 2 lakh crore within the next year as the government looks to trim stakes in its companies and private firms aim to raise fresh capital.
But, sceptics are not sure whether the market would be able to absorb the extent of share sales amid a slowdown in foreign institutional inflows , though bankers remain confident of their success.
Of the stake sales planned over the next 12 months, the government would be the largest contributor. About Rs 45,000 crore worth of shares could be sold by the government to meet its disinvestment target. This is in addition to its probable share sales in Balco and Hindustan Zinc worth Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore from SUUTI stake sales.
Banks — public and private — may raise about Rs 40,000 crore, while various companies plan to raise almost Rs 50,000 crore from institutional investors. In private, bankers accept that the extent of fund-raising is a steep task but they expect it to scrape through once pension funds enter the picture.
"This is not a worrisome figure as FIIs and private equity players are continuously pumping in funds into Indian equities. Domestic mutual funds have already turned net buyers whereas insurance companies are likely to turn positive," said S Subramanian, MD, investment banking, at Axis Capital. "Moreover, pension funds will enter the equity market once government gives the final go ahead".
Some market participants were worried with the quantum of the supply of shares in the wake of the recent drop in foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows. There is a concern that the tighter monetary policy in the US may slow FII flows into the country.
During the calendar year 2013, FIIs invested Rs 1.13 lakh crore while domestic institutions sold stocks worth Rs 74,000 crore. The net investment from both the institutions was about Rs 39,000 crore.
So far in 2014, FIIs have invested Rs 86,000 crore, while DIIs sold shares worth Rs 34,000 crore with a net investment of about Rs 51,500 crore. Brokers said FII inflows have slowed down because of rich valuations but once the economy and corporate earnings recover, more foreigners would be keen on investing in fresh papers.
"Even during the difficult time, India has received about $10-15 billion investment from FIIs. However, with improving economic conditions, Indian market should get about $25 billion inflow — $15 billion in primary and $10 billion in the secondary market," said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
The government has already announced its plan to sell 10 per cent stake in Coal India, 5per cent in ONGC and 11.36 per cent stake in NHPC to raise about Rs 45,000 crore in the next few months. The other offer from the government will come in the form of residuary stake sales in Hindustan Zinc and Balco, worth an estimated Rs 20,000 crore.
The government is also planning to raise about Rs 10,000 crore by selling a part of SUUTI's holding in ITC and L&T. SUUTI owns around 11.3 per cent stake in ITC, which is worth over Rs 31,500 crore, while its 8.2 per cent in Larsen & Toubro is valued at over Rs 12,100 crore.
"There is strong investor interest in Indian equities and with limited opportunities to buy quantities in the secondary market, investors would look for fresh offerings to increase their exposure," said Ravi Sardana, EVP—Investment Banking, ICICI Securities.
Indian corporates, which have raised about Rs 26,000 crore so far this year by a way of institutional placement, plan to raise about Rs 50,000 in coming months going by corporate announcements and board meeting resolutions.
"We expect more QIPs to follow in the rest of the year as there is a strong demand of equity capital by India Inc." said Nilesh Shah, CEO & managing director, Axis Capital. "The primary market in the mean time has seen strong revival as seen in response to recent IPOs."

The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.
()
Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc said India's drug regulator has approved its copy of a top-selling arthritis treatment, paving the way for its launch in the country early next year.
The company's Indian partner, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd , will sell a copycat version of Johnson & Johnson's
and Merck & Co Inc's infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug with annual sales of about $6 billion.
The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.
With changing regulations and a looming biotech patent cliff, the global market for biosimilars is forecast to rise to $24 billion in 2019 from about $1.2 billion last year, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
Infliximab, sold under the brand name Remicade, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. In India, it sells at about 70,000 rupees ($1,150) per month.
Like its main rivals, Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie Inc's Humira, the drug works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.
Epirus, a Boston-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing biosimilar drugs for sale, said it would launch the Remicade biosimilar in India under the name Infimab by the first quarter of 2015.
Chief Executive Amit Munshi, citing various estimates, said the Indian market for Remicade was worth $8 million to $10 million a year. He declined to say how much Infimab would cost or to estimate how many patients might use the drug.
The drug will be made in Mumbai by Reliance Life Sciences.
Remicade copycats are already being sold elsewhere. South Korean drugmaker Celltrion Inc won approval in July for its version in Japan and is hoping for U.S. approval in 2015.
Epirus is also in talks with Ranbaxy, as well as other Indian and international companies, about expanding sales of its biosimilar drugs in other regions, Munshi told Reuters.
"Ranbaxy has, under their license, quite a few markets in southeast Asia and North Africa," he said. "We're also working with other partners in places like Latin America."
Ranbaxy is not the only Indian drugmaker to explore production of biosimilar drugs. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd , for example, is developing biosimilars with Germany's Merck KGaA.
Biocon Ltd has a tie-up with Mylan Inc, while Lupin Ltd has entered a deal to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster insulin, Lantus, in India.

BSE Sensex recovers on realty  healthcare stocksUS rate hike fears hit markets as Sensex, Nifty fall most in 7 weeks
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 17:15 IST

In their worst single-day drop in nearly 7 weeks, Sensex plunged 324 points to 26,492.51 and Nifty tanked 109 points to 7,932.90 on negative cues from jittery global markets before the US Federal Reserve's much-awaited monetary policy meeting that starts later on Tuesday.
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced. Major markets in Asia ended down and Europe was weak in morning trades.
Domestic investors also took money off the table in recent out-performers in sectors including realty , banking, consumer durables and oil & gas. All the 12 BSE sectoral indices ended in the red.
Smallcap and midcap stocks, which in previous sessions had bucked a weak trend, saw a huge sell-off with their indices falling over 3 per cent each.
The 30-share Sensex after resuming higher at 26,854.90, improved to 26,861.29. However, it succumbed to widespread selling in blue-chips and slipped to day's low of 26,464.03, before ending at 26,492.51 - down 324.05 points, or 1.21 per cent. This is its worst drop since August 1 when Sensex had plummeted 414.13 points. Today's closing is also its weakest since August 26 (26,442.81).
Among major laggards, Tata Power suffered the most by plunging 5.85 per cent. Others include Tata Steel, Hindalco, NTPC, Tata Motors, ONGC, RIL, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and L&T.
Bucking the trend, stocks of Dr Reddy's, Bharti Airtel , ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys gained.
The 50-share Nifty dropped 109.10 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close below 8,000 mark at 7,932.90 after moving between 8,044.90 and 7,925.15 intra-day. Tuesday's drop is also Nifty's worst show since August 1 when it fell 118.70 points.
"Market players will be looking for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years. Consensus is that the Fed will hike interest rates next year and it may declare the timelines today," said HDFC Securities in a note.
Sectorally, the BSE Realty sector index suffered the most by losing 3.42 per cent, followed by Power down 3.26 per cent, Capital Goods 2.70 per cent and Oil & Gas 2.67 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 74.59 crore on Monday as per provisional data released by stock exchanges.

After SBI, PNB likely to revise deposit rates in 15 days
The credit growth of PNB is around 13 percent currently and is expected to touch 15 percent by the end of FY15.
Post your opinion here
We have a busy season coming in and so, in the second half of the year the credit growth should pick up
KR Kamath
CMD
PNB
After country’s largest lender  State Bank of India  (SBI) cuts deposit rates to 8.75 percent from 9 percent for 1-3 years, other banks are likely to follow the suit.
Public sector lender Punjab National Bank  (PNB) is expected to revise its deposit rates in the next 15 days, says CMD KR Kamath. "We are at 9 percent now and we have also been looking at it because we have enough liquidity in the bank to meet the reasonable credit demand that can come," he adds.
However, the call on lending rate will depend on credit pick up, Kamath adds.
The credit growth of the bank is around 13 percent currently and is expected to touch 15 percent by the end of this fiscal. 
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: There was an unscheduled rate cut by SBI. They have cut their one-three year deposit rates by a quarter percentage point. Now they stand at 8.75 percent, what is your one-year rate and will it be lowered shortly?
A: We are at 9 percent now and we have also been looking at it because we have enough liquidity in the bank to meet the reasonable credit demand that can come.
Now with the credit demand not going in a big way, there is no meaning holding on to the liquidity and accumulating and investing such amount in some other investment instruments which gives you less than what you pay on the deposit.
We will just wait and watch and in case the credit pick-up doesn’t happen then we may also have to look at reviewing the interest rates and deposit rates.
Q: How long will you take before you make that decision?
A: We have a credit policy in front of us in another 15 days and we may take maybe 15 days time to look at it.
Q: You expect this to become a flood, most of the bankers to follow suit now that the guy with 25 percent market has given you the elbow room?
A: I think it depends on respective banks’ asset liability management (ALM) positions. We also find that some of the banks are still in the wholesale market beyond 9 percent.
It depends on the respective banks’ ALM positions and those banks who are positive on liquidity may definitely review the rates of interest and who are still having ALM issues may take a little more time.
Q: How long do banks take to convert that into a lending rate cut?
A: If you look at the lending rate cut today, the demand is absolutely on the retail side that is happening and we are lending at the best possible rates that housing loans going at base rates and auto rates, all cut at 10.65-10.75 percent sort of a thing.
Now converting it into a base rate reduction will definitely take some time because it will also have far-reaching implications on the net interest margins (NIMs). So this is a temporary phase and then we should see how the credit pick up happens and only then we will take a call on the lending side.
Q: Can you give us an indication of how much of 25 bps cut will impact the margins positively?
A: In single digit numbers it will impact. It will not create a big impact because about 40 percent of your deposits are in current account/savings account (CASA). So it is only 60 percent. Also, you see how much of the deposit comes in this bracket.
Q: Would banks therefore cut single product loan rates? Like you only cut home loans or you only cut consumer durable loans ahead of Diwali it makes sense, should we expect that kind of a pattern from banks?
A: That can happen to some extent but banks have already announced this. The basic loans that are in demand today are housing loans which are absolutely at base rate by most of the banks. So there is no further scope of cutting them. In respect of the auto loans, we have already cut and announced it at 10.65-10.75 percent.
Q: Are you saying that deposit rate cut has followed the lending rate cut?
A: On a retail side, yes.
Q: We were speaking with Keki Mistry just a while back and he indicated that he expects to see about 15 percent credit growth once the credit offtake picks up. What is your indication of how much time it would take for credit growth to pick up and what could the eventual growth be?
A: We have a busy season coming in and so, in the second half of the year the credit growth should pick up especially the working capital limits, which are not drawn out are drawn up.
Also, on the basis of your other creditor investment, the credit growth cannot come in a big way. The SME credit and the agricultural credit are just keeping pace with the normal credit growth rate.
Last year our growth was not that good. So we are around 13 percent but 15 percent growth is possible.
Q: Is it too early to call this a beginning of a decline in the rate cycle?
A: Yes, if you have tracked governor’s statement yesterday, it is too early to say that we are out of the woods. Therefore, it is too early to say it is a beginning but since it has happened, you cannot just say not also. But what is the gap in the next moves to cut, we will have to wait and watch.

A huge explosion rattled windows in Afghanistan’s capital early on Tuesday, sending a plume of white smoke rising above eastern Kabul and killing at least one person, a witness said.
The blast tore through cars on the main airport road near the U.S. Embassy, leaving them tangled hunks of metal. A Reuters witness saw the dead body of at least one foreigner in a uniform lying at the scene.

MUMBAI: Shares of newly listed Snowman Logistics were locked at 5 per cent upper circuit for second straight session.
There is increased demand for the stock after Reliance Mutual Fund and ace investor Radhakishen Damani bought shares in bulk deals from the open market.

The company enjoys a blended margin at around 25 per cent, wherein the warehousing generates almost 40 per cent of the margin and the balance comes from the distribution .
"In our business, the more you scale it up, the more the margins are going to increase, because we have a fixed cost in terms of infrastructure, which will not going to change for us. So, the margins will definitely improve as capacity utilisation goes up. So I think our margins will increase as well as the utilization," said Ravi Kannan , CEO & Director, Snowman Logistics.

Security issues to be discussed on Modi s US visitObama to discuss security issues on PM Narendra Modi's US visit
Lalit K Jha     Washington   Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 15:02 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
The United States on Tuesday said it shares a very broad relationship with India and key issues of security, economy and energy among others would be discussed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's maiden visit to the country.
"We are all looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Modi to Washington for a number of meetings," State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told foreign correspondents at a news conference in Washington.
US President Barack Obama's administration is gearing up to give a red carpet welcome to Prime Minister Modi when he arrives in Washington on September 29 from New York where he would attend the annual General Assembly session of the United Nations.
Modi is scheduled to meet Obama at the White House on September 29 and 30.
"This is a broad relationship we have with India in a whole host of areas. Certainly security; I'm sure we'll talk a lot about security issues. Environmental issues, energy issues, economic issues - our relationship with India really is a very broad one where we talk about a whole range of topics," she said in response to a question.
The US, she said, wants India to have good relationships with all the countries in the region, including China. In a lot of these areas, we have overlapping interests. So we certainly are welcoming the Prime Minister to Washington, having a full agenda, she said.
Afghanistan, Harf said, is important to a lot of people but more so to the Indians. I think that'll certainly be a topic of conversation, Harf said.
The discussion between Prime Minister Modi and the US President over two days in Washington is expected to result in taking the bilateral relationship to the next level in terms of defense and strategic ties, co-operation in the field of space and counter-terrorism and unleash the potential of economic and trade ties, sources familiar with the preparations had told PTI earlier.
On September 29, Obama is likely to host the Inidan PM for a small working dinner, which is rarely accorded to a visiting foreign leader.
The maiden meeting between the two leaders on September 29 would help them to know each other and prepare the ground for the next day's meeting at the White House.
Soon after Modi's electoral victory, Obama had called to congratulate him and invited him to visit Washington. Thereafter the two leaders have not spoken over phone, but there has been an exchange of letters between the two.

On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 245 billion (USD 4 billion) in 2012/13.
Post your opinion here
 
Government officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals to shut down some loss-making state-owned companies, risking a conflict with powerful trade unions.
After two decades of halting privatisations, the Central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level, involved in activities ranging from generating nuclear power to making condoms.
Some of them, including  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and  Steel Authority of India are successful, but there are dozens more that have been bleeding cash for decades and kept afloat by budgetary support each year.
On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 245 billion (USD 4 billion) in 2012/13.
The list includes Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam , Air India, Hindustan Photofilms and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation, according to a note prepared by the Department of Public Enterprises.
Officials at the department have drawn up proposals to close some.
They include Hindustan Photofilms, a company set up in 1960 to make film rolls and take on the likes of Kodak but declared a sick company in 1996 and recommended for closure by the department in 2003 on the grounds that it could not compete with private players.
The company, based in the southern town of Ottacamund in the Nilgiri hills, went to court and won a stay order on any further proceedings that could lead to its closure.
In 2010 the firm proposed a recovery plan but the government has been sitting on it, with no decision having been made since about the company's future. In the meantime the company's accumulated losses have piled up to Rs 82.32 billion, about 40 times its paid-up capital.
"There is no future for this company in the current environment. It is a fit case for winding down," said a government official at the Department of Public Enterprises, which is overseeing the privatisation of state firms. The official did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The department will be making a presentation at Tuesday's meeting.
The government is also considering a proposal to wind down the watch-making division of HMT Machine Tool Limited after years of losses that have forced it to borrow from the government to pay wages.
Unions
Trade unions are opposed to any moves to shut down state firms and the Bharatiya Mazadoor Sangh (BMS), a body affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would work with other unions to block the move.
"We are co-ordinating with all central trade unions on the matter. We are fortunate that all trade unions are on the same page when it comes to these issues," said Vrijesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the BMS.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which took office in May pledging to reignite growth, has embarked on a cautious course of shedding stakes in state firms although it has eschewed big moves.
The government increased its privatisation target for its fiscal year 2014/15 budget to Rs 630 billion from the interim budget's target of Rs 480 billion. The target is nearly four times larger than total government divestments in the past four years.
Officials said the government was also looking for ways to revive some of the sick companies through capital infusion, joint ventures and by bringing in new management.

Satyam Case: All Accused Asked to Appear in Court on October 27Future Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Hyderabad: A local court trying the case of multi-crore accounting fraud in erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) on Monday ordered all the accused to appear before it on October 27.
The court has not given any date for judgement, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Special Public Prosecutor K Surender said.
The ten accused in the case include the prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju, his brother and Satyam's former managing director B Rama Raju, ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, former chairman Mr Raju's another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch. Srisailam, and Satyam's former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The trial in Satyam fraud case had concluded in the second half of June before the special court, which examined 216 witnesses and marked 3,038 documents during the course of the hearing.
Touted as the country's biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009, after Mr Mr Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company's account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees. He was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother.
In February that year, CBI took over the investigation and filed three charge sheets (on April 7, 2009, November 24, 2009 and January 7, 2010), which were later clubbed into one.
Mr Raju and others were charged with offences ranging from cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery, breach of trust, under relevant sections of IPC, by way of inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of various I-T laws.
During the trial, CBI alleged that the scam caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to Satyam shareholders, while the defence countered the charges, saying the accused were not responsible for the fraud and all the documents filed by the central agency relating to the case were fabricated and not according to law.

After a small break on last Friday, the selling pressure resumed again on Monday dragging the Sensex below 27000 level dented by weak industrial output in July despite significant fall in August inflation. Global nervousness ahead of FOMC meet (which will begin on Tuesday) too caused pressure. However, the broader markets outperformed benchmarks and the market breadth remained positive.
 
The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 244.48 points to close at 26816.56 and the 50-share NSE Nifty lost 63.50 points to 8042 whereas the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up 0.12 percent and 0.65 percent, respectively.
According to Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA, the coming festive season should be a barometer of Indian economic recovery.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee breached 61 level, hitting a four-month low intraday on the bank of weakness in equity markets and increased demand for dollars overseas. It was down 49 paise to 61.14 a dollar at close.
Prabhat Awasthi, Nomura says a stronger dollar, driven by expectations of divergent monetary policies of the Fed and other major developed world central banks is positive for Indian equities on an overall basis.
Historically, broad dollar strength typically begins 6-9 months ahead of a rate tightening cycle, a phase we believe India is now entering, he elaborates.
On the economic data front, WPI inflation hit five-year low in August, easing to 3.74 percent as against 5.19 percent in July supported by low food and fuel cost.
“The WPI index is less relevant today from the point of view of monetary policy but still is indicative of prices at a different level,” said CARE Ratings, adding it still does not think the RBI will lower interest rates on September 30 based on this information.
CPI inflation (announced on Friday evening) also declined to 7.8 percent versus 7.96 percent on month-on-month basis but industrial output dropped sharply to 0.5 percent in July from 3.9 percent in June on weak growth in manufacturing, capital goods and consumer goods sectors.
Stocks in Action
Shares of oil & gas, metals, technology, FMCG, capital goods, power and auto stocks were under pressure.
Jindal Steel and Hindalco Industries topped the selling list, falling 4.6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Tata Steel and Sesa Sterlite were down over 1.5 percent after China’s industrial production grew 6.9 percent last month, its weakest rate since December 2008, as against 9 percent growth in July.
Shares of TCS, HDFC, ITC, Reliance Industries, ONGC, L&T, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Tata Motors, M&M and Sun Pharma dropped 0.8-1.8 percent.
However, Cipla bucked the trend, up 2.8 percent as the company entered into a licensing agreement with Gilead to increase access to Hepatitis C treatment.
Another drug maker Lupin ended at record closing high of Rs 1414, up 4 percent on a media report that the company is in advanced talks to sign a blockbuster deal with Merck Serono.
Private sector lender HDFC Bank climbed 0.5 percent as managing director Aditya Puri is affirmative that the growth will get back to 25 percent and even 30 percent growth when the economy gets back to 6-7 percent growth, which he expects by FY16.
Two-wheeler maker Hero Motocorp rose 1.6 percent as company expects very strong sales in festive season and expects sales of 6 lakh 2 wheelers during Diwali.
In the broader space, Fortis Healthcare shot up 6.7 percent on selling RadLink-Asia stake to Medi-Rad Association for about USD 110 million while Bajaj Electricals gained 1.5 percent on winning eight new orders worth Rs 518.5 crore.
Atlas Cycle Industries gained 7 percent after Uttar Pradesh government decided to exempt VAT on bicycles costing less that Rs 3,500 whereas YES Bank tanked 5 percent after FII investments reached trigger limit.
Advancing shares outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of 1756 to 1309 shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Park Street rape survivor denied entry to restaurantPark Street rape survivor denied entry to restaurant
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Mon 15 Sep, 2014
Print
Kolkata: An Anglo-Indian woman, who was allegedly raped inside a moving car here in 2012, Sunday claimed she was denied entry into a restaurant for being a "rape victim". The restaurant refuted the claim.
The 40-year-old woman alleged that the management of Ginger, a restaurant-cum-bar in south Kolkata's Kalighat area turned her out.
"The management said they can't allow me because I was the Park Street rape victim. They said they have orders not to allow me inside. If I was raped, is it my fault? Why can't I try to live a normal life," the woman said.
The restaurant management, however, denied the charge and claimed the woman was turned out for being "troublesome".
"She was not barred for being a rape victim. Rather she had earlier created trouble. We have video footage to show how she had created trouble after getting drunk, and so we barred her," said eatery owner Dipten Banerjee.
The mother of two was allegedly raped at gun-point inside a moving car and later thrown out in February 2012.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had courted controversy after she dubbed the incident "fabricated".
While five people were charged by the court, only three are behind bars. Two, including the prime suspect, are still untraced.

500 feared dead in Mediterranean migrant shipwreckPrint
Agence-France Presse | Rome | Posted: September 15, 2014 5:10 pm
As many as 500 migrants could have died after traffickers rammed and sank their boat in the Mediterranean last week, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Sunday, quoting survivors.
Two Palestinians plucked from the water by a freighter on Thursday after their boat capsized near Malta told the organisation that there had been around 500 passengers on the vessel, which was wrecked on purpose by people smugglers.
“Two survivors brought to Sicily told us that there had been at least 500 people on board. Nine other survivors were rescued by Greek and Maltese ships, but all the rest appear to have perished,” Flavio Di Giacomo, IOM’s spokesman in Italy said.
Details of the shipwreck could not be independently verified.
According to the survivors, the Syrian, Palestinian, Egyptian and Sudanese migrants set out from Damietta in Egypt on September 6, and were forced to change boats several times during the crossing towards Europe.
The traffickers, who were on a separate boat, then ordered them onto another, smaller vessel, which many of the migrants feared was too small to hold them.
When they refused to cross over to the new boat, the furious traffickers reportedly rammed their boat until it capsized, the organisation said.
Italian police have opened an inquiry into the shipwreck. According to the Italian navy, some 2,380 migrants and asylum seekers were rescued over the weekend by Italy’s large-scale naval deployment dubbed “Mare Nostrum”, launched after over 400 people died in two shipwrecks last October.

Insurers want rich to pay more for universal health coverSep 15, 2014, 09.41 PM IST  | Source: PTI
Insurers want rich to pay more for universal health cover
The fact that only 20 per cent of people have health cover, out of India's 124 crore population, makes it clear that India is a hugely underpenetrated market when it comes to health cover.

Insurers want rich to pay more for universal health cover
The fact that only 20 per cent of people have health cover, out of India's 124 crore population, makes it clear that India is a hugely underpenetrated market when it comes to health cover.
Post your opinion here
 
Insurers and other health insurance industry stakeholders feel that the proposed universal health cover (UHC) must be underwritten in a variable way, so that the rich pay higher premium to help fully subsidise health insurance cover for the really poor. "Personally, I feel that the government should pay full premium for health cover for the below poverty line (BPL) segment and it should be subsidised for the middle class.
"However, the rich must be asked to pay the full premium for getting health insurance cover," New India Assurance Chairman-cum-Managing Director G Srinivasan told PTI today. The idea is that people may freely go for add-on or top-up health insurance cover on their own.
"It's the basic model of universal health cover that we are working on. Health cover will be the same for all people because as an insurer, we don't differentiate between people, Srinivasan said.
The fact that only 20 per cent of people have health cover, out of India's 124 crore population, makes it clear that India is a hugely underpenetrated market when it comes to health cover.
Individual health cover is only 2 per cent, while 4 per cent have group cover and another 14 per cent are covered under various central and state schemes like the central government's Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana. A leading doctor at the renowned Sir Gangaram Hospital in the national capital also agreed with the largest general insurer.
"If somebody is poor, then the government must pay the full premium. However, the premium can be raised if the person covered is rich. It could be brought down a bit for the middle class," Sir Gangaram Hospital Chairman and Head of Surgical Gastroenterology and Lliver Transplant Saumitra Rawat said.
Experts also said premium amount may be brought down in case policies are underwritten on a large scale, thus enabling economies of scale for insurance providers. "Cost of underwriting a health insurance policy will become affordable if the volume goes up," ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Chief for Underwriting and Claims Sanjay Datta said.
The government should provide basic coverage for all diseases and some higher coverage for critical illnesses like cancer and heart diseases, though all secondary and tertiary diseases must be covered by insurance providers themselves, he said. Insurers also said that universal health cover would address the issue of under-penetration of insurance to a great extent and its scope could be enlarged by forming a pool to cover serious diseases like cancer.

Fair Trade Regulator Clears 15% Stake Buy in MCX by KotakFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank's proposed Rs 459-crore deal to acquire a 15 per cent stake in Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Monday received approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), making the financial sector conglomerate a major player in exchange business.
According to the fair trade regulator, the proposed deal "is not likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India".
On July 20 this year, Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) had announced that it has signed an agreement to sell 15 per cent in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank for Rs 459 crore.
As mandatory, Kotak had approached CCI for its approval on August 1, 2014.
In its order released on Monday, the commission observed that Kotak has 40 per cent equity interest in Ace Derivatives and Commodity Exchange (ACE) a national multi-commodity exchange.
This stake would have to further brought down to 15 per cent by the year 2019 in accordance with the revised norms by the Forward Market Commission (FMC), CCI noted.
Besides, the fair trade watchdog also said "that neither Kotak nor any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or joint venture, either directly or indirectly, has any investment in any other commodity exchanges in India".
As per the details in the CCI order, post combination Kotak would hold a 15 per cent non-controlling equity interest in MCX and as per the norms by FMC, the bank would not have any contractual right to appoint directors to the board of MCX, in proportion to its shareholding in the exchange.
FTIL originally held a 26 per cent stake in MCX. The Jignesh Shah-led company is divesting stake in MCX after commodity market regulator FMC had declared the company unfit to run any exchange in the wake of a Rs 5,600-crore payment crisis at group company National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).
The regulator had asked FTIL to reduce its stake in MCX to 2 per cent from 26 per cent.
Before the Kotak deal, FTIL had sold a 6 per cent stake in MCX in two rounds for about Rs 220 crore, bringing down its shareholding to 20 per cent.
After the agreement with Kotak Mahindra bank to sell 15 per cent stake, FTIL would be left with 5 per cent stake in MCX.

New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has cleared Singapore government investment arm Temasek Holding's proposed acquisition of a 10.16 per cent stake in Intas Pharmaceuticals, saying the deal will not raise anti-competition concerns.
Under the proposed deal, Dunearn Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd - a indirect subsidiary of Temasek - would acquire the stake from Mozart Ltd - a wholly-owned subsidiary of ChrysCapital III LLC.

The regulator said that "there are no horizontal overlaps between the products and services of Intas and the rest of the Temasek group".
"...Temasek has some minority investment in the companies engaged in the pharmaceutical and health sector in India including Medreich Ltd, a pharmaceutical company in India," CCI said.
Among others, CCI said that "in respect of the overlapping products of Intas and Medreich Ltd, the combined market share is of minimal nature".
"Further, as stated in the notice neither Temasek nor any of its subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures has any significant vertical linkage with any of the business activities of Intas or its subsidiaries in India," CCI added.
Incorporated in India, Intas is a vertically-integrated pharmaceutical company with global operations.

Sebi Eases Governance Norms, Extends Woman Director Deadline
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 23:47 (IST)
Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
Mumbai: To ease the process of implementing stronger corporate governance norms by listed firms, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Monday relaxed various provisions of the new law, especially for smaller companies, and extended the deadline for appointing at least one woman director to April 1, 2015.
Changes have been made to the new regulatory regime, which would come into effect from next month, following numerous representations received by the regulator with regard to these regulations that would vastly change the way listed companies function and are regulated in the country.
While amendments have been made to various provisions of this Corporate Governance Code to align them with the relevant sections of the new Companies Act, the deadline would remain unchanged at October 1, 2014, except for requirement of a minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies.
The listed companies would have time till April 1 next year to comply with the woman director-related provision. Sebi has also exempted smaller companies - those having equity share capital of up to Rs 10 crore and net worth not exceeding Rs 25 crore, as also listed on SME platforms of the stock exchanges - from the mandatory compliance to the new Code "for the time being".
Among others, the proposed regulations related to tenure of independent directors, as also the definition and exemption from mandatory prior approval for certain related party transactions, have also been amended to align them with the Companies Act.
Announcing the changes, Sebi said it has "received representations from market participants including companies and industry associations, highlighting certain practical difficulties in ensuring compliance, seeking clarifications on interpretation of certain provisions and suggesting various options to ease the process of implementation".
These issues were examined and discussed in the Primary Market Advisory Committee of Sebi and "in order to address the above mentioned concerns and facilitate the listed companies to ensure compliance with the provisions of the revised Clause 49 (which deals with the Corporate Governance norms at listed companies), it has been decided to make certain amendments to Clause 49," the regulator said.
The new corporate governance norms were proposed after detailed discussions by Sebi and with concerned stakeholders for over a year and had prescribed stronger regulations for listed companies than those prescribed under the Companies Act for general classes of companies.
Since implementation of the new Companies Act with effect from April 1, 2014, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued various circulars on matters related to Corporate Governance clarifying certain provisions of the new law.
These include clarification on rules relating to appointment and qualification of directors and independent directors, matters relating to related party transactions, and
the rules governing meetings of board and its powers.
These amendments and clarifications have been taken into account by Sebi also to make necessary changes in the new norms. Besides, Sebi had also sought earlier this year the status of preparedness of top 500 listed companies by market capitalisation for ensuring timely compliance with the new corporate governance norms.
According to the new norms, related party transactions entered into between two government companies and between a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary would not be applicable for prior approval from audit committee.
Moreover, Sebi has allowed an audit committee to "grant omnibus approval" for related party transactions proposed to be entered into by the company subject to certain conditions. For the same the audit committee would have to lay down the criteria "for granting the omnibus approval in line with the policy on related party transactions of the company and such approval shall be applicable in respect of transactions which are repetitive in nature".
Among others, the committee would also have to satisfy itself the need for such omnibus approval and that whether such approval is in the interest of the company and would have review atleast every quarter the details of transactions entered pursuant to the approval.
On modifications with regard to tenure of independent director, Sebi said that "the maximum tenure of independent directors shall be in accordance with the Companies Act, 2013 and clarifications/ circulars issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in this regard, from time to time".
Under the Act, an independent director can have a maximum of two tenures of five consecutive years (a total of ten years), with a cooling off period of three years.
Other than this, the watchdog has said that the terms and conditions of appointment of the independent directors have to be placed on the website of the company as against the earlier norms that required firms to disclose the letter of appointment along with the detailed profile of the director.
Besides, it has also asked the firms to disclose the details of "familiarisation programmes" for independent directors and policy on dealing with related party transactions not only in the company's annual report but also their respective website and a web link.
Additionally, Sebi has brought in norms that allow the chairperson of the company to be appointed in the nomination and remuneration committee. However, the chairperson is not permitted to chair such a committee.
Sebi also noted that the risk management committee would be constituted by the firm "through its board of directors".
"The majority of Committee shall consist of members of the Board of Directors" and "Senior executives of the company may be members of the said Committee but the Chairman of the Committee shall be a member of the Board of Directors," Sebi said.
For norms on subsidiary companies, the market regulator has said that a company can dispose of shares in its material subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting in cases "where such divestment is made under a scheme of arrangement duly approved by a Court/Tribunal".
"Selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20 percent of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by way of special resolution, unless the sale/disposal/lease is made under a scheme of arrangement duly approved by a Court/Tribunal," Sebi added.
Moreover, the norms would require companies to "formulate a policy for determining 'material' subsidiaries and such policy shall be disclosed to stock exchanges and in the annual report".
Meanwhile, the market regulator has done away with norms that require disclosure related to resignation of directors, disclosure of formal letter of appointment of independent director and certain disclosures like details of establishment of vigil mechanism in the annual report.

RBI Chief Calls for Cleaning Up of Banking System
Reuters | Updated On: September 15, 2014 22:47 (IST)
RBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
Mumbai: Public sector banks need to improve monitoring of loans and root out "bad apples" and "bad practices," Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Monday, as the sector continues to struggle with bad assets.
In a speech at a banking conference in Mumbai, Mr Rajan also called on public sector banks to stop outsourcing assessments of creditworthiness, and said the lenders needed to better monitor their loan evaluation processes.
"We need better evaluation using in-house skills, not intermediaries. I think one of the problems that has emerged in recent years and in recent scandals is the fact that evaluation has been outsourced," he told the gathered bankers.
"Evaluation is so central to banking, it's impossible to outsource it. It has to be brought back in-house and competency generated. We have to move towards engaged, informed banking and not banking driven by outside intermediaries and middle men."
Mr Rajan further said that public sector banks had "lots of good people" but said the lenders needed to root out "bad apples, bad practices, and weak capabilities".
The RBI supervises state-run banks in India, although the Finance Ministry controls the lenders through its majority stakes.
An economic slowdown in India has hit balance sheets in the sector, with stressed loans - those categorised as bad and restructured - amounting to about 10 per cent of all loans.
Police last month launched a corruption investigation at state-controlled Syndicate Bank Ltd, further raising concerns about weak oversight, graft and politically-directed lending in the sector.
State Bank of India (SBI), however, said the country's largest lender has never used a third party to assess the profile of a corporate borrower.
"SBI has never used a loan appraisal by any intermediary. We have always used our in-house appraisal system," SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.

70 per cent slum kids in Mumbai malnourished, says report
23
0
Mumbai: An alarming study by Mumbai based think-tank has found that 40 to 70 per cent of slum kids in the maximum city under the age of 5 barely get minimum nourishment and almost 50 per cent of them are stunted as a result. These are startling figures from a survey carried out by the Observer Research Foundation and and MB Barvalia Foundation on 300 slum children in the maximum city.
"The findings are indeed very startling. It is generally perceived that malnutrition is a rural problem, but our study shows how it is an urban issue in Mumbai slums," said Sudheendra Kulkarni, the Chairman of ORF Mumbai.
This is not just a Mumbai phenomenon, a landmark study done by UNICEF and published in the medical journal Lancet in 2012 found that one-third of the world's chronically malnourished children are in India.
#mumbai #slums #malnutrition
Mohandas Pai, Co-Founder/Member, Board of Trustees, Akshaya Patra, said, "There is an utter lack of sanitation. It's high time the government takes strict action about it."
Medical evidence links chronic malnutrition to low cognitive development and premature death later in life because vital organs never fully develop. There is no doubt that the Indian government needs to take immediate steps to protect children across the country against the menace of malnutrition and poor sanitation.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Flat on Weak Global Cues
NDTV | Updated On: September 16, 2014 09:36 (IST)
Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
BSE Sensex and Nifty struggled today amid weak Asian markets as global investors awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the US will raise interest rates.

Chit fund case: BJD MLA Pravat Kumar seeks anticipatory bail6
1
Cuttack: Senior Biju Janata Dal leader and Banki MLA Pravat Kumar Tripathy today approached the Orissa High Court seeking anticipatory bail following the raid of his houses by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
"Since the CBI officials had raided my houses, I apprehend that the investigating agency could arrest me any moment. In anticipation of any further humiliation, I have sought bail in advance from the High Court", Tripathy said.
Ever since the central investigating agency has taken up the case in the state, at least six persons have been arrested by it. Two of them were owners of media houses based in Bhubaneswar.
CBI sleuths had also raided the house of one of Tripathy's close associates Subash Padhy in Banki in connection with the case.

CBI sleuths had last month raided the houses of the MLA located in Cuttack and at Banki. The raid party had apparently seized certain documents from Tripathy's houses.
CBI sleuths had also raided the house of one of Tripathy's close associates Subash Padhy in Banki in connection with the case.
Tripathy, being the President of 'Banki Mahotsav', had allegedly taken money from Artha Tatwa CMD Pradeep Sethy last year through Padhy, who is General Secretary of the festival committee. Sethy is now under CBI custody.
CBI sleuths have also interrogated a BJD working committee member Ashis Sahu on Sunday.

Seeing good demand for bond-based issuances: LT Fin08:00 am
With lower-than-expected credit offtake and the current state of liquidity generation, interest rates or cost of money can drop from current levels, says N Sivaraman, president and wholetime director of L&T Finance Holdings .
Though inflation has cooled a bit, it continues to be a worry and hence it may take another 2-3 quarters to see a drop in interest rates, he adds.
L&T Finance Holdings is seeing good demand for bond-based issuances.
Sivaraman also commented on L&T Finance Holdings current state of business. He says in terms of core competencies, it is either the number 2 or the number 3 player in every segment it is present in, except the commercial vehicles space.
Below is the verbatim transcript of N Sivaraman's interview to CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy
Latha: What is the situation in the market itself looking like to you? Today there was this big news that is hitting the entire banking and finance space, State Bank of India (SBI) has cut deposit rates by 0.25 percent. Are you getting a sense that cost of money will fall shortly for all players?
A: Given the overall credit growth expectations as well as liquidity generation within the economy. I do believe that there is a potential for the rates to drop from where they are today. However given the slightly volatile or uncertain inflation situation, we could get to see this rate drop in a matter of two-three quarters rather than in a hurry. What we have seen is that there has been good demand for bond based issuances. So we have also been substituting our bank borrowings with bonds which has helped us overall bring down the borrowing cost by few basis points over the last two-three months of this quarter.
Sonia: The reason perhaps the stock has not performed as well as some of its peers is because of the asset quality pressures that L&T Finance has faced and even in the quarter gone by we have seen the worsening of the gross NPAs to about 3.57 percent. Are you noticing any improvement on the ground either in the infrastructure sector or with respect to retail finance and if yes how much time do you think it could take for asset quality to recover?
A: There are two aspects which I want to talk about, regarding core competency, it is important to know that we are either a number two or number three player in every segment that we are participating other than commercial vehicle (CV) segment.
CV segment perhaps we were the only one to have degrown disbursements to this segment over the last more than 30 months. So it is a sweeping comment to talk about core competency when we have built our asset book at the rate of about 35-40 percent CAGR for last five years. The growth itself has not contributed to GNPA, the environment has definitely contributed.
When you have a sluggish economy for a period of three years with government payments not coming through, there have been a lot of delayed payments coming through to the developers from various agencies and we have a stretched economy as far as the investment cycle is concerned. I don’t see ourselves being singled out as one entity which has seen deterioration in asset quality and we have seen this happening everywhere. Yes, we have had a series of setbacks beginning with micro finance and to some extent economic issues around credit quality. Perhaps this is a time when we can say with a positive outlook towards the near future both on the margin side where we have consistently shown an improvement in margin by about 15 bps in the retail segment every quarter. Secondly, we have seen a slowdown in accretion to new quality issues as far as assets are concerned. And we have given our outlook that we do see this stabilising to dropping in the next three quarters.
The effect of these will play out on our P&L and balance sheet as we look forward to the next three years. It is not our lookout to comment about the stock price. The fact is that we have 4.5 lakh retail shareholders which is the largest in the country for a size of ours.
Latha: Which segment do you see recovering fast, those who were disadvantaged by their exposure to trucks and construction equipment are also the ones who are beginning to see some level of improvement because we did see CV sales growing. In the several sectors that you service where are you seeing a turnaround first?
A: Definitely construction equipments, commercial vehicle we will continue to remain cautious. The freight loading or the opportunity to hire out construction equipment continues to be low. The cost of operations is yet to come down. The margins over there have not gone up to compensate for all that has happened. So we will continue to remain cautious in this sector till we really see a turnaround and even if you look at the sales numbers for construction equipment, they have been once again negative. Commercial vehicles other than the higher end vehicle there has been no pickup as far as the volumes are concerned. We will continue to remain cautious. Infrastructure we do see opportunities on the refinancing of the operational projects, we have done reasonably well, we have seen a slue of approvals going through. Hopefully some of them will definitely get converted into actual loans on our books and with the idea of becoming operational, we see it to be a string that will contribute to our disbursement growth and book growth in the current year.
The rural segment despite rain related issues seem to be stabilising and we see decent demand coming through. Some of the manufacturing tie-ups that we have been able to put through is helping us maintain disbursement in this segment.
On the B2C segment we also have been very active on the housing side, we do see it on a relative basis really picking up disbursements compared to the previous years. Cars is becoming slower, it is becoming far more competitive than what it was a year back given that this is one segment growing and relatively safer credit.
In the two-wheeler segment we have been able to improve our market share constantly from below 3-4 percent to around 7.5 percent today on financing. So looks well, these are the segments that we will see. The disbursement trends have not dramatically changed from the last six-nine months period. We do believe that the third and fourth quarter should give us some positive momentum.
L&T Finance stock price
On November 21, 2014, L&T Finance Holdings closed at Rs 72.35, up Rs 0.00, or 0.00 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 88.35 and the 52-week low was Rs 62.30.

US open to talks with Iran on Islamic State: JohnKerryPrint
French President Francois Hollande, left, watches U.S Secretary of State John Kerry, right, shaking hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, back to the camera, before a family photo at the international conference intended to come up with an international strategy against Islamic State extremists, in Paris, Monday, Sept. 15, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Paris | Posted: September 16, 2014 11:19 am
As more than two dozen nations pledged to help Iraq fight the Islamic State militants, the United States said it was open to talking to Iran about a role in resolving the crisis, despite Washington’s earlier opposition to Tehran even attending the conference.
US Secretary of State John Kerry ruled out any military coordination with Iran, which in the end was not invited to Paris. “That doesn’t mean that we are opposed to the idea of communicating to find out if they will come on board, or under what circumstances, or whether there is the possibility of a change,” Kerry yesterday told a small group of reporters.
France and Iraq see Shiite-powerhouse Iran as an interlocutor who could bring its influence to bear in the region against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, but some Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, disagree. The US opposed a place for Iran at the conference. But Tehran, which has political and military influence with its neighbor Iraq, still managed to be part of the conversation.
The absence of Iran underscored the conflicting sensitivities and complex politics in the region as Western countries seek to battle the Islamic State group, which has taken control of large parts of Iraq and Syria. The meeting of foreign ministers from Asia, the Middle East and the West was a first step toward deciding who does what in a multilayered offensive against the Islamic State group.
As envisioned by France and Iraq, the effort would include intensifying airstrikes, cutting off financing, and helping Baghdad cope through humanitarian aid and reconstruction. There would be no combat troops on the ground, however. As the conference began, two French jets took off over Iraq in France’s first reconnaissance missions over the country in a sign of the larger battle ahead.
Later the United States, which has led airstrikes over Iraq since August, took the first step in the planned expanded fight by launching airstrikes, going to the aid of Iraqi security forces south of Baghdad who were being attacked by enemy fighters.

Congress snatches away Mangrol seat from BJP inGujaratPrint
Written by Gopal B Kateshiya | Rajkot | Posted: September 16, 2014 11:18 am
The Congress drew first blood in Saurashtra region in bypolls to nine Gujarat Assembly seats as it snatched away Mangrol constituency in Junagadh district from the BJP while the party candidate was  ahead from Khambhaliya in Devbhoomi Dwarka district also.
However, the BJP looked set to retain its seats in Talaja in Bhavnagar and Tankara in Morbi.
Babu Vaja of Congress had secured more than 57000 votes out of approximately 114000 total votes cast in Mangrol seat with only two rounds of counting of votes to go. Vaja is a cooperative leader and he also benefitted from a sizable number of voters from minority community. The result is a setback to Junagadh BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama who had resigned as MLA from this seat after his election to Lok Sabha.
In Khambhaliya, Congress candidate Meraman Goriya was leasing his BJP rival and former minister Mulu Bera by more than 2000 votes with three quarters of total polled votes having been counted.
However, former MLA Shiva Gohil was marginally ahead of his Congress rival from Talaja. In Tankara, BJP candidate Bavanji Metaliya was coasting towards victory after taking lead of more than 5000 votes over Lalit Kagathara of Congress.
Saurashtra is a BJP bastion and all the four assembly seats had fallen vacant after their incumbent BJP MLAs were elected to Lok Sabha early this year. Given the stranglehold the saffron party enjoys in the region, Congress victory in Mangrol and a possible win in Khambhaliya are significant.

India's infrastructure market is expected to touch USD 6.6 trillion by 2025, which will be nearly 12.5 per cent of the Asia-Pacific, says a report.
According to consultancy firm PwC, the Asia Pacific infrastructure market is expected to grow by 7-8 per cent a year over the next decade to over USD 53.6 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60 per cent of the world total.
The increase in infrastructure spends in the country is likely to be driven by sectors like housing, telecom, healthcare, education, transportation, among others, it said.
"Overall, India's share of the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to continue to grow, reaching around 12.5 per cent or USD 6.6 trillion by 2025," PwC said in its report.

According to the report, transportation and utilities investments are expected to triple over the coming decade as income and travel demand will rise and the country's population will increasingly congregate in urban centres. "The ongoing development of technology services sector, as well as demand from households, is likely to drive investment in telecommunications infrastructure.
The population is expected to grow much faster than other countries in the region, which will further boost demand for infrastructure sectors serving households," the report said. While annual healthcare investment is forecast to grow around USD 37 billion by 2025, education infrastructure spending will likely to reach USD 18.9 billion.
"The huge growth in infrastructure spending will be driven by key factors such as Asia's economic growing prominence, trade competitiveness, and the current widely recognised infrastructure deficit across the emerging markets of this region.
"Asia is now the world's primary growth engine, with China, India and Southeast Asia offering a very large consumer base and low-cost workforce, with high levels of natural resources," PwC India Leader Capital Projects and Infrastructure Manish Agarwal said.

Government mulls closing some loss-making state firms  Air India  ONGC  BSNL on the list19

New Delhi: Government officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals to shut down some loss-making state-owned companies, risking a conflict with powerful trade unions.
After two decades of halting privatisations, the Central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level, involved in activities ranging from generating nuclear power to making condoms.
Some of them, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Steel Authority of India are successful, but there are dozens more that have been bleeding cash for decades and kept afloat by budgetary support each year.
After two decades of halting privatisations, the Central government still owns about 260 firms and thousands more at the state level.
#state owned companies #air india #bsnl #ongc
On Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has called a meeting of top officials to consider what to do with the 10 firms that make the biggest losses. They had a combined net loss of Rs 245 billion ($4 billion) in 2012/13.
The list includes Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Air India, Hindustan Photofilms and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation, according to a note prepared by the Department of Public Enterprises.
Officials at the department have drawn up proposals to close some.
They include Hindustan Photofilms, a company set up in 1960 to make film rolls and take on the likes of Kodak but declared a sick company in 1996 and recommended for closure by the department in 2003 on the grounds that it could not compete with private players.
The company, based in the southern town of Ottacamund in the Nilgiri hills, went to court and won a stay order on any further proceedings that could lead to its closure.
In 2010 the firm proposed a recovery plan but the government has been sitting on it, with no decision having been made since about the company's future. In the meantime the company's accumulated losses have piled up to Rs 82.32 billion, about 40 times its paid-up capital.
"There is no future for this company in the current environment. It is a fit case for winding down," said a government official at the Department of Public Enterprises, which is overseeing the privatisation of state firms. The official did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The department will be making a presentation at Tuesday's meeting.
The government is also considering a proposal to wind down the watch-making division of HMT Machine Tool Limited after years of losses that have forced it to borrow from the government to pay wages.
Unions
Trade unions are opposed to any moves to shut down state firms and the Bharatiya Mazadoor Sangh (BMS), a body affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would work with other unions to block the move.
"We are co-ordinating with all central trade unions on the matter. We are fortunate that all trade unions are on the same page when it comes to these issues," said Vrijesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the BMS.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which took office in May pledging to reignite growth, has embarked on a cautious course of shedding stakes in state firms although it has eschewed big moves.
The government increased its privatisation target for its fiscal year 2014/15 budget to Rs 630 billion from the interim budget's target of Rs 480 billion. The target is nearly four times larger than total government divestments in the past four years.
Officials said the government was also looking for ways to revive some of the sick companies through capital infusion, joint ventures and by bringing in new management.

Archaeologists sure of new finds from  ancient computer  shipwreckSep 16, 2014 at 10:31am IST
Archaeologists sure of new finds from 'ancient computer' shipwreck
8

Athens: Archaeologists set out Monday to use a revolutionary new deep sea diving suit to explore the ancient shipwreck where one of the most remarkable scientific objects of antiquity was found.
The so-called Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device known as the world's oldest computer, was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off a remote Greek island in the Aegean.
The highly complex mechanism of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears was used by the ancient Greeks to track the cycles of the solar system. It took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in Europe.
The so-called Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device known as the world's oldest computer, was discovered by sponge divers in 1900.
Now archaeologists returning to the wreck will be able to use a new diving suit which will allow them to more than double the depth they can dive at, and stay safely at the bottom for longer.
Double the diving depth
The Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, will permit divers to reach depths of 150 metres (492 feet) and still perform delicate tasks, says archaeologist Theotokis Theodoulou.
The suit, which resembles a puffy space suit, "expands our capabilities", Theodoulou told AFP as the team set off for a month-long expedition to Antikythera, which lies between Crete and the Peloponnese.
"I'll be able to grasp, pluck, clench and dig... for several hours," he said.
Archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck. Up to now they had only been able to operate at a depth of 60 metres.
The mechanism was found with a spectacular bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying booty to Rome, and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered.
"We have good signs that there are other objects present," said Angeliki Simosi, head of Greece's directorate of underwater antiquities, after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013.
"There are dozens of items left, this was a ship bearing immense riches from Asia Minor," added Dimitris Kourkoumelis, another archaeologist on the team.
The archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship, some 250 metres away from the original discovery site.
Antikythera, which now has a population of only 44, was on one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified.
Monumental statues
The Greek team is assisted by Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist from the renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Massachusetts, which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the Titanic.
Foley has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years.
"We may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901, in the mistaken belief that they were rocks," Foley said.
As well as the new Exosuit, the Antikythera expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed-circuit "rebreathers", which will allow divers much more time underwater.
"We will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site, because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers," the expedition's website said.
"Each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day, and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at Antikythera."

New Delhi: YouTube users in India will soon be able to save videos from the Google-owned service, making it possible to watch them offline, and the feature will eventually be available globally, the company said Monday.
The feature will be available through the YouTube app on Google's new Android One smartphones unveiled in New Delhi on Monday.

"YouTube will be available offline soon, starting with India," Google India communications manager Gaurav Bhaskar told AFP.
The feature will be available through the YouTube app on Google's new Android One smartphones unveiled in New Delhi on Monday.
#android one #youtube #micromax canvas a1 #karbonn sparkle v
Smartphones using Google's Android operating system are used by more than one billion people globally and the new Android One phone is part of the company's drive to reach out to billions more.
The company said the YouTube save service will be available soon but gave no date. It did not give any indication when it would be extended to other parts of the world.
The new YouTube save feature will be "a great benefit for when there is a slow connection or re-watching videos without using up the data plan", said Bhaskar.
Google has tied up with local Indian handset makers Micromax, Karbonn and Spice Mobiles to make Android One Smartphones that will start at Rs 6,299.
"While 1.75-billion people around the world already have a smartphone, the vast majority of the world's population - over five billion more - do not," said Sundar Pichai, a senior Google vice president.
Google said the phones will be "high-quality" and "affordable" smartphones sold through online Indian retailers.
The new Google phones come with improved security features and more than a million apps, the company said.
Smartphone-makers are in a race to the bottom of India's economic pyramid as they battle for customers in the fast-growing low-end market segment where analysts say opportunities are vast.
India is now the fastest-expanding smartphone market globally and the third-largest market after China and the United States, according to Britain-based consultancy Canalys.
The cheapest smartphones now retail at Rs 2,000, down from an average 15,000 rupees two years ago.
Technology consultancy IDC India projects annual smartphone sales growth of around 40 per cent for the next five years in the price-sensitive nation, home to 33 percent of the world's poor.
Smartphones now hold a 10 per cent market share among India's mobile-phone-using population, according to consultancy IDC.
Handset makers in India and other emerging markets have been leapfrogging fixed-line technology that was used in developed markets.
They are employing mobile broadband to deliver Internet access to people who have no computers.

Apple: Record 4 mn orders of iPhones on first dayApple: Record 4 mn orders of iPhones on first day
PTI
Tweet
New York, Sept 16:  
Apple had more than 4 million advance orders of its new iPhones in the first 24 hours, exceeding its initial supply, the company said on Monday.
The company said the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be delivered to customers starting Friday and throughout September, but many won’t be delivered until October.
Phones will still be available Friday on a walk-in basis at Apple retail stores and from various wireless carriers and authorised Apple resellers.
Apple’s website had intermittent outages last Friday because of heavy traffic as orders began online. The company said the 4 million orders set a new 24-hour record.
It did not immediately say what the old record was. Last year, Apple sold 9 million phones in the first three days they were on sale.
The new phones were announced last week and have larger screens, faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments at retail stores by holding the phone near the payment terminal. The phones start at USD199 with a two—year service contact.
The phones will initially be available in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK Availability will expand to more than 20 additional countries a week later.
A free update to Apple’s iOS software for phones will be available to existing users on Wednesday. The new phones will come with that update, iOS 8.

Strong quake hits JapanTweet
Tokyo, Sept 16:  
Buildings in Tokyo shook today as a strong quake hit Japan, reports said, but there was no immediate risk of a tsunami and no damage was reported.
Seismologists said the epicentre was around 44 kilometres north-northeast of the Japanese capital and was located around 50 kilometres below the surface.
The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.6. Their Japanese counterparts said there was no danger of a tsunami from the tremor, the effects of which could be felt in buildings for more than a minute after the initial shaking began.
The operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant, which was battered by a tsunami after a powerful undersea quake in 2011, said nothing unusual had been noted at the still-fragile site.
“There was no abnormality in our monitoring at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following the earthquake. Also, we have not received any reports of damage from the latest quake,” spokesman Keisuke Murakami said.
The Japan Atomic Power Co. said the Tokai No.2 Power Station, which was nearest to the epicentre of the quake, showed no signs of any problems.
An official at the Ibaraki prefectural government said checks were ongoing, but that so far there appeared to be nothing amiss in the wider area.
“We have not received any reports of damage, injuries or casualties following the earthquake. We are still checking if the quake could result in damage,” he said.
Japan is hit by around a fifth of the world’s powerful quakes every year and sits at the conjunction of several tectonic plates.
Building codes are rigorous and regular disaster drills are held, helping to ensure that despite their frequency and their violence, quakes usually pass without loss of life or significant damage to property in Japan.
However, the 9.0 magnitude undersea quake of March 2011 sparked a huge tsunami that smashed into the country’s northeast coast, killing around 18,000 people and creating the world’s worst nuclear emergency in a generation.

BJP loses 13 of the 24 seats held by it, cedes ground to SP in U.P., and Congress in Rajasthan and Gujarat
The BJP on Tuesday suffered a major blow in the Assembly by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the States it had swept in the Lok Sabha polls four months ago, losing 13 of the 24 seats held by it.
The BJP has suffered electoral reverses in all the three rounds of by-elections held after it swept the Lok Sabha polls four months ago.
The saffron party, which got majority on its own in the Lok Sabha riding a “Modi wave”, has got a rude shock in the third round of by-elections, losing ground in key states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home State of Gujarat.
Out of the 32 Assembly seats across nine States for which counting of votes was taken up on Tuesday, BJP won 10, Congress seven and Samajwadi Party seven while the TDP, the Trinamool Congress, the AIUDF and the CPI(M) bagged one each. One seat in Sikkim was won by an Independent. In three seats in UP where results were awaited, the BJP was leading in two and Samajwadi Party in one.
It was Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was on a high after a near-total sweep of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, that delivered a humiliating blow to the saffron party as it lost seven of the 11 seats held by it, including one held by its ally Apna Dal.
The BSP’s absence in the by-elections had made it a virtual straight fight between the SP and the BJP in the politically crucial State.
Equally crushing was the defeat in Rajasthan where BJP conceded three of the four seats to the Congress, which also managed to wrest three of the nine seats in Gujarat, where the elections were held for the first time in 12 years with Mr. Modi at the helm.
All the seats in Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9) and Rajasthan (4) were held by the BJP and the bypolls were necessitated after the MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha.
The first bypolls were held in Congress-ruled Uttarakhand close on the heels of the May 16 Lok Sabha verdict. The outcome had shocked the BJP as the Congress had won all the three Assembly seats including two seats which were held by former BJP Chief Ministers who were elected to Lok Sabha by comfortable margins.
The second round saw the party losing six out of the 10 seats in Bihar, despite a formidable show in the Lok Sabha polls.
Seat adjustments among arch rivals — JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar and RJD’s Lalu Prasad besides the Congress — forced the BJP to beat a retreat as the three parties together won six seats.
As the BJP again suffered reverses in the Assembly bypolls, the Opposition said that the results should ring alarm bells for the BJP and the Modi government.
This meant that an anti-incumbency factor has set in within 100 days of the Narendra Modi government coming to power, Congress General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed said.
“If you look at these results, these bypolls have proved to be bye-bye polls for the BJP,” NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi remarked.
The bypoll results have come as a shot in the arm for the Congress as it gained three seats each in Gujarat and Rajasthan after drawing a blank in Lok Sabha polls.
Gloating over the BJP’s reverses, the Congress and the SP called it as a defeat of the communal forces. They said people had rejected the Modi government and the BJP’s “politics of polarisation”.
The BJP, which is hoping to do well in the coming Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, conceded that the bypoll results were not up to its expectations and said that people had voted on local issues.
The only solace for the BJP on an otherwise dismal day was its entry into the West Bengal Assembly.
BJP candidate Shamik Bhattacharya won the Basirhat Dakshin seat in North 24-parganas district by a margin of 1,742 votes against his nearest Trinamool Congress rival and former Indian soccer captain Dipendu Biswas. The seat was earlier held by the CPI(M).
The BJP retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Mr. Modi, albeit with a reduced margin. Ranjanben Bhatt thumped her Congress rival Narendra Rawat by over 3.29 lakh votes. Mr. Modi had won the seat by 5.7 lakh votes.
In the other two Lok Sabha by-elections, Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, the stronghold of the ruling SP, Tej Pratap Singh, the grand nephew of Mulayam Singh Yadav, defeated the BJP’s Prem Singh Skahkya by a margin of more than 3.21 lakh votes.
Mr. Yadav had vacated the seat after he chose to retain Azamgarh.
In Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, the ruling TRS retained the seat vacated by party chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Its candidate K. Prabhakar Reddy won by 3,61,277 votes.
In Uttar Pradesh, out of 11 Assembly seats, the SP won seven seats and the BJP one. In Gujarat, the BJP won six seats and the Congress three, while in Rajasthan the Congress bagged three and the BJP one. In Andhra Pradesh, the ruling TDP retained the Nandigama seat.
In West Bengal, the Trinamool and the BJP won one seat each. The BJP also made other advances in eastern region wresting Silchar constituency in Assam from the Congress. The All India United Democratic Front and the ruling Congress retained Jamunamukh and Lakhipur seats respectively in the State.
The CPI(M) won the Manu (ST) Assembly constituency in Tripura while Independent candidate R.N. Chamling, brother of Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling, won Rangang-Yangang Assembly seat in Sikkim by 708 votes defeating his nearest Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) nominee.
Last month, the saffron party suffered a 4-6 defeat at the hands of the RJD-JD(U)-Congress alliance in Bihar and yielded two strongholds to the Congress in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the by-elections. In July, it lost all the three Assembly seats in Uttarakhand to the Congress in the by-elections.
In U.P., while the SP won Bijnor, Thakurdwara, Nighasan, Hamirpur, Charkhari, Sirathu, Balha and Rohaniya assembly seats, BJP won Saharapur (city seat), Lucknow East and Noida.
Charkhari was earlier held by Union Minister Uma Bharati and Lucknow East by Union Ministers Kalraj Mishra.
In Gujarat, the BJP lost Dessa, Mangrol and Khambalia seats to the Congress. It managed to retain Maninagar, Tankara, Talaja, Anand, Kheda and Limkheda Assembly seats.
In Rajasthan, the BJP lost in Nasirabad, Weir and Surajgarh Assembly constituencies. It retained Kota city.
In West Benagl, whereas Trinamool Congress bagged the prestigious Chowringhee seat. The TMC candidate Nayana Bandopadhyay won by a margin of 14,344 votes against her nearest rival BJP’s Ritesh Tiwari.
The AIDUF’s Abdur Rahim Ajmal won the Jamunamukh seat defeating Congress’ Bashir Uddin Laskar by 22,959 votes in Assam.
The AIUDF president Badruddin Ajmal’s son Abdur Rahim Ajmal retained the seat polling 62,153 votes.
The ruling Congress retained Lakhipur seat as its candidate Rajdeep Goala defeated his nearest BJP rival Sanjay Thakur by 9172 votes garnering 40,090 votes, while Thakur got 30918 votes. In Silchar, however, BJP’s Dilip Kumar Paul won.
Ruling Telugu Desam Party’s Tangirala Sowmya won the Nandigama Assembly bypoll in Andhra Pradesh by 74,827 votes.
Riding on the sympathy wave, Sowmya, a software engineer, got 99,748 votes. The by-election was necessitated following the death of Ms. Sowmya’s father due to a cardiac arrest.
CPI(M) candidate Prabhat Chowdhury trounced the Congress candidate Mailafru Mog in Manu (ST) constituency in Tripura.
The constituency fell vacant after former Industries and Commerce Minister Jitendra Chowdhury was elected to the Lok Sabha.

Parag Thakkar of HDFC Securities told CNBC-TV18, "Healthcare is 17 percent of US GDP and US GDP is USD 16 trillion economy, so this is very important space. Right now it contributes - for Wipro it is 10 percent, for  Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) and  Infosys it is seven to nine percent while it was 26 percent for Cognizant. Cognizant has clearly said that US healthcare companies are desperate for reducing their costs and so they see huge traction in this particular segment so they have acquired this."
"There is lot of deals coming in healthcare space, we recently saw  Wipro getting a deal in Saudi Arabia, and two weeks ago they got a big deal in Canada. So deals are coming from all over the place. So we remain very positive on two fronts, one is USD 16 trillion economy growing at 3.5 percent means lot of business and second, even after tapering this is the growth," he added.
"Dollar will continue its strength and dollar revenue growth for Indian IT services will be continue. Valuations, after long time IT services business which is free cash flow machine they are trading at below market price-to-earnings (PE). Except for TCS very other largecap IT stock is trading at below market PE. It's an excellent combination of value and visible growth," he said.

Prefer SBI  PNB  OBC: Parag ThakkarParag Thakkar of HDFC Securities told CNBC-TV18, "We already have a buy on couple of public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, in large caps  State Bank of India (SBI),  Bank of Baroda (BoB) and  Punjab National Bank (PNB) and in midcaps  Union Bank and  Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC)."
"Recently we came out with a note where we are saying that the banks like Union Bank and OBC are set to report net interest margins (NIM) increases. So their margins can expand because they are growing their book very slowly. PSU banks are set for a re-rating but one has to remember that because of the problems of past like this coal mine deallocations and some of the very highly leveraged companies some problems can persist. So FY15 is a clean up year and from FY16 things should improve significantly," he added.

Buying a car? Why petrol vehicles make more economic sense
According to a Crisil report, the breakeven period after buying a costlier diesel car, compared to a petrol vehicle, has moved up from 2.4 years in FY2012 (when the differential between the fuel prices was at the maximum) to an estimated 5.6 in FY2015.

Buying a car? Why petrol vehicles make more economic sense
According to a Crisil report, the breakeven period after buying a costlier diesel car, compared to a petrol vehicle, has moved up from 2.4 years in FY2012 (when the differential between the fuel prices was at the maximum) to an estimated 5.6 in FY2015.

Moneycontrol Bureau
As petrol prices skyrocketed over the past several years, diesel cars had started outselling petrol cars by about 7 to 3 at one point , due to their low running costs and higher fuel economy.
However, as the government decided to increase prices of subsidized diesel till it finally reached market levels – and after the price differential between petrol and diesel cars widened due to the increasing demand for the latter -- it now becomes clear that the economic sense to invest in a diesel four-wheeler has reduced drastically.
According to a Crisil report, the breakeven period after buying a costlier diesel car, compared to a petrol vehicle, has moved up from 2.4 years in FY2012 (when the differential between the fuel prices was at the maximum) to an estimated 5.6 in FY2015.
The report has arrived has taken into account the costs associated with the Maruti Suzuki Swift, one of the country’s largest-selling vehicles, even as the breakeven is in the same range for vehicles in a similar price bracket while it moves to 9.5 years for more expensive cars such as the Skoda Superb.
The math is this: the typical difference between a similar-trim petrol and diesel Swift would be Rs 1.04 lakh (Rs 4.42 lakh versus Rs 5.46 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi), 40 percent of which can be recovered during the vehicle’s resale.
With a 23 percent differential in the mileage (18.6 kmpl versus 22.9, ARAI figures) and a Rs 9.54 per litre differential in fuel (Rs 68.51 versus Rs 58.97, Delhi prices), the savings on running a diesel vehicle would be Rs 11,082 per year if it travels 10,000 kms a year.
Crisil assumes that maintenance costs for both vehicles are similar.
If the vehicle, however, clocks a higher annual run, of 15,000 kms or 20,000 kms, the breakeven reduces to 3.8 years and 2.3 years, respectively.
The tilt in economics back towards petrol vehicles has already resulted in showing up in sales numbers: petrol vehicles have already started outselling diesel vehicles, according to some reports . Crisil forecasts petrol vehicles to account for 55 percent of car sales this year compared to 42 percent in FY13.
“The ownership cost equations will change if car manufacturers decide to reduce the price premium for diesel vehicles, which is a possibility given the converging fuel prices,” Crisil said, pointing out that the average premium charged on a diesel car is 25 percent in India (compared to a petrol car) while the same stands at about 10 percent in Europe.
The analysis, however, is restricted to small cars such as hatchbacks and sedans rather than utility vehicles, where higher torque levels, etc, tilt the decision in favour of diesel variants.
Maruti Suzuki stock price
On November 21, 2014, Maruti Suzuki India closed at Rs 3348.80, up Rs 13.50, or 0.40 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 3397.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 1541.25.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 102.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 32.57. The latest book value of the company is Rs 694.45 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.82.

Bypolls: BJP losing ground in UP  neck and neck with Congress in GujaratBy-polls: BJP losing ground in UP, neck and neck with Congress in Gujarat
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 16:  
BJP appeared to cede ground in Uttar Pradesh where SP was leading on six of the 11 Assembly seats where by-polls were held, while it was neck and neck with Congress in Gujarat and behind them in Rajasthan today exactly four months after it swept the three states in Lok Sabha elections.
Three hours after the counting of votes to 33 Assembly constituencies spread across 10 states began, two results were declared with TDP candidate T Sowmya winning Nandigama (SC) in Andhra Pradesh by about 75,000 votes, while CPI-M nominee Prabhat Chowdhury trounced his nearest Congress rival Mailafru Mog by 15,971 votes in the Manu (ST) in Tripura.
The outcome of the by-polls are seen as yet another test for Narendra Modi government’s popularity since it assumed power in May, It is also important as BJP prepares for polls in Haryana and Maharashtra next month where it hopes to oust the Congress in the two states.
Uttar Pradesh
In Uttar Pradesh, SP is leading in six seats, BJP and its ally in four seats and Congress in one, an Election Commission official said in Lucknow.
Stakes are high for BJP, Congress, and Samajwadi Party in UP after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls.
Gujarat
Ruling BJP is leading in five Assembly seats in Gujarat, while Congress is ahead on four, according to early trends.
Initial rounds of counting indicated a neck and neck fight on at least five seats in the Assembly elections.
BJP is leading in Anand, Tankara, Maninagar, Talaja and Limkheda Assembly seats, while Congress is ahead in Khambalia, Matar, Mangrol and Deesa, according to election officials.
All the seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was a three-time MLA from Maninagar.
The by-polls are also considered to be a test for new Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel under whose leadership, the elections are being held for the first time.
Rajasthan
In Rajasthan, the Opposition Congress candidates are leading in three out of the four Assembly constituencies, while ruling BJP candidate is ahead on the remaining one.
Initial trends show that Congress candidates Shrawan Kumar (Surajgarh), Bhajanlal (Weir) and Ramnarayan (Nasirabad) are leading, while BJP’s Sandeep Sharma was ahead on Kota South.
Trinamool Congress and Congress are leading in Basirhat Dakhin and Chowringhee Assembly constituencies in West Bengal.
For the three seats in Assam, Opposition AIUDF is leading in Jamunamukh and Lakhipur, while BJP is ahead in Silchar.
Counting of votes was also underway in Rangang-Yangang seat in Sikkim, Manu in Tripura and Antagarh in Chhattisgarh.
After BJP’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in UP in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago, it is to be seen whether the party can retain its 10 seats. One seat was earlier with its ally Apna Dal.
The current BJP President Amit Shah had scripted the sweep in UP helping the saffron party bag 71 seats while its ally Apna Dal got two.

Need a Job Watch What You Post on InternetRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
New Delhi: Social media has emerged as a major background check tool for employers and nearly 68 per cent of them decide against hiring individuals after finding negative details about them, according to findings of a survey.
As many as 59 per cent employers are currently using social media to research on job candidates, while another 33 per cent are planning to access the platform soon, the survey by job site CareerBuilder India said.
According to the survey, 68 per cent employers who research job candidates on social media have found 'content' that caused them not to hire the individual.
The findings of the survey were based on responses by top 1,200 corporates in the country.
Moreover, about 75 per cent of employers were observed to be also using search engines such as Google to research potential job candidates, the survey showed.
The most common reasons for employers to reject a job aspirant were that the candidate lied about his qualifications (50 per cent), had poor communications skills (50 per cent), posted provocative or inappropriate photographs or information (47 per cent) or shared confidential information of previous employer (42 per cent).
Among other reasons, the applicants had posted details about their drinking or drug habits (38 per cent), were linked to criminal behaviour (35 per cent) or had bad-mouthed their previous company or fellow employees (32 per cent).
"It's vital for job seekers to remember that much of what they post to the Internet - and equally importantly, what others post about them - can be found by prospective employers, and that can affect their chances of getting hired down the road," CareerBuilder HR vice president Rosemary Haefner said.
"Job seekers need to stay vigilant, and pay attention to privacy updates from all of their social networking accounts so they know what information is available for others to see," she said.
Meanwhile, many employers surveyed said they were likely to hire the candidate if they found on social media platform that the individual's background supported his/her professional qualifications, his/her personality was clearly a good fit within the company culture, he/she had great communication skills, was creative and had a wide range of interests, among others.

Taper tantrums unlikely for Indian marketsTaper tantrums unlikely for Indian markets
Puneet Wadhwa and Ishan Bakshi | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 10:42 AM IST
With the US Federal Reserve likely to stick to the reducing the quantum of bond buying programme in its meeting this week, analysts now seem to be eyeing hints regarding the first interest rate hike from the US central bank's chair, Janet Yellen.
They, however, remain divided on the timing. While some argue might happen early than expectations given the strengthening economy, others expect the US Fed to remain in a wait–and–watch mode.
“In terms of the Fed, the market looks to be positioning itself for a hawkish shift here. The focus here is upon the possible tweaking of the FOMC’s (Federal Open Market Committee’s) statement so as to remove the current pledge that rates would remain low post the end of QE tapering for a considerable time,” points out a recent note by Rabobank International.
“Our Fed watcher, Philip Marey, expects this pledge to be removed this week but sticks to his view that a) The Fed will want to “tick all the boxes” before hiking and, b) The recovery will not proceed in as linear a fashion as the FOMC expects. As such, he continues to look for the first rate move taking place at the end of the next year (Q4) rather than in the middle as per the current consensus,” it adds.
So what does it mean for India?
Analysts believe that India will remain in a sweet spot as far as liquidity is concerned even if the US Fed winds down its QE programme. This liquidity, coupled with an overall improvement in macro conditions, has enough ammunition to take the stock markets higher.
“As the US Fed winds down its liquidity infusion program this year, the BoJ (Bank of Japan) and ECB (European Central Bank) might potentially open up their own liquidity taps—balances things out for India. The search for yield on account of further liquidity creation will be positive for capital inflows given India’s elevated interest rates,” says Prabhat Awasthi, managing director & head of equity research, Nomura Financial Advisory.
While, India’s monetary policy has tended to be largely coupled to the US Fed’s policy, their paths going forward are expected to diverge. Beginning last year, RBI under its new governor Raghuram Rajan has consistently focused on containing inflation. Rajan, who has raised interest rates thrice since he took office last September, said earlier that if he's convinced that the target of six per cent consumer inflation (CPI) by January 2016 can be achieved, the central bank would re-look at interest rates.
“The RBI doesn’t want to fight the inflation battle every two years. So the whole idea is to create an environment which is conducive for the manufacturing industry to revive by breaking the backbone of inflation. Rate reduction, in our opinion, is still far away,” said Sujoy Das, head of fixed income at Religare Invesco Mutual Fund.
In the past countries that suffered were ones that tended to have high current-account and fiscal deficits and high inflation. But under the new dispensation India has made considerable progress on these fronts. Growth although sluggish is likely to have bottomed out. Inflation is trending down and the current account deficit has narrowed. The new government in addition has reaffirmed its commitment to containing fiscal deficit.
“Market-wise, we expect falling inflationary expectations and easier liquidity to spur another round of re-rating of the market multiple in the short–to–medium term. We maintain our one-year forward Sensex target of 30,310, based on a one-year forward P/E multiple of 16.4x versus the current level of 15.6x, a three–year average of 14.2x and 5-year average of 14.9x,” Awasthi of Nomura adds.
In this backdrop, analysts expect we expect bond yields to come off by 20 – 30 basis points (bps) by November 2015. However, once the RBI starts to cut rates, they point out that the yields could rise again by 200 – 300 bps over the next two years. “Rupee is expected to hold steady if we don’t see heavy outflows and on an overall basis, we think that the RBI is doing a good job managing it,” Das of Religare adds.

An Artist and A Writer Went to Comic Con
Local comic artists. International guests. Make-shift costumes. Sweaty crowds. Comic Con, back in Bangalore for the third time, continues to draw fans in large numbers for a variety of reasons, plenty of them unrelated to comics. We bring you a look at this year's Comic Con, and scenes from the three days of festivities.

There is such a thing as an event being so successful that it is no longer a pleasant experience. At 4pm on day two of Comic Con Bangalore-2014, it was not only impossible to walk two meters without having to fall into the slow zigzag of the crowd; it was even more difficult to shrug off the feeling that the layer of sweat that was growing on me wasn’t really coming from me.
The sponsors of Comic Con Bangalore in their many stalls were only too aware of the fact that we’ve quickly transitioned into a world where the digital counterparts of real-time experiences are often far more valuable: as I stood a few feet away, looking at the ‘Hike Zone’ – Hike Messenger’s stall which called people to “Hike up their lives” – a volunteer enthusiastically instructed me to step in and take a picture with the Hulk. Nearby, a photographer took pictures of people getting their faces painted, while a stall near the entrance to the food court handed out colourful wigs to people posing in an Instagram frame.
Let’s be real. We’re at a comic book convention whose tagline is “For the love of comics”, but he’s here for the love of t-shirts, she’s here for the love of Harry Potter/Game of Thrones/ Arctic Monkeys posters, and we’re all here to look at the Chumbak stall and be happy, and wonder what in God’s name kinetic sand is.
I begin trying to guess where the stage is before realizing that I am only a few feet away from it. Bundles of people move in sticky conglomerations towards the stalls, and after I have pushed my way through the crowd and am standing at the edge of a large group of people seated on the floor, I am surprised to see Dan Parent – writer and illustrator of Archie comics – on stage. The mics are losing a battle against the loud hum of the crowd, and the artists keep asking audience members to repeat their questions. There are more people turned away from the stage than towards it, but I can’t really blame them – they might have not known that it was there to begin with.
One of the hosts of the stage events, Vijay Sinha, says, “When I first looked at the floor plan, I wouldn’t have guessed that it would have been a problem. I still think that the plan works – the artists are seated in the center of the ground, and they can interact with fans.”
David Lloyd (the illustrator of V for Vendetta , the dystopian graphic novel written by Alan Moore), Peter Kuper (the writer and illustrator of “ Spy vs. Spy ” for MAD Magazine), Sana Amanat (an editor at Marvel Entertainment and creator of Ms Marvel ), and Dan Parent – the “international guests” that all the volunteers are eager to talk about when I ask about the reception of this year’s Comic Con – sit at a panel where fans may get copies of their works autographed.
I approach them early on day three before the lines begin to form (Rob DenBleyker of the popular webcomic “ Cyanide and Happiness ” has a booth to himself where a line has already begun folding itself to accommodate everyone). The artists are surprised by the number of fans who are eager to meet them. Dan Parent says, “It’s fantastic. I didn’t know that Archie had so many readers in India.” Never mind the extensive coverage in the Indian media or that Archie’s followed so closely here that we even have him dancing to Bollywood songs .
Away from the hall’s center are the un-international artists, who smile and make eye contact from behind their mostly empty lines when they see me looking at their tables. It would have been nice to have had these artists interact with the “international guests”.
Comic Con Bangalore is also the venue for the first public display of the Xbox One in India, which will come out on the 23rd of this month. When I ask Sandhya Gurung – account director at an agency that helps market the Xbox – about this, she says, “We thought it would be a good idea. You know, comic books, gaming, it all sort of fits.” She goes on to explain how the last product, the Xbox 360, was promoted in colleges through a ‘battle of couch gaming’, where the winner won a ticket to the FIFA World Cup 2014.
The volunteers are clear about one thing, “Comic Con is not only about comics”. “Even our website says that it’s about popular culture,” they tell me with confidence. Over the last two days I’ve seen someone dressed as the music producer and performer Deadmau5, someone in a mask from the horror movie Scream, and one of the girls from the TV show “Two Broke Girls”, amongst others. I can hardly disagree.

Wipro Bags Deal From Saudi Electricity Company
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 21:02 (IST)

This will help ensure uptime of distribution networks, expense controls and effective utilisation of assets.
"We have traditionally had a strong position in the utilities space in the global market, and this will allow us to further strengthen our leadership in this space in KSA," Wipro Arabia general manager and head Thomas George said.
The deployment will help SEC to methodically migrate existing data from current digitised and manually maintained systems to SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.
In addition, the solution will help SEC to streamline day-to-day operations and increase operational and financial efficiencies.
"With this program, we will be able to scale up our operations in a significant way and seamlessly manage our distribution networks. Wipro's deep domain capability and technology-leadership will help us deliver cost-effective services and serve our large customer base in an efficient manner," Saudi Electricity Company's NEBRAS Program executive director, Eng Mohammad A Al-Nahari, said.

Infosys Foundation to Spend Rs 249 Crore in FY15
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 22:21 (IST)
Future Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: Infosys Foundation, the philanthropic arm of India's second largest IT firm Infosys, will spend Rs 249 crore during fiscal year 2014-15 through various initiatives aimed at promoting education, improving health and assisting rural development.
As a part of its efforts, Infosys Foundation on Monday launched a new programme -  Spark-IT - to enhance the skill levels of engineering graduates in the country.
"Infosys Foundation has several programs aimed at alleviating hunger, promoting education, improving health, assisting rural development, supporting arts and helping the destitute," Infosys Foundation said in a statement.
For fiscal year 2014-15, Infosys Foundation plans to deploy Rs 249 crore towards these initiatives, it added.
Spark-IT is a three month programme, which will work towards enhancing technical and communication skills of unemployed engineering graduates. However, it does not guarantee employment at Infosys.
"Many engineering graduates in India find it difficult to gain meaningful employment due to inadequate skills. Through Spark-IT we are imparting technical and communication skills to prepare candidates for future employment," Infosys Foundation chairperson Sudha Murty said.
Under the programme, more than 35,000 applications were received from 27 states.
"In fiscal 2015, Spark-IT plans to train 1,800 graduates spread over 11 batches, at the Infosys campus in Mysore, Mangalore and Chennai and Rs 9 crore have been committed for this programme," the statement said. Candidates will be given a monthly stipend of Rs 10,000 and an accommodation allowance of Rs 5,000 per month. On completing the program, they will be given a certificate of participation.

Alibaba to Boost IPO Size on  Overwhelming  Demand: ReportFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd plans to increase the size of its US initial public offering (IPO) because of "overwhelming" investor demand, people familiar with the deal said on Monday.
The Chinese e-commerce company launched the IPO last week and had enough investor demand to cover the entire deal within two days, people familiar with the process said last week.
Alibaba could set a new record for the world's biggest IPO if underwriters exercise an option to sell additional shares to meet demand, pushing it as high as $24.3 billion and overtaking Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's $22.1 billion listing in 2010.
The company and some shareholders offered 320.1 million American depositary shares at a $60-$66 per share indicative range. Alibaba will likely file an amendment to its IPO later on Monday with a higher price range after discussing the new price with large US mutual funds and institutional investors, one of the people said.
"Demand has been overwhelming since the launch," said the person, who couldn't be named because details of the IPO aren't yet public.
"Increasing the price range was already on the cards from the beginning."
Bloomberg earlier reported that Alibaba plans to increase the top end of the price range to above $70.
Alibaba spokeswoman Florence Shih declined to comment on the size of the IPO being raised.
Reuters reported on Friday that Alibaba plans to close its IPO order book early after it received enough orders to sell all the shares in the record-breaking offering.
Overseas expansion
Alibaba plans to expand its business in the United States and Europe after the much anticipated IPO, billionaire founder Jack Ma said on Monday as the Chinese e-commerce titan pitched its record deal to investors in Asia.
"After being listed in the US, we will develop our business in Europe and in the US," Ma told a packed group of journalists ahead of his presentation to investors. "We will not give up the Asia market because, as I would say, we are not a company from China, we are an Internet company that happened to be in China."
The investor luncheon took place in a huge events room at the luxury Ritz Carlton hotel. The hotel is on the same building as three of the main bookrunners of the IPO, just an elevator ride away from Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley offices, across the harbor from the city's financial center.
Fund managers and analysts were given orange bracelets to give them access to the banquet of smoked salmon, chicken breast and mango pudding. The event had two videos and a question and answer session with Ma answering most of the questions, according to investors at the presentation.
Missed opportunity
Alibaba picked New York for its IPO after Hong Kong officials rejected its request to allow a small group of company insiders to nominate the majority of its board.
The request went against Hong Kong's "one share, one vote" principle, which has been staunchly defended by its securities regulator.
Ma, who is also Alibaba's executive chairman, said that the missed opportunity came about in part because of how Alibaba communicated its plans to local authorities, mirroring statements he gave last year.
"People say that Hong Kong lost the Alibaba deal. To me, I think it is Alibaba that missed this great opportunity to list in Hong Kong," Ma added. "We love Hong Kong. We will continue to love Hong Kong and invest in Hong Kong."
The company launched its IPO last week and is expected to price the deal on Sept. 18. It will start trading a day later.

Man pleads for toilet to save marriageGovernment officials in Ranchi’s outskirts are rushing to have a toilet built for a tribal man whose wife has threatened to divorce him unless he gets one constructed at their home.
 
For months, Mahavir Oraon didn’t take his wife’s request seriously, partly because of his own financial problems. But he panicked after his wife, Karmi, threated to walk out on their one-year-old marriage.
 
Oraon then rushed to local government officials, pleading to save his marriage by helping him get a toilet constructed at his house in Ranchi’s Itki locality.
 
“We have taken his request seriously and have subsequently directed the village water and sanitation committee to construct a toilet at Oroan’s house at the earliest,” the Block Development Officer, Devdas Dutta, said.
 
Local officials have hailed Karmi for her ‘courageous’ act and is considering making the couple a mascot in their drive to push hygiene in Jharkhand.
 
In a letter to the BDO, Oroan, a resident of Mukhmandro village under Luhna Panchayat in Ratu block, said his wife, who is from Ranchi, had been complaining since the second day of their marriage about the lack of a toilet in the house as she was not used to going into the open to answer nature’s call.
 
Local panchayat head, Silwanti Devi, said: “We are yet to adapt to the practice of having toilets at home. In Mukhmandro, out of 250 households, (a) few have proper toilets.”
 
Villagers said a few roofless toilets were constructed around six years back by the water and sanitation department but none is functional as they were not provided with water supply.
 
Jharkhand ranks amongst the worst in India in sanitation. More than 91% people in rural areas do not have access to toilets. The 2011 census said only 7.7% of rural population had access to proper toilets.
 
Jharkhand police records state that 25% of rapes in rural areas are committed against from women going into the open to defecate.

Modi-Xi agenda: Work for  Hindi-Chini buy-buyprint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is receiving the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Ahmedabad on the former’s birthday. If symbolism mirrored reality, then we should see the birth of new relations between India and China under the two leaders.
Relations between countries marred by conflict and distrust cannot, however, change abruptly unless new challenges emerge, surpassing bilateral differences, and a strategic shift becomes necessary to cope with them together.
In our case, the fundamentals of the relations have not changed. China still claims large parts of Indian territory, with new maps issued recently showing Arunachal Pradesh as Chinese territory. It has repeatedly said that the resolution of the border issue should be left to future generations. Xi has declared firmly that China will never compromise on territorial issues. China is confronting Japan and the US with its aggressive maritime claims and also intimidating its Southeast Asian neighbours as well. It seems confident that despite huge investment and trade ties with Japan and the United   States and the vulnerability of its export-based economy in a conflict situation, it can assert its regional hegemony incrementally. Why should it be more accommodating with India when the cost of strong-arming us is much less?
China’s territorial provocations — even questioning our sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir — have occurred even as our Special Representatives (SRs) have been talking of solutions. China has hollowed out the original mandate of the SRs to ‘politically’ resolve the border issue by extending its scope to the entire gamut of relations. We should wind up the SR mechanism and revert to the exercise earlier agreed upon — unilaterally renounced by the Chinese — to define on the ground the Line of Actual Control so that repeated atmosphere-fouling ‘incidents’ on the border are avoided.
Ironically, our attachment to ‘strategic autonomy’ gives China a freer hand to calibrate the levels of friendliness and tensions with us as opportune because, behind us, they are not confronting any alliance arrangement. China’s interest is to encourage us to pursue an independent foreign policy. It is concerned about our growing strategic ties with the US and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s wooing of India. Its current smiling-face diplomacy towards us is to raise our awareness of the opportunity cost of discounting China in favour of Japan, besides encouraging us to distance ourselves from the US re-balancing towards Asia. Paradoxically, if there is concern that closer strategic ties with the US and Japan may leave us open to more Chinese pressure on the border, our independent posture actually relieves China of any pressure to resolve the border issue.
China will not dilute its strategic ties with Pakistan in order to build bridges with us. If we could not persuade even the US to cease bolstering Pakistan, how can we expect China to heed our sensitivities? Pakistan and Pak-occupied Kashmir play a key part in China’s ‘connectivity’ strategy to our west. Through nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, China balances strategically the India-US nuclear deal. China’s intrusions into our broader neighbourhood will remain a challenge for us.
All this does not preclude India and China working together in areas of common interests, whether on climate change and WTO issues, in BRICS and the Russia-India-China format, at the G20 and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Both countries have interests in reforming the international financial institutions. But then, the biggest beneficiary of a shift of power to Asia is China. Our dilemma is whether an increasingly strong China sitting atop us is better for us than the erosion of the West’s long domination of global affairs necessary for a more equitable international system.
China’s strongest card in international relations, as the world’s largest exporter with humungous reserves of $3.8 trillion, is the economic one. It has built enormous capacities in infrastructure and India, with its poor infrastructure and in desperate need of upgrading, is a huge market. India-China economic relations are unbalanced, with China enjoying a huge trade surplus and restricting the entry of our internationally competitive products into the Chinese market, while capturing key areas of power and telecommunications in India. China’s investments in India remain minuscule.
Modi’s development agenda and his pragmatic approach to China create opportunities for Xi to play the economic card with India more vigorously. It is unclear, however, whether China has definitively concluded that it has earned enough Indian trust to invest heavily in India, and that tensions on the border can be isolated from burgeoning economic ties. Talk of China investing $100 billion in the next five years is unreal, as China’s total investment abroad so far is about $80 billion. Bagging projects in India, supplying equipment and financing Indian companies is not investment. Will China spend its own money to build industrial parks in India? We should be open to benefiting from China’s ability to undertake projects and supply equipment very competitively, but we should not start believing that if China makes more money in India, it is doing us a favour. Concepts such as the Silk Road, the Maritime Silk Route and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor are intended to promote China’s commercial interests and divert attention away from its disruptive territorial and maritime claims by propagating the notion that China is merely proposing cooperative moves to enhance prosperity for all.
While testing whether China’s moves towards us are strategic or tactical, we should seriously build synergies with it in areas where both sides benefit. Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai proved illusory; Hindi-Chini Bye Bye is not feasible, given the reality of our neighbour’s powerful international role today; Hindi-Chini Buy Buy is a reasonable objective for the Modi-Xi tandem to work for. But we should not be sweet-talked again into believing a Hindi-Chini Lie Lie.

J-K floods: When waters rose  Muslims in Srinagar rescued PanditsComments
Wazirbagh has a temple and a gurdwara. Though many Kashmiri Pandit families have left the area, 10 to 12 families still live here and its adjoining areas. There are several Sikh families too whose garments and hardware shops now lie submerged in water.

When flood waters were rising by a few feet every hour, the family of a Kashmiri Pandit, Ashok ji, as neighbours call him, was among the first to be rescued by Sohail Tabrez and Akil, the Muslims of the locality.
“Ashok ji had saved young Akil when there was a theft in his house. We went to the Pandit families here and asked them to leave their homes. The Sikh families too were rescued by army and locals,” says Sohail Tabrez.

The sprawling three-storied house of Ashok ji is being looked after by Shariq Mughal and Akil, both teenagers, who along with their friends take over a dozen trips a day on a boat taken from the army by depositing their identity cards.
When they reach the submerged Kalgi Dhar gurdwara in neighbouring locality, they call out to Inderjit Singh, the gurdwara’s old caretaker to take his supplies of the day.
Also getting their daily milk and food from the boat are Akil’s pet cats, Angrez and Rangrez, besides some pet dogs in Burzbagh. The few locals and migrant workers who continue to live on the top floors or rooftops of eateries and homes too call out for water and food.

The Pandit family owning the Natraj medical shop on the corner of road leading to Lal Mandi Chowk has long left but it is still called Natraj gali. “We had requested Bhabhijaan to stay but the family left. Inderjit, the gurdwara’s caretaker only has Muslim friends,” said Tabrez whose throat has gone hoarse asking people to stand in a queue to be ferried on boat. “I will have to again take medicine from Tinni,” he says referring to the young Sikh homeopathic doctor of the locality.

Android One will bring high-quality smartphones to India  says Pichaiprint
In March 2013, Chennai-born P Sundarajan, better known as Sundar Pichai, shot to fame when Google CEO Larry Page announced that he would head the Chrome operating system (OS) and apps business and fill the shoes of Andy Rubin, the architect of the Android unit. Around that time, Pichai was also being mentioned as a potential co-CEO of Microsoft Corp. Reports said Pichai was cajoled to stay back by Page. An IIT-Kharagpur graduate, Pichai joined Google in 2004. Today, the Android operating system (OS) has a market share in excess of 80%, both globally and in India. In an interview on Monday, Pichai, in Delhi to launch three Android One phones, spoke about the road ahead for Android, wearable devices and partners. Edited excerpts:
This is a real big event for India. What do you hope to achieve with Android One?
Outside the I/O (Google’s annual developer conference), this is one our biggest events globally. Android One is our initiative to bring high-quality smartphones to new markets like India. We are going a step forward from Android. We are providing a reference platform, and a menu of choice for our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to choose various tested and pre-qualified components so that it’s easier to build a phone. And with that, they get the peace of mind of software backed by Google, with security and updates.
We are not only announcing the launch of the devices, but also connectivity partnerships with telecom service providers like Bharti Airtel, and our expansion to other countries in South Asia. All three devices from Micromax, Karbonn and Spice will go on sale across India, both online and offline. The question was: what was the most affordable phone we could deliver, given the quality bar we had in mind?
By 2017, India will have 500 million internet users, and Google expects many of these users to access the internet through smartphones. Within the next couple of years, India will become the second largest internet user (market) in the world, and most new users will access the internet on mobiles. And Android is powering much of this growth. In India, Android users have more than tripled over the past 12 months. With today’s announcement (of the Android One mobiles), we expect the pace to accelerate.
And you have wearables in the offing?
Wearables will be the next wave of computing, and they are a great addition to the smartphone experience. There are a whole new set of uses in segments like health and fitness.
Which mobile you currently use?
I have about 20 devices at any given time, and switch between them. I’m constantly using the next phase of devices that are being tested, and which we plan to ship.
What’s that on your wrist now (pointing to a smartwatch-like wearable)?
This is a confidential prototype that I can’t talk about.
What’s that on your wrist now (pointing to a smartwatch-like wearable)?
This is a confidential prototype that I can’t talk about.
Do you feel you have filled the shoes of Andy Rubin well?
They were definitely big shoes to fill in. Andy had run it (Android) for a long time. At the same time, it was a very natural and intuitive thing for me to do. I had a very good team in place. The good thing about stuff such as Android is that you don’t get much time to think about such things. I felt like running a marathon at a sprint pace on a treadmill, and someone just came and made the treadmill go faster. You get one shot at it, or you fall down.
Will we see the Chrome OS and Android OS merging at some point?
We invest both in Android and Chrome. Computing is integral to people’s lives. The onus is on us to deliver more useful things to them. We have a huge opportunity across Android to make computing more useful. We are investing in both areas, and we will converge organically. In L (the new Android L is an update that will offer Google’s new design, improved battery life, enhanced security features and smarter notifications), we are doing a lot of work on making Android and Chrome integrated with the rest of our offerings. So, while there will be a unifying experience across services, Chrome OS and Android One won’t be a single OS since they have unique attributes.
But you do face competition from companies such as Apple and Microsoft., especially from the latter in the enterprise segment, for which you have Android for Work. How do you perceive this scenario?
Android One is not guided by others. We don’t take the computing landscape for granted. Competition is good and the journey to get computing to all is important. But our approach is different from our competitors. Android for Work (a platform that allows business and personal information to co-exist on a single device—derived much from Samsung’s Knox) is underway. It will be a consistent platform for companies.
It’s a big initiative and we are working with a lot of partners, including Samsung. There were reports about competitors trying to poach you. But you’re still at Google...
I’m very passionate about computing and Google is a place where I can have a long-term vision for it and a humbling place to be in. Larry (Page) is committed to the very long term. It’s a partnership I enjoy.
What’s your leadership style?
I believe in working with people who share your vision for making a difference and then empowering them. At a practical level, it’s (about) staying out of the way. When coordinating such a large ecosystem such as Android, people need to share your concerns.

Diesel deregulation may follow price cut of ...Government to consider diesel deregulation and price cut

(The government is weighing…)
NEW DELHI: The government will consider decontrolling diesel and cut the fuel's price by 40 paise per litre this month as the sharp fall in global crude oil prices has paved the way for a major reform in fuel pricing, government and industry sources said.
The fall in global prices has helped state oil firms make a profit on diesel, which has been a source of heavy subsidy burden for about a decade. The government is weighing the political impact of fuel pricing as elections in crucial states of Maharashtra and Haryana are due in weeks.
Officials said that the government has to take a call on whether or not it should announce price deregulation simultaneously with the cut in diesel prices. "Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan is expected to consult senior cabinet ministers on diesel price issue after he returns from Vietnam this week," one source said. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan have already expressed their keenness on fuel price reforms. Before the unexpected fall in global oil prices, Jaitley had told Parliament that the government would be able to decontrol diesel fully in a year if there are no international shocks in the oil sector.
Diesel price deregulation will be a major policy reform of the Narendra Modi government but, it is concerned about sudden spike in international oil prices in the near future that would adversely affect ruling BJP's polls prospects in Maharashtra and Haryana, sources said. Assembly elections in the two states are scheduled on October 15. ET first reported about an impending cut in diesel rates on September 9.
State oil marketing companies are currently gaining about 40 paise per litre revenue on diesel compared to its assumed market price. Companies have gained from fall in global prices and the gradual increase in retail price of diesel. But, petrol consumers will not gain from the sharp fall in global crude oil prices as its prices are likely to remain steady, sources said.
Crude oil prices tumbled below $98 last week, falling to the lowest in two years, but India's fuel pricing system links petrol and diesel rates to their respective international benchmarks, which don't always move in step with crude. Exchange rate also influences local prices.
Petrol prices may not be hiked this time, one of them said. The government has directed oil companies not to raise diesel prices by 50 paise by end of this month if over-recovery continues in rest of the month, an industry source said. In fact, a diesel price cut is expected by the end of this month after the cabinet reviews the fuel price scenario, the source said. But, the Election Commission may not allow a price cut ahead of assembly elections, the source added.
Government officials say that the oil ministry may have to take permission of the Election Commission to reduce diesel prices before assembly elections because of the model code of conduct.

India to be test bed for Google s new initia...India to be test bed for Google's new initiatives
By Pankaj Mishra & Jayadevan PK, ET Bureau | 16 Sep, 2014, 07.01AM IST
Google Senior V-P Sundar Pichai says India is a key market and the Android One launch heralds the start of many more initiatives here.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India will be the proving ground for many new initiatives by Google, the company's highest-profile Indian-origin executive said, highlighting the Internet giant's commitment to one of the world's biggest markets for technology.
On Monday, the Chennai-born Sundar Pichai launched cut-rate smartphones based on Google's Android One program tailored for India and likened the opportunities in this country to China, the world's second-largest economy.
"Like we are doing with Android One, we would want to do more such things India-specific. Just because of the scale and scope of the market," said Pichai, 42, a senior V-P who oversees the Chrome browser and apps. "You have seen what is happening in China, and you have seen how much investment has happened. I expect the same to happen for India and I expect Google to do the same."
At present, India contributes only a tiny fraction ($330 million) of Google's $55-billion revenue, but the country is all the more important because of the company's struggles in China. The USbased company has a minuscule share of the search engine market in the Middle Kingdom, and while its Android mobile operating system is popular, most apps are downloaded through third-party stores. "Soon we will be in that phase where it (India) is not just potential but a big market," said Pichai, pointing to the country's 500 million Internet users. "It is a big bet from our side. I think the thing that will really tip over is when I look at the numbers."
As an example of an India-specific initiative, Pichai, who reports to CEO and cofounder Larry Page, cited the launch of a service to make YouTube work even when there is no Internet connectivity. Pichai, who studied at IIT-Kharagpur, Stanford University and The Wharton School, began his career at Google in 2004.
He was the driving force behind Chrome, the browser which eventually became one of Google's most successful products. He then set out to build a whole ecosystem around Chrome — including Chromebooks (laptops running Chrome operating system) and applications that run on Chrome.
In many markets, including India, Google has faced tough questions from regulators on issues such as privacy, taxation and alleged anti-competitive practices. Pichai defended the company against criticism, saying it is not uncommon for a large company to face such scrutiny. All the same, "We never ever forget that we exist and do well because users trust us," he remarked.

10 stocks that returned upto 136% | Sensex @ 11: top 15 stock betsET 500 highlights resurgence in India Inc as companies post higher revenue, profits over 2013
Ramkrishna Kashelkar, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 11.03AM IST
(The ET500 features India…)
MUMBAI: Watershed — that's what 2014 feels like. A time of uncertainty, fear, stasis and overall gloom is giving way to hope, renewal and good cheer as various auguries point to an economic resurgence after a prolonged slump. The stock markets, racing ahead of the curve, shot up to an all-time high earlier this month.
There's no better time to unveil this year's ET500 — the definitive ranking of India's biggest listed companies — than right at the cusp of this transformation as Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready to deliver on his promise of economic deliverance from years of policy paralysis and excruciatingly slow growth.
The ET500, in broadsheet format for the first time, features India Inc's biggest companies in terms of revenue, which saw an 11% increase at the aggregate level to Rs 67 lakh crore since the last list. Nevertheless, it reflects the sluggishness through FY14 as the cut-off for this year's listing remained unchanged from the previous level. Similarly, the number of companies posting losses jumped to a record high of 85 and their combined losses, more than Rs 36,700 crore, turned out to be 18 times what it was in 2007.
On the brighter side, quite a few companies expanded profits significantly. TCS, for example, became the third-biggest in terms of profit in FY14, after energy giants ONGC and Reliance Industries. In fact, for private sector firms, the reported profit for FY14 was the highest ever. However, their public sector counterparts failed to keep pace.
The year also recorded the highest amount distributed as dividends by ET500 companies.
Coal India and Strides Arcolab paid out hefty special dividends and the big information technology companies were also generous to shareholders after turning in healthy performances. A record Rs 1.26 lakh crore was paid out as dividend in FY14, translating into 30% of the year's aggregate profits.
The petroleum sector's dominance of the ET500 continues with six of the top 10 companies belonging to that industry. The supremacy of stateowned companies could be slackening, as only five of them made it to the top 10 as against six last year.
Tata Motors became India's biggest non-oil company by revenue while State Bank of India retained its position as the biggest non-manufacturing company in the country. The top eight companies in the ET500 remain a class apart, with each reporting revenue that exceeded 1% of India's GDP.
Rivals have a long way to catch up, with an almost Rs 50,000 crore gap separating Tata Steel in eighth position and Essar Oil in the ninth. The ET500 also clearly captures the changing face of India Inc — the gradual shift away from the metro cities, as an increasing number of companies from tier-2 and tier-3 cities make it to the list.
Pune, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are gaining while Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are losing ground.

Iran wont shake Americas dirty hands in fight against the IslamicStateIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini.
Reuters | Paris | Posted: September 16, 2014 11:41 am | Updated: September 16, 2014 12:03 pm
Iran’s supreme leader on Monday said he had personally rejected an offer from the United States for talks to fight ISIS, an apparent blow to Washington’s efforts to build a military coalition to fight militants in both Iraq and Syria.
READ: US warplanes bomb ISIS targets in Iraq for the first time
“I saw no point in cooperating with a country whose hands are dirty and intentions murky,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in quotes carried on state news agency IRNA. He accused Washington of “lying” by saying it had excluded Iran from its coalition, saying it was Iran that had refused to participate.
ALSO READ: Iraq wins pledge of military support against Islamic State militants
World powers meeting in Paris on Monday gave public backing to military action to fight ISIS fighters in Iraq. France sent jets on a reconnaissance mission to Iraq, a step towards becoming the first ally to join the US-led air campaign there.
But Iran, principal ally of ISIS’s main foes in both Iraq and Syria, was not invited to the Paris meeting. The countries that did attend — while supporting action in Iraq — made no mention at all of Syria. Washington has been trying to build a coalition to fight Islamic State since last week when President Barack Obama pledged to destroy the militant group on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border.
That means plunging into two civil wars in which nearly every country in the Middle East already has a stake. And it also puts Washington on the same side as Tehran, its bitter enemy since the Islamic revolution of 1979. In a rare direct intervention into diplomacy, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Washington had reached out through the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, requesting a meeting to discuss cooperation against Islamic State. Khamenei said some Iranian officials had welcomed the contacts, but he had personally vetoed them.
US Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington was “not cooperating with Iran”, but declined to be drawn on whether it had reached out through its embassy for talks. “I am not going to get into a back and forth,” he said. ISIS fighters set off alarms across the Middle East since June when they swept across northern Iraq, seizing cities, slaughtering prisoners, proclaiming a caliphate to rule over all Muslims and ordering non-Sunnis to convert or die.
French officials said they had hoped to invite Iran but Arab countries had blocked the move. “We wanted a consensus among countries over Iran’s attendance, but in the end it was more important to have certain Arab states than Iran,” a French diplomat said.
Calling the decision regrettable, Iraq’s Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said Baghdad had wanted Iran to attend. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said French aircraft would begin the reconnaissance flights over Iraq. “The throat-slitters of Daesh – that’s what I’m calling them – tell the continued…

Dalal Street gears up for new share sales worth Rs 2 lakh crore

(Sceptics are not sure whether…)
MUMBAI: The primary market is likely to witness a deluge of fresh paper worth over Rs 2 lakh crore within the next year as the government looks to trim stakes in its companies and private firms aim to raise fresh capital.
But, sceptics are not sure whether the market would be able to absorb the extent of share sales amid a slowdown in foreign institutional inflows , though bankers remain confident of their success.
Of the stake sales planned over the next 12 months, the government would be the largest contributor. About Rs 45,000 crore worth of shares could be sold by the government to meet its disinvestment target. This is in addition to its probable share sales in Balco and Hindustan Zinc worth Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore from SUUTI stake sales.
Banks — public and private — may raise about Rs 40,000 crore, while various companies plan to raise almost Rs 50,000 crore from institutional investors. In private, bankers accept that the extent of fund-raising is a steep task but they expect it to scrape through once pension funds enter the picture.
"This is not a worrisome figure as FIIs and private equity players are continuously pumping in funds into Indian equities. Domestic mutual funds have already turned net buyers whereas insurance companies are likely to turn positive," said S Subramanian, MD, investment banking, at Axis Capital. "Moreover, pension funds will enter the equity market once government gives the final go ahead".
Some market participants were worried with the quantum of the supply of shares in the wake of the recent drop in foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows. There is a concern that the tighter monetary policy in the US may slow FII flows into the country.
During the calendar year 2013, FIIs invested Rs 1.13 lakh crore while domestic institutions sold stocks worth Rs 74,000 crore. The net investment from both the institutions was about Rs 39,000 crore.
So far in 2014, FIIs have invested Rs 86,000 crore, while DIIs sold shares worth Rs 34,000 crore with a net investment of about Rs 51,500 crore. Brokers said FII inflows have slowed down because of rich valuations but once the economy and corporate earnings recover, more foreigners would be keen on investing in fresh papers.
"Even during the difficult time, India has received about $10-15 billion investment from FIIs. However, with improving economic conditions, Indian market should get about $25 billion inflow — $15 billion in primary and $10 billion in the secondary market," said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
The government has already announced its plan to sell 10 per cent stake in Coal India, 5per cent in ONGC and 11.36 per cent stake in NHPC to raise about Rs 45,000 crore in the next few months. The other offer from the government will come in the form of residuary stake sales in Hindustan Zinc and Balco, worth an estimated Rs 20,000 crore.
The government is also planning to raise about Rs 10,000 crore by selling a part of SUUTI's holding in ITC and L&T. SUUTI owns around 11.3 per cent stake in ITC, which is worth over Rs 31,500 crore, while its 8.2 per cent in Larsen & Toubro is valued at over Rs 12,100 crore.
"There is strong investor interest in Indian equities and with limited opportunities to buy quantities in the secondary market, investors would look for fresh offerings to increase their exposure," said Ravi Sardana, EVP—Investment Banking, ICICI Securities.
Indian corporates, which have raised about Rs 26,000 crore so far this year by a way of institutional placement, plan to raise about Rs 50,000 in coming months going by corporate announcements and board meeting resolutions.
"We expect more QIPs to follow in the rest of the year as there is a strong demand of equity capital by India Inc." said Nilesh Shah, CEO & managing director, Axis Capital. "The primary market in the mean time has seen strong revival as seen in response to recent IPOs."

MUMBAI: Shares of newly listed Snowman Logistics were locked at 5 per cent upper circuit for second straight session.
There is increased demand for the stock after Reliance Mutual Fund and ace investor Radhakishen Damani bought shares in bulk deals from the open market.
Snowman Logistics is one of the leading players in the control temperature segment of the logistics industry. Its main growth drivers are confectionary, food (mainly seafood), poultry and other meat items, high value vegetables and some industrial products like pharmaceuticals.
The company enjoys a blended margin at around 25 per cent, wherein the warehousing generates almost 40 per cent of the margin and the balance comes from the distribution .
"In our business, the more you scale it up, the more the margins are going to increase, because we have a fixed cost in terms of infrastructure, which will not going to change for us. So, the margins will definitely improve as capacity utilisation goes up. So I think our margins will increase as well as the utilization," said Ravi Kannan , CEO & Director, Snowman Logistics.
The stock had a stellar debut as it listed at 68 per cent premium to issue price of Rs 47.
At 10:05 a.m.; Snowman Logistics was at day's high at Rs 86.75, up 5 per cent, on the BSE. There were over 13.92 lakh pending buy orders and no sellers.

Hong Kong, Sept 16:  
Hong Kong was shuttered today as a powerful typhoon swept past the city, bringing strong winds and rain that caused flight disruptions and forced the closure of the stock market and container ports.
Typhoon Kalmaegi, packing gusts of 125 kilometres (77 miles) per hour, was centred 400 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong as it barrelled towards the northern tip of China’s Hainan island.
“Although the tropical cyclone is moving away from Hong Kong, gales are expected to persist for some time,” the Hong Kong Observatory said on its website.
The Observatory hoisted the number-eight tropical cyclone warning yesterday evening and said it would remain in place until late morning today, triggering the closure of schools and businesses in the city.
At Hong Kong’s airport, over 500 flights were delayed while nearly 40 were cancelled, a government statement said.
It said that there were 44 reports of fallen trees and that some parts of the city were flooded, but there were no reports of landslides.
HK exchange cancels morning session
The Hong Kong stock exchange cancelled its morning trading session and said it would remain closed for the day if the number-eight warning — the third in a five—tier warning system — was still in force by noon.
Typhoon Kalmaegi swept out of the Philippines yesterday after causing chest-deep floods in some rural areas but leaving the storm—prone country largely unscathed.
Six people were killed after a passenger ferry sank in the central Philippines on Saturday amid rough weather as the storm approached, the navy said.
Hong Kong was buffeted by two typhoons last year.
In August 2013 helicopter teams saved all 21 crew from a cargo ship that sank as Severe Typhoon Utor passed within 240 kilometres of the city, generating waves of up to 15 metres (50 feet).
And in September Typhoon Usagi — the year’s most powerful storm — caused transport chaos in the city before crashing ashore in southern China.

Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures lost 0.1 per cent, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 per cent.

Gone are the days when you needed a broadband connection only at home to connect your PC. With every gadget becoming smart, you now need a portable WiFi device in your pocket all the time.
A couple of years ago, using a WiFi hotspot option on your phone, if you had data activated, was a great idea. However, that is not a reliable alternative these days as the phone's battery doesn't last long enough.
Telecom operators have realised the changing customer needs and have come up with better products.
Airtel 3G WiFi
Rs 2,499
Airtel has launched a 3G WiFi dongle that allows users to download data on multiple devices at a high speed of up to 21 Mbps on its 3G network. The device is similar to Tata Photon Max WiFi. It needs to be plugged in either to a laptop or an adapter that converts it into a WiFi router. Up to five devices can be connected to the 3G network using this dongle, including laptops, tablets, mobiles and any other device.
MTS MBlaze Ultra WiFi
Rs 1,499
This dongle works on the EV-Do network, which claims to have a better network reach. It delivers a speed of up to 9.8 Mbps and can be used to connect up to six devices. It has a dual LED indicator for WiFi network. It works with a laptop USB, car chargers and travel chargers. Although it is priced at Rs 2,650, the dongle is available at a huge discount on the MTS website.
Tata Photon Max WiFi
Launched last year, the Tata Photon Max WiFi was among the first few USB dongles that could be converted into a WiFi router to connect up to five devices. The dongle promises a speed of up to 6.2 Mbps. The only downside in unlimited plans is that the speed slows to 153.8 Kbps after you consume the high-speed monthly data under the plan.
Idea Smart WiFi
Rs 2,499
The Idea Smart WiFi is a few hundred rupees expensive than some other similar devices but claims to offer a downlink speed of 21.6 Mbps and can be used to connect up to 10 devices. It requires external power to work - be it a laptop or a power adapter. Interestingly, this device can be controlled using a mobile app as well.
TRAVEL ROUTERS
If you already use a data card, you don't have to dump it and invest in a new one. Instead, you can get yourself a router that converts the dongle into a WiFi router that can be used on a limited number of devices. You can configure the device yourself by following the steps mentioned in the user manual.
MTS MBlaze Power WiFi
Rs 4,000
This is a 3-in-1 device that works as a memory card reader, a charging device and a WiFi router. It can be used to connect up to six devices on the WiFi network, and packs in a 5,200 mAh battery that can provide power to other gadgets too.

Why e-commerce is taking India by a storm 
an additional $2 billio
E-commerce has, without any iota of doubt, been the flavour of this year. From Flipkart’s ability to raise USD 1 billion, Amazon's commitment to invest USD 2 billion in its India business and companies choosing to sign exclusive tie-ups with such portals (as seen with Xiaomi’s Mi3 phones), business models are undergoing metamorphosis to boost sales.
Take  Arvind Limited for example. The company that has been in textile manufacturing for over eight decades has launched its e-commerce platform-Creyate- with an initial investment of around Rs 20 crore.
Why the need to foray into digital space, one may wonder. Simple answer: The industry can give a turnover of over USD 20 billion in 4-5 years.
“E-commerce is an incredible force. China, whose economy is similar to ours, has reached the size of USD 200 billion in a very short period of time. The industry can expand through this route and grow to USD 20 billion soon,” says Kulin Lalbhai, executive director, Arvind Limited.
Ashvin Vellody of KPMG couldn’t agree more. From a study conducted by the advisory firm, Vellody states the digital space is seeing rapid growth and it has seen a 34 percent year-on-year ( YoY) from 2009 to 2012.  And despite this impressive run rate, he believes the e-commerce industry has a lot more potential to grow.
So are the brick and mortar shops passé?
Not necessarily, believes Raghav Moolchandani of Archies. “On the contrary, e-commerce will complement businesses. It will boost ground sales as it will help in reaching to more number of people,” he says.
In what could validate this belief, Raghav is putting his money where his mouth is. The company just recently revamped its e-commerce platform – archiesonline.com- in order to make it more user-friendly and to attract more customers.
Apart from its own website, Archies has tied up with portals like Flipkart, Snapdeal, E-india and Groupon India.
This, Vellody says is just a good example of piggybacking as it overcomes the challenges of scale, of the task of reaching customers in time.
“This is common with emerging brands that tie up with established e-commerce portals as the latter have figured the best way to provide service delivery and get to the targeted customers in a more easier fashion,” he adds.
But e-commerce shouldn’t be seen just as channel for existing brands, highlights Lalbhai. He believes it is a unique business opportunity when one can bring new products to customers.
“We will ourselves be bringing new brands to the online space,” he adds.
But where's the moolah?
Flipkart, started in 2007 is yet to garner profits. The founders- Mukesh and Sachin Bansal have only been raising money through private equity.
But the lack of a clear cut profit in P&L accounts isn’t bothering the newest entrant in the e-commerce space. Radha Madhav Corporation announced its foray into the digital space on September 8.
Mitesh Agarwal, managing director and chief executive officer says the company has spent the last 4.5 years working on its products – 1100 in all.
“We have spent a majority of the last 4.5 years working upon establishing logistics for the portal. Our paying days are over now and whatever seem to be the losses, were costs incurred on learning and establishing a good logistic structure. Now is the time for capitalizing,” he adds optimistically.

Indian Economy Poised to Grow 5.7% in 2014: OECDLondon: Sharply revising upwards its forecast, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has projected 5.7 per cent growth for the Indian economy this year even as global recovery continues at a moderate pace.
Its latest estimate is way higher than the 4.9 per cent growth projection in May this year.
"Growth in India is projected to pick up and Brazil will experience a modest rebound from recession... India will grow by 5.7 per cent in 2014 and 5.9 per cent in 2015," the Paris-based think tank said.
In its latest interim Economic Assessment report released on Monday, OECD said a moderate expansion is underway in most major advanced and emerging economies.
However, growth remains weak in the euro area, which runs the risk of prolonged stagnation if further steps are not taken to boost demand, it added.
OECD is a grouping of 34 countries.
India's economic growth accelerated to 5.7 per cent in April-June quarter, better than 4.7 per cent in the corresponding quarter last fiscal year.
Government expects growth in the current fiscal year to be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent. The economy grew by sub-5 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
About India, OECD said the country "has the opportunity to achieve faster and more inclusive growth".
India needs to improve fiscal consolidation by shifting from subsidies to investment in social and physical infrastructure, control inflation and improve financial stability, it added.
Further, the grouping said the country should improve "infrastructure, simplify labour laws and pursue tax reforms".
According to OECD, even though emerging economies as a group would continue to grow much faster than the advanced economies, the forecast are uneven across countries.
While China is projected to see GDP growth of 7.4 per cent this year, Brazil is anticipated to see an expansion of 0.3 per cent.
"While the global recovery continues at a moderate rate, the outlook is uneven across regions. Growth will be strong enough to push unemployment down further in US, UK and Canada," it said.
"In Japan, where unemployment has already declined to low levels, the economy will grow broadly in line with its potential. China is expected to continue an orderly adjustment to still high but more sustainable growth rates."
The US is expected to see growth of 2.1 per cent this year while the UK is projected to grow 3.1 per cent in 2014.
"The euro area is projected to grow at a 0.8 per cent rate in 2014... Growth prospects differ widely among the major euro area economies," the grouping said.
OECD Deputy Secretary General and Acting Chief Economist Rintaro Tamaki said the global economy is expanding unevenly, and at only a moderate rate.

Iraq wins pledge of military support against Islamic State militantsFrench President Francois Hollande, left, leaves with Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, after a family photo at the International conference intended to come up with an international strategy against Islamic State extremists, in Paris. Source: AP photo
Agence-France Presse | Paris | Posted: September 15, 2014 7:12 pm
The world’s top diplomats pledged today to support Iraq in its fight against Islamic State militants by “any means necessary”, including “appropriate military assistance”, as leaders stressed the urgency of the crisis.
Representatives from around 30 countries and international organisations, including the US, Russia and China, gathered in Paris as the brutal beheading over the weekend of a third Western hostage focussed participants’ minds.
The pledge came as US Secretary of State John Kerry stepped up efforts to forge a broad anti-jihadist coalition.
In a joint statement issued after the talks, diplomats vowed to support Baghdad “by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance, in line with the needs expressed by the Iraqi authorities, in accordance with international law and without jeopardising civilian security.”
They stressed IS extremists were “a threat not only to Iraq but also to the entire international community” and underscored the “urgent need” to remove them from Iraq, where they control some 40 percent of its territory.
However, the final statement made no mention of Syria, where the extremists hold a quarter of the country and where the regime of Bashar al-Assad still had friends around the Paris conference table, including Russia.
Opening the conference, French President Francois Hollande emphasised there was “no time to lose” in the fight against the jihadists.
“The fight of the Iraqis against terrorism is our fight as well,” Hollande stressed, urging “clear, loyal and strong” global support for Baghdad.
Iraqi President Fuad Masum also stressed the urgency of the crisis, saying there was a risk the militants could overrun more countries in the region.
“We are still asking for regular aerial operations against terrorist sites. We have to pursue them wherever they are. We need to dry up their sources of finance,” added the Iraqi leader.
The international community is scrambling to contain the IS jihadists — who have rampaged across Iraq and Syria and could number as many as 31,500 fighters, according to the CIA.
As if to underscore the urgency of the campaign, France’s defence minister announced just hours ahead of the conference it was joining Britain in carrying out reconnaissance flights in support of the US air campaign against the jihadists.
Shortly afterwards, two French Rafale fighter jets took off from the Al-Dhafra base in the United Arab Emirates, an AFP correspondent reported.
The Paris conference was one of a series of diplomatic gatherings in the run-up to a United Nations General Assembly later this week.

Easy admission IITs may tweak top-20 percen...hrd minister
(The percentile criterion…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have proposed a change in admission criteria barely two years after the premier engineering schools adopted a new format at the behest of Kapil Sibal , then human resource development minister under the previous UPA government .
The IITs are in favour of tweaking the requirement that candidates have to be in the top 20 percentile in their Class XII exams in order to be eligible for admission, amid criticism that the condition is shutting many deserving candidates out. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) of the IITs — comprising heads of the institutions — met last week in Mumbai and proposed to accommodate such candidates who have been rejected despite cracking the entrance test. The proposal suggests according some weightage to a candidate's aggregate marks in board exams. ET spoke to two IIT directors who confirmed this on condition of anonymity.
The JAB proposal will be discussed at the meeting of the IIT Council — the highest decision-making body of the 16 engineering schools — on September 22, which will also be attended by Smriti Irani, Sibal's successor as HRD minister . If approved, though, the change won't be applied retrospectively. Currently, candidates are admitted to the 16 IITs based on their performance in the Joint Entrance Exam or JEE (Advanced) besides which they have to be in the top 20 percentile in Class XII.
The second condition has often been criticised for leading to a peculiar predicament that students of school boards that are more generous with marks find themselves facing. Students from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are usually regarded as the worst hit as the top 20 percentile cut-off for their state boards usually hovers around, or is above, 90 per cent. In 2013, which was the first year of the new eligibility criteria, an Andhra Pradesh student with 91.1 per cent could not get admission to the civil engineering course at IIT Bombay because the top 20 percentile cut-off mark for the state board exam was 91.8 per cent. According to an IIT director, about 240 aspirants could not gain entry into IIT this year despite securing an impressive all-India rank in JEE (Advanced) as they fell short of the percentile condition.
"Such candidates are small in number. They usually make up just 2.5 per cent of those who have cracked the entrance test. It's unfortunate that some cannot get in even though they have scored above 80 per cent in their board examination," an IIT director told ET on condition of anonymity. "We feel that there should be an additional criterion for such candidates. It could be a formula which gives weightage to both aggregate board marks and the top 20 percentile cut-off. We will only finalise it once the IIT Council takes a view on this proposal."
The percentile criterion was introduced in 2013 at the behest of Sibal so that students would pay greater attention to their performance in school, thus gaining an allround education rather than merely focusing on entrance exams. It was also targeted at the cram schools that thrive thanks to the relentless striving for acceptance at India's top institutes. There could be some opposition to the attempt to undo the earlier change.
"We understand that there could be some resistance to this move, if approved by the (IIT) Council," said another IIT director. "But we have discussed the issue threadbare, which is why we have proposed to introduce an additional or a sub-criterion which could be a combination of top 20 percentile condition and absolute marks scored in the board exams."

India tightens Vietnam defence, oil ties ahead of Xi's tour

India tightens Vietnam defence, oil ties ahead of Xi's tour
India's new accords with one of China's rivals for influence in the South China Sea came as Xi visited the nearby islands of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, a reminder of the geostrategic jostling that is becoming an increasing feature in Asia.

India extended a USD 100 million export credit to Vietnam for defence deals and tightened energy ties on Monday, signaling a more confident foreign policy ahead of a visit this week by China's President Xi Jinping.
India's new accords with one of China's rivals for influence in the South China Sea came as Xi visited the nearby islands of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, a reminder of the geostrategic jostling that is becoming an increasing feature in Asia.
During a visit to Vietnam by President Pranab Mukherjee, the two countries said in a joint statement that the credit line would open new opportunities for defence cooperation and that details of what Vietnam would buy were being finalised.
"The leaders agreed that defence and security cooperation was an important pillar of the strategic partnership between the two countries," the statement said.
They also agreed to "consolidate" energy cooperation following a 2013 agreement under which PetroVietnam offered India's  ONGC oil and gas blocks for exploration and production.
India and Vietnam have deepened military cooperation over the past decade and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is pushing ahead with a new strategy to establish itself as an arms exporter using export credits to leverage foreign sales.
The money may help slow-moving talks to sell Brahmos cruise missiles to Hanoi.
Vietnam is building a naval deterrent to China with Kilo class submarines from Russia and it would like to add India's missile technology to its defences.
India and Vietnam have both traditionally depended heavily on their mutual Cold War partner Russia for military knowhow. The Brahmos itself was developed with Russian help.
REGIONAL COMPETITION
Carl Thayer, an expert on Vietnam’s military at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra, said he believed Vietnam was seeking India’s ship attack variants of the missile.  
Indian tests showed the supersonic cruise missile could be successfully fired from ships, which matched Hanoi's goal of creating a meaningful deterrent against China.
"This is leading-edge technology that would further complicate the ability of the Chinese navy to operate off the Vietnamese coast with impunity, particularly in the south of the South China Sea," Thayer said.
"The Vietnamese do not want to be in a situation where they wake up one morning and discover the Chinese navy has surrounded one of its bases in the Spratlys," he said, referring to a disputed island chain.
Business is growing fast between India and China, but the rising powers' ties are also defined by competition for energy and regional clout, as well as a border dispute that led to war 50 years ago.
Long insecure about China's strength, India elected Modi in May partly because of his promises to build an economically strong nation that could hold its own on the world stage.
The timing of Mukherjee's visit to Vietnam may not have been planned to coincide with Xi's South Asia tour, but it underlined India's new twin track diplomacy, foreign policy analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper on Monday.
"Much like China, which does not limit its strategic relationship with Pakistan because of Indian concerns, the Modi government apparently believes it can build a partnership with Vietnam on its own merits without worrying too much about what Beijing might think," Mohan said in his column.
Also on Mukherjee's trip, India's Jet Airways and Vietnam Airlines agreed to start flying between Delhi and Ho Chi Minh City from November 5, via Bangkok.
Xi will be in India from Sept. 17-19.

Asian Shares on Edge as Investors Brace for Fed
Reuters | Updated On: September 16, 2014 09:54 (IST)
Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
Tokyo:
Asian shares held near one-month lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the US Federal Reserve's policy stance as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting later in the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed near one-month low hit on Monday after seven consecutive days of falls. Japan's Nikkei stock average shed 0.3 per cent, catching up after Tokyo markets were closed for a local holiday on Monday.
Speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected have rattled many share markets around the global and supported the US dollar.
"As global bond markets show early signs of adjustment to an emerging higher interest rate environment, yield plays like the major banks, (phone company) Telstra and property trusts are losing favour," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said in a note to clients.
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years.
US central bank policymakers will also release fresh economic and interest-rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.
They have said they do not expect to raise rates until 2015, but recently strong US economic data has led Fed officials to acknowledge they may need to act sooner than they thought just a few months ago.
"At Wednesday's FOMC meeting, changes to Fed forecasts and wording that reflects expectations that rates could go higher sooner than expected should provide support" to the US dollar, strategists at Barclays said. "We also look for a modest steepening in the median policy path and more clarity on exit principles."
Wall Street had a mixed session on Monday also after weekend data showed China's factory output in August grew at its slowest pace in nearly six years, raising fears the world's second-largest economy was losing momentum.
"The fall in the real estate sector activity is affecting output. Everyone knows August is pretty weak, so if things improve in September, that would reassure investors," said Hirokazu Yuihama, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady on the day at 84.166, not far from its 14-month peak of 84.519 scaled a week ago.
Keeping pressure on the euro, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development projected lower growth for major economies on Monday and urged much more aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank to ward off the risk of deflation.
The euro was treading water at $1.2939, while the dollar edged down slightly against its Japanese rival to 107.15 yen but was still close to a six-year high of 107.39 yen touched on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note stood at 2.574 per cent in Asia, not far from Monday's US close of 2.591 per cent. It hit a two-month high of 2.651 per cent on Monday, before paring its rise on news of a drop in last month's US manufacturing output.
US crude edged down about 0.1 per cent to $92.79 a barrel, pressured by the weekend data from China that cast doubt on the strength of global demand. On Monday, the expiring Brent contract for October dropped to its price since July 2012, while the new front-month contract added 0.2 per cent in Asian trade to $98.07.
Spot gold was steady on the day at $1,232.36 an ounce, supported by the Chinese data but undermined by expectations that the Fed will start hinting at interest rate hikes. On Monday, it fell to its lowest level since January.

The US dollar holds steady with investors reluctant to do much as they wait for fresh guidance on interest rates from the Fed, while the Australian dollar rebounded from a six-month trough. The dollar index is little changed at 84 mark.
Global cues, meanwhile, are mixed with the US markets closing mixed with Nasdaq slipping to a one-month low, as investors booked profits ahead of the crucial two-day FOMC meeting that begins today.
Asian markets too are trading in the red as all eyes stay glued on the start of the Federal Reserve's meeting. Europe closed lower over concerns on the Fed meet and the Scottish independence vote.
In other asset classes, brent crude is trading well below USD 97 per barrel, its lowest since July 2, 2012 as investors are concerned of a possible weakening oil demand.

Why Dynamatic is Infosys of aerospace manufacturing | CUMI: A mini GE in makingAirbus
(European aircraft maker…)
Bangalore-based Dynamatic Technologies is increasingly becoming the preferred supplier of aerospace parts and assemblies to global aviation industry including giants such as Airbus, Boeing and Bell Helicopter. The company that many experts call the "Infosys of aerospace manufacturing" was recently promoted as a tier-1 global vendor for these companies and orders have been pouring in. Its order book for aerospace products has tripled to about Rs 6,000 crore since the beginning of 2014. These orders have to be executed over the next decade.
European aircraft maker Airbus, which has placed orders worth Rs 1,800 crore with Dynamatic, has worked closely with the company for the past eight years. "We are expanding our Airbus 320 and Airbus 350 production. With increasing maturity of Dynamatic, we include it among the popular candidates. They have been manufacturing one of the most complicated parts for us and have delivered all our orders on time," said Airbus India CEO Srinivas Dwarkanath.
The global aviation companies decided to outsource manufacturing in 2006 and identified India as a potential destination. Dynamatic's CEO and managing director Udayant Malhoutra, who was working closely with HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics) then, was quick to see the opportunity and got in touch with these firms.
"Dynamatic was quite smart about it," said Pratyush Kumar, India head of American firm Boeing. "They have been innovative and quick to get into the game, and have been successful. They recognise manual assembly and are very savvy and well-informed about how global aviation industry functions." He added, "With high cost, quality and delivery efficiencies we are keenly looking at Indian suppliers. Their success is our success."
Dynamatic is the only tier-1 supplier from India, which is being seen as an outsourcing destination by global majors.
It manufactures primarily flap track beams, a flight critical component instrumental in controlling the speed, direction and balance of the aircraft, for Airbus and helicopter parts for Boeing and Bell.
"Developing plane parts is an art, like manufacturing a Swiss watch," said Malhoutra, "It's all handmade. It's not a business where you set up capacities and start manufacturing. We have invested several years and a lot of money in developing these skills and are now past the learning curve."
Tata and Mahindra Aerospace are among the other domestic private sector companies in this sector, but they are much smaller than Dynamatic, which also makes airframe structures for Indian Air Force aircraft such as the Sukhoi 30MKI. It is a strong contender for the offset orders that can come up in aerospace as part of defence orders. The defence ministry has already placed orders worth about $4.3 billion or Rs 26,000 crore. It is expected that orders worth $24 billion will flow from the aerospace and defence segments.
The aerospace business contributed just 15% to the company's total revenues in 2013-14, but its share in operating profit was as much as 60%. The revenues from the aerospace segment are likely to grow, too, promising a jump in the company's profits.
  Just as its aerospace business, the company's auto parts manufacturing German subsidiary is a tier 1 vendor for automakers such as BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and Audi. The segment is critical for the company as it generates two-thirds of its revenues. In addition to Germany, it has manufacturing facilities in Chennai, with the German accounting for 83% of its revenues while the rest comes from Indian operations.
The company will gradually transfer iron-casting business to cost-effective India, Malhoutra said, adding that its Chennai plant had already started exporting castings to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz. "Recently our German Engineers have developed complex stainless steel turbine housings with only a few companies manufacturing this globally, we are already seeing a huge demand for this product. As we continue to build steel casting capabilities in Germany, we will gradually transfer the iron casting business into India, which will give us cost advantages and higher profitability. Chennai plant is already started exporting castings to BMW Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz."
With less than half capacity utilisation at its Indian plants, the company is focusing on improvement on this count and hopes business will pick up with economic revival.
In addition to its aerospace and automotive businesses, Dynamatic is the leading hydraulic gear pump maker in the country, with 65% market share and clients such as Mahindra & Mahindra, John Deere and Cummins. This business is growing in double digits and is likely to continue at this pace for the new few years.
Dynamatic's market capitalisation has grown almost 50 times over the past decade and is expected to grow further at a fast pace in the next few years. "While we focus our emotive energies on building deep and lasting relationships with our customers, employees and stakeholders, our business decisions are based solely on logic. Over the past two years we have deleveraged our balance sheet by monetising non-core assets, creating the conditions necessary for rapid growth in the near future," said Malhoutra.
With its aerospace business having taken off, profitability expanding in the automotive business and steady growth in the gear pump business, Dynamatic is a company to watch out for.

Huge explosion kills at least one in Afghan capital  KabulPrint
Reuters | Posted: September 16, 2014 10:39 am
A huge explosion rattled windows in Afghanistan’s capital early on Tuesday, sending a plume of white smoke rising above eastern Kabul and killing at least one person, a witness said.
The blast tore through cars on the main airport road near the U.S. Embassy, leaving them tangled hunks of metal. A Reuters witness saw the dead body of at least one foreigner in a uniform lying at the scene.

Ambulances rushed to the scene within minutes of the explosion, which came just after 8 a.m.
Tensions have been building in Afghanistan in the wake of a disputed presidential election that has destabilised the country ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign troops by the end of the year.
Taliban insurgents have been exploiting the uncertainty, launching bombings and attacks on government officials across the country.

Relief for Robert Vadra, Delhi HC rejects plea seeking CBI probe into his land deals

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation probe in the land deals of Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra. The plea was dismissed on the grounds that it had been dismissed by the Supreme Court earlier and that it was based only on media reports.
A PIL was filed seeking probe into the sale of agriculture land to Vadra's companies.
The plea had also sought a probe into grant of licences to change the land use of agricultural plots purchased by Vadra's companies in Haryana.

The petitioner was seeking a probe by the CBI under charges of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and Prevention of Corruption Act. He claimed that this is a scam worth Rs 20,000 crore.
The PIL also cited media reports to claim that the current CAG, Shashi Kant Sharma, issued a letter to stop a CAG audit/enquiry into the Skylight Pvt Ltd within a fortnight of succeeding Vinod Rai as the chief auditor of the country. Skylight is a company based out of Sukhdev Vihar. It is allegedly owned by Robert Vadra and his mother Maureen Vadra.
The petitioner had also filled a PIL seeking the cancellation of Sharma's appointment as the CAG.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the approval for going ahead with the biggest tax reform initiative - the Goods and Services Tax. The government will now try to introduce the Constitutional Bill for GST in the Winter Session of Parliament.
The government has decided to make a few amendments. In the Constitution Bill, both the Centre and States would be allowed to levy GST on petroleum products. But practically, the states would continue to levy their excise rates, preventing a revenue loss for them.
The Centre is also trying to convince the Sates on allowing a GST compensation mechanism. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will be meeting state finance ministers next month. He met the Prime Minister over the issue on Tuesday.
The government will now try to introduce the Constitutional Bill for GST in the Winter Session of Parliament.
Several states have expressed concerns over losing autonomy and facing revenue losses if GST comes into play.

SideSwipe lets you control your smartphone with in-air hand gestures9

New York: How does it feel when your smartphone begins to ring all of a sudden during a key client presentation? Embarrassed? Help is here.
Researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle have developed a way to control your smartphone with in-air hand gestures.
The system called SideSwipe lets you interact with the phone without using touchscreens or physical buttons.
When a user waves his hand over the phone, the movement of the hand disturbs the signal between the phone's receiver and antenna.
#sideswipe #gesture controls #smartphones #universoty of washington
This is how it works.
When a user waves his hand over the phone, the movement of the hand disturbs the signal between the phone's receiver and antenna.
This vibration is captured by SideSwipe and used for recognising gestures.
"We developed an algorithm to convert the GSM pulses to a continuous signal that can be used for gesture recognition," the team behind SideSwipe posted on its website.
SideSwipe will have three gesture control modes.
The first gesture directed down towards the phone to put it to silent; the swipe right gesture to send a text (pre-defined), and finally the tap gesture to decline an incoming call, reports added.

KKR to lend $175 million to GMR InfrastructureGMR Infra to raise Rs 1,500 cr through rights issue
Raghuvir Badrinath | Bangalore Sep 17, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Bangalore-based publicly-held infrastructure developer GMR Infrastructure plans to raise Rs 1,500 crore in equity through a rights issue, which, along with the recently-concluded qualified institutional placement issue of Rs 1,500 crore, is expected to ease leverage.
For the past two years, GMR Infrastructure has been grappling with debt of Rs 40,000 crore with a gearing of four times. After the rights issue, which is expected by November, GMR’s net worth will go up to Rs 14,000 crore as a result of which the leverage will be down to 2.85 times.
The move to raise equity of Rs 3,000 crore in quick succession comes after a year during which GMR went about aggressively to trim its assets across airports, power projects and highways, which enabled it to infuse liquidity into its system to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore.

Rs 3,000 crore:
The move to raise equity in quick succession comes after a year during which GMR trimmed its assets across airports, power projects and highways
GMR Infrastructure’s promoters through their main holding company GMR Holdings have parallely raised a debt of Rs 1,000 crore from global private equity major KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) to fund their share of the rights issue.
The global investment firm said it has signed a term sheet to provide Rs 1,000 crore of structured long-term financing, with co-investors to GMR Holdings, which holds 64 per cent in GMR Infrastructure.
Grandhi Kiran Kumar, group director of GMR Holdings and managing director of GMR Infrastructure, said: “The infusion of additional equity from the promoters of GMR Infrastructure is a testimony to the promoters’ confidence in the long-term value of the group’s business. The rights issue, after successful conclusion, will improve the net worth of GMR Infrastructure and bring down the net debt-to-equity ratio to 2.85 against 3.5 prevailing as of March 2014. In addition, it will reduce the corporate debt of GMR Infrastructure. The partnership with KKR helps GMR strengthen its foundation for the next phase of growth.”
In addition to strengthening the balance sheet of GMR Infrastructure, the proceeds from the rights issue will also be used to support the funding requirement for projects and meet its financing obligations. Neither KKR nor GMR Holdings specify the terms of the contract. GMR Holdings is already under a debt of Rs 1,000 crore with as much as 73 per cent of that in short-term borrowings.
B V Krishnan, managing director, KKR Capital Markets, said: “We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with GMR, which represents a significant opportunity for KKR to partner with committed infrastructure groups.”
In India, KKR provides structured financing solutions through multiple capital pools, including a non-banking finance company, alternative investment funds and special situations capital pools. The firm looks to provide flexible, long-term capital, which can help companies achieve their objectives of balance sheet consolidation, de-leveraging and long-term growth.
KKR has executed more than $2 billion of structured financing to 21 business groups in India through its credit and capital markets business over the past five years.

Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
BSE Sensex and Nifty struggled today amid weak Asian markets as global investors awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the US will raise interest rates.
With Federal Reserve poised to indicate monetary stance in next few days, emerging market currencies are seeing stress, said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
The rupee yesterday fell to one-month low against the dollar and today was trading marginally higher at 61.07/dollar vs its yesterday's close of 61.13.
Market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin said Nifty may test 8,000 on the downside and find support around 7950. Nifty faces resistance at around 8,070, he added.
The Sensex was down 8 points at 26,808 while Nifty fell 6 points to 8,035. The broader markets outperformed with BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.60 per cent and 0.80 per cent.
Among Nifty stocks, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Sesa Sterlite, and Tech Mahindra were down between 0.80 per cent to 1.2 per cent.
Some buying was seen in pharma stocks with Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy's up over 1 per cent.

Interest rates to soften by year end: BoB

Post your opinion here
Street Signs
Public sector lender  Bank of Baroda is not looking to cut deposit rates anytime soon. After India’s largest public sector lender  State Bank of India cut deposit rates on Tuesday, there are expectations that others may follow suit.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Ranjan Dhawan, ED, Bank of Baroda (BoB) said that there is no knee-jerk reaction to SBI's rate cut because the bank had already cut its bulk deposit rates substantially in the last one year. But clearly rates are headed down in the system and one can expect softening of interest rates by the end of the year, he added.
Further, Dhawan said credit growth for the banking industry is likely to be at 11-11.5 percent and for BoB hopes to clocks nearly one percent more.
Below is the transcript of Ranjan Dhawan's interview with CNBC-TV18’s Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra
Ekta: First your preliminary reaction to State Bank of India (SBI) cutting rates on deposits for the tenure of one-three years by 25 bps and will Bank of Baroda (BoB) follow suit?
A: The main reason why it appears to be that SBI has cut deposit rates is that credit offtake for the last several months has been very weak and on the back of this, we don’t require that volume of deposits. Therefore, probably this is the reason that SBI has cut deposit rates. As far as BoB is concerned, our bulk deposit rates for deposits above Rs 1 crore were already at 8.75. That is number one.
Secondly, we have stopped taking bulk deposits a long time back. We were not offering any substantial increases in deposit rates for bulk deposits. We had substantially cut down our bulk deposits over the last one year. Therefore, at the moment, we are quite comfortable with our deposit rates. We are not having any knee-jerk reaction to SBI’s action. We will wait and watch for a few more days and see what is the market reaction to it and the asset-liability committee (ALCO) will decide accordingly perhaps in 10-15 days time.
Anuj: Do you get a sense that rates are headed further down in the system from this point on?
A: I would expect so and the reason I would expect so is that with the revival of a monsoon, I think that inflation should gradually come under control towards the end of the year and a revival in the monsoon at a late period also indicates to me that perhaps the rabi crop should be better. If that is so, I do see at the end of the year, inflation coming down. If inflation comes down towards the end of the year, rates should also definitely comes down. But we would not like to have an immediate reaction to the SBI Act.
Also, we see that credit pick up will also take some time to come in. There is no doubt that there is momentum, there is movement in the market particularly we have information that foreign players are planning to put money into ventures into India. So we do feel that investment will pick up, it will not happen anytime very soon but in the long run it should pick up. Therefore, there is an expectation that interest rate should soften towards the end of the year.
Ekta: Can you give us some statistics in terms of credit offtake for BoB itself as well as what you are assuming for the industry?
A: The industry is pretty clear - 10.9 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has come out at the year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth is 10.9. I would assume that 11-12 percent is what the industry will grow come September 30. I imagine that BoB would be in that region also maybe a percentage of a point or two more but normally the guidance that we give the industry is that we are up 1-2 percent above the industry level but in general, we see that credit growth is quite muted.
Ekta: 13-14 percent would be credit growth that you would assume only till September or which would be the end of the quarter or would you assume that or extrapolated for FY15 as well?
A: No, I am not saying that we would be 13-14 percent. I said that we would be 1-2 percent perhaps a percentage point or two above the industry level. I assume that the industry level will be somewhere about 11-11.5 percent. So we would be a percentage point or two above that.
Going forward, I do feel that the government has cleared 170 stalled projects. I do expect if projects starts coming onstream, a lot of power is available from these new projects. So in the last quarter of the financial year, I do expect a pick up.
Bank of Baroda stock price
On November 21, 2014, Bank Of Baroda closed at Rs 1038.85, up Rs 13.30, or 1.30 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1067.50 and the 52-week low was Rs 509.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 108.46 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 9.58. The latest book value of the company is Rs 835.56 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 1.24.

Maharashtra Assembly elections: Seat sharing worries Congress-NCP and BJP-Shiv Sena ties43
0
Mumbai: The state assembly elections in Maharashtra, which is scheduled for October 15, will be very crucial for the ruling Congress-NCP alliance. The recent victory of the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, in which the combine swept 42 out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The recent parliamentary election result has come as a rude shock for the Congress and the NCP. The list of the Congress-NCP candidates will be finalised only after the return of Congress President Sonia Gandhi from abroad. It is expected that the list will be finalised within a couple of days. The NCP leader Sharad Pawar clarified that there was no dispute between the Congress-NCP combine.
In 2009 Assembly elections, the Congress and NCP won 82 seats and 62 seats respectively winning the state for the third time in a row. While the Congress fought in 174 seats, the NCP contested in 114 seats. In the recent parliamentary elections, the NCP won 4 seats and the Congress had to be contended with just 2 seats. On the basis of its performance in the parliamentary elections, the NCP is demanding 144 seats with its so called increased clout in the Zilla Parishad elections. Nevertheless, the Congress is adhering to its party's policy regarding the number of seats. However, both the alliance partners, who seems to be in a defensive mood have understood the grave situation and have agreed to arrive at a final solution in a day or two.
In the Congress camp, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan carries a favourable public image and has played a key role in taking some important decisions including the Maratha and Muslim reservations as part of the electioneering. However, the Congress is facing a major problem of anti-incumbency across the state. The resentment is mainly against the attitude of the NCP leaders. The NCP is facing several allegations related to irrigation scam, highway toll-tax issue and increasing load shedding of electricity in the rural areas. This adds to the worries of NCP President Sharad Pawar as many prominent leaders like Suryakantha Patil, former State Minister, Babanrao Pachpute, former president of state NCP Ajit Ghorpade, former state ministers have distanced themselves from the party. The alleged autocratic nature of Deputy Chief Minister Ajitdada Pawar, nephew of Pawar has also added to the woes of the NCP. It has led to more confrontations with its ally Congress.
The Assembly elections are crucial for Shiv Sena-BJP alliance as the combine has not been to win the state in last 15 years.
#maharashtra #bjp #shiv sena #congress
On the other hand, the BJP won 46 seats out of 114 it contested whereas; Shiv Sena won 44 seats out of 169 contested seats it contested in the 2009 state assembly elections. In the backdrop of this spectacular victory in the Parliament elections and with the backup of 'Modi-impact', the BJP aspires to take over the 'progressive' state of Maharashtra along with Mumbai-the financial capital of the country. However, the Shiv Sena is reluctant to offer more seats to the BJP. The BJP has decided to contest in at least 150 seats in the state. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance has now extended to four more regional parties like Swabhimani Sanghatana, Shivsangram, RPI (Athawale Group) & Rashtriya Samaj Paksha.
The late BJP leader Gopinath Munde had envisioned this alliance with a view to lure the OBC's and Dalits in an effort to counter the Maratha dominated party like the NCP. The BJP has its strong base in Vidarbha region, the home town of the BJP leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The Shiv Sena enjoys a big support in Kokan, Mumbai and Marathwada regions. Gradually, Sena has expanded its area of influence to the Congress strongholds Western Maharashtra as well as North Maharashtra. On the other hand, the BJP has a strong backing of the so-called Narendra Modi wave, but lacks the cadre support like Shiv Sena. In addition to this, the tragic and untimely death of Gopinath Munde has also weakened its organisation structure. The BJP leaders want to capture the power this time. They know that they cannot end their 25 years old relationship with the BJP.
The Shiv Sena has been severely criticised by the BJP for its poor performance in the last assembly elections as well as in the recent parliamentary elections. Based on its not so good performance in last two elections, Shiv Sena is can't demand more seats in the coming elections. However, it is blaming the Raj Thackeray led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) for the loss of 28 state Assembly seats by Shiv Sena in 2009. The breach of Shiv Sena's vote bank was felt in the regions of Mumbai, Pune, Thane and some other urban pockets.  The position of the MNS seems to be very weak in the current elections.

What China s  peaceful rise  means for India Part II: India and China in history12
0
History is central to all nationalist mythos. This is especially true for China, whose perceptions of its past substantially contribute to its conduct in the present and to its belief in the inevitability of its emergence as a super power. And in this context, Western scholars over the last 300 years have by design or otherwise done a lot to create the image of a Sino-centric world for much of human history. A typical example of this is Martin Jacques' 2009 book 'When China Rules the World', which starts with the argument of the Chinese centrality in history, and predicts the revival of that centrality in the near future.
Similarly, Henry Kissinger, the past master of realpolitik and diplomacy, also presents a rather sentimental view of the same narrative in his 2011 book 'On China', when he notes:
Other societies, the United States included, have claimed universal applicability for their values and institutions. Still, none equals China in persisting - and persuading its neighbours to acquiesce - in such an elevated conception of its world role for so long, and in the face of so many historical vicissitudes. From the emergence of China as a unified state in the third century BC until the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912, China stood at the center of an East Asian international system of remarkable durability.
India has also witnessed the rise and fall of many empires and dynasties in the long and eventful course of its history.
#india #china #india history #china history
The crucial mistake that Kissinger commits here is to imagine that East Asia, where China was indeed the central presence, as being at the heart of the world or of the 'international system'. One need not be surprised, however, if the architect of US-China alliance, which is a principal factor behind the current rise of China, errs on the side of the 'Middle Kingdom'.
Contrary to what Kissinger claims, it is the world of the Indian Ocean, with East Asia and West Asia-East Africa as its twin extremes, which was the heart of the world economy and of the international system for two millennia. And both India and China had a pre-eminent economic presence in this Indian Ocean world.
However, it was India which was geographically central to the Indian Ocean. This was clearly acknowledged in the ancient world as is reflected in the fact that more than 1200 years ago Arab traders and geographers used to call this ocean 'Bahr-e-Hind', which is from where the present term, the Indian Ocean, is derived.
The world was therefore never Sino-centric. Far from being the greatest power on earth which it is claimed to have been for 2,000 years, China was for most of its history a civilization that though large and advanced in comparison with most other parts of the world with the exception of India of course, was too isolated and self-centered to be able or willing to exert power over others. Indeed, power becomes power only in the process of engagement with others.
One of the most important reasons behind China's self-engrossment was that for most of its history it had to contend with Central Asian nomads, who kept invading China intermittently, and even ruled over it, as in the case of Yuan Empire of the Mongols built by the famed Kublai Khan. It is only by the 17th century that the central Asian threat to China was finally overcome.
The Chinese self-image of being the 'Middle Kingdom' was thus not an outcome of its non-existent world domination, but of being at the center of the East Asian world and being surrounded by a host of smaller countries that naturally accepted the hegemonic position of China. In fact, even within East Asia, Japan remained a largely independent civilization and power for most of its history.
The 'tribute system' primarily involved the many smaller countries of East Asia, for whom it was simply a practical means of doing trade and conducting other business with China. Great civilizations and empires of the ancient and medieval world were neither a part of this 'tribute system' nor did they acknowledge China as the 'Middle Kingdom'.
The political disunity in Indian history is often contrasted with supposed Chinese unity. Nothing could be more disingenuous than this. Like other great civilizations, China too has witnessed a good deal of disunity and fragmentation in its history. In the last 2,500 years, China has been united for no more than a total of 1100 years, and even during these periods, the Chinese State generally covered only the eastern and southern parts of what is the present-day People's Republic of China, which constitute the core area of the Chinese civilization. Interestingly enough, it is only the foreign-origin dynasties, the Yuan/Mongols (1279-1368) and the Manchu/Qing (1644-1912) which conquered and ruled over China as it is today.
India has also witnessed the rise and fall of many empires and dynasties in the long and eventful course of its history. In the last 2,500 years, it has had a united empire for at least 900 years cumulatively. Just like China, most of these empires covered only the core area of the Indian Sub-continent; it is only the British and Mauryan empires that easily covered more than four-fifths of the Sub-continent.
The State in Chinese history has admittedly been more centralized, bureaucratic, and powerful than in India. But this is hardly a strongpoint for China. Indian society has been far more organized and stable compared to the Chinese, precluding the need for such a State in India. What is important is that the State in India was derived from the needs of our society, and was able to perform its functions effectively most of the time.
The so called disunity of India in history is largely a product of the Eurocentric writing of history in the last 200 years. For the British, it was important to emphasise how their rule was a boon for Indians who, they claimed, had generally been disunited, lacked a tradition of statecraft, and rarely had a united State. The more strident among the British writers such as the Utilitarian led by James Mill went to the shameful extent of asserting that India had no history at all, and that it had never been an advanced civilization.
Though Indian history writing has come a long way, and Indian as well as foreign historians of the last hundred years have demolished most myths created by imperialist scholars, the myth of India's political disunity vis a vis other comparable countries remains an abiding one. This considerably distorts the way India sees itself and how it is seen by others, including China. The sooner this distortion is corrected, the better it is.
Just as in the case of India, China's historical narrative is very substantially a product of Western knowledge and imagination, though it has worked to the advantage of China. The Roman Empire and later day European countries rarely had any real knowledge of or contact with China for most of human history. The links they did have were of the most indirect and tenuous kind. In this bliss of ignorance about a distant and largely isolated civilization, fascination, romanticisation, and mythification of China was their frequent recourse. The account of the Italian merchant and traveler Marco Polo who supposedly visited the court of Kublai Khan in the late 13th century is a typical example of the old European images of China.
The 18th century can justifiably be called a formative period in world history, for it is during this period that the West came to gain ascendancy over large parts of Asia, consolidated its power in the North and South Americas, and was able to start the Industrial Revolution which over the first half of the 19th century helped establish Western hegemony over the world.
Much of the myth-making in history goes back to this period, and works to India's disadvantage and China's advantage. The European travelers, writers, intellectuals, and traders contrasted the apparent disunity and chaos of India after the decline of the Mughal Empire in the 18th century with the unity and order of the Qing Empire in China.
Not that it always remained so. The Europeans oscillated wildly between declaring China a great civilization and a backward and stagnant one. Thus Leibniz, Voltaire, and Rousseau had favorable opinions about China, while Goethe and Herder held rather dismissive views about it. In the early 19th century, the great German philosopher Hegel went to the extent of saying that 'China was like a dead star whose light was spent forever'. This was in stark contrast with Napoleon's description of China as a 'sleeping giant', which 'will move the world' when it wakes up, a description that was repeated by many other Europeans.
Even after the British success in the first Opium War (1839-42) leading to the forced opening of China and European occupation of many of its parts, European assessments of China continued to swing between the two extremes. And by this time, even China had started thinking in the same manner, as has been corroborated by David Scott in his book China and the International System (1840-1949): Power, Presence and Perceptions in a Century of Humiliation. Thus Chinese perceptions about their own history and future were deeply influenced by European assessments, and continue to be so. These highly selective and distorted views of China's past call for correction.
The truth of history is very different. Both India and China were among the great civilizations of the world. India was no less than China in material advancement and cultural development. This was first established by the Belgian scholar Paul Bairoch, one of the two great economic historians of the last 70 years, who concluded that in 1750 India accounted for about 25 percent of the world GDP and China about 33 percent. Bairoch's study was followed up by a much more comprehensive research of Angus Maddison, the other great economic historian of the last 70 years, about the world economy in the last 2,000 years.
And his findings are even more interesting. According to Maddison, around the beginning of the Common Era, India accounted for 33 percent of the world economy, and China about 25 percent.  Circa AD 1000, India and China still had roughly the same shares, i.e. 33 percent and 25 percent each. By AD 1500, India's share had come down mainly because of the rise of European share, so that both India and China contributed roughly 24 percent each to the world GDP, with China marginally ahead. By AD 1600, China had overtaken India, with about 28 percent of the world GDP against India's 22. However, by 1700 India had again overtaken China now having around 24 percent of the world GDP against China's 22.
The British conquest of Bengal and gradually other parts of India created a huge gap between India and China over the next century or so, as it caused unprecedented damage to both population and economy.  By 1820, the figures were around 17 percent for India and 33 for China. While making a historical comparison between the two countries, people often take only this last cut-off date, and come to an erroneous conclusion, since by this time the Indian economy had already suffered incalculable damage first under British mercantilism and later because of the rise of the Industrial Revolution in England, which would have scarcely been possible without the resources and markets provided by India.
Now these figures are not meant to be taken too strictly. What they do indicate, however, is that both India and China were central to the world economy in history, and that neither the one nor the other could claim primacy for itself.
What is true of economy was also true of the demography of the two countries. For most of the last 2000 years, India had a larger population than China. Again, as late as 1700, its population exceeded that of China, which overtook India by 1820 mainly because of the decline of India's population under the British rule. Population was more important in the pre-modern world than it is today, because it was reflective of the greater productivity and economic development of a country.
We should, therefore, not be surprised that India is again poised to overtake China in terms of population, since it is in tandem with a long-term historical trend. Indeed, India along with Pakistan and Bangladesh, i.e. the undivided India, has already overtaken China.
It is important to debunk the myths of history, because in a very large measure China's sense of entitlement, its manifest destiny of emerging as a super power in the 21st century flow out of Sino-centric accounts of the past.  Even the 'century of humiliation' that China keeps highlighting to justify its conduct in the present is rooted in this mythology of the past. Other nations have suffered far worse fates than China in its 'century of humiliation', but scarcely any of them carry the baggage of the past as much as China does.
The truth of the history is that both China and India paid a heavy price for their inability to see the rising tide of European imperialism while there was still time. We know about the dismissive response of the Qing Emperor to the British embassy led by Lord Macartney in 1793. What is less known is that Aurangzeb, who ruled over one of the greatest empires of the world, had betrayed a similar attitude towards English ambassadors regarding them as people of no consequence and their Queen as nothing more than a petty chieftain. The future was to prove both of them wrong.
The subsequent tide of imperialism and colonialism involved massive exploitation and oppression of large parts of the world. Among the biggest victims was indisputably India, which suffered hugely at the hands of the British, who dealt a final blow to it in the form of Partition before granting Independence in 1947. But we have never had any aggressive plan to seek revenge and to correct the historical wrongs by redrawing borders in blood.
China's claims over Taiwan, Tibet, and Sinkiang on the other hand have very little historical justification. Taiwan may have been a part of China during some periods of its history, but it became a separate nation by the will of its people and leaders, and has every right to continue its existence as such, irrespective of Chinese claims.
Just because the Manchus/Qing, who themselves were of foreign origin, had some nominal suzerainty over Tibet does not mean that China's occupation of Tibet since 1951 has any justification whatsoever. The peculiarities of the Qing Empire make any Chinese claims on the basis of its territorial limits meaningless. This is clearly brought out from the following words of William T. Rowe in his famous book China's Last Empire: The Great Qing:
This new Manchu-centered Qing differed fundamentally from most preceding imperial dynasties-and none so dramatically as the Ming-in that it was self-consciously conceived as a universal empire, a multinational polity within which China (the former Ming domain) was simply one component, though quite obviously the most central and economically productive one. The dissociation of the Great Qing empire from the long recurring pattern of imperial Chinese dynasties has led some scholars to insist on seeing 1636 (the year of the Qing's self-proclamation) rather than 1644 (the year of the Qing conquest of the Ming) as the empire's proper founding date.
For China, however, there is no contradiction in professing faith in a 'harmonious world' of Hu Jintao's description, while claiming rights over all territories conquered by the Qing. This Chinese contradiction is aptly summed up by Peter C. Perdue in his book China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia:
Even though nationalists rejected the Manchus as an obstacle to China's modernization, the Chinese nation-state derived its concept of its ideal boundaries from the maximal expansion of the Qing empire in the eighteenth century. Like other nationalists, the Chinese built on the past they reject.
Almost all the territorial claims of China supposedly deriving their justification from the past exemplify only the age-old dictum of might is right. China claims territorial rights over all lands which in some distant past may have been ruled by foreign-origin dynasties like the Yuan and the Qing which extended over huge landmasses. It is then not a surprise that China has territorial disputes with so many countries, such as India, Japan, Vietnam, and Philippines.
By this utterly flawed and dangerous logic, India can stake a right to many neighboring countries like Sri Lanka and Burma, as these were parts of the British Empire. China's claim over Taiwan is roughly in the same category as would be a hypothetical Indian claim over Pakistan or Bangladesh. China's claim over Sinkiang would be in the same league as a putative Indian claim over Afghanistan, most of which was a part of the Mughal Empire as late as the 18th century.
Whereas history is an important part of nation-building, too much emphasis upon it or an inability to see it in the right perspective can easily lead a country to 'such an elevated conception of its world role' in the past as to make peaceful and harmonious relations with other nations difficult, if not impossible.

Why Minecraft s creator Markus Persson is leaving MojangSep 16, 2014 at 11:26am IST
Why Minecraft's creator Markus Persson is leaving Mojang

New York: Microsoft agreed Monday to buy the Swedish group behind the hugely popular video game Minecraft for $2.5 billion, bolstering the increasingly important gaming division of the US tech giant.
The deal for Swedish-based Mojang gives Microsoft one of the best-known video games of all time - one which is played on game consoles as well as PCs and mobile devices.
Mojang will be merged into Microsoft Studios, which includes the studios behind global franchises including Halo.
Microsoft is buying buy the Swedish group behind the hugely popular video game 'Minecraft' for $2.5 billion.
#minecraft #gaming #microsoft #mojang
"Gaming is a top activity spanning devices, from PCs and consoles to tablets and mobile, with billions of hours spent each year," said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, announcing the deal.
"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise - it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft."
Minecraft is often described as digital Lego. Players try to survive in a hostile world populated by monsters while building tools and buildings and redesigning the environment as they progress.
Despite less sophisticated graphics than many successful competitors, the game has succeeded in winning over children and more seasoned gamers.
Since its launch in 2009, Minecraft has been downloaded some 100 million times on PCs, has been the most popular game on Microsoft's Xbox and is the top paid app for both iOS and Android, according to Microsoft.
"The Minecraft community is among the most active and passionate in the industry, with more than two billion hours played on Xbox 360 alone in the past two years," Microsoft said.
Microsoft plans to continue to make the game available across all the platforms on which it is available today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.
'Belongs to all of you'
Mojang's Owen Hill said Minecraft's main creator Markus Persson, who uses the nickname "Notch," decided "that he doesn't want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance."
"Minecraft has grown from a simple game to a project of monumental significance," Hill said in a blog post.
"Though we're massively proud of what Minecraft has become, it was never Notch's intention for it to get this big."
Indeed, Persson said in his own blog post it was time to move on.
"I don't make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don't try to change the world," he said.
"Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can't be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now.
"In a much bigger sense, it's belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change."
The Swedish group said that "the vast majority (if not all) Mojangstas will continue to work at Mojang for the time being" but that the three founders are leaving.
"We don't know what they're planning. It won't be Minecraft-related but it will probably be cool," Hill said in his blog post.
Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said the deal has enormous potential for Microsoft if it manages the game wisely.
"Minecraft is what it is because its users are free to make it whatever they want it to be," McQuivey said.
"Will Microsoft be able to let the people run free with Minecraft the way the founders did and continue to do? The right answer, to preserve the value of the property, is 'yes'," he said.
"But that is not usually the corporate answer, whether at Microsoft or elsewhere. Lesson to Microsoft: Let Minecrafters be Minecrafters, or you'll practically guarantee an explosive collapse."

Indias infrastructure market set to touch $6.6 bn by 2025: ReportIndia’s infrastructure market set to touch $6.6 bn by 2025: Report
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Sept 16:  
India’s infrastructure market is expected to touch $6.6 trillion by 2025, which will be nearly 12.5 per cent of the Asia-Pacific.
According to consultancy firm PwC, the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to grow by 7-8 per cent a year over the next decade to over $53.6 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60 per cent of the world total.
The increase in infrastructure spends in the country is likely to be driven by sectors like housing, telecom, healthcare, education, transportation, among others, it said.
“Overall, India’s share of the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to continue to grow, reaching around 12.5 per cent or $6.6 trillion by 2025,” PwC said in its report.
Travel demand
According to the report, transportation and utilities investments are expected to triple over the coming decade as income and travel demand will rise and the country’s population will increasingly congregate in urban centres.
“The ongoing development of technology services sector, as well as demand from households, is likely to drive investment in telecommunications infrastructure. The population is expected to grow much faster than other countries in the region, which will further boost demand for infrastructure sectors serving households,” the report said.
Healthcare, education
While annual healthcare investment is forecast to grow around USD 37 billion by 2025, education infrastructure spending will likely reach $18.9 billion.
“The huge growth in infrastructure spending will be driven by key factors such as Asia’s economic growing prominence, trade competitiveness, and the current widely recognised infrastructure deficit across the emerging markets of this region.
“Asia is now the world’s primary growth engine, with China, India and Southeast Asia offering a very large consumer base and low-cost workforce, with high levels of natural resources,” PwC India Leader Capital Projects and Infrastructure Manish Agarwal said.

By-polls: BJP losing ground in UP  neck and neck with Congress in GujaratBy-polls: BJP losing ground in UP, neck and neck with Congress in Gujarat
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 16:  
BJP appeared to cede ground in Uttar Pradesh where SP was leading on six of the 11 Assembly seats where by-polls were held, while it was neck and neck with Congress in Gujarat and behind them in Rajasthan today exactly four months after it swept the three states in Lok Sabha elections.
Three hours after the counting of votes to 33 Assembly constituencies spread across 10 states began, two results were declared with TDP candidate T Sowmya winning Nandigama (SC) in Andhra Pradesh by about 75,000 votes, while CPI-M nominee Prabhat Chowdhury trounced his nearest Congress rival Mailafru Mog by 15,971 votes in the Manu (ST) in Tripura.
The outcome of the by-polls are seen as yet another test for Narendra Modi government’s popularity since it assumed power in May, It is also important as BJP prepares for polls in Haryana and Maharashtra next month where it hopes to oust the Congress in the two states.
Uttar Pradesh
In Uttar Pradesh, SP is leading in six seats, BJP and its ally in four seats and Congress in one, an Election Commission official said in Lucknow.
Stakes are high for BJP, Congress, and Samajwadi Party in UP after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls.
Gujarat
Ruling BJP is leading in five Assembly seats in Gujarat, while Congress is ahead on four, according to early trends.
Initial rounds of counting indicated a neck and neck fight on at least five seats in the Assembly elections.
BJP is leading in Anand, Tankara, Maninagar, Talaja and Limkheda Assembly seats, while Congress is ahead in Khambalia, Matar, Mangrol and Deesa, according to election officials.
All the seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was a three-time MLA from Maninagar.
The by-polls are also considered to be a test for new Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel under whose leadership, the elections are being held for the first time.
Rajasthan
In Rajasthan, the Opposition Congress candidates are leading in three out of the four Assembly constituencies, while ruling BJP candidate is ahead on the remaining one.
Initial trends show that Congress candidates Shrawan Kumar (Surajgarh), Bhajanlal (Weir) and Ramnarayan (Nasirabad) are leading, while BJP’s Sandeep Sharma was ahead on Kota South.
Trinamool Congress and Congress are leading in Basirhat Dakhin and Chowringhee Assembly constituencies in West Bengal.
For the three seats in Assam, Opposition AIUDF is leading in Jamunamukh and Lakhipur, while BJP is ahead in Silchar.
Counting of votes was also underway in Rangang-Yangang seat in Sikkim, Manu in Tripura and Antagarh in Chhattisgarh.
After BJP’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in UP in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago, it is to be seen whether the party can retain its 10 seats. One seat was earlier with its ally Apna Dal.
The current BJP President Amit Shah had scripted the sweep in UP helping the saffron party bag 71 seats while its ally Apna Dal got two.

BJP retains Vadodara LS seat  Ranjan Bhatt wins by over 3 lakhvotesBJP's Ranjan Bhatt showed impressive lead over Narendra Ravat of Congress as soon as counting started.
Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:43 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:26 pm
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat that was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with party’s candidate Ranjan Bhatt winning the Lok Sabha bypoll by a margin of 3,29,507 votes over her closest rival, Congress candidate Narendra Ravat.
Bhatt showed impressive lead over Ravat as soon as counting started at the Polytechnic college in Vadodara, leaving no doubt about her victory.
Unlike the April 30, 2014 election that saw over 70 per cent voters turning up to exercise their franchise for the then BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and his rival, Congress’ Madhusudan Mistry, among other candidates, the September 13 election was marked by low voter turnout with only a little over 45 per cent voting. A total 7,32,339 valid votes were cast as against 11,43,524 votes cast in April 2014 election.
According to the final tally that was out by 11:15 am Tuesday, Bhatt received 5,26,763 votes against Ravat’s 1,97,256 votes. Two other independent candidates in the fray received 8,320 votes in all. As many as 14,257 votes were cast under “none of the above” (NOTA) category.
The postal ballot count also went in favour of BJP’s Bhatt, as she received 1,997 votes against Ravat’s 1,340 votes. As many as 60 votes under postal ballot were cast under NOTA category.

9 Independent MLAs  Rane aide joinNCPPress Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:43 pm
In a pre-election boost to the NCP, nine Independent legislators, including a minister, Monday joined the party, which said it was firm on contesting 144 out of the total 288 Assembly seats in the elections next month. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said the ball was now in the Congress’s court.
The new entrants included minister Dilip Sopal, who wasn’t present during the induction but announced his entry through a mobile phone call to Ajit Pawar at the function. The other legislators who joined the Sharad Pawar-led NCP Monday were Mansingh Naik (Shirala), Balasaheb Patil (Karad), Makrand Patil (Wai), Ramesh Thorat (Daund), Babasaheb Patil (Ahmedpur), Suresh Deshmukh (Wardha), Sharad Gavit (Navapur) and Sahebrao Patil (Amalner). The NCP also made it clear that it was firm on contesting 144 seats in the Assembly polls on October 15.
“The top leaders of Congress and NCP held talks on seat-sharing in Delhi. We are awaiting the response. The ball is in their court,” Ajit Pawar told reporters after inducting the nine Independent legislators into the NCP. “We are firm on 144 seats,” he said.
Asked if there were plans to contest polls without the Congress, he said: “So far there are no such plans.” When pointed out that Congress leaders were scrutinising candidates for seats that are now with the NCP, Pawar said: “If that is the case, we also won’t keep quiet. Anyways, it is their (Congress) right to undertake such an exercise.”
“There is a trend seen in workers of all parties to go independent,” he said, in response to a query. “Senior NCP leaders feel there should be no division of secular votes,” Pawar said.
Meanwhile, the NCP Monday also inducted former legislator Rajan Teli, a former aide of Congress state campaign chief Narayan Rane. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare evaded a direct response to queries on Teli’s name allegedly figuring in a murder case.

Govt to decide on diesel deregulation after assembly polls:SourceThis is perhaps the first time that fuel retail prices in India are higher than the global rates. (Reuters)
Reuters | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:39 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 2:08 pm
India will decide on whether to end government control of diesel pricing after elections in two states next month, an oil ministry source said.
India currently controls prices with subsidies under a scheme originally intended to help the poor and rein in inflation, but local prices are now higher than global rates, making a case for a cut in retail prices.
“The diesel under-recovery (goal) has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of 0.35 rupees per litre (less than a cent) with effect from Sep. 16,” a government statement said on Tuesday.
A rising subsidy bill and strained public finances in a sluggish economy forced India’s Cabinet in January 2013 to allow state retailers to marginally raise diesel prices each month.
“We tinker with diesel prices once a month…There is a case for a cut in diesel prices towards the end of the month but a decision is yet to be taken on that,” the source with direct knowledge of the matter said. “Decision on diesel deregulation will be taken after state elections.”
Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said India should use this opportunity of easing global oil prices to eliminate diesel subsidies at the earliest. [O/R}
The states of Maharashtra and Haryana, with chief ministers from the opposition Congress Party, will go to the polls on Oct. 15, offering Prime Minister Narendra Modi the chance to chalk up gains after his general election triumph in May.
Under India’s election rules the government can not make any major policy decisions during an election campaign which may directly impact voters.
The oil ministry will have to seek a cabinet nod for deregulating diesel prices, two ministry sources said last month.
Government controls over pricing of liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene and diesel led to revenue losses at state fuel marketing companies – Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp.
“For oil marketing companies, it is quite positive because 55 percent of their sales are diesel and positive margins on diesel definitely helps their earnings,” said Rohit Ahuja, Mumbai-based analyst at ICICI Securities.
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Oil India Ltd and GAIL (India) sell crude and related products at a hefty discount to partly compensate for losses of retailers, who also get some cash subsidies from the government.
Ahuja said benefits for ONGC and Oil India would come with a lag as the government might look at easing their burden through a “subsidy sharing formula or a fixed number”. Currently these companies’ subsidy share varies from quarter to quarter.
Deregulation could bring the return of private firms such as Reliance Industries and Essar Oil to retail sales. Such companies do not receive federal support for selling diesel at discounted rates and currently sell via state refiners despite continued…

10 stocks that returned upto 136% | Sensex @ 12: top 20 stock ideasET 500 highlights resurgence in India Inc as companies post higher revenue, profits over 2013
Ramkrishna Kashelkar, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 11.03AM IST
(The ET500 features India…)
MUMBAI: Watershed — that's what 2014 feels like. A time of uncertainty, fear, stasis and overall gloom is giving way to hope, renewal and good cheer as various auguries point to an economic resurgence after a prolonged slump. The stock markets, racing ahead of the curve, shot up to an all-time high earlier this month.
There's no better time to unveil this year's ET500 — the definitive ranking of India's biggest listed companies — than right at the cusp of this transformation as Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready to deliver on his promise of economic deliverance from years of policy paralysis and excruciatingly slow growth.
The ET500, in broadsheet format for the first time, features India Inc's biggest companies in terms of revenue, which saw an 11% increase at the aggregate level to Rs 67 lakh crore since the last list. Nevertheless, it reflects the sluggishness through FY14 as the cut-off for this year's listing remained unchanged from the previous level. Similarly, the number of companies posting losses jumped to a record high of 85 and their combined losses, more than Rs 36,700 crore, turned out to be 18 times what it was in 2007.
On the brighter side, quite a few companies expanded profits significantly. TCS, for example, became the third-biggest in terms of profit in FY14, after energy giants ONGC and Reliance Industries. In fact, for private sector firms, the reported profit for FY14 was the highest ever. However, their public sector counterparts failed to keep pace.
The year also recorded the highest amount distributed as dividends by ET500 companies.
Coal India and Strides Arcolab paid out hefty special dividends and the big information technology companies were also generous to shareholders after turning in healthy performances. A record Rs 1.26 lakh crore was paid out as dividend in FY14, translating into 30% of the year's aggregate profits.
The petroleum sector's dominance of the ET500 continues with six of the top 10 companies belonging to that industry. The supremacy of stateowned companies could be slackening, as only five of them made it to the top 10 as against six last year.
Tata Motors became India's biggest non-oil company by revenue while State Bank of India retained its position as the biggest non-manufacturing company in the country. The top eight companies in the ET500 remain a class apart, with each reporting revenue that exceeded 1% of India's GDP.
Rivals have a long way to catch up, with an almost Rs 50,000 crore gap separating Tata Steel in eighth position and Essar Oil in the ninth. The ET500 also clearly captures the changing face of India Inc — the gradual shift away from the metro cities, as an increasing number of companies from tier-2 and tier-3 cities make it to the list.
Pune, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are gaining while Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are losing ground.

Analysts bearish on Hindalco as Jharkhand shuts bauxite mines

(The company has bauxite…)
MUMBAI: The Jharkhand government's move to shutdown all bauxite mines with deemed licenses in the state is likely to have negative impact on Hindalco .
The company has 5 bauxite mines in Lohardaga and Gumla which, have been operating on deemed license.
The company has bauxite inventory for about 1-2 months and will have to source bauxite from external sources if the state government does not allow restarting of mines soon.
According to reports, these mines cumulatively accounted for 45 per cent of Hindalco's bauxite production from Jharkhand.
"Factoring the cost differential between captive and imported bauxite, we see an adverse impact of Rs 7.1 per share on our current Fair Value. Hindalco's disclosures pertaining to bauxite sourcing have been opaque and the Street so far has given it the benefit of doubt on sourcing arrangements/costing," said Espirito Santo report.
"Given the power outage issues and bauxite mine shutdown, we expect higher COP/lower volumes on a sequential basis for Hindalco's standalone operations in Q2FY15," the report added.
The brokerage has reiterated 'Sell' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 155 per share.
The stock after correcting over 10 per cent in the last one month looks weak on the charts.
Sandeep Wagle, Founder & CEO , Power My Wealth has advised traders to go short on the stock with stoploss of Rs 168. He expects the stock to slip lower to Rs 156 per share.
At 10:30 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 164.75, up 0.83 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 165.50 and a low of Rs 161.15 in trade today.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to nearly 20,000 Indian-Americans in New York during his US visit will be beamed live on the giant screens of the iconic Times Square.
His speech at the Madison Square Garden in midtown Manhattan, New York, on September 28 will be shown at Times Square with Indian American Community Foundation (IACF), organisers of the mega event, signing a memorandum of understanding in this regard with Times Square Alliance.
The speech, shown live on the giant screens of the Times Square — considered to be the hub of the New York City — would carry English subtitles.
For the audio, people can either dial a toll free number to listen the speech live or download an app on their smart phone, people familiar with the event told PTI.
Mr. Modi is scheduled to address a 20,000 packed crowd inside the Madison Square Garden for which nearly 40,000 people had applied from across the nation.
The live telecast of the speech is expected to help some of these people to listen to Mr. Modi’s speech at the Times Square — another historic venue of the New York City.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that IACF has raised about USD 1.5 million for the mega event, while donations are still pouring in from across the United States. Thousands of people have made donations to IACF through its website.
Majority of the donations have come from individuals, an IACF official said on condition of anonymity, adding that they are very strict on corporate donations.
IACF is bringing out a souvenir magazine for the occasion and sponsors of the pages are being offered complimentary seats — which are a few hundred.
Such is the response that IACF has run out of those pages in the souvenir and the associated complimentary seats for the Madison Square Garden event, according to one individual familiar with the planning.
IACF has already announced that money raised in excess would be donated to charitable and non-profit organisations.
Tickets to the events are free, although prior registration is required.
Each attendee will be given a “souvenir”, a glossy full colour magazine with content that celebrates the Indian diaspora, the common values of democracy, and content about the Prime Minister and the historic election which his party won.
Cost of advertisement in the souvenir range from USD 2,500 to USD 35,000.

Positive on OMCs, pharma; overweight on pvt banks: Emkay
The house continues to remain positive on oil marketing companies on back of expected reforms and disinvestments. The reduction in crude prices has been an added advantage says Sinha.
Post your opinion here
Street Signs
Dhananjay Sinha Head - Institutional Research, Emkay Global Financial Services feels reduction in deposit rates would help induce margin upsides for PSU banks but the house is still cautious on PSU banks because of their low credit growth.
According to him the private banks will grow business much faster than PSU banks. So the house is overweight on private banks, especially  ICICI Bank . However, amongst PSU banks they are only positive on Bank of Baroda .
State Bank of India  today cut the deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent, while for the period of 180-210 days; it has hiked the rates to 7.25 percent from 7 percent.
The house continues to remain positive on oil marketing companies on back of expected reforms and disinvestments. The reduction in crude prices has been an added advantage says Sinha.
Meanwhile with all the current happenings in the pharma sector, the house continues to be positive on the sector.
For the market per se, he expects higher volatility going forward because the market has run up significantly ahead of the fundamentals.
Below is the transcript of Dhananjay Sinha’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Anuj Singhal
Anuj: A word on PSU banks, we had State Bank of India (SBI) in the morning coming out and cutting interest rates on fixed deposits. How would you react to that, what is your call on PSU banks?
A: We have been pretty cautious on the PSU banks. I think things like deposit rate cuts etc would not really matter too much. On a standalone basis one would assume that the reduction in deposit rates would actually help induce certain upside to the margins but I think the important thing to notice is that reduction in the deposit rate is happening on the back of the fact that bank is not seeing enough credit growth and the business of the bank is to actually lend.
So if the lending growth is not really happening then it is quite likely and we are seeing that in the numbers where credit growth as a system has actually declined to something like 10.9 percent. The benefit on the margins will not really be sustained. So that is an important thing and we also have to understand that after Q1 growth numbers that we have seen on GDP and IIP we have seen first month of this quarter showing a considerable decline wherein the IIP growth was just half percent and export growth was fairly flat.
Also if you are looking at the credit growth numbers; I would say that some of these numbers would also have certain implications for the asset quality issues which continue to be a concern for the PSU banks. We have seen in Q1 results those concerns were prevailing and those concerns will extend even in the Q2 numbers. So, we are cautious on PSU banks. Within the PSU banks, we like Bank of Baroda. We have been overweight private bank and ICICI Bank has been our favourite.
So, from a structural standpoint also we think that the private sector banks will actually grow business much faster compared to the public sector space.
Ekta: Your thoughts on the entire oil and gas space and would you see any more incremental upside in the likes of  Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) which has run up over 95 percent year-to-date?
A: Yes. I think we have been constructive. We were rather positive on the oil segment and even ahead of the reduction in the global crude prices we have said that since the government will be dependent a lot on disinvestment and since disinvestments will happen more proactively in the oil sector, and government will do these reforms. Therefore, from a reform standpoint that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) and other oil marketing companies (OMCs) will do well.
Moreover, this reduction in the crude oil prices has come as an additional boon for the oil sector. So if the crude prices continue to remain soft, it will continue to add certain positivity to these companies.
Ekta:  Venus Remedies is now down 15 percent and that stock had gained over 36 percent on a year-to-date basis. Would that make you a little worrisome in terms of may be the midcaps going ahead of their fundamentals and there could be some more sort of accidents such as Venus which could take place?
A: The market has actually run-up significantly ahead of fundamentals and people have picked up some of the midcap names without really having some fundamentals just because there was flavour for midcap companies. However, it is likely that there could be reoccurrence of volatility for more macro reasons.
Venus Remedies is a pharma stock and we are generally positive on the pharma stocks. We think that within the pharma space the stock should actually do well. And it is possible that there will be certain midcap stocks over there which can also continue to do well. But otherwise the whole cyclical components of the midcap stocks can be more vulnerable.
We have met several midcap capital goods companies recently and we see that there is a considerable amount of paradox in terms of how the market has been viewing the investment cycle and the expectations around it, and what these companies are going through or what they are expecting. So there will be certain amount of realignment and that would imply higher volatility going forward.

Blame game starts as Scottish poll loomsBlame game begins as PM makes his final pitch for No vote
By Sarah Neville and Jim Pickard in London, George Parker in Edinburgh and Kiran Stacey in Aberdeen
©Reuters
David Cameron has made a final appeal to Scots to vote No and avoid a “painful divorce” amid claims that he and his inner circle were slow to heed warnings from senior civil servants that the UK could be heading for a break-up.
His second visit to Scotland in a week reflects an abrupt change of approach following the narrowing of the polls that electrified the campaign 10 days ago. In a foretaste of the recriminations should Scotland vote Yes, a government aide insisted ministers had at no stage taken victory in Thursday’s independence referendum for granted. Any such suggestion was “absolutely complete and utter nonsense”, the aide said.
More
Farage people know Ukip not a protest vote
Meanwhile Mr Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg signed a joint pledge in the Daily Record saying that the Scottish parliament was “permanent” and that the so-called Barnett formula – which gives Scotland higher per capita funding for public services than England – would continue.
Lord O’Donnell, cabinet secretary and head of the civil service until the end of 2011, and his successor, Sir Jeremy Heywood , are understood to have raised early concerns over the potential break-up of the union. Other senior civil servants also expressed concern this year that ministers were underestimating the resilience of the Yes campaign, the Financial Times understands.
In the opening months of the campaign, Sir Jeremy, who became cabinet secretary in 2012, pressed ministers to push to win over putative Yes voters, rather than simply shoring up the No vote, according to one person familiar with the discussions. Sir Jeremy had pointed out that winning the independence vote was Scottish first minister Alex Salmond’s sole focus and that Westminster, despite its much wider range of priorities, must provide matching fire, the former insider said.
The Cabinet Office said last night this was “simply not true”, adding that the government’s focus had been “entirely on getting to the right outcome. Ministers and the civil service have worked hard to make the case for the UK”. Their efforts had included 14 analysis papers, as well as “numerous” speeches on, and visits to, Scotland by minsters.
George Osborne, the chancellor, was a key supporter of the “fear” aspects of the campaign – notably on the currency question – in recent months, arguing that a No campaign was by definition destined to be negative.
Michael Moore, Scotland secretary until late last year, defended the conduct of the No campaign. “As long as I was involved, everybody shared and discussed information together and there was a strong consensus between politicians and officials about how this should be approached,” he said. “I’m surprised to hear these noises-off now.”
A coalition figure added: “Politicians if anything understood the dyn­amics of electoral campaigns rather more closely than civil servants and tend to understand the variability rather better.”
On his final campaign visit to Scotland before the vote, Mr Cameron pleaded with Scots not to think of a Yes as “a trial separation” but as a permanent settlement. “Do not break this family apart.”

"India Inc. Is Risk Averse"Great Lakes Institute of Management
Agree
"Although liquidity is improving, companies aren't ready to invest"
Studies on our economy have made India look like a risk-averse country. A study of Indian leaders indicated their insecurity when it comes to encouraging innovation and R&D. The country's work culture is more hierarchical in nature, impeding innovation that drives the 21st century. Our mentality towards risk can be dated back to the Mahabharata in which Yudhishtira lost his kingdom, his brothers and Draupadi by playing the game of dice...
These days, most students are reluctant to take risks to come up with start-ups or become an entrepreneur. Even if they come up, they don't take the risk of scaling it up and mostly sell their ventures to some giants. No wonder there are no Googles or Facebooks in India. Also, weak economic growth in the last few years has forced the companies to heavily hedge against the rupee, aiding to its fall.
Domestic companies borrowed debt for their expansion in the early years of this century when the economy was booming and the returns were expected to be the same for another decade. This year, when the IMF warned India on corporate debt, banks demanded that corporate houses repay, and companies sold their assets and raised capital to reduce their debts. The RBI has asked the banks to be more risk averse. Now, even though liquidity conditions are improving after the RBI reduced the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) twice, the companies are not ready to invest. This shows their risk aversion and lack of entrepreneurship.
Gaurav Bhardwaj
Disagree
"Companies are waiting for the right business opportunities"
Indian companies are playing a major role in writing the country's success story. Big MNCs have emerged, and foreign investors/players are always eyeing various new start-ups for strategic investments. To say India Inc. is risk averse because the borrowing trend did not show any signs of improvement even after consecutive cuts in SLR rates is incorrect. The cut from 23 to 22 per cent does not necessarily translate into lower cost of borrowing being offered by banks to corporate houses.
Recently, the IMF said: "A third of the corporate debt in India has a debt-to-equity ratio of more than three, the highest degree leverage in the Asia Pacific region." The high ratio signifies that the companies are using the debt market rather than the equity market to infuse capital in their businesses to support expansion plans.
Due to receding liquidity, higher interest rates and poor government machinery leading to delays in project approvals and implementation, the companies are facing an adverse situation. As per a Credit Suisse report, $400 billion of debt is held by 3,500-odd companies. The companies are [now] waiting for the right time and positive government measures to improve the overall business conditions and ease of doing business in India. They are trying to ensure higher profitability in the future and are waiting for the right business opportunities to utilise their leveraging power.

TCS opens Saudi Arabias first all-women BPO centreIndia’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Sunday said it has opened Saudi Arabia’s first all-female business process centre, which will provide employment to up to 3,000 women in three years.
Saudi Aramco and GE are the centre’s first customers, TCS said in a statement in Mumbai.
Both the clients have already surpassed their target of recruiting 100 women each, while the total number of those employed at the centre stands at 300, it said.
The Riyadh-based 3,200-sq mt facility will offer customers specialised finance and accounting, human resources, materials supply and office services to improve their operational efficiency, it said.
The centre was announced in September last year.
Saudi Arabia’s Commerce and Industry Minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan Al Rabiah, Deputy Governor of Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority Prince Saud bin Khalid, Saudi Aramco’s President and Chief Executive Khalid Al Falih and GE’s Vice Chairman John Rice, were present on the occasion, the statement said.

Indiabulls: Promoters carve out new paths in separation dealComments
The Indiabulls promoters are dividing the real estate-to-finance-to-power group among themselves to bring greater focus to the constituent parts of the diversified conglomerate and also because of differing perceptions about individual companies.
Sameer Gahlaut, chairman of the undivided group, will retain control of Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Securities and will also get to keep the Indiabulls brand name.
Rajiv Rattan, who bought out co-promoter Saurabh Mittal’s stake in Indiabulls Infrastructure and Power last week for Rs. 360 crore, is now the sole promoter of the company, which has two 2,700 MW thermal plants in Amravati and Nashik, both in Maharashtra, that are either already generating power or close to completion.
“The finance and real estate companies used to generate about 80% of the combined group’s profits. The division would ring-fence these businesses from any possible contagion arising in the power business,” said Gagan Banga, vice-chairman and CEO of the Indiabulls Group. 
“I have been running the power business from the start. Today, most of the issues have been sorted out and I feel the years ahead will see exponential growth,” Rattan told HT.
But why split the group if all businesses are doing well? “It will allow me to focus exclusively on the power business,” he added.
Rattan and Mittal will retain their 18% stake in the finance and real estate companies (valued at Rs. 3,000 crore). However, Rattan will have to rename his company as the Indiabulls brand name will go to Gahlaut. “I haven’t yet decided on a name. When I do, I will inform Sebi,” he said.
The power business, Rattan said, is the only listed power company not to be affected by the recent Supreme Court order declaring the allocation of coal blocks illegal because it has dedicated coal linkages from Coal India. “If the government decides to auction the cancelled coal blocks, we will bid for them,” he said.

Google launches Android One-powered smartphones at Rs. 6 399technology (general)
Google launched the phones in partnership with Micromax, Karbonn and Spice Mobiles
Hoping to lure feature phone users in India, which form 70 per cent of the mobile market in the country, to upgrade to smartphones, Google on Thursday launched the first Android One devices in India with prices starting from Rs 6,399.
The first three phones have been launched by domestic handset makers Karbonn, Micromax and Spice. While the ones from Karbonn and Spice are priced at 6,399, the one from Micromax is for Rs 6,499.
Interestingly, India is the first country where the technology giant has rolled out these devices. The launch across other markets, including Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka will follow in the coming months.
Commenting on the same, Jaideep Mehta, GM, South Asia, said, “It is a positive development. Fundamentally, Android One devices are going to help enable smartphones prices to go lower. While there are phones available in this segment, more competition gives more options to consumer to choose from.”
He added that typically first time smartphone buyers, who have been using feature phones and have not upgraded due to lack of options will go for these devices.
The Android One devices will compete with like of Moto E, Xiaomi Redmi 1S, Asus Zenphone 4, and models even from Micromax such as Unite 2, all with similar features and priced below Rs 7,000.
With Android One, Google has given a frame of reference to OEMs, based on which the device has been designed for optimum performance. This is likely to significantly improve the quality of hardware and software used.
Presently majority smartphones, including in the affordable range, already run on different and somewhat customised version of Google’s Android operating system. However, this makes the phone more prone to glitches.
In case of Android One devices, the eventual software upgrades will come directly from Google, giving Google better control of the operating system and ensure users get a consistent service.
Vishal Tripathi, Principal Research Analyst at Gartner opined, “This would bring higher traction to the smartphone market, he said, adding consumers will be clear winners. Majorly users looking to upgrade from feature phone to smartphones will go for these devices, he added.
India is an attractive market for companies that make low-cost smartphones because of the immense opportunity it offers as about 70 per cent of the mobile phone users are still on feature phones.

Cognizant to acquire TriZetto for $2.7 bnCognizant to acquire TriZetto for $2.7 bn
Our Bureau
Tweet
Chennai, Sept 15:  
Cognizant Technology Solutions will acquire US-based healthcare IT service provider TriZetto for $2.7 billion in cash and debt.
About 1,200 of TriZetto’s 3,700 employees work at its Pune centre. Nearly 75 per cent of the US-headquartered Cognizant’s 1.87 lakh employees are based in India.
The deal makes it the largest acquisition in value terms among the WITCH — Wipro, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant and HCL Technologies — companies. The previous topper was HCL’s acquisition of UK-based Axon Group for $682 million in 2008. Thanks to this deal, Cognizant’s North America revenues are expected to exceed TCS’s.
The biggest IT deal involving an Indian IT company outside WITCH was iGate acquiring Patni for $1.2 billion in January 2011.
Second position
The TriZetto deal vaults Cognizant to the second slot in terms of overall revenues, after TCS, and gives it a pipeline into what is becoming an increasingly consolidated provider system marketplace in the US, said Joseph Walent, Analyst, Technology Business Research, US.
TriZetto brings to Cognizant significant and complementary new market opportunities, expertise and intellectual property, including multiple industry-leading software platforms used by payers and providers, enhanced competitiveness in integrated engagement opportunities, about $1.5 billion of potential revenue synergies cumulatively over the next five years and attractive, non-linear software revenue, said a Cognizant statement.
TriZetto helps healthcare companies improve administrative efficiency, improve the cost, quality and delivery of care and address compliance.
With over $3 billion in combined healthcare revenue, the two US-based companies will collectively serve nearly 245,000 healthcare providers and around 350 payers (entities that finance or reimburse the cost of health services) with around 180 million covered lives in the US, says a statement issued by Cognizant.
Cognizant’s announcement comes in the backdrop of it signing a Letter of Intent last quarter for a multi-billion dollar engagement with Health Net.
“Healthcare is undergoing structural shifts due to reform, cost pressure and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers. This creates a significant growth opportunity, which TriZetto will help us capture,” said Francisco D’Souza, CEO, Cognizant.
For Cognizant, the healthcare practice contributes nearly 26 per cent of its total revenue. It reported revenues of $2.52 billion in the second quarter of this financial year.
$1 billion debt
Cognizant plans to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. It has secured $1 billion of committed financing for the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014, the statement said.
Gordon Coburn, President, Cognizant, said the acquisition represents an opportunity to integrate services across three horizons — traditional IT services; high-growth businesses such as management consulting, business process services and IT infrastructure services; and, emerging delivery models.
TriZetto and its employees will become part of Cognizant’s existing healthcare business, which currently serves over 200 clients, including 16 of the top 20 US health plans and four of the top five pharmacy benefit management companies.

Shemaroo sells Rs 36-cr shares to anchor investorsShemaroo IPO: Rs 36-cr shares sold to anchor investors
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 21:05 IST
Shemaroo Entertainment, whose initial public offer begins on September 16 to raise about Rs 100 crore, on Monday sold shares worth Rs 36 crore to nine anchor investors including Birla Sunlife and HDFC mutual funds.
Shemaroo is into film and entertainment content business and its IPO would be the fourth of this year. Prior to that, there have been public offers of Wonderla Holidays, Snowman Logistics Ltd and Sharda Cropchem.
In regulatory filings with Sebi and the two stock exchanges (NSE and BSE), Shemaroo said on Monday that the IPO committee of its board finalised allocation of 21.17 lakh equity shares to anchor investors at Rs 170 each-the higher end of the proposed price band of Rs 155-170 each-for an aggregate amount of Rs 35.99 crore.
The anchor investors include two funds of HDFC and seven funds of Birla Sunlife.
The company said that if the IPO price, discovered through book building, is higher than the price offered to the anchor investors, then these investors would be required to bring in the additional amount within the pay-in date.
Shemaroo has offered a 10 per cent discount to retail subscribers. Of the total shares offered, 60 per cent will be offered to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).
The company's IPO closes on September 18.
Shemaroo had received the market regulator Sebi's nod to launch the public offer in February. The company filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in June last year.
The proceeds from the issue would be utilised to fund working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.
The lead managers of the issue are Yes Bank Ltd and ICICI Securities Ltd.
Shemaroo would list shares on the National Stock Exchange and the BSE.

MCX-SX Gets Conditional 1-Year RenewalFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Mumbai: As crisis at its erstwhile promoter group continues to cast a shadow, MCX Stock Exchange on Monday received a one-year conditional renewal to function as a bourse and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) asked it to submit a long-term sustainable business plan and take other remedial actions.
Besides, the exchange would not be allowed to introduce any new contract till it meets the minimum net worth requirement of Rs 100 crore for which it has been given three months.
The current recognition of MCX-SX, which was set up by Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies group, expired on Monday, September 15, but capital market regulator Sebi has now decided to extend it for a period of one year, commencing Tuesday and ending on September 15, 2015.
The renewal is subject to five specific conditions and compliance to other conditions specified by Sebi from time to time, Sebi said in a statement.
"The exchange shall build its net worth (undisputed) to the level as prescribed in Sebi (SECC) Regulations 2012 within a period of three months from the date of renewal of recognition. Further, the exchange shall also submit a business plan to satisfy the regulator about the long term sustainability of the exchange," the regulator said.
While the exchange has been claiming to have a net worth of Rs 100 crore, the regulator does not share the same view and pegs the figure at about Rs 56 crore, sources said.
Sebi further said that MCX-SX "shall not introduce any new contracts till fulfillment of net worth requirement" and it would have to comply with Sebi's directions with regard to entities which have been declared not 'fit and proper' person.
The regulator also asked the exchange to "take immediate steps to rectify the deficiencies pointed out in the systems audit as well as special audit".
Besides, the exchange will have to take necessary steps for compliance with shareholding requirement by all the shareholders as per SEBI (SECC) Regulations 2012, the market watchdog said.
Earlier in March this year, Sebi ruled that the Financial Technologies group was not "fit and proper" to own stakes in any stock exchange and directed it to divest existing holdings in MCX-SX and four other entities.
This order followed Shah-led group coming under scanner of various agencies, including CBI, for alleged irregularities in the grant of license to MCX-SX, as also for the payment crisis worth thousands of crores at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), also set up by the same group.
While FTIL group has challenged the Sebi order on their 'fit and proper status', they no more qualify as 'promoter' in MCX-SX and some other entities such as MCX.
Last year also, while granting a one-year renewal to MCX-SX, Sebi had asked the exchange to strengthen its governance structure to continue remaining a recognised bourse.
Sources said that it might be difficult for MCX-SX to meet some of the conditions set by Sebi for the latest renewal.
The bourse earned total revenue from operations of Rs 91.83 crore for the latest fiscal 2013-14, down from Rs 155.23 crore in the previous year.
It incurred a loss of Rs 154.53 crore for the last year, as against a profit of Rs 21.42 crore in 2012-13. The exchange has attributed the loss to commencement of new segments and fall in volumes in the currency derivatives segment.
"The sentimental fallout of the defaults in another Exchange floated by the erstwhile promoter and introduction of zero pricing by competitor among other events leading to negative publicity also contributed to the fall in volumes," MCX-SX said in its annual report.
"With the management and Board level changes as well as relaxations in the regulatory regime for CD Segment, your Directors feel the company would be able to see better volumes in the CD segment and consequently improve its financial performance in the coming years," it informed its investors.
MCX-SX was notified a 'recognised stock exchange' on December 21, 2012. Its shareholders include top public sector banks, private sector banks and domestic financial institutions who, together hold over 88 per cent stake. It offers trading in the segments of capital market, debt market, futures and options and currency derivatives. It has also received in-principle approval from Sebi for operationalizing SME trading platform.
MCX-SX commenced operations in currency derivatives on October 7, 2008. It launched the segments of capital market and futures and options, and flagship index 'SX40' on February 9, 2013, and commenced trading from February 11, 2013.
The debt market segment was launched on June 7, 2013, and trading commenced from June 10, 2013. The exchange started live trading in cash-settled interest rate futures (IRF), on 10-year government securities, in its currency derivative Segment from January 20, 2014.
MCX-SX had first got a license from Sebi to operate as a stock exchange in September 2012 and this permit was to expire on September 15, 2013, before getting extended by a year.
The bourse began operations in February 2013. However, the trading volumes of the exchange has been quite low as compared to rivals BSE and NSE, while problems at group entity NSEL in July 2013 further worsened the situation.
While Sebi has decided to renew its license twice now, the regulator has been asking MCX-SX to work towards strengthening its governance practices and comply with all applicable regulations to operate as a stock exchange. Sebi also previously warned that the licence can be withdrawn in case of any non-compliance to its directions.

Jharkhand govt shuts 5 Hindalco bauxite minesJharkhand govt shuts 5 Hindalco bauxite mines
Dev Chatterjee and Aditi Divekar | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:49 AM IST
The Jharkhand government has shut five bauxite mines of Hindalco Industries, flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group. This follows a report by the Shah commission on illegal mining, which had alleged such mining was causing widespread damage to the environment and losses to the exchequer.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had reserved its verdict on Hindalco’s Mahan  mine in the coal block allocations case. The action against Hindalco follows similar moves by the Jharkhand government against Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Tata Steel. Jharkhand  earlier ordered the closure of 12 iron ore mines and a few manganese mines in that state. These include SAIL’s mines in Budhaburu, Durgaiburu, and Kiriburu-Meghahatuburu and Tata Steel’s Noamundi mine.
In its report on Jharkhand, the Shah commission had said in 2000-2009, the royalty per million tonnes (mt) of iron ore was meagre, adding, due to this, the lessees had recorded windfall profits. “During the deemed extension when unlawful mining was carried out, the loss to the state is required to be compensated by recovery of value equivalent to the market rate or export rate, whichever is applicable in individual cases, with exemplary penalty after following due course of law,” the report had said.
Analysts say assuming all Tata Steel and SAIL iron ore mines in Jharkhand are shut for the next six months and both companies import iron ore, their book values will take a hit of two per cent and six per cent, respectively. “We forecast incremental cost of importing iron ore of Rs 1,365 crore ($228 million) and Rs 3,885 crore ($648 million) in FY15 for Tata and SAIL; this will impact their profits after tax 18 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively,” said a Goldman Sachs report dated September 8.
“However, if the Jharkhand government allows mining to start for steel producers, we expect the impact to be negligible. The actual impact could be less, given iron ore companies typically have inventory of up to 45 days,” the report added. India’s iron ore production declined from a peak of 219 mt in FY10 to 136 mt in FY13, primarily due to various regulatory and policy interventions.
In May, the Supreme Court had imposed a temporary ban on 26 iron ore and manganese leases (of a total of 56) operating on second and subsequent renewals in Odisha. It had directed the Odisha government to consider all renewal applications within six months. Subsequently, the state government had issued an order to restart mining for eight of the 26 affected leases, including four leases of Tata Steel, three of SAIL, and one of Odisha Mining Corporation.
While Tata Steel did not comment, a SAIL spokesperson said, “We are making efforts to get clearances for the mines from the Jharkhand government and till the time we do not have access to these mines, we will use the ore from our stocks.”
He, however, declined to specify the stock levels and the period for which the stock would suffice.
“We also plan to source ore from other iron ore mines of SAIL,” he added. In its report, the Shah commission had said if illegal mining was allowed to go on, it might lead to irreparable damage to the environment and if it was stopped, there might be irreparable damage to economic interest. “In case of doubt, however, protection of environment will have precedence over the economic interest,” the commission had said.

Taco Bell owner opens Asian fast food jointTaco Bell owner opens Asian fast food joint

Yum Brand's new restaurant serves traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
If you're not up for Mexican tonight, why not try some Vietnamese fare?
Yum Brands, the owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is testing a new restaurant called the Banh Shop. The first location opened on Friday in Dallas, and a second is scheduled to open later this month at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport.
On the menu is a medley of Southeast Asian cuisine, including a number of Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. One sandwich piles chicken, red onion, scallions and noodles on top of a baguette, topped with a cucumber-cilantro aioli. The restaurant also serves Vietnamese-style chicken soup, as well as a "Drunken Noodles" bowl that features stir-fried rice noodles tossed with Thai basil and vegetables.
Related: KFC's China sales plunge on food scare
If successful, the Banh Shop could bring Yum Brands into the fast-casual space to compete with chains like Chipotle ( CMG ) and Panera ( PNRA ). The food comes out quickly, but there's also an emphasis on serving healthy meals.
This is only Yum's latest foray into the space. It opened a U.S. Taco Co . in Huntington Beach, Ca. earlier this year. The eatery is a step up from Taco Bell and offers specialty tacos like the "Brotherly Love," served like a Philly cheese steak in a flour tortilla.
Yum Brands ( YUM ) had a tough summer due to a food safety scare in China . Sales plummeted at its restaurants after a meat factory was accused of selling the company out-of-date and tainted meat.

Now  travel club class at economy price | SpiceJet tops flight occupancy figures againJet Airways, Qatar Airways offer steep discounts on business class
Anirban Chowdhury, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 10.10AM IST
Tags:
Abu Dhabi
(Under the same offer, one…)
MUMBAI: The price war in the skies has spread to the business class. Jet Airways and Qatar Airways are offering huge discounts in a desperate bid to take on Emirates and Singapore Airlines whose recently started A380 flights are scooping passengers in big chunks. Jet Airways is offering all-inclusive one-way business class fares to London at just Rs 28,382 from Delhi and Rs 27,727 from Mumbai, which are just onefourth of usual business class fares and almost half of regular economy fares.
The offer is effective for bookings between September 16 to 18 for travel between October 16, 2014 and July 31, 2015. Under the same offer, one can fly to Singapore in business class at just Rs 18,672 from Delhi and Rs 18,282 from Mumbai, about one-third of normal fares. Jet, however, clarified that none of these fares are valid on flights that operate via its new international hub Abu Dhabi. The airline made Abu Dhabi its global hub after selling 24 per cent stake to Etihad last year.
Earlier in the day, Qatar Airways wrote to travel agents offering an up to 25 per cent discount on all its 130 direct and indirect destinations from India on economy, business and even first classes on bookings made till September 17 for travel between September 21 and June 15, 2015. Industry experts said poor demand has forced airlines to this.
"Demand is a problem. Business class seats for many airlines have been going empty or half full at best," said an industry watcher who didn't want to be named. "What's more, the oncoming festive season never means the same spurt for business class as it does for the back end of the flight." Further, the 500-plus-seater A380 jumbo jet services started by Emirates and Singapore Airlines have made a dent in the market.
"The Emirates A380 flights are doing exceptionally well and so are the ones operated by Singapore Airlines although they have been quiet about it. Bookings are chock-full," said Manoj Samuel , director at Riya Travels, one of the biggest offline travel companies. And it's not as if Emirates is enticing passengers with its premium services alone. The airline recently wrote to travel agents offering base fares starting Rs 7,700 to destinations such as Jeddah, Doha and Bahrain.
Singapore started its daily flights from Delhi and Mumbai on May 30 while Emirates started operating a single daily A380 Mumbai-Dubai flight from June 21. Jet's business class offers are not limited to international routes. Under the scheme, a Delhi-Mumbai business class ticket comes for Rs 4,819, while a Mumbai-Bangalore ticket costs Rs 9,016.
Depending on the aircraft make, Jet Airways has anywhere between 8 and 34 premiere seats per flight. Only a miniscule percentage of the inventory would be on offer on these fares. Slowdown has forced airlines to force-fill their flights with discounts. However, slashing prices in the business class that doesn't depend on volumes is considered a desperate measure.

SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav ’s grand nephew Tej Pratap was leading over his nearest rival BJP’s Prem Singh Shakya in Mainpuri Lok Sabha.

(According to consultancy…)
MUMBAI: India's infrastructure market is expected to touch $6.6 trillion by 2025, which will be nearly 12.5 per cent of the Asia-Pacific, says a report.
According to consultancy firm PwC, the Asia Pacific infrastructure market is expected to grow by 7-8 per cent a year over the next decade to over $53.6 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60 per cent of the world total.
The increase in infrastructure spends in the country is likely to be driven by sectors like housing, telecom, healthcare, education, transportation, among others, it said.
"Overall, India's share of the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to continue to grow, reaching around 12.5 per cent or $6.6 trillion by 2025," PwC said in its report.
According to the report, transportation and utilities investments are expected to triple over the coming decade as income and travel demand will rise and the country's population will increasingly congregate in urban centres.
"The ongoing development of technology services sector, as well as demand from households, is likely to drive investment in telecommunications infrastructure. The population is expected to grow much faster than other countries in the region, which will further boost demand for infrastructure sectors serving households," the report said.
While annual healthcare investment is forecast to grow around $37 billion by 2025, education infrastructure spending will likely to reach $18.9 billion.
"The huge growth in infrastructure spending will be driven by key factors such as Asia's economic growing prominence, trade competitiveness, and the current widely recognised infrastructure deficit across the emerging markets of this region.
"Asia is now the world's primary growth engine, with China, India and Southeast Asia offering a very large consumer base and low-cost workforce, with high levels of natural resources," PwC India Leader Capital Projects and Infrastructure Manish Agarwal said.

Cox and Kings hits new high on fund raising plansCox and Kings hits new high on fund raising plans
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 11:25 AM IST
Cox and Kings has moved higher by 6% to Rs 333, extending its previous day’s 5% rally, on reports that the leisure travel arranger is planning to raise about Rs 300-350 crore via qualified institutional placements (QIP).
The stock opened at Rs 316 and touched a new high of Rs 337 on National Stock Exchange (NSE). A combined 1.33 million shares changed hands on the counter till noon deals on NSE and BSE.
Axis Capital is likely banker to the QIP. The company plans to raise capital in a bid to cut debt on books, the Economic Times report suggests.
Meanwhile, analyst at Sharekhan has recommend ‘buy’ rating on Cox and Kings with price target of Rs 395.
An exit from the low-margin camping business and focus on strengthening the balance sheet bode well for the company from the long-term perspective.
The company aims to become one of the largest leisure travel players globally and is also keen to expand its education tourism business in the other geographies. This would result in a stable double-digit earnings growth and generate better cash flows in the near to medium term, said analyst in a research report dated September 2, 2014.
 

Markets remain weak; Index heavyweights dragMarkets remain weak; Index heavyweights drag
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 11:22 AM IST
Markets are trading weak in a narrow range in the late morning trades on heavy selling by fund and retail investors in oil and gas and select financial stocks amid weak global cues.
 
Meanwhile, investors turned cautious ahead of the start of the two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting starting today.
 
By 11:25, the Sensex has dipped 29 points at 26,787 mark and the Nifty has slipped by 13 points at 8,029 levels.
 
The broader markets continue to outperform the large counterparts- BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have gained between 0.3-1%.
 
The market breadth on the BSE is healthy with 1,509 shares advancing and 1,068 shares declining.
 
Rupee:
 
Rupee is trading at 61.0425/0500 versus Monday's close of 61.13/14. Pares losses made on Monday, when the Indian unit saw its biggest daily fall in 1-1/2 months.
 
Global Markets:
 
Asian shares held near one-month lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the US Federal Reserve's policy stance as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting later in the day. 
 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed near one-month low hit on Monday after seven consecutive days of falls.
 
Japan's Nikkei stock average has shed 0.1%, catching up after Tokyo markets were closed for a local holiday on Monday and Singapore’s Straits Times index dropped 0.8%. However, China’s Shanghai is up 0.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is trading flat with a positive bias.
 
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first U.S. rate hike in more than eight years.
 
Speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected have rattled many share markets around the global and supported the US dollar.
 
Sectors & Stocks:
 
On the sectoral front, BSE Oil & Gas index is the biggest loser down nearly 0.7% followed by Auto and Metal indices. Bankex is down 0.5%. However, BSE Realty index is leading the rally up over 1% followed by Healthcare, Consumer Durables and IT indices.

In the financial segment, Axis Bank is up 1.8% and is the top gainer of this hour. ICICI Bank and HDFC twins are laso trading in the positive territory with marginal gains.

M&M, Hero Motocorp, Tata Power and NTPC are some of the notable names in red among others.
 
On the flip side, healthcare stocks are trading in the positive territory on renewed buying. Dr Reddy’s Lab and Sun Pharma have gained more than 1.5% each.
 
Shares of Wipro are trading nearly 1% higher after a subsidiary of India's third largest IT firm Wipro, secured a contract from Saudi-based Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) for implementing and performing plant maintenance and project system functionality of SAP ERP application.
 
Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto, BHEL and Hindalco are some of the notable names in green among others up between 0.5-2%.

PTI
Tweet
Vijayawada, Sept 16:  
Giving the ruling party a boost, Telugu Desam Party’s Tangirala Sowmya today won the Nandigama Assembly by-poll in Andhra Pradesh by 74,827 votes.
Riding on the sympathy wave, Sowmya, a software engineer, got 99,748 votes, pushing her Congress rival Bodapati Babu Rao to a distant second with 24,921 votes in a straight contest in Krishna district.
The main Opposition YSR Congress Party had not fielded candidate after TDP requested other parties to make the election unanimous.
The by-election was necessitated following the vacancy caused by the death of Sowmya’s father due to a cardiac arrest days after he was elected in the May polls.
Talking to reporters, Sowmya attributed her victory to the leadership of TDP President and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and her late father’s hard work and clean image.
“We can consider this victory as a gift of people on the Chandrababu Naidu Government completing 100 days in office today and Vijayawada being declared as capital of Andhra Pradesh,” she said.
Though she expected to win, Sowmya said she did not expect the margin to be as high as about 75,000 votes.
Pleding to live up to the expectations of the people, Sowmya said she would work for the development of Nandigama, situated around 50 km from Vijayawada, with the help of state minister D Umamaheswara Rao and other leaders.

Bengal by-poll: BJP wins Basirhat Dakshin seatTweet
Kolkata, Sept 16:  
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opened its account here in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly with its candidate Shamik Bhattacharjee winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat.
According to sources, Bhattacharjee defeated footballer and Trinamool Congress candidate Dipendu Biswas by a margin of over 1,700 votes.

The Chowringhee seat was won by Sikha Mitra of Trinamool Congress in the 2011 Assembly elections. The by-election fell due after her resignation from the party.
Trinamool fielded Nayana Bandyopadhyay, wife of the leader of the Trinamool Congress Parliamentary party Sudip Bandyopadhyay, from the segment.
In both the Assembly segments, Congress and Left Front candidates have come in either third or fourth.

Gone are the days when you needed a broadband connection only at home to connect your PC. With every gadget becoming smart, you now need a portable WiFi device in your pocket all the time.
A couple of years ago, using a WiFi hotspot option on your phone, if you had data activated, was a great idea. However, that is not a reliable alternative these days as the phone's battery doesn't last long enough.
Telecom operators have realised the changing customer needs and have come up with better products.
Airtel 3G WiFi
Rs 2,499
Airtel has launched a 3G WiFi dongle that allows users to download data on multiple devices at a high speed of up to 21 Mbps on its 3G network. The device is similar to Tata Photon Max WiFi. It needs to be plugged in either to a laptop or an adapter that converts it into a WiFi router. Up to five devices can be connected to the 3G network using this dongle, including laptops, tablets, mobiles and any other device.
MTS MBlaze Ultra WiFi
Rs 1,499
This dongle works on the EV-Do network, which claims to have a better network reach. It delivers a speed of up to 9.8 Mbps and can be used to connect up to six devices. It has a dual LED indicator for WiFi network. It works with a laptop USB, car chargers and travel chargers. Although it is priced at Rs 2,650, the dongle is available at a huge discount on the MTS website.
Tata Photon Max WiFi
Launched last year, the Tata Photon Max WiFi was among the first few USB dongles that could be converted into a WiFi router to connect up to five devices. The dongle promises a speed of up to 6.2 Mbps. The only downside in unlimited plans is that the speed slows to 153.8 Kbps after you consume the high-speed monthly data under the plan.
Idea Smart WiFi
Rs 2,499
The Idea Smart WiFi is a few hundred rupees expensive than some other similar devices but claims to offer a downlink speed of 21.6 Mbps and can be used to connect up to 10 devices. It requires external power to work - be it a laptop or a power adapter. Interestingly, this device can be controlled using a mobile app as well.
TRAVEL ROUTERS
If you already use a data card, you don't have to dump it and invest in a new one. Instead, you can get yourself a router that converts the dongle into a WiFi router that can be used on a limited number of devices. You can configure the device yourself by following the steps mentioned in the user manual.

Ranchi: Man pleads for toilet to save marriageGovernment officials in Ranchi’s outskirts are rushing to have a toilet built for a tribal man whose wife has threatened to divorce him unless he gets one constructed at their home.
 
For months, Mahavir Oraon didn’t take his wife’s request seriously, partly because of his own financial problems. But he panicked after his wife, Karmi, threated to walk out on their one-year-old marriage.
 
Oraon then rushed to local government officials, pleading to save his marriage by helping him get a toilet constructed at his house in Ranchi’s Itki locality.
 
“We have taken his request seriously and have subsequently directed the village water and sanitation committee to construct a toilet at Oroan’s house at the earliest,” the Block Development Officer, Devdas Dutta, said.
 
Local officials have hailed Karmi for her ‘courageous’ act and is considering making the couple a mascot in their drive to push hygiene in Jharkhand.
 
In a letter to the BDO, Oroan, a resident of Mukhmandro village under Luhna Panchayat in Ratu block, said his wife, who is from Ranchi, had been complaining since the second day of their marriage about the lack of a toilet in the house as she was not used to going into the open to answer nature’s call.
 
Local panchayat head, Silwanti Devi, said: “We are yet to adapt to the practice of having toilets at home. In Mukhmandro, out of 250 households, (a) few have proper toilets.”
 
Villagers said a few roofless toilets were constructed around six years back by the water and sanitation department but none is functional as they were not provided with water supply.
 
Jharkhand ranks amongst the worst in India in sanitation. More than 91% people in rural areas do not have access to toilets. The 2011 census said only 7.7% of rural population had access to proper toilets.
 
Jharkhand police records state that 25% of rapes in rural areas are committed against from women going into the open to defecate.

Ahmedabad, Sept 16:  
Ruling BJP today won four seats, while the Congress bagged two out of the nine Assembly seats in Gujarat, where by-polls were held on September 13.
On three other seats, where counting is underway, BJP is leading in two, while Congress is ahead on one.
“Congress candidates have been declared elected in Deesa and Mangrol seats,” Additional Chief Electoral officer A H Manek said.
“BJP candidates have been declared elected in Maninagar, Tankara, Talaja and Matar,” Manek said.
Maninagar was the seat on which Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerged victorious thrice as a MLA.
On the remaining three seats, Congress is leading in Khambhalia, while BJP is leading in Limkheda and Anand seats.
All the seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The by-polls are also considered as a litmus test for new Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel’s leadership.
The BJP had sought votes in the name of Modi and Patel has asked voters to gift 10 seats to him ahead of his 64th birthday. Modi will reach Ahmedabad this evening and will be present here on his birthday tomorrow.

Sensex down a 100 points; 20 bets | 10 stocks that returned upto 136%You are here: Home > Collections > Stop-loss
Sensex plunges over 300 points, Nifty below 8,000; top 20 intraday trading ideas

(The momentum, the 50-share…)
The S&P BSE Sensex was witnessing profit booking as foreign institutional investors are playing safe ahead of the US Federal Reserve meet. There are concerns that US central bank may give hints of earlier than expected hike in interest rates.
The Sensex plunges over 300 points in intraday trade.
At 3:08 pm, the Sensex was at 26,489.64; down 326.92 points. The Nifty was at 7,931.90; down 110.10 points.
Stocks from mid-and-smallcap space, which were outperforming the benchmarks, were witnessing a sharp cut. Over the last one month, midcaps & smallcaps have outperformed the Sensex and gained more than 11 per cent & 15 per cent respectively.
"We may have reached at exuberant levels if not euphoric ones and therefore we believe that it is time to be a bit fearful when everyone else is greedy and would recommend to trim down leveraged positions and start booking partial profits especially in the Mid & Small Cap space and have a little legroom to take fresh entries in case of an intermediate correction," said Apurva Sheth, CMT, Technical Analyst JHP Securities.
The S&P BSE Midcap Index fell 2.50 per cent and the S&P BSE Smallcap plunged 3.14 per cent.
Among the sectoral indices, the S&P BSE Power Index was down 2.28 per cent, the S&P BSE Oil & gas Index fell 2 per cent and the S&P BSE Metal Index was 1.99 per cent lower.
Tata Power (4.95 per cent), Tata Steel (2.99 per cent), GAIL (2.89 per cent), Axis Bank (2.60 per cent) and ONGC (2.54 per cent) were among the top losers.
Dr Reddy's Laboratories (up 1.47per cent), Sun Pharmaceuticals (up 0.94 per cent), ITC (up 0.68 per cent), Infosys (up 0.59 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (up 0.46 per cent) were among the Sensex gainers.
The market breadth was negative on the BSE with 793 gainers against 2160 losers.
The foreign institutional investors were net sellers worth Rs 74.59 crore and domestic institutional investors were net sellers worth Rs 74.49 crore on Monday as per the provisional data from the National Stock Exchange.
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex fell over 300 points in intraday trade, led by losses in ONGC, Axis Bank, Tata Motors and ICICI Bank.
At 1:20 pm.; 26,627.39; down 189.17 points.

Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
BSE Sensex and Nifty struggled today amid weak Asian markets as global investors awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the US will raise interest rates.
With Federal Reserve poised to indicate monetary stance in next few days, emerging market currencies are seeing stress, said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
The rupee yesterday fell to one-month low against the dollar and today was trading marginally higher at 61.07/dollar vs its yesterday's close of 61.13.
Market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin said Nifty may test 8,000 on the downside and find support around 7950. Nifty faces resistance at around 8,070, he added.
The Sensex was down 8 points at 26,808 while Nifty fell 6 points to 8,035. The broader markets outperformed with BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.60 per cent and 0.80 per cent.
Among Nifty stocks, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Sesa Sterlite, and Tech Mahindra were down between 0.80 per cent to 1.2 per cent.
Some buying was seen in pharma stocks with Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy's up over 1 per cent.

Krish Subramanyam of Asit C.Mehta Investment Intermediates told CNBC-TV18, " Dr Reddy's Laboratories has shown some strong breakout and we feel that we could see the momentum continuing. So we are recommending a bull spread; probably we could do buying of a 3,000 strike Call at around Rs 64 and also sell a 3,100 strike Call at around Rs 23. So the net cost comes to about Rs 41. We could keep a target of Rs 75 and may be a stoploss at Rs 25."
At 12:58 hrs Dr Reddys Laboratories was quoting at Rs 3,022.35, up Rs 45.65, or 1.53 percent. It has touched a 52-week high of Rs 3,033.

Kingston MobileLite Wireless review: A good to have accessoryFor professionals, who need to access storage units on-the-go, the Kingston MobileLite Wireless is a good option but everyone may not find spending Rs. 4,495 worthwhile.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 7:19 pm
Nearly all smartphones and tablet PCs come with USB OTG support, which helps us to access data on flash drives and portable hard drives. The major issue with USB OTG cable connection is that the user has to carry the weight of the storage device. Also, the storage unit keeps on dangling down the micro-USB port of the smartphone or tablet- which is irritating.
Limited storage capacity is another issue synonymous with all smartphones and tablets. So, if you are looking for a device to boost your storage capacity or something that will allow you to access your hard drive, flash drive or SD card from your smartphone or tablet wirelessly without connecting to any computer then this review might interest you.
Device: Kingston Digital MobileLite wireless flash reader comes with a USB port and a SD card slot. You can either connect a pen drive or a portable hard drive and a SD card (mircoSD cards are also supported through adapter) and access content wirelessly through the MobileLite application (available for free) on your Android or iOS device. It supports SD, SDHC and SDXC cards.
Three users can connect to the device simultaneous. Which means, the same memory card, hard drive or pen drive can be used by three users at a time to play different content on three different devices.
It also doubles up as a power bank for emergency power requirement. MobileLite doesn’t have any built-in storage space.
The mission of Kingston Digital MobileLite wireless flash reader is to make additional storage units like portable hard drives, pen drives and memory cards a part of our daily lives on-the-go. So, let’s see if it could impress us or not.
Price: Rs. 4,495 (At Amazon.in)
Design: The Kingston MobileLite Wireless is simple looking, surprisingly light device and easily fits inside trouser pockets. It offers one microSD card slot, one regular USB port and one micro USB port for charging. There is one physical button along with three LED lights. To turn on the device, users will have to just press the button once and on long pressing the button, the WiFi connection is established.
Accessibility: Users will need to download the MobileLite app on their smartphone. Attach the storage unit to the reader and long press the power button to get a static blue light on the device. On the smartphone, activate WiFi and find the device and enter a password. The content can then be accessed via the MobileLite app.
Performance: The card reader does a decent job. I did not witness any lags while streaming a HD movie or any large file. Users can cut/copy and paste files from one storage unit to another and into their phone’s memory or external storage. The range of the device is pretty decent. However, remember, if you are using WiFi to view a movie on your smartphone, then it sucks up a lot of battery. To cater to this problem, the device also doubles up as power bank. But when three devices are connected to it via WiFi, the battery of  MobileLite is simply asked to out perform.
While using the Kingston MobileLite Wireless, remember, that you are already connected to a WiFi network, so, if you want to share content to social media sites directly from your storage then you will have to copy the file, disconnect the Kingston MobileLite Wireless and then use WiFi to access social media sites or you can do it through your mobile Internet connection..
The device heats up very fast. However, this doesn’t affect regular performance.
One interesting issue which I noticed while using the card reader by connecting it to the wall socket for charging was that the device got switched off on its own when power supply resumed after a short power cut.
Overall, there is no serious issue with the performance.
Battery life: The battery life of the device depends on usage. If you are using it watch movies, then the battery life is of course less. However, for basic file operation and a bit of multimedia, the battery life is decent. Kingston MobileLite Wireless is not primarily a power bank, it can just deliver enough juice during crisis. So, don’t think of replacing it with a power bank.
Verdict: Kingston MobileLite Wireless is a good to have accessory for sure. However, buy it if you use USB OTG very often or if you are running short of memory on your smartphone or tablet. For professionals, who need to access storage units on-the-go, the Kingston MobileLite Wireless is a good option but everyone may not find spending Rs. 4,495 worthwhile. Kingston could have added more value to the device, by adding a microSD card slot and an extra USB port along with some amount of storage.
Are you using the Kingston MobileLite Wireless reader? If yes, please feel free to share your experience at the comments section below. Also, if you know about a better alternative please let our readers know.

Fair Trade Regulator Clears Zuari s Open Offer for MCFL ShareholdersFuture Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
New Delhi: Paving the way for competing open offers for Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers' shareholders, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has cleared Zuari's proposal to buy an additional 26 per cent stake in the Vijay Mallya group firm.
Deepak Fertilizers, which is also in the fray to snap up stake in Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL), last month received green signal from fair trade watchdog CCI for its Rs 190-crore open offer.
Zuari entities' Rs 211-crore offer for 26 per cent in MCFL is supported by the existing promoters and would be "a competing open offer" to Deepak Fertilizers' offer.
Giving its approval, CCI said the "proposed combination is not likely to have appreciable adverse effect on competition in India".
Zuari Fertilisers and Chemicals is currently setting up a single super phosphate plant in Maharashtra and does not yet manufacture or trade in any fertiliser products. The entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zuari Agro Chemicals, which is into manufacture and trading of fertilisers.
The public announcement for the open offer was announced on May 12.
Citing information provided by the acquirers, the commission said that the "parties have overlaps in the fertilisers, pesticides and chemicals and organic products".
"However, it is observed that the overlap in pesticides, chemicals and organic products is minimal," CCI said in its order dated September 4 and made public on Monday.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which had given its go-ahead to the proposed stake purchase by Deepak Fertilizers and Zuari Group in MCFL, had also ruled that their respective open offers can commence only after CCI's approval.
Either of the two open offers can start only within 12 working days from receiving CCI approval for the second deal.
According to CCI, it is observed that apart from a few fertilisers which Zuari entities manufacture, they are largely involved in trading of fertilisers.
"Further, the composite market shares of the parties in primary nutrients, as well as in overlapping straight and complex fertilisers such as urea (straight nitrogenous fertiliser), MOP (straight potassic fertiliser), SSP (straight phosphatic fertiliser) and NPK (complex fertiliser), except for in Calcium Nitrate, are not substantial."
"Also the incremental change in the market share is minimal in most cases. With respect to most of the remaining overlapping fertiliser products, including Calcium Nitrate, the parties' presence is only through trading," it noted.

Now  Croma ties up with SnapdealNow, Croma ties up with Snapdeal
Raghavendra Kamath | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:50 AM IST
On the heels of Tata Value Homes, a subsidiary of Tata Housing, tying up with the Kunal Bahl-led Snapdeal.com, another Tata group company, Croma, is gearing up to ink a pact with the e-commerce portal.
Sources in the sector said the deal would involve the electronics chain’s products being sold through Snapdeal, but a source close to the development insisted it would be different from the Tata Value Homes-Snapdeal tie-up, where the former’s properties are to be sold through portal.
Notably, this is the second such tie-up after Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata bought a stake in Snapdeal recently.
Snapdeal and Croma are expected to hold a press conference here on Tuesday to announce the deal.
Both Croma chief executive officer (CEO) Ajit Joshi and Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl could not be contacted.  According to experts, in the wake of Ratan Tata’s investment, Tatas could use the Snapdeal platform for various companies.
“The e-commerce marketplace has taken off in a big way. If Croma expands itself through Snapdeal, it is good for both. Tatas could use this platform for various companies. Who knows, tomorrow Westside could also come on Snapdeal,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak Advisors, a retail consultant. That Snapdeal sold about 100 apartments of Tata Value Homes online within a week of the partnership shows the e-commerce site’s strength, experts point out.
As part of the deal, about 1,000 Tata Value Homes properties across Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Chennai were put up for sale on Snapdeal. Ranging from one bedroom, hall, kitchen (BHK) to three BHK, the houses are priced between Rs 18 and Rs 70 lakh. Although Tata Value Homes and Croma have their own e-commerce portals, both are also exploiting a marketplace model to sell their products, say experts.  
“Many retailers have their own websites and also use marketplace to sell their products. Metro Shoes and MobileStore are two such examples,” said Singhal.
“Croma is a respected and strong brand. The Tata connection would definitely help Snapdeal,” he added.

Robust review before PSU bank chiefs are selectedRobust review before PSU bank chiefs are selected
Manojit Saha | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has begun to review the performance of those appointed to or candidates for the top posts in public sector banks (PSBs).
The move to make the appointment process more robust comes after last month’s arrest of S K Jain, chairman and managing director (CMD) of Syndicate Bank last month, over graft charges. As a result, the authorities have started asking for feedback and not only from the immediate reporting heads and peers.
The previous government had selected some for appointment in PSBs to replace the many CMDs and executive directors (EDs) due for retirement in 2014-15. The present government is now doing a complete review of those selected.
Following Jain’s arrest, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) found irregularities in the appointment process. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had requested both RBI and the cabinet secretary to review the appointment process.
A committee headed by the RBI governor, which includes the financial services secretary of the Union finance ministry, is set up to select the candidates. The committee sends its recommendations to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister.
CMD posts in four PSBs are already vacant and other vacancies will arise during the financial year. The heads of Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank have competed their terms and United Bank’s CMD opted for early retirement in February. Jain was suspended following his arrest. Two more CMD posts will become vacant by the end of the month, with S L Bansal of Oriental Bank of Commerce and R K Dubey of Canara Bank completing their terms. Later in the financial year, the top post in Vijaya Bank will also get vacant.
And, a number of ED positions will also become vacant on retirements.
A committee headed by former Axis Bank chief P J Nayak has emphasised a need to make the appointments process in PSBs more transparent. Set up by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, it gave a report in May.
At a banking seminar here on Monday, the RBI chief agreed there was a need to change the management appointment process in PSBs, to make it more transparent. The central bank is in talks with the government to improve governance in these lenders, he said.

Hopes for Modi-Sharif talks recedePakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit, at a seminar in New Delhi on Monday.Photo: Rajeev Bhatt
TOPICS
India-Pakistan
Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit, responding to questions on LeT founder Hafiz Saeed’s anti-India statements over the flood situation, said, “Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him.” Mr. Basit’s comments come a day before he travels to Pakistan for consultations with the government.
Mr Basit’s statements on Monday provoked a strong reaction from the Ministry of External Affairs with a spokesperson saying, “99% of the evidence against Saeed exists in Pakistan, given that the conspiracy for the Mumbai attacks was hatched in Pakistan, the training and financing of it was done in Pakistan, and all the masterminds and men who carried out the attacks were Pakistani nationals.”
Monday’s statements further reduced chances of India and Pakistan working towards a meeting between the PMs on the sidelines of the UNGA, where Mr. Sharif had met Manmohan Singh last year.
On Monday, Mr. Basit told The Hindu, “There is no proposal from either Islamabad or New Delhi for such a meeting,” a statement confirmed by MEA officials here. Of particular interest will be Mr. Sharif’s speech to the UNGA on September 25, followed by Mr. Modi’s address on September 27.
The rise in sharp statements between both countries comes after India called off talks between the Foreign Secretaries in Islamabad over Mr. Basit’s meetings with Kashmiri separatists. Since then, Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif had exchanged letters over the flood crisis in J&K as well as in Pakistan.
However, at a press conference in Lahore on September 9, Saeed had attacked Mr. Modi’s offer of assistance and accused India of “water terrorism,” blaming it for the flooding in Pakistan. He had blamed India for drought conditions in Pakistan over the past few years as well.

5 stocks that will lead mkt rally | 10 multi-baggers of tomorrowBharat Petroleum
(Here is a look at a few Nifty…)
Indian equity markets are scaling fresh highs as investors are pouring in funds once again. After a prolonged consolidation, Nifty has been rising to new highs. Experts believe the rally is likely to continue for the next three years. Here is a look at a few Nifty stocks that we believe will lead the rally and have the potential to double in the next three years.
ICICI Bank
India's largest private lender has undergone a major restructuring exercise over the past few years. Its strategy is now concentrated on 4Cs - CASA (current accounts & saving accounts), costs, credit quality and capital. The company has reduced its unprofitable bulk business in terms of both assets and liabilities. For instance, it is going slower on giving large loans to any single group.
Over the past few years, it has concentrated more on secured retail and corporate lending than unsecured lending. ICICI Bank's CASA deposits now stand at 43% of the total deposits, compared to 35% two years ago, a level that ranks among the best in private sector banks. Given its retail franchise and wide branch network, the bank is poised to grow faster than the industry average of 17-18% in the next few years.
Besides, it offers a bouquet of financial services such as broking and insurance. In most of the service categories, ICICI Bank ranks among the top three in the industry. Its profit is likely to go up 80% in the next three years, with 20% overall growth. With improved margins on the back of correction in interest rates and better asset quality, ICICI Bank is likely to be rewarded with better valuation multiples.
Hindalco
After several years of consolidation, aluminium prices have started to move up. LME aluminium is up 20% over the past three months, which is a huge positive for the company as the upward cycle seems to have begun. Besides, global automakers are increasingly substituting steel with lighter aluminium to meet stricter emission rules and improve fuel efficiency.
Hindalco's subsidiary, Novelis will benefit from this, given the good timing of the company's auto grade capacity expansion. Novelis accounts for two-thirds of Hindalco's revenues. With this change in the industry cycle, Hindalco could see a 13-15% operating profit growth in the coming four years. This, in addition to deleveraging, could give additional benefit at the net profit level as the interest too will start coming down.
At present, Novelis' stock is trading at much lower multiples than that of its peers, and the gap could also reduce, contributing to more than doubling of Hindalco's stock.
  Maruti Suzuki
A dominant player in the Indian passenger car market, Maruti Suzuki can look forward to multiple triggers both in its operational and financial performance over the next three years.
It is expected to benefit from the pent-up demand in passenger car sales in the coming years. At the same time, it is entering a strong product cycle pipeline starting 2014-15, with five new launches and expansion of diesel offerings over the next two financial years. The company gained market share between 2011-12 and 2013-14 with its strong portfolio of products that are well-regarded for low-cost ownership and the company's large dealer service network.
Analysts see potential for a further rise in the company's market share. Robust domestic sales volumes, along with new export strategy, are likely to lead Maruti to show volume growth of 12% on annualised basis over the next three years. Its margins are expected to improve by 200-300 basis points on account of improvement in capacity utilisation and progressive trending down of average discount level on its vehicles. This could help the company double its earnings per share by 2016-17 and its stock could double in the next three years.
ONGC
State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation currently shoulders nearly 28% of total under-recoveries in India's petroleum sector that totalled a massive Rs 56,384 crore in 2013-14. With diesel prices likely to be deregulated soon, the company will benefit from a reduced burden of subsidies.
The company is further investing heavily to expand its stagnating output in the years to come. The success of these projects is expected to add nearly 20% to its current output over the next three years.
Its subsidiaries ONGC Videsh and MRPL are likely to see a significant jump in profits from expansions or new projects. In addition to this, the company's three mega-projects in downstream industries ONGC Petro-additions, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals and ONGC Tripura Power are commissioning in 2014-15. All these together will enable the company to generate superior returns over the next three-four years.
Bharat Petroleum
Oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum's market capitalisation has jumped over 2.6 times in the past one year. Yet, it has the potential to double further in the next three-four years.

China  India in border skirmish ahead of Xi visitChina, India in border skirmish ahead of Xi visit
Shishir Gupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 15, 2014
First Published: 20:34 IST(15/9/2014) | Last Updated: 14:15 IST(16/9/2014)
Comments
The Chinese are at it again. Days before President Xi Jinping's arrival in India, possibly with promises of huge investments, his troops were locked eyeball-to-eyeball last week with Indian security forces, an incident serious enough to be escalated to PM Narendra Modi's office.
The face-off started on September 10 around the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chumar sector of eastern Ladakh, an area which has seen a big increase in Chinese activity this year. According to authoritative government sources, a mixed patrol of Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) troops saw more than 200 Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops with 12 heavy vehicles including cranes, bulldozers and a Hummer trying to level a rivulet and construct a temporary road two kilometres into Indian territory.

According to the army assessment, this was part of a PLA plan to build a road connecting Manza and Kyenjung outposts on the Chinese side of the LAC with Chepzi on the Indian side and install a surveillance camera for area domination and patrolling.
In no mood to allow this, Indian forces confronted the PLA and asked them to withdraw, resulting in no fewer than seven face-offs and even shouting matches. Some 15-20 metres of the temporary track was demolished by the Indian forces during the night of September 10 using heavy equipment.
The latest incident highlights the bitter differences between the two Asian giants despite the likely bonhomie that will mark Xi's first Indian visit. Modi is flying to Ahmedabad to meet Xi, who lands on Wednesday — incidentally the Indian leader's birthday.
Read: India says boundary issue will be discussed during Xi's visit
More than 130 Indian troops and 230 Chinese were involved in last week's standoff with additional men brought in on both sides as the situation threatened to deteriorate rapidly.  But both sides backed off, with the Chinese deploying two surveillance helicopters to confirm whether the Indian Army troopers had withdrawn to its original position. The whole incident spanned five days.
"The Chinese PLA have increased their troop strength  seven to nine times in Chumar over the past year and are involved in construction activity across the disputed LAC," said a senior South Block official, adding that between January and August, there had been 42 intrusions by the Chinese compared with nine transgressions during the same period last year.
Despite Indian efforts to exchange maps in the disputed eastern Ladakh or western sector with the Chinese side, Beijing has refused to exchange positions since 2002.

10:55 am Downgrade: Shares of Venus Remedies slumped over 15 percent intraday after Crisil downgraded its ratings on the bank facilities to D from BB+. The rating agency has stated that the downgrade reflects delays in repayment of term loan by the company driven by a stretched liquidity.
“Venus Remedies stretched liquidity is on account of the significant increase in total cost of the large debt-funded capital expenditure over the past one year and high working capital requirements. The company is undertaking capex towards setting up marketing office. The total cost of this capex is estimated to have increased by about Rs 10 to Rs 15 crore,” Crisil said.
It also added that the company's liquidity has deteriorated due to high working capital requirements reflected by inventory of about 131 days as on March 31, 2014.
10:30 am Interview: With State Bank of India cutting deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent, could other banks soon follow suit? Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of HDFC sees more banks cutting deposit rates in the next two months. He believes SBI decided to cut rates on the back of lower-than-expected credit offtake.
According to him, in another quarter or two, credit growth will take off. He says traditionally, credit offtake is highest in the fourth quarter. "I would be surprised to see sub-15 percent credit growth by FY15 end," Mistry told CNBC-TV18. According to him, if deposit rate across the system is lowered, then HDFC too will have to lower it. However, he was unable to give a timeline for a cut in deposit rates.

The market is looking listless with the Nifty hanging below 8050, down 10.35 points at 8031.65. The Sensex slips 37.06 points at 26779.50. About 1363 shares have advanced, 589 shares declined, and 66 shares are unchanged.
ONGC, Tata Motors, HDFC, Axis Bank and Sesa Sterlite are major laggards in the Sensex. Among the gainers are Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs, Hindalco, Wipro and SBI.
Asian shares held near one-month lows as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the US Federal Reserve's policy stance as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting later in the day.
Speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected have rattled many share markets around the global and supported the US dollar.
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years.

Countdown to Mars: Isro prepares for crucial Mangalyaan insertionComments
Roopa MV looks at the screen in front of her in the mission control room at the Isro Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network, as it shows a graphical representation of the Mars Orbiter Mission’s (MOM) entry into Mars.
“We have finished uploading the commands to the spacecraft, which are now being verified,” says Roopa, the spacecraft operation manager for MOM — better known as Mangalyaan.
There is visible anxiety among the scientists as the nine-month period after the launch of Mangalyaan comes to an end next Wednesday. “Anxiety will obviously be there.  But if you are well prepared for the exam, your confidence level also increases,” says M Annadurai, programme director, Isro.
Before the Mangalyaan enters Mars on September 24, Isro scientists will have to endure nail-biting prelims on September 22, when the spacecraft enters the sphere of influence of Mars, which will essentially involve ‘waking ‘ up the 440 Newton liquid apogee motor (LAM) that has been in slumber for nearly 300 days.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro.
“We are confident that it will work. But just in case it does not, we have a Plan B which involves firing the eight thrusters. This however will entail a longer firing period and will need more fuel,” he adds.
Besides the LAM firing, the fourth and the final trajectory-correction manoeuvre has also been planned for September 22.
Isro launched Mangalyaan on November 5 last year to find evidence of life on the red planet and position itself as a budget player in the global space race. If the mission succeeds, India will receive the first photographs of Mars by the afternoon of September 24.

Residents of flood-hit Srinagar hit out at government apathyComments
A banner on one of the tents in a relief camp in downtown Srinagar's Kani Mazaar that says "We don't need Indian choppers" speaks of the anger at the grossly inadequate government rescue and relief measures after the floods hit Jammu and Kashmir.
People from all walks of life have taken up the task to put their lives back together. Doctors are helping in relief camps by putting in the hours and supplying with medicines. Young men are chipping in as volunteers supplying relief material and helping sort out the traffic.
A doctor at a health camp in a mosque in Shah Mohalla area of old Srinagar, 100 metres away from the valley's most-visited SMHS Hospital, which is still five feet under water, asked "Where is the administration?"
All the patients of the SMHS hospital have been shifted to SKIMS Hospital in the suburbs of Srinagar, 12 km away. The SMHS caters to the patients from the old city and rural areas.
Makeshift hospitals
Realising that most parts of the old city were cut off from other hospitals, a group of doctors, who work at the hospital, put up at a hostel nearby decided to operate from a mosque.
The main prayer hall has been converted into a pharmacy. Five round tables in the compound function as ENT, ophthalmology, medicine, dentistry and gastroenterology departments, each attended to by specialist doctors.
Another small room has been marked as the orthopaedics unit.
 
Since Wednesday about 2,000 patients have been examined and provided free medicines. The medicines dispensed to patients have been pooled by the doctors from their samples given to them by representatives of pharmaceutical companies.
Charities and other organisations working for flood victims also provide a steady supply of medicines.
Asked what the government did for this medical outreach, the doctor, requesting anonymity, said, "Nothing. Local residents help in distributing medicines and queuing up patients. Some volunteers help with keeping records."
Mohammad Rajab, a local resident, told HT that Dr Showkat Kadla, one of the leading gastroenterologists of the valley, donated a few lakh rupees out of his own pocket for the health camp.
Charity organisations step in
Another such health camp operates out of a house vacated by its generous owner in Hyderpora area. Twenty-one doctors voluntarily work in six shifts in this camp set up by the Coordination Committee Hyderpora, which also runs one of the largest relief camps in the local mosque.
Like Hyderpora, all major relief camps - Sanat Nagar, Baghat Gurdwara, Makhdoom Sahab, Rajouri Kadal, HMT and others - where thousands of people have taken shelter, are being run by local committees and volunteers from other places.
Nazir Ahmad, one of the coordinators of Hyderpora committee, said that currently 3,200 people are living at the mosque camp, nearly half the number of flood victims a couple of days ago.
Asked about the governmental help, Nazir said that five trucks of rice were provided by the state food and supplies department for the first time on Sunday.
Vegetables, oils and spices have been coming from charities and purchases, while professional chefs have been hired by the committee to prepare meals.
On Monday, this reporter spotted a few policemen for the first time since the floods ravaged the city.
They were manning a traffic bottleneck near Magarmal Bagh in uptown Srinagar, but a larger number of civilian volunteers were directing the traffic through the congested road that leads to Batamaloo that houses the biggest bus stand.
The absence of the police has made the traffic chaotic on several other roads that remain the only link between flooded and non-flooded areas, hindering the movement of relief material and volunteers.
Death and stink
Shopkeepers in areas where the flood waters receded opened their shops to salvage whatever little they could.
Mujtaba Sheikh, a resident of Chattabal area, which has the largest concentration of the leather garment makers in the city, said, "The water has ruined everything. Nothing we recovered from the shop is worth the market."
Besides huge losses, the residents of these areas complained of the stink emanating from the flotsam and the slimy silt, awaiting fumigation and other disinfecting processes by the government.
Some of them were spraying phenyl and bleaching powder provided by relief camps or bought from the market.
But the stink, which is threatening in more than one way, comes from the decomposing carcasses of more than 315 cows that died in the flood.
Barring a few that were swept away and are rotting in nearby localities, all the heavily bloated dead cattle are laying in the sprawling farm.
"Unless disposed of quickly, these carcasses pose a grave threat to the people of Chattabal which is submerged under water. We are trying to hire a JCB to remove the carcasses," said Naqshab, a volunteer with Athrot, a charity that did a commendable work during 2005 Kashmir earthquake.
In scores of low-lying localities - Batamaloo, Qamarwari, Bemina Housing Colony, Karan Nagar, Tengpora and Rajbagh - where people apprehend flood waters will remain stagnant for long unless pumped out, relief efforts suffered because of inaccessibility.
"The ground floor of our house is three feet under water. My parents didn't leave because they think it is a hassle to go to someone's place when the entire population has suffered. So every day after doing my bit at a health camp, I wade in four-foot deep water to reach my home along with supplies," said Dr Humaam, a resident of Sir Syed Abad in Bemina.
He said volunteers of a local charity have come twice since last Tuesday and offered milk, bread and other eatables.

Modis speech to be beamed live at New Yorks Times SquareModi’s speech to be beamed live at New York’s Times Square
PTI
Reuters In this file photo, chairs in Times Square wait to be used on a cold and windy afternoon in New York.
Washington, Sept 16:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to nearly 20,000 Indian-Americans in New York during his US visit will be beamed live on the giant screens of the iconic Times Square.
His speech at the Madison Square Garden in midtown Manhattan, New York, on September 28 will be shown at Times Square with Indian American Community Foundation (IACF), organisers of the mega event, signing a memorandum of understanding in this regard with Times Square Alliance.
The speech, shown live on the giant screens of the Times Square — considered to be the hub of the New York City — would carry English subtitles.
For the audio, people can either dial a toll free number to listen to the speech live or download an app on their smart phone, people familiar with the event told PTI.
Modi is scheduled to address a 20,000 packed crowd inside the Madison Square Garden for which nearly 40,000 people had applied from across the nation.
The live telecast of the speech is expected to help some of these people to listen to Modi’s speech at the Times Square — another historic venue of the New York City.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that IACF has raised about $1.5 million for the mega event, while donations are still pouring in from across the United States. Thousands of people have made donations to IACF through its website.
Majority of the donations have come from individuals, an IACF official said on condition of anonymity, adding that they are very strict on corporate donations.
IACF is bringing out a souvenir magazine for the occasion and sponsors of the pages are being offered complimentary seats — which are a few hundred.
Such is the response that IACF has run out of those pages in the souvenir and the associated complimentary seats for the Madison Square Garden event, according to one individual familiar with the planning.
IACF has already announced that money raised in excess would be donated to charitable and non-profit organisations.
Tickets to the events are free, although prior registration is required.
Each attendee will be given a “souvenir”, a glossy full colour magazine with content that celebrates the Indian diaspora, the common values of democracy, and content about the Prime Minister and the historic election which his party won.
Cost of advertisement in the souvenir range from $2,500 to $35,000.

Mumbai, Sept 16:  
The Sensex and the Nifty plunged nearly 1.4 per cent at the closing session as investors turned wary ahead of the Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting.
Investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve's policy stance in the lead-up to the US central bank's two-day policy meeting later in the day.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex plunged 324.05 points to end at 26,492.51 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty fell 109.10 points to close at 7,932.90.

Dr Reddy's, HUL, ITC, Infosys and Sun Pharma were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Tata Power, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, ONGC and L&T.
European markets
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.5 per cent to 342.23 at 11.15 a.m. in London. The equity gauge has fallen 1.9 per cent since reaching a two-month high on September 4 amid investor concern over the Scottish referendum and central-bank stimulus policies.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures lost 0.1 per cent, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 per cent.
Investors were reluctant to dip back into the market ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, due to start today, and a referendum on independence for Scotland from the United Kingdom on Thursday.

Typhoon Kalmaegi lashes Hong Kong with strong winds  rain; approaches Chinas HainanIslandPress Trust of India | Hong Kong | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:07 pm
Hong Kong was shuttered on Tuesday as a powerful typhoon swept past the city, bringing strong winds and rain that caused flight disruptions and forced the closure of the stock market and container ports.
Typhoon Kalmaegi, packing gusts of 125 kilometres (77 miles) per hour, was centred 400 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong as it barrelled towards the northern tip of China’s Hainan island. “Although the tropical cyclone is moving away from Hong Kong, gales are expected to persist for some time,” the Hong Kong Observatory said on its website.
The Observatory hoisted the number-eight tropical cyclone warning yesterday evening and said it would remain in place until late morning today, triggering the closure of schools and businesses in the city. At Hong Kong’s airport, over 500 flights were delayed while nearly 40 were cancelled, a government statement said.
It said that there were 44 reports of fallen trees and that some parts of the city were flooded, but there were no reports of landslides. The Hong Kong stock exchange cancelled its morning trading session and said it would remain closed for the day if the number-eight warning – the third in a five-tier warning system – was still in force by noon.
Typhoon Kalmaegi swept out of the Philippines yesterday after causing chest-deep floods in some rural areas but leaving the storm-prone country largely unscathed. Six people were killed after a passenger ferry sank in the central Philippines on Saturday amid rough weather as the storm approached, the navy said.
Hong Kong was buffeted by two typhoons last year. In August 2013 helicopter teams saved all 21 crew from a cargo ship that sank as Severe Typhoon Utor passed within 240 kilometres of the city, generating waves of up to 15 metres (50 feet). And in September Typhoon Usagi – the year’s most powerful storm – caused transport chaos in the city before crashing ashore in southern China.

BJP suffers reverses in Rajasthan  losing ground in UP  close inGujaratIn Rajasthan, where BJP won all the 25 seats at stake in the Lok Sabha polls, Congress bagged Nasirabad, Weir and Surajgarh while BJP managed to win only Kota. ( File photo )
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:05 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 1:33 pm
BJP suffered a jolt in Rajasthan winning just one of the four seats and was losing ground in Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party(SP) was ahead during counting of votes in the bypolls on Tuesday, exactly four months after it swept the two states in Lok Sabha elections.
In Gujarat, ruling BJP could retain only six of the nine seats while Congress bagged two and was ahead in one. All the nine seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The BJP, however, had a reason to smile in West Bengal where it made its debut in the state assembly on its own by winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat. The bypolls for 33 seats spread over 10 states were held on September 13.
The outcome of the bypolls are seen as yet another test of Narendra Modi government’s popularity since it assumed power in May. It is also important as BJP prepares for polls in Haryana and Maharashtra next month where it hopes to oust the Congress in the two states.
In a jolt to the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan, opposition Congress wrested three Assembly seats of Weir, Nasirabad and Surajgarh from the ruling BJP which could retain only the Kota seat. BJP had won all the 25 seats at stake in the Lok Sabha polls.
“It is a huge effort by the Congress party workers and I must give credit to each and everyone especially young people,” said Congress leader and former Union Minister Sachin Pilot, who is trying to revive the party in Rajasthan.
In Uttar Pradesh, where 11 seats were at stake, ruling SP bagged the first seat winning Thakurdwara in Moradabad district where its candidate Nawabjaan defeated his nearest rival Rajpal Singh of BJP by a margin of 27,023 votes. It was ahead in eight while BJP was leading in two.
While BSP did not contest the bypoll, Congress and SP fielded candidates on all the 11 Assembly seats, whereas BJP contested on 10 and its ally Apna Dal on one. “I am grateful to the people of Uttar Pradesh for helping the Samajwadi Party,” a visibly happy Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said.
The current BJP President Amit Shah had scripted the sweep in UP helping the saffron party bag 71 seats while its ally Apna Dal got two out of the 80 seats in the politically crucial state.
The bypolls in Gujarat are also considered to be a test for new Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel under whose leadership, the elections are being held for the first time after Modi became the Prime Minister. continued…

Life slowly moving to normalcy in KashmirSemblance of normalcy emerges in flood-ravaged Kashmir
PTI Sep 16, 2014, 03.28PM IST
(A number of areas have been…)
SRINAGAR: It will be a long, long haul for the people of Kashmir to resume their normal life but a semblance of normalcy is beginning to emerge with waters receding in various places and being pumped out from several other colonies.
In a major relief, the Jammu-Sringar National Highway reopened for traffic today after remaining closed for 13 days, a development that will give a boost to relief efforts in the flood-ravaged Kashmir Valley.
The extent of damage caused by floods in Kashmir is still unfolding as people who had left their marooned houses or were evacuated are now going back to their homes to check the damage as water level is receding and dewatering has gained momentum.
Water has receded to a large extent in Jhelum river and the main flood canal, which kept overflowing for at least three days and caused unprecedented flooding in residential areas.
A number of areas have been cleared of water while dewatering is being done in several colonies of Srinagar city by pumps of ONGC and fire services.
Several areas still remain marooned, particularly in the old city, but relief material is being sent to the people who have been temporarily shifted to some safe places within the flooded areas.
People can be seen enquiring about each other's well- being and their relatives and friends whom they are meeting for the first time since the tragedy struck.
There is a rush of people travelling from one place to another to visit their relatives and friends to check out their condition.
Each one has a story about how water suddenly started entering on September 6, first in the colonies and then into their houses.
"We first thought water may rise to some level but nobody had imagined that it would come up to even 12 feet in some areas," said Mohd Shafi of Gogji Bagh area where dewatering is underway in full swing.
There are reports of thefts in the houses which had been vacated.
With many main roads being cleared of water, public transport has started plying in the areas where flooding has ended and movement of people has increased, leading to traffic jams at several places.
Some key roads, like the one leading to the airport, continue to be inaccessible due to water-logging.
The historic Lal Chowk and its adjoining areas and the vicinity of Badami Bagh Cantonment are still flooded.
Shops are also being reopened with the owners trying to retrieve whatever material has escaped the water fury.
The situation on availability of essential supplies, like vegetables and LPG which had suddenly become rare, is also improving. The power scenario is also better as also the communication network.
With life showing signs of returning to normalcy, security forces and police personnel are also back on the roads at various places.

New Delhi: Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who was summoned as a witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case, on Tuesday sought exemption from personal appearance on health grounds before a special court.
Bansal's lawyer Puneet Ahluwalia moved an application before Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma saying that the Congress leader is suffering from viral fever and would appear before the court on the next date.
"He (Bansal) is suffering from viral fever. He will appear whenever the court directs him to come," he said.
The CBI had chargesheeted 10 accused, including Vijay Singla and Mahesh Kumar, in the case last year.
#raiway bribery case #pawan kumar bansal #cash for post case #delhi court
The court, however, said that it would hear the application at 11:30 AM, as it will record statement of one other CBI witness, who has appeared before it.
Bansal, who resigned as Railway Minister after the case came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla is one of the accused along with suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and others. The court had commenced the trial in the case on Monday.
The CBI court had sent the summons to Bansal to appear before it for recording of his statement as a prosecution witness.
The court had on Monday recorded statements of Vinay Mittal, the then Railway Board chairman and senior Railway ministry official Jagmohan Rawat, who had given sanction to prosecute accused Mahesh Kumar.
The CBI had chargesheeted 10 accused, including Vijay Singla and Mahesh Kumar, in the case last year.
Paving the way for the trial, the court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based GG Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, CV Venugopal and MV Murali Krishan.
The court, while framing charges against the accused, had observed that they had prima facie entered into a criminal conspiracy to get Mahesh Kumar appointed as Member(Electrical) in the Railway Board and for that Singla was to be paid Rs 10 crore as illegal gratification.
While framing charges against the accused, the court had also observed that as per the records placed before it, Rs 2 crore was to be paid immediately and Kumar had instructed Manjunath to arrange bribe amount of Rs 2 crore through other co-accused.
The probe agency had alleged that Singla had demanded Rs 10 crore from Kumar for his appointment to the post of Member (Electrical) and it was decided between the accused that Rs 5 crore will be paid before the appointment and the rest after the job was done.
It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

Troy Costa designs dress for PM Modi's US trip, says 'let my work speak'

New Delhi: As the date of his maiden US trip is approaching, all eyes are on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from people accompanying him to his couture.
Known for experimenting with his looks, Modi had already adorned kurta with chudidaar pajami, Nehru jacket and bandhgala. He is also believed to be cautious about his outfit and has hired a Mumbai-based fashion designer Troy Costa to design his outfits.
Costa refused to divulge details about the outfit that Modi will wear and said, "I would rather like my work to speak for me, than I should do."
In a journey full of hardships, he even designed costumes for Bollywood movies in order to save money and started a small factory.
#narendra modi #us trip #modi us trip #modi dress
Costa left his house in Mumbai's Bandra at an young age of 17 to chase his dream. "My father wanted me to be a chartered accountant but I had other dreams."
In a journey full of hardships, he even designed costumes for Bollywood movies in order to save money and started a small factory. "It was a long journey. I travelled to various places, met people and learned pattern making, garment cutting, tailoring," he said.
Coming from a lower middle class family, Costa calls his journey satisfying as well as gratifying. "I am very simple guy. I come from poverty. I have even designed clothes for free for people who could not afford it," he said.
Having a clientele of who's who of the country, Bollywood stars, businessmen and bankers, he now wants to design for US President Barack Obama.
He also revealed that he loved designing for actor Hrithik Roshan. "I love designing for Hrithik Roshan. He is a thorough professional and he does not interfere in your work."
He has a team of 60 people and works for 15 hours a day and has no PR company. "I don't believe in PR company and will not hire one in the future. Your clothes should do the talking, rather than you," he said.

PTI
Tweet
Jaipur, Sept 16:  
In a jolt to the Vasundhara Raje Government, the Opposition Congress today wrested three Assembly seats of Weir, Nasirabad and Surajgarh from the ruling BJP which could retain only the Kota seat.
Out of four Assembly seats which went to polls on September 13, BJP managed to win only one, bringing down its strength in the 200-member Rajastahn Assembly to 160 from 163.
In Nasirabad Assembly constituency, Congress candidate Ramnarayan Gujjar defeated BJP’s Sarita Gena by a margin of 386 votes. Ramnarayan got 66,648 votes, while BJP’s Sarita got 66,262 votes.
Congress regained its old scheduled caste seat of Weir with its candidate Bhajanlal defeating BJP veteran Gangaram Koli by 25,108 votes.
In Surajgarh Assembly constituency, BJP’s former minister Digamber Singh, who shifted from Bharatpur and is said to be Raje loyalist, lost to the Congress candidate.
Congress’ Shravan Kumar secured 70,527 votes, while Singh secured 67257 votes. With the victory in three seats, Congress tally in the Assembly is now 24.
BJP retained Kota city with party candidate Sandeep Sharma winning the Kota-South Assembly constituency by defeating Congress candidate Shivkant Nandwana by a margin of 25,707 votes. Sharma got 84,233 votes, while Shivkant got 58,526 votes.
Twenty-three candidates were in the fray, including four each of BJP, and Congress, and one CPI-ML.
The by-polls were necessitated after sitting MLAs Sanwar Lal Jat (Nasirabad), Om Birla (Kota-South), Santosh Ahlawat (Surajgarh) and Bahadur Singh Koli (Weir) resigned from the Assembly following their election to Lok Sabha.
Immediately after the Assembly polls in November last year in Rajasthan, BJP had won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in the State in May this year.

Oil cos hold 35 paisa cut in diesel  55 paise hike in petrolOil cos hold 35 paisa cut in diesel, 55 paise hike in petrol
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 01:18 PM IST
Diesel prices, for the first time in over 5 years, should have been cut by 35 paisa on falling global rates but oil companies have decided to hold on to the rates pending a government decision on deregulation.
Under-recovery or the difference between retail price and its imported cost on diesel was 8 paisa per litre in the first half of September. The under-recovery in the second half has turned into over-recovery or profit of 35 paisa per litre.
"Naturally, when there is an over-recovery or profit, rates should have been cut but oil companies are holding the price line as they await a clear decision from the government on diesel price deregulation," an official said.
This would have been first reduction in diesel rates in over five years. Diesel rates were last cut on January 29, 2009 when they were reduced by Rs 2 a litre to Rs 30.86.
Since then rates have only increased as international oil prices climbed. Since January 2013, diesel prices have been raised by up to 50 paisa a litre every month to eliminate under-recoveries.
The official said Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is in Vietnam on an official tour and a deregulation or freeing of the fuel pricing from government control will be discussed upon his return.
Deregulation would give oil companies powers to change rates in tandem with cost like they do in case of petrol since June 2010.
Like diesel, state-owned oil companies have also not changed petrol rates which warranted a 54 paisa increase as its benchmark gasoline rates had firmed up in international market.
"There are elections in Maharasthra and Haryana and an increase now would not have been a very popular decision," the official said.
This is perhaps the first time that retail prices in India are higher than global rates.
A government statement on fortnightly under-recoveries stated that diesel under-recovery has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of Rs 0.35 per litre with effect from September 16.

Persistent Systems rises on plans to invest in AltizonPersistent Systems rises on plans to invest in Altizon
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 01:06 PM IST
Shares of Persistent Systems were up over 2% at Rs 1,369 after the company late Monday said it will acquire stake in Pune-based Altizon.
The company has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Altizon Systems Private limited, a product company focused on the Internet of Things (IoT) ('Altizon'), to invest US $ 100,000 (equivalent amount of INR) of the Company by subscribing to the equity shares of Altizon in one or more tranches from time to time, the company said in a release to the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, the company has already remitted its first tranche of investment to Altizon, the release said.
The stock opened at Rs 1,350 and touched a high of Rs 1,400 as of now. Over 27,000 shares were traded on both the stock exchanges so far.

Asian shares fall 1-month low as investors brace for FedLisa Twaronite and Hideyuki Sano     Tokyo   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 14:56 IST
Photo: Reuters
Asian shares held near one-month lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting later in the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed near one-month low hit on Monday after seven consecutive days of falls. Japan's Nikkei stock average shed 0.3 per cent, catching up after Tokyo markets were closed for a local holiday on Monday.
Speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected have rattled many share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar.
"As global bond markets show early signs of adjustment to an emerging higher interest rate environment, yield plays like the major banks, (phone company) Telstra and property trusts are losing favour," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said in a note to clients.
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years.
US central bank policymakers will also release fresh economic and interest-rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.
They have said they do not expect to raise rates until 2015, but recently strong US economic data has led Fed officials to acknowledge they may need to act sooner than they thought just a few months ago.
"At Wednesday's FOMC meeting, changes to Fed forecasts and wording that reflects expectations that rates could go higher sooner than expected should provide support" to the US dollar, strategists at Barclays said. "We also look for a modest steepening in the median policy path and more clarity on exit principles."
Wall Street had a mixed session on Monday also after weekend data showed China's factory output in August grew at its slowest pace in nearly six years, raising fears the world's second-largest economy was losing momentum.
"The fall in the real estate sector activity is affecting output. Everyone knows August is pretty weak, so if things improve in September, that would reassure investors," said Hirokazu Yuihama, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady on the day at 84.166, not far from its 14-month peak of 84.519 scaled a week ago.
Keeping pressure on the euro, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) projected lower growth for major economies on Monday and urged much more aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank to ward off the risk of deflation.
The euro was treading water at $1.2939, while the dollar edged down slightly against its Japanese rival to 107.15 yen but was still close to a six-year high of 107.39 yen touched on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note stood at 2.574 per cent in Asia, not far from Monday's US close of 2.591 per cent. It hit a two-month high of 2.651 per cent on Monday, before paring its rise on news of a drop in last month's US manufacturing output.
U.S. crude edged down about 0.1 per cent to $92.79 a barrel, pressured by the weekend data from China that cast doubt on the strength of global demand. On Monday, the expiring Brent contract for October dropped to its price since July 2012, while the new front-month contract added 0.2 per cent in Asian trade to $98.07.
Spot gold was steady on the day at $1,232.36 an ounce, supported by the Chinese data but undermined by expectations that the Fed will start hinting at interest rate hikes. On Monday, it fell to its lowest level since January.

Jet  Qatar Airways offer discounts on busine...Jet Airways, Qatar Airways offer steep discounts on business class
Anirban Chowdhury, ET Bureau Sep 16, 2014, 10.10AM IST

Abu Dhabi
(Under the same offer, one…)
MUMBAI: The price war in the skies has spread to the business class. Jet Airways and Qatar Airways are offering huge discounts in a desperate bid to take on Emirates and Singapore Airlines whose recently started A380 flights are scooping passengers in big chunks. Jet Airways is offering all-inclusive one-way business class fares to London at just Rs 28,382 from Delhi and Rs 27,727 from Mumbai, which are just onefourth of usual business class fares and almost half of regular economy fares.
The offer is effective for bookings between September 16 to 18 for travel between October 16, 2014 and July 31, 2015. Under the same offer, one can fly to Singapore in business class at just Rs 18,672 from Delhi and Rs 18,282 from Mumbai, about one-third of normal fares. Jet, however, clarified that none of these fares are valid on flights that operate via its new international hub Abu Dhabi. The airline made Abu Dhabi its global hub after selling 24 per cent stake to Etihad last year.
Earlier in the day, Qatar Airways wrote to travel agents offering an up to 25 per cent discount on all its 130 direct and indirect destinations from India on economy, business and even first classes on bookings made till September 17 for travel between September 21 and June 15, 2015. Industry experts said poor demand has forced airlines to this.
"Demand is a problem. Business class seats for many airlines have been going empty or half full at best," said an industry watcher who didn't want to be named. "What's more, the oncoming festive season never means the same spurt for business class as it does for the back end of the flight." Further, the 500-plus-seater A380 jumbo jet services started by Emirates and Singapore Airlines have made a dent in the market.
"The Emirates A380 flights are doing exceptionally well and so are the ones operated by Singapore Airlines although they have been quiet about it. Bookings are chock-full," said Manoj Samuel , director at Riya Travels, one of the biggest offline travel companies. And it's not as if Emirates is enticing passengers with its premium services alone. The airline recently wrote to travel agents offering base fares starting Rs 7,700 to destinations such as Jeddah, Doha and Bahrain.
Singapore started its daily flights from Delhi and Mumbai on May 30 while Emirates started operating a single daily A380 Mumbai-Dubai flight from June 21. Jet's business class offers are not limited to international routes. Under the scheme, a Delhi-Mumbai business class ticket comes for Rs 4,819, while a Mumbai-Bangalore ticket costs Rs 9,016.
Depending on the aircraft make, Jet Airways has anywhere between 8 and 34 premiere seats per flight. Only a miniscule percentage of the inventory would be on offer on these fares. Slowdown has forced airlines to force-fill their flights with discounts. However, slashing prices in the business class that doesn't depend on volumes is considered a desperate measure.

Obama meets Indian-American Spelling bee champsstudents
The two co-champions were accompanied by their proud parents in their interaction with Obama, who had invited them to the White House.
US President Barack Obama might be one of the world’s most powerful man but he is no spelling champion as he failed to spell two words correctly given to him by this year’s Indian—American co—champions of the prestigious Spelling Bee contest.
“He (the President) is very humble. I think he (Obama) is appropriate for the job,” Sriram Hathway from New York told PTI in an interview, moments after he and co—champion of Scripps National Spelling Bee Ansun Sujoe from Texas met the US President at his Oval Office yesterday.
The two co-champions were accompanied by their proud parents in their interaction with Obama, who had invited them to the White House.
Soon after Sriram, 14, and Ansun, 13, were declared co-champions of this year’s Spelling Bee, Obama had tweeted, .
“Congrats to Ansun and Sriram, the incredible co-champs of the #ScrippsNationalSpellingBee. You make us all proud!“.
This was for the first time since 1962 that the annual spelling contest had ended in a tie.
“The President greeted us. He is very nice. He talked to us little bit. He gave us some advice. He also spelled a couple of words for us. Like the two words we misspelled —— corpsbruder and antigropelos. He did not spell them correctly.
But it was quite fun to hear it and to talk with the President and interact,” Ansun told PTI outside the White House after his memorable meeting with Obama.
During the spelling bee competition this year both Sriram and Ansun stumbled one time with the words “Corpsbruder (a close comrade)” and “Antigropelos (waterproof leggings)” respectively. And both passed on these words to Obama for spelling.
For the Spelling bee champions, this was not a surprise.
“He (tried) to spell those two words. We got to shake hands with him. He greeted us very humbly...very welcoming. It was an honour to meet him,” Sriram said.
Obama presented the two young Indian-Americans a book on Constitutional amendments in which he wrote: “Dream, Big Dreams.”

As D-Day nears  here are five things you need to know about India s Mars Orbiter MissionComments
India's ambitious Mars Orbiter Mission, scheduled to enter the orbit of the Red Planet on September 24, is in the "pink of health" and sending vital information from 211 million km away after covering 95% of its journey, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has said.

“MOM keeps sending us vital information about the health of its various modules and measurements from sensors. This is called Telemetry signal. The telemetry has confirmed that MOM is in the pink of health,” the Isro posted on Twitter on Saturday.
“MOM uses 2.2m High Gain Antenna to send us signals from the present distance of 211 million kilometre,” it added. The Isro said the spacecraft was less than “four million kilometres” away from mars.
Here are 5 things to know about India's Mars Orbiter Mission:
1. Close to its destination
The MOM will perform the crucial Mars orbit insertion (MOI) manoeuvre when it is in the shadow of Mars. With the solar panels not receiving any sunlight, the battery will then supply all the power required for this operation.
The spacecraft is slated to enter the Mars atmosphere on September 24 around 7.30am. Scientists would undertake a challenging task on September 24 when they would restart the onboard liquid engine, which has been in sleep mode for nearly 300 days, for a critical manoeuvre of the spacecraft.
2. MOM will follow MAVEN on Mars
NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft is expected to enter the orbit around Mars on September 21, three days before the MOM.  Both the MOM and the MAVEN were launched into space last year.
3. Objectives
One of the main objectives of the MOM is to develop the technologies required for design, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. The other major objectives of the mission are:
# Deep space communication, navigation, mission planning and management.
# Exploration of Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere by indigenous scientific instruments.
# The MOM will also study the atmosphere of Mars, using a methane gas sniffer. On Earth, methane can have both geological and biological origins, so detecting it on Mars could suggest the presence of Martian microbes, Indian scientists say.
# The mission will also look at Mars' minerology, morphology and surface features.
3. The payloads
Dissambled view of the MOM spacecraft. Pic courtsey: ISRO website
The MOM carries five scientific payloads to observe the Martian surface, atmosphere and exosphere extending up to 80,000 km for a detailed understanding of the evolution of the planet. These payloads consist of a camera, two spectrometers, a radiometer and a photometer. Together, they have a weight of about 15 kg.
# Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP)
The Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP) is an absorption cell photometer. It measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from lyman-alpha emission in the Martian upper atmosphere (typically Exosphere and exobase). Measurement of D/H (Deuterium to Hydrogen abundance Ratio) allows scientists to understand the possible process of loss of water from the planet.
# Mars Color Camera (MCC)
This tri-colour Mars colour camera gives images and information about the surface features and composition of the Martian surface. They are useful to monitor the dynamic events and weather of Mars. The MCC will also be used for probing the two satellites of Mars — Phobos and Deimos. It also provides the context information for other science payloads.
The other components are Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) and  Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS).

4. India’s road to the elite club
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have been successful. A similar mission by China, which beat India to the Moon, failed in 2011. Only the US, Europe, and Russia have sent probes that have orbited or landed on the planet.
If the MOM succeeds at entering the orbit around Mars, India will be the fourth international entity credited with accomplishing that task.
5. Cost and size of the mission
The gold-coloured MOM probe is almost the size of a small car. The cost of the mission is $73 million, less than a sixth of the $455 million earmarked for the Nasa’s MAVEN.

Sensex slumps over 200 points; Nifty below 8 000Sensex slumps over 200 points; Nifty below 8,000
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 01:40 PM IST
Benchmark indices have extended losses and are trading near day’s lows weighed down by index heavyweight Reliance Industries and financials.
By 13:35 PM, the Sensex was lower by 263 points at 26,554 mark and the Nifty slipped by 90 points at 7,952 levels.
The main losers on the Sensex are Tata Steel, Tata Motors, ONGC, Axis Bank, RIL, SBI and Coal India.
Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have dipped 3% to Rs 409, extending its three-day’s fall, after the government cleared 5% disinvestment in oil major.
Among broader markets, BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have slumped by 3%.
**************************************
Updated at 12:50
Benchmark indices edged lower in early noon trades amidst weak global cues as selling in ONGC, Axis Bank, RIL and Tata Motors weighed on the indices.  At 1230 hrs, the Sensex was down 50 points at 26,766 and the Nifty slipped 19 points to trade at 8,023.
However, a mixed trend emerged in the broader markets with the midcap index flat with a negative bias and the smallcap index gained 0.3%.
For the day, investors have turned cautious ahead of the start of the two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting starting today. Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled many share markets around the globe and supported the U.S. dollar.
As a result, overseas investors have sold index futures worth 13.94 billion rupees ($228.2 million) on Monday, exchange data shows. Also, foreign funds sold cash shares worth 746 million rupees in the previous session.
Rupee was weak with the currency quoting at 61.07 to a Dollar.
Sectors & Stocks
Oil & Gas, Metal, Power, Auto and banking indices were down 0.3-1% and were the major sectoral indices in red.
However, there was some buying in Realty, Health Care, IT and the respective indices gained 0.6-1.4%.
Pharma names like Dr Reddy’s and Sun Pharma gained 1-2% and were the top gainers among Sensex-30.
IT majors Infosys, TCS and Wipro were up 0.4-1%. Wipro gained after the company’s subsidiary secured a contract from Saudi-based Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) for implementing and performing plant maintenance and project system functionality of SAP ERP application.
Bharti Airtel, Herp MotoCorp, ITC and GAIL up 0.1-0.8% rounded off the gainers list.
From the oil & gas pocket, ONGC and RIL were the top losers down 2.5% and 1% respectively and were also the top losers among Sensex stocks.
The weak trend continues in the metal names with Tata Steel and Sesa Strelite down over a percent each. Hindalco was flat with a negative bias.
Auto names like Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, M&M and Maruti were weak with the scrips down 0.1-1%.
Tata Motors dipped 1% after global wholesales in August 2014, including Jaguar Land Rover, stood at 73,524 units showing a declination of 10% from the corresponding month last year.
Coal India, NTPC, Tata Power, ICICI Bank and HUL down 0.6-2% were the other notable losers.
The market breadth was negative on BSE. 1,422 stocks declined while 1,353 stocks advanced.
Global Markets
Asian shares fell to 10-week lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve's policy stance in the lead-up to the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting later in the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.6% to its lowest level since late June. Japan's Nikkei stock average snapped a five-session winning streak to close down 0.2%, catching up after Tokyo markets were closed for a local holiday on Monday.

Markets trade lower on disappointing IIP dataBSE Sensex slipped below the 27,000-mark by falling 185.55 points in early trade. (Reuters)
Mumbai | Posted: September 15, 2014 10:31 am | Updated: September 15, 2014 12:52 pm
Benchmark indices were trading lower on Monday as industrial output showed signs of slowing down.
The BSE benchmark, the Sensex was trading 200.51 points or 0.74% lower at 26,860.53 points, while the NSE’s Nifty was trading 0.69% or 56.20 points lower at 8,049.30 points at 11:00 am IST.
On Friday, data showed that the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose 0.5% In July as against 3.9% in the previous month; slowest in four months.
Experts feel markets could see further correction. “We may see further price correction or profit booking, if the Nifty breaks 8050 in the near term. Resistance is at 8250. Support is at 8050 and below that 8000,” Standard Chartered Securities said in a note.
Among sectoral indices, the BSE Metal (-1.28%), BSE Oil & Gas (-0.77%) and BSE Capital Goods (-0.71%) were trading in the red. Among Sensex stocks, Hindalco (-2.85%), Gail (-2.23%) and Tata Steel (-1.96%) were the major losers.
Most Asian indices were trading lower. The Hang Seng (-0.73%), Kospi (-0.24%), Straits Times (-0.27%), Jakarta Composite (-0.24%) and Taiwan Taiex (-0.15%) were trading lower.
NSE Sensex tumbles over 185 points in early trade
The benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled over 185 points to dip below the 27,000-mark in early trade today on selling by funds and retail investors after industrial production growth slowed to 0.5 per cent in July amid a weak trend in the Asian region.
The 30-share barometer slipped below the 27,000-mark by falling 185.55 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 26,875.49 with metal, FMCG, power, capital goods and IT stocks leading the fall.
The index had gained 65.17 points in the previous session on Friday.
On similar lines, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty moved down by 70.95 points, or 0.88 per cent, to trade below the 8,100-mark at 8,034.55.
In the metal sector, stocks of Tata Steel fell 2.19 per cent, Sesa Sterlite Ltd shed 1.33 per cent and Hindalco lost 2.43 per cent in early trade.
Brokers said selling activity emerged largely on disappointing economic data as the country’s industrial production growth slowed to 4-month low of 0.5 per cent in July but easing retail inflation to 7.8 per cent in August from 7.96 per cent in July, restricted the fall.
Besides, a weak trend on other Asian bourses after data showing Chinese industrial output expanded in August at its slowest rate since the global financial crisis, influenced the sentiments, they said.
Among other Asian markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down by 0.75 per cent in early trade, while Japan’s financial markets are closed today for a public holiday.

Alibaba lifts IPO price rangeAlibaba lifts IPO price range to $66 to $68
By Heather Long   @byHeatherLong September 16, 2014: 8:34 AM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The word in financial circles is that Alibaba's upcoming IPO is heavily in demand. Today that speculation was backed up by the numbers.
Alibaba increased its target IPO price range to between $66 and $68 a share. That's a nice jump from earlier this month when the company was predicting a range of $60 to $66 a share .
The stock is expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "BABA" later this week, mostly likely on Friday.
The Chinese e-commerce giant founded by Jack Ma is on track to be the largest IPO in world history . At $68 a share, the IPO would raise $25 billion if the underwriters also claim their shares. That's more than Visa ( V )'s 2008 offering or Facebook ( FB , Tech30 )'s 2012 stock debut.
It's interesting to note that Visa also beat its target IPO price range by $2, and Facebook ended up selling more shares because of high demand.
Ma and other top Alibaba executives have been on a world tour speaking to "institutional investors" such as hedge funds, mutual funds and pensions to generate interest in the stock. These investors will be able to get shares at the IPO price, likely on Thursday night. Mom and pop investors won't be able to buy shares until the stock begins trading on the NYSE.
Overall, Alibaba would have a market value of around $167 billion if it prices at the high end of its range, roughly equivalent to Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ).

Modi fixes April 2016 deadline for GST launchPrint
Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:57 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given directions for Goods and Services Tax to be rolled out by April 2016.
Modi met finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday to judge how far the GST preparations have moved. According to Jaitley, the Constitutional Amendment Bill to give states and the Centre co-equal power to tax services and production can be introduced in Parliament in the Winter Session. This is the first structured meeting on the tax measure that has been held by Modi.
The big challenge in the run up to GST is setting up of a national IT framework that can act as a clearing house for the taxation of inter-state movement of goods. Finance ministry officials have told Modi that the IT framework would be up and running by 2016.
The ministry has already set up a GST cell headed by a joint secretary-level officer. This cell, which also has officers from the Central Board of Excise and Customs, will be the secretariat for the empowered committee of state finance ministers and pilot the key bills through Parliament and monitor their subsequent progress through state legislatures. The setting up of the cell shows the ministry has now begun to rush the timetable for GST roll out.
Modi is, however, reported to have advised the finance ministry to ensure that all the elements are in place, before making the announcement for a nationwide roll-out of the tax. GST will replace all domestic taxes on production and sale of goods and services.
While the finance ministry is in favour of a single rate of tax in the bill, it has conceded to the demand by the states for a band within which their levies would flourish.
The Confederation of All India Traders that has most retailers under its umbrella has argued for a single rate.
On the other hand, representatives of major industrial houses have stepped up their lobbying with the Centre to make the tax come true. But irrespective of the choice of the rates the roll out of GST will be the single most economic reform in the country.

Nifty Falls Below 8,000 Amid Broad Decline
NDTV | Updated On: September 16, 2014 15:07 (IST)
Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
BSE Sensex and Nifty came under strong selling pressure today in afternoon trade with sharp losses in oil & gas, real estate and banking stocks.
The losses in Indian markets tracked fall in global shares,which slipped to a one-month low on Tuesday as markets braced for a Federal Reserve meeting later this week. Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, was down 0.2 per cent after hitting its lowest level since mid-August earlier in the session.
The Sensex was down 242 points to 26,569 while Nifty fell 83 points to 7,958.
The selling pressure was stronger in broader markets with BSE midcap and smallcap indices falling nearly 3 per cent.
Attributing today's slump in midcap stocks to profit-taking, Nipun Mehta, CEO of BlueOcean Capital Advisors, said midcap stocks had not seen a sharp correction for a long time. He advised investors to accumulate 'quality stocks' on declines.
Overseas investors sold index futures worth Rs 1,394 crore on Monday, exchange data showed. Foreign funds also sold cash shares worth Rs 74.6 crore in the previous session.
Global markets were lower today as investors awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the US will raise interest rates.
With Federal Reserve poised to indicate monetary stance, emerging market currencies are seeing stress, said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
The rupee yesterday fell to one-month low against the dollar and today was trading marginally higher at 61.07/dollar vs its yesterday's close of 61.13.
Mr Bhasin said Nifty may find support around 7,950.
Among Nifty stocks, BPCL fell nearly 4 per cent to be the biggest loser while another oil & gas stock ONGC declined 2 per cent. In the banking and financial services pack, IDFC, Axis Bank, and PNB fell over 2 per cent.
Some defensive buying in select pharma and FMCG stocks, with Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and ITC advancing.

Watch the interview of Amit Harchekar of A PLUS Analytics with Ekta Batra & Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his reading and outlook on market and specific stocks.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Amit Harchekar's interview with CNBC-TV18.
In Larsen and Toubro  (L&T), the rising support line that has been breached at
around Rs 1,560 in today’s trading session means that stock should at least test levels of Rs 1,475-1,480 in next couple of days or maybe in next three-four trading sessions. Apart from that, if one looks into the open interest (OI) position, there has been continuous building of
short positions. The smart money is unwinding long positions and building heavily in short positions at these levels.
We are expecting a big slide in L&T as well as infrastructure index that is CNX-Infra Index and that should transform into a downside of atleast 5 percent from current levels. So from trading perspective, I would say Rs 1,590 turns out to be a very good stoploss for short
positions and we should see levels of Rs 1,480 by tomorrow or day after tomorrow.
The Bank Nifty has given a clear breakdown below 16,150. So it transforms into a
downside of at least 5-6 percent. ICICI Bank  has already breached the support of Rs 1,560 and thereafter the stock was unable to form a higher top formation. So technically we are expecting this stock to slide towards Rs 1,480. If that is taken out, you can easily expect the
selling to aggravate further towards the zone of Rs 1,390-1,400.
From a trading perspective, you can easily short at current levels with a stoploss of Rs 1,580 and we are expecting a big fall in ICICI Bank.

When winning is not enoughUpdated: September 15, 2014 00:21 IST
When winning is not enough
election
It is not often that an opposition party comes under greater pressure than the ruling party ahead of an election. However, as Maharashtra and Haryana prepare to go to the polls next month, the benchmark for performance is not the 2009 Assembly elections that voted the Congress to power, but the Lok Sabha election this year that saw a Bharatiya Janata Party wave sweeping through the two States. No one expects the Congress to return to power in Maharashtra or Haryana, but for the BJP, any showing that falls even marginally short of its vote share in the Lok Sabha election would be seen as a setback and as a reflection on the performance of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The Congress won just one of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, and in Maharashtra, in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party a total of only six of 48 seats. Clearly, the Assembly elections are for the BJP to lose. Both the Prithviraj Chavan government in Maharashtra and the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Haryana have little to show for their years in power, and the BJP must be hoping to ride on the anti-incumbency sentiment more than on the performance of the Modi government. In its first few months, the BJP-led government at the Centre did succeed in infusing hope among large sections of the people, but in terms of results on the ground there is little to show as yet.
In Maharashtra, the death of its strongman Gopinath Munde in a road accident soon after the Lok Sabha election has greatly reduced the BJP’s claim for the leadership of the alliance with the Shiv Sena. The national party performed much better than the regional ally in the Lok Sabha polls, and is therefore driving a hard bargain in the seat-sharing negotiations. But as in 1995, the chief ministership is likely to go to the Shiv Sena in the event of the alliance coming to power. The only difference is that the Sena supremo, Uddhav Thackeray, is likely to stake his claim instead of attempting to wield power through ‘remote control’ as his father Bal Thackeray did. In Haryana, the BJP seems to be in a better position if only because it does not need an ally to come to power. The party has truly outgrown its former ally, the Indian National Lok Dal, which, like the Congress, did not have a great record during its years in government. Thus, for the first time, Haryana could see a BJP Chief Minister if the Lok Sabha pattern of voting holds for the Assembly polls too. In both States the BJP could well record its best-ever performance in an Assembly election, but even so the party will have reasons for worry if the results pale in comparison to those in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Sometimes, winning alone is not enough.

RBI chief bats for more freedom to state-run banksRaghuram Rajan bats for more freedom to state-run banks
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 17:02 IST
Photo: Reuters
Batting for greater autonomy to state-run lenders, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said the government should look at them as truly "independent entities" that take their own commercial decisions and not as an extended arm of the administration.
He also said that while it was fine for the government to involve banks to further the social sector agenda, it should ensure that such schemes should be financially feasible for the lenders.
"You cannot get a mandate and cannot fund it. After all, public sector banks also have private shareholders and are not any longer an extension of the government. They should be seen as independent entities," Rajan said, addressing bankers at an annual industry conference here.
"By all means, the public sector banks are there to undertake social actions when necessary but those mandates should be backed by financial gains," he said.
RBI is working with the government on issues regarding the governance at central banks, Rajan said, adding: "We are in constant dialogue with the government, we are discussing these issues on governance improvement, etc and let us see how much progress the government and the RBI make".
He further said that RBI has forwarded the recommendations of the P J Nayak committee on corporate governance to the government for necessary action. The panel called for radical changes in the functioning of banks, including those within the top management and running of boards.
Some of its major suggestion are splitting the position of chairman and managing directors of the PSBs, giving longer fixed terms to the top management, paying them market prices as remunerations and having a transparent, merit-based system of appointments on the boards.
"We have to change the appointment process and expand the talent pool for management and boards of public sector banks, it has to be much more transparent and driven by people with strong capabilities. We have to strengthen board oversight and powers, boards have to be empowered and made more accountable," Rajan said.
The comments come amidst a slew of scandals plaguing PSBs involving top management. Last month, the CBI had arrested Syndicate Bank CMD S K Jain for allegedly receiving a bribe of Rs 50 lakh from Bhushan Steel to enhance the steel firm's credit limits.

As mining curbs bite, India offers mkt to glut-hit iron ore

As mining curbs bite, India offers mkt to glut-hit iron ore
The country may ship in up to 45 million tonnes over the next three years as home-grown iron ore output falls short of domestic steel production needs, an executive at an influential industry group said.
Post your opinion here
 
An oversupplied global iron ore market may find some relief from an unlikely source as former No.3 exporter India turns into a big importer due to a cutback in domestic production.
The country may ship in up to 45 million tonnes over the next three years as home-grown iron ore output falls short of domestic steel production needs, an executive at an influential industry group said.
India imported just 0.37 million tonnes of the steelmaking raw material in 2013/14, government data showed. But already JSW Steel , India's third-largest maker of the alloy, has said it will import 6 million tonnes of iron ore in 2014/15 against zero a year earlier.
Also Read: Iron ore glut: Are shutdowns the only way out?
"There's no option but to import to meet the shortfall. We're looking at between 10 and 15 million tonnes every fiscal year over the next three years," Basant Poddar, vice president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the only industry group for mining firms in the country, told Reuters by phone.
"The mine closures all over India, starting from Karnataka, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand, have created a massive disruption to supply," Poddar said.
Mining in the key iron ore states of Karnataka and Goa was banned in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following a crackdown on illegal mining by the Supreme Court and the government. Several mines in top producing Odisha state and in Jharkhand too were closed this year following government-imposed restrictions on the renewal of mining licenses.
While the bans have since been lifted, delays in restarting mining operations in Goa and Karnataka and the latest mine closures in the other states have limited local iron ore supply.
The disruptions have cut India's iron ore production to 152 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, from about 218 million in 2009/10, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.
The prospect of higher demand from India comes at an opportune time for global iron ore miners, whose margins have been shrunk by a 40 percent slump in iron ore prices this year.
Iron ore fell to $81.90 a tonne last week, its lowest since September 2009.
The bulk of India's imports may come from Australia and South Africa, said Poddar, and unlikely from Brazil where shipments are usually made in big vessels. "Indian ports are not geared to handle large vessels," he said.
But the potential import volume won't be enough to absorb the total projected global surfeit. Morgan Stanley, which sees a global surplus of 79 million tonnes this year doubling to 158 million tonnes in 2015, expects the price to drop to $70.
In addition, any relief from Indian demand may be temporary, as the domestic shortage is due to government policy measures that could eventually be reversed.
BUREAUCRATIC ROUTE
For the present, resuming operations has been slow due to the long bureaucratic route to renew mining leases, said Poddar.
Only 22 mines out of 122 that are eligible to restart in Karnataka have resumed operations, said Poddar who owns Mineral Enterprises Ltd which has five mines in the state that have a combined capacity of 1.2 million tonnes but have remained shut. Mines in Goa have not reopened.
In Odisha, around a third of 56 iron ore mines are still closed and in Jharkhand, the third biggest producer in the past fiscal year, 12 out of 17 mines are shut.
India used to be the world's No.3 iron ore exporter until higher costs along with the mining bans slashed shipments by 85 percent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years.
Amid the shortage in local supply, iron ore prices in India are defying the global weakness.
In Odisha, 63 percent grade iron ore would cost about $105 a tonne, including taxes and the royalty, to export, way above the current global market price of $67-$68, said Dhruv Goel, managing partner at industry consultancy SteelMint.
But miners make a profit of $15-$20 a tonne selling the same grade to local steelmakers, said Goel.
"It is certainly profitable to sell in the domestic market."

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  Venus Remedies slumped over 15 percent intraday on Tuesday after Crisil downgraded its ratings on the bank facilities to D from BB+. The rating agency has stated that the downgrade reflects delays in repayment of term loan by the company driven by a stretched liquidity.
“Venus Remedies stretched liquidity is on account of the significant increase in total cost of the large debt-funded capital expenditure over the past one year and high working capital requirements. The company is undertaking capex towards setting up marketing office. The total cost of this capex is estimated to have increased by about Rs 10 to Rs 15 crore,” Crisil said.
It also added that the company's liquidity has deteriorated due to high working capital requirements reflected by inventory of about 131 days as on March 31, 2014.
 
According to Crisil, the ratings reflect Venus Remedies’ comfortable financial risk profile, marked by a healthy net worth and strong debt protection metrics. The ratings has also factored in the company's strong presence in the high-value critical care segment and the healthy growth in its domestic and export sales. These rating strengths are partially offset by VRL's working-capital-intensive and small scale of operations in the overall formulations market.
In early September, Venus had tied up with Mylan for marketing antibiotic drug in three European countries. It also has an agreement with Israel-based generic drug maker Teva for selling anti-cancer drug in Canada.
 At 10:42 hrs Venus Remedies was quoting at Rs 330.00, down Rs 48.50, or 12.81 percent on the BSE.

Railgate: Bansal seeks exemption on health ...exemption
(Pawan Kumar Bansal today…)
NEW DELHI: Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal , who was summoned as a witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case , today sought exemption from personal appearance on health grounds before a special cour
Bansal's lawyer Puneet Ahluwalia moved an application before Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma saying that the Congress leader is suffering from viral fever and would appear before the court on the next date.
"He (Bansal) is suffering from viral fever. He will appear whenever the court directs him to come," he said.
The court, however, said that it would hear the application at 11.30 AM, as it will record statement of one other CBI witness, who has appeared before it.
Bansal, who resigned as Railway Minister after the case came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla is one of the accused along with suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and others.
The court had commenced the trial in the case yesterday. CBI court had sent the summons to Bansal to appear before it today for recording of his statement as a prosecution witness.
The court had yesterday recorded statements of Vinay Mittal, the then Railway Board chairman and senior Railway ministry official Jagmohan Rawat, who had given sanction to prosecute accused Mahesh Kumar.
CBI had charge sheeted 10 accused, including Vijay Singla and Mahesh Kumar, in the case last year.
Paving the way for the trial, the court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based G G Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C V Venugopal and M V Murali Krishan.
The court, while framing charges against the accused, had observed that they had prima facie entered into a criminal conspiracy to get Mahesh Kumar appointed as Member(Electrical) in the Railway Board and for that Singla was to be paid Rs 10 crore as illegal gratification.
While framing charges against the accused, the court had also observed that as per the records placed before it, Rs two crore was to be paid immediately and Kumar had instructed Manjunath to arrange bribe amount of Rs two crore through other co-accused.
The probe agency had alleged that Singla had demanded Rs 10 crore from Kumar for his appointment to the post of Member (Electrical) and it was decided between the accused that Rs 5 crore will be paid before the appointment and the rest after the job was done.
It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

Rupee recovers from 1-month low on dollar sellingRupee rebounds from 1-month low on dollar selling

Bucking a weak trend in stocks, the Indian rupee on Tuesday recovered from one-month lows to end with a modest gain of eight paise at 61.05 against the Greenback on fresh dollar selling by exporters.
Persistent capital inflows also aided the rupee rise while the dollar index was almost stable against a basket of six major currencies ahead of the outcome of two-day policy meeting by the US Federal Reserve starting from Tuesday.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced strong at 61.02 a dollar from previous close of 61.13, a one-month low.
It was later trapped in a narrow range of 61.01 and 61.1425 before settling at 61.05, a net rise of eight paise or 0.13 per cent.
On Monday, it had plunged 48 paise, or 0.79 per cent, its biggest fall in more than five weeks.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, after tumbling by 244.48 points or 0.90 per cent on Monday, tanked 324.05 points or 1.21 per cent today to end at three-week lows.
FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $79.57 million on Monday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Rupee appreciated today even as local equities closed down by over one per cent. Rupee movement was aided by lower trade deficit in August. Dollar index rally slowed down today, which further supported the rupee. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.50 to 61.50."
"The Indian rupee traded on a cautious note today taking cues from its Asian peers. However, the data showing narrower trade deficit in the month of August on the domestic front helped," India Forex Advisors said.
Yesterday after markets closed, government data showed that trade gap in August stood at $10.83 billion.
In forwards market on Tuesday, premium closed weak on fresh receipts by exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in February moved down to 228.5-230.5 paise from 231-233 paise previously.

Govt to decide on diesel deregulation after...Government to decide on diesel deregulation after state polls
By Reuters | 16 Sep, 2014, 06.28PM IST
"The diesel under-recovery has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of Rs 0.35 per litre with effect from Sep. 16," a government statement said. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India will decide on whether to end government control of diesel pricing after elections in two states next month, an oil ministry source said.
India currently controls prices with subsidies under a scheme originally intended to help the poor and rein in inflation, but local prices are now higher than global rates, making a case for a cut in retail prices.
"The diesel under-recovery (goal) has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of 0.35 rupees per litre (less than a cent) with effect from Sep. 16," a government statement said on Tuesday.
A rising subsidy bill and strained public finances in a sluggish economy forced India's Cabinet in January 2013 to allow state retailers to marginally raise diesel prices each month.
"We tinker with diesel prices once a month...There is a case for a cut in diesel prices towards the end of the month but a decision is yet to be taken on that," the source with direct knowledge of the matter said. "Decision on diesel deregulation will be taken after state elections."
Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said India should use this opportunity of easing global oil prices to eliminate diesel subsidies at the earliest. [O/R}
The states of Maharashtra and Haryana, with chief ministers from the opposition Congress Party, will go to the polls on Oct. 15, offering Prime Minister Narendra Modi the chance to chalk up gains after his general election triumph in May.
Under India's election rules the government can not make any major policy decisions during an election campaign which may directly impact voters.
The oil ministry will have to seek a cabinet nod for deregulating diesel prices, two ministry sources said last month.
Government controls over pricing of liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene and diesel led to revenue losses at state fuel marketing companies - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp.
"For oil marketing companies, it is quite positive because 55 percent of their sales are diesel and positive margins on diesel definitely helps their earnings," said Rohit Ahuja, Mumbai-based analyst at ICICI Securities.
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Oil India Ltd
and GAIL (India) sell crude and related products at a hefty discount to partly compensate for losses of retailers, who also get some cash subsidies from the government.
Ahuja said benefits for ONGC and Oil India would come with a lag as the government might look at easing their burden through a "subsidy sharing formula or a fixed number". Currently these companies' subsidy share varies from quarter to quarter.
Deregulation could bring the return of private firms such as Reliance Industries and Essar Oil to retail sales. Such companies do not receive federal support for selling diesel at discounted rates and currently sell via state refiners despite having their own sales infrastructure.

RBI limiting reliance on foreign debt: Raghu...Important to have FII debt limits, says Raghuram Rajan

(Rajan's comments came…)
MUMBAI: Cautioning about reliance on foreign flows, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan today advocated for continuing with caps on overseas investments in debt.
"...we are limiting our reliance on foreign debt. It is important we keep it this way and manage the economy in way that is careful and that is circumspect," he said during an address at the 55th foundation day celebrations at the Somaiya Vidyavihar.
The Reserve Bank had in July raised the Foreign Institutional Investors' debt limit by USD 5 billion to USD 25 billion, after the investments started nearing the $20 billion threshold.
According to reports, the additional headroom is almost exhausted and FIIs' debt investments in the country are already nearing the USD 25 billion, leading to expectations that there might be an increase in the cap again.
Rajan said that the country has benefited from the foreign flows into the country, but advised caution, while dealing with such investments, which chase the best yields.
"We have to be careful about this money because if we say, 'this is wonderful, they all like us, we follow tremendous policies and that's why we got this money', and we go and spend, we run large current account deficits based on these foreign borrowings," he said.
"But this foreign borrowing cannot be taken for granted. At some point these investors will find greater usage of their money back home and they want to go out once again," he added.
Rajan, however, said that through various measures we have been successful in "substantially" containing the current account deficit (CAD), which narrowed to 1.7 per cent in FY'14 from an all time high of 4.8 per cent in the previous fiscal.

Expect order book to improve marginally by Q2-end: ThermaxI want to be positive and give full credit to the new govt. There is nothing that came negative from their side.
MS Unnikrishnan
MD
Thermax
Discussing the business outlook, MS Unnikrishnan, MD of Thermax , said he does not expect things to change on ground over the next 2-3 months.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, on the sidelines of HSBC summit, Unnikrishnan said the capital utilisation has not reached at reinvestment level in India yet. Though there has been some traction in small-ticket industries like food processing, large-ticket investments will take time to draw corporate interest, he feels.
Thermax’s current order book stands at over Rs 5,000 crore and the company expects it to improve marginally by the end of Q2.
It has been seeing a build-up in order inflows from South East Asia and expects to grow faster in those markets along with in West Asia and Africa. The company is also open to technology tie-ups in international markets, Unnikrishnan said.
Below is the transcript of MS Unnikrishnan’s interview with Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18.
Anuj: In terms of business outlook, have you seen any change on ground since the new government has taken over and if yes do you think that is something that would reflect in the results of company maybe over the next two quarters or so?
A: Other than the sentiment reversal where negativity is absent and positivism is prevailing, at the ground level action wise we are yet to be seeing traction. Expecting that in the next two or three quarters things would be changing for the entire economic spectrum is a little too unfair to ask because 100 days or maybe a quarter, two quarters is insufficient to turnaround. 
However, I want to be positive and give full credit to the new government that there is nothing which is come negative from their side. The way they have been able to manage the entire governance and also the policy spectrum is very positive which is making the entire industry and the decision makers think another time as to why did I not invest earlier. 
However, the current situation is capacity utilisation within the country is not reached a level of reinvestment level that is the reason for you not seeing a ground level action. However, the small ticket size items in some of the conventional industries where in pharma, food processing I am seeing traction happening. However, the last ticket size investments sentiments alone are insufficient. You are talking about hard cash so it would take time for it to be reversed. However, the direction is positive.
Ekta: While the direction is positive, just to get a couple of numbers or maybe an outlook for Q2 FY15, in Q1 FY15 particularly the margins were impacted because of delays in terms of execution of few projects though the costs where booked in the quarter gone by. Is that the same case for Q2?
A: I won’t give a guidance but certainly not the same. It will be any improved result that you should be expecting in the Q2 because one time expenses or which are not generic in nature will not continue; that is for the company. 
Ekta: Could you give us a sense in terms of what your current order backlog is and how much of that would you be executing at this point?
A: We are still continuing at above Rs 5000 crore of order book with us and depending up on how the numbers are going to pan out for the current quarter which will be getting over in another 15 days, I would expect it to be slightly improved at the end of the quarter. Good parts of them are executable in current year but equal numbers are also getting transferred under the FY16 financial year. 
Anuj: Last time you had told us that you want to increase your overseas presence. Are you working towards getting any incremental orders and if yes if you could tell us the geographies that you are working on? 
A: On the product side of the company we have fairly good traction happening in the South East Asian markets. The projects which I mentioned earlier in the African and Middle Eastern continent there are enquiries under the stage of negotiations. So, depending upon how we are able to conclude them I should be able to declare the numbers as we progress. However, whatever we promised in terms of international traction, is online, is on the course.
Ekta: Could you give us more details in terms of your total revenue pie, how much would now come from domestic, how much from international? How much of a mix do you expect it to change towards maybe by the end of FY15 as well as what the margins would be for both the businesses?
A: We started at 10 percent international at the start of the century 2000. We reached up to almost 20 percent by 2010 and then we upped the target to 30 percent international and 70 India and I am happy to say that we are almost there right now. So, next challenge is going upwards of 30. It maybe not be practical only organically so one has to have a mixture of inorganic and organic combination to play to ensure that we ranch it up target level of 30-40.
International business, when you export out of India you get a better margin but when you conduct international businesses locally, the margins are the local margins. So, in developed world engineering industry of our kind will never make a double digit margin. So, we are working towards that to happen. 
Exports versus domestic, when you do from India, international exports do give you a higher margin. Certainly it is a higher margin because the currency advantage, cost arbitrage advantage put together can make you fetch better margin.
Ekta: I did hear you mention inorganic. What is the plan in terms of your inorganic opportunities, in terms of any sort of acquisition that you would be interested in, geographies, throw some colour for us on those details if you can?
A: Three markets that we expect to grow faster are in South East Asia, Middle East and Africa. Unfortunately, you don’t find very attractive marriageable partners in that part of the world so easily because they are not developed economies to the extent we are. So, there it is hard challenge for anybody to be locating inorganic target accepting for the fact that facilities can be looked into for inorganic growth which will accelerate your growth pace in that area. 
The real ones are in the European continent but there as I mentioned to you, you will get distressed assets which why should Indian companies go and buy in that part of the world and the area that we belong to because energy is well managed in the developed world, environment is well protected. So, these are the two areas that we are in. 
So, our aim in those developed markets could be primarily for technology acquisition, not for market entry. We are always on the lookout for good technology which are transpondable to the markets that we are looking forward to. We come across something, why won’t we do that. We are a zero debt company; we have got cash on the balance sheet. So, if there is something right available, certainly we will say yes for it.

HC rejects PIL for CBI probe into alleged land deals of Robert Vadra's firms

(Earlier, the bench had reserved…)
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today dismissed a PIL seeking a court-monitored CBI probe into various land deals allegedly entered into by Robert Vadra's firms.
"The petition is dismissed," a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice R S Endlaw said.
Earlier, the bench had reserved its order on the PIL filed by advocate M L Sharma in his personal capacity.
To satisfy the bench on the issue of jurisdiction of this court, the lawyer had said that the cause of action partially had arisen in Delhi as various offices and constitutional bodies such as the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) and Ministry of Urban development are located here.
Sharma had told the court that he had already given a representation to CBI, but it neither registered an FIR nor lodged even a preliminary enquiry in the case "which relates to huge loss caused to the exchequer during 2005 to 2012".
He had also submitted a copy of a Supreme Court judgement which has directed police authorities to register an FIR "mandatorily" if the allegations disclose the commission of a cognisable offence.
The plea had also sought a probe into grant of licences to change land use of agricultural plots purchased by Vadra's companies in Gurgaon.

Street talk: How a two-year-old broking firm is hitting daily turnover of Rs 4 000 crore todayHow a two-year-old firm is hitting a daily turnover of Rs 4,000 crore today

(Shrinivas Viswanath, and…)
If the lives of start-up founders are about sweat, blood and tears, no one told the trio at Mumbai-based discount broking firm RKSV.
"To be honest, we have had a considerably smooth ride," says Raghu Kumar, one of the three promoters, briefly describing in a matter-of-fact tone their two-year journey as entrepreneurs. He means it.
Rather, he prefers to let the numbers speak. Within two years of starting operations and largely operating in a dull market, RKSV is now clocking daily turnover of Rs 4,000 crore.
That's about 1.3 per cent of total turnover of NSE, in a business where even the leaders are at 5-6 per cent. For the US-bred trio — Raghu, brother Ravi and their friend Shrinivas Viswanath — it was a move by the Indian capital market regulator to allow algorithmic trading that encouraged them to dip their toes in Indian waters.
And when the Securities and Exchange Board of India allowed the direct market access (DMA) facility in April 2008, which gives investors direct access to a stock exchange's trading system, they decided to put in both their feet.
Prior to 2009, their only connection with India was the occasional visit to meet relatives. "DMA was the reason we came to India. We saw a lot of opportunities and wanted to explore them," says Raghu, a University of Illinois graduate in actuarial science and finance.
The concept of algorithmic, or high frequency, trading was not alien to them. Before coming to India, the brothers were active in the US foreign exchange markets between 2006 and 2008.
But, in October 2008, they had to wind up after the global financial markets imploded; trading opportunities had dried up, liquidity had shrunk and spreads had widened enough. By then, however, they made a killing of about $2 million, giving them the self-belief — and the capital — to explore other business ideas.
Against The Tide
In 2009, Raghu and Ravi, along with Viswanath, a computer engineer in New York, shifted base to India. Although the Indian markets were alien to them, funding a venture was never a problem.
Raghu and Ravi spent the first two years trading with their own money, which helped them gauge the pulse of the market here. Meanwhile, they secured a membership to the Bombay Stock Exchange, which had slashed its fees significantly to rope in more members.
After making good money in the two years in proprietary trading, they saw stockbroking as a natural progression. But to set up shop in India, at the time they did, was a contrarian call.
Disappointed by the previous government's tardy attitude towards business and economic policies, business confidence in India had hit its nadir. Foreign investors were wary and several nonresident Indians (NRIs) were returning to countries where they held passports. The broking industry was bleeding too. While competition in institutional broking business was fierce, retail investors had deserted the markets.
But there was still a segment of market participants that was underserved: traders, for whom high brokerage costs was making it difficult to make money. "We realised there were many traders who did not have cheaper options to trade," says Kumar. "What shocked us was the number of branches that retail brokerages had, which is not the case in the US."
It did not take too much time for RKSV's business to pick up as its relatively-older rival Zerodha had taken the plunge by then. Although there was little that RKSV could do to hold an edge in terms of technology, it managed to attract clients by launching the 'unlimited trading model', where traders can transact for as many times at a fixed cost.
Currently, RKSV has about 20,000 clients. They are serviced by about 50 employees from its office in Mumbai's emerging financial services hub, Bandra-Kurla Complex. Raghu said the firm is looking to double its client base to about 40,000 in 2014-15. That's not bad for a two-year-old, first-generation firm.

Another actor sues Google over 'Innocence of Muslims' movie trailer

A second actor has sued Google over a movie trailer called Innocence of Muslims that mocked the Prophet Mohammad and led to riots in 2012, six months after a US appeals court ruled for another actor and ordered the film taken off YouTube.
Gaylord Flynn said he has received death threats and fears for his life while Google continues to provide its users with access to the film through pirated content websites known as torrent sites, according to his lawsuit, filed on Friday in a California federal court.
Flynn, who is also suing the filmmaker, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, said Google had refused to block access to the movie, even though a 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel last February ordered it taken off Google's video-sharing website, YouTube.

#google #innocence of muslims
In that case, actor Cindy Lee Garcia sued Google for an injunction, claiming she owned the copyright of her performance. Garcia also said she received death threats.
Google argued at the time that an injunction amounted to restricting speech in violation of the US Constitution. The company is demanding a rehearing from the full appeals court.
A representative from Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Flynn's lawyer, Cris Armenta, who also represented Garcia, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Innocence of Muslims sparked waves of anti-US unrest in Egypt, Libya and other countries in 2012, and coincided with an attack on US diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya.
Flynn said the filmmaker concealed the true nature of his production. He said he thought he was hired for a movie called Desert Warrior and never consented to be in a "religiously oriented film nor in one that propagates hate speech."
Flynn, like Garcia, said he did not sign a release and his own copyright interests remain intact, according to the complaint.
The case is Gaylord Flynn v. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, Google Inc et al, in the US District Court for the Central District of California, No. 14-01901.

Chinese city of Chongqing creates a smartphone footpath

Beijing: Taking a cue from an American TV program, the Chinese city of Chongqing has created a smartphone sidewalk lane, offering a path for those too engrossed in messaging and tweeting to watch where they're going.
But the property manager says it's intended to be ironic - to remind people that it's dangerous to tweet while walking the street.
"There are lots of elderly people and children in our street, and walking with your cellphone may cause unnecessary collisions here," said Nong Cheng, the marketing official with Meixin Group, which manages the area in the city's entertainment zone.
In this photo taken Saturday, September 13, 2014, residents look at a sign with the words "China's First Cellphone Lane" explaining the use of a lane which separates those using their phones as they walk from others in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality. (AP Photo)
#china #smartphones
Meixin has marked a 50-metre (165-foot) stretch of pavement with two lanes: one that prohibits cellphone use next to one that allows pedestrians to use them - at their "own risk."
Nong said the idea came from a similar stretch of pavement in Washington DC created by National Geographic Television in July as part of a behaviour experiment.
She said that pedestrians were not taking the new lanes seriously, but that many were snapping pictures of the signs and sidewalk.
"Those using their cellphones of course have not heeded the markings on the pavement," she said. "They don't notice them."

About 30 percent of the gold that we are purchasing today is under gold on lease scheme
S Subramanian
CFO
Titan
With gold prices falling to 8-month low, it is no more an attractive investment as the demand for gold coins and bars has been falling since last couple of months. However, the demand for jewellery is steady and more stable than last year, says S Subramanian, CFO, Titan .
 
He believes second quarter will be a bumper quarter for the company and is confident of this festive season being better than the previous one with the discretionary demand for gold picking up slowly but steadily.
"We do expect the festival season this year to be better than last year for sure, so there is a lot of hope and also walk-ins have been better, not just in the jewellery segment but in watches as well. So, confidence is back with the consumer," he adds.
According to Subramanian, 30 percent of gold being purchased is under gold on lease scheme and the remaining is being hedged internationally.
Right now the company has no plans to set up stores in International markets but is looking at export consignments as a new business opportunity.
The sales of the company are expected to return to normalcy post second quarter of FY15, he adds.  
Titan has commissioned a new stainless steel watch case plant in Coimbatore. Subramanian believes the new plant will help the company reduce its costs for stainless steel cases which have been rising substantially.
"The costs have been going up substantially and we have been importing most of these from China and their costs have gone up; both the labour cost and the rupee devaluing over the last few years has meant that the input cost has gone up substantially," he adds.
The set up of the Coimbatore plant is expected to cost the company around Rs 75 crore. The new plant will manufacture around 1 million cases per year and the capacity is expected to scale up to 2 million cases annually.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: You have recently commissioned a new stainless steel watch case plant in Coimbatore. How does this add to the prospects of the watches division and what was the rational for this new plant?
A: This is a stainless steel case plant. Most of the higher end watches, the more expensive ones, Rs 5,000 and above would come in stainless steel cases. So far we have been importing most of these cases.
There are very few countries in the world which have stainless steel case plant because it’s a much evolved production system and fairly sophisticated as well. It has been something which we have not been doing in any. So, we have been importing a lot of these.
The costs have been going up substantially and we have been importing most of these from China and their costs have gone up; both the labour cost and the rupee devaluing over the last few years has meant that the input cost has gone up substantially.
We planned this a few years back that we need to be depended on making our own stainless steel cases for our watches and this is inline with a fairly large investment and thanks to the technical help from Seiko Epson, we are able to go ahead and get this commissioned.
We are about to start the production but more important is we have commissioned and it would start producing in the next couple of months.
Q: Gold prices are at eight-month low now. How is that impacting demand especially in the light of the upcoming festive season and also since gold as an asset class is now becoming little less attractive than earlier, are you seeing lower investment demand and higher demand for jewellery?
A: In terms of gold as an investment, it’s not as attractive as pure investment and that’s reflected by the much lower sales of coins and bars that we have seen over the last so many months. So that is a fact.
However, as far as jewellery is concerned, the demand is fairly steady and it’s more stable now this year than it was last year. Last year we saw so much of volatility in demand and we had bad Q3 which was the festive season, was really bad, of course that was preceded by the gold rush in Q1.
This year is seeing a far more steady demand. In our own case you would see this quarter as a bumper quarter because we had to close golden harvest scheme and therefore, most customers were those customers who were enrolled into the scheme had to close and buy jewellery. To that extent, you would find this quarter exceptional for us but things would come back to normalcy from the next quarter.
We do expect the festival season this year to be better than last year for sure, so there is a lot of hope and also walk-ins have been better, not just in the jewellery segment but in watches as well. So, confidence is back with the consumer. So, discretionary demand is something which is picking up slowly but steadily.
Q: On the recently concluded golden harvest scheme, could you tell us the proportion of customers who redeemed as well as the percentage of customers who have bought jewellery because that would determine the incremental jewellery sales we will see in Q2?
A: It is a fact that a very large portion of people have bought jewellery which is a very good sign because we did gave them the opportunity of redeeming in cash along with return as well this time because we had to foreclose this while it was also at our control we still thought we should be fair with the customer. But the very gratifying fact has been that they have chosen to buy jewellery and that is a very good sign for us and which is one reason why we are seeing that demand situation is definitely better.
Q: What is the proportion of gold on lease in the system now and international hedging which started last quarter? Is it entirely complete?
A: About 30 percent of the gold that we are purchasing today is under gold on lease scheme. The scheme got reintroduced over the last three-four months.
We started gold on lease but it was available only for 30 percent of our purchases, for the rest 70 percent we are hedging predominantly abroad other than the exchange gold that we are hedging in the local commodity exchange; exchange in the sense that when we get it from customers, other than that we are hedging outside India. So a large chunk of our gold is been hedged outside India.

Asian shares fall 1-month low as investors brace for Fed policyLisa Twaronite and Hideyuki Sano     Tokyo   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 14:56 IST

Asian shares held near one-month lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting later in the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed near one-month low hit on Monday after seven consecutive days of falls. Japan's Nikkei stock average shed 0.3 per cent, catching up after Tokyo markets were closed for a local holiday on Monday.
Speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected have rattled many share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar.
"As global bond markets show early signs of adjustment to an emerging higher interest rate environment, yield plays like the major banks, (phone company) Telstra and property trusts are losing favour," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said in a note to clients.
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years.
US central bank policymakers will also release fresh economic and interest-rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.
They have said they do not expect to raise rates until 2015, but recently strong US economic data has led Fed officials to acknowledge they may need to act sooner than they thought just a few months ago.
"At Wednesday's FOMC meeting, changes to Fed forecasts and wording that reflects expectations that rates could go higher sooner than expected should provide support" to the US dollar, strategists at Barclays said. "We also look for a modest steepening in the median policy path and more clarity on exit principles."
Wall Street had a mixed session on Monday also after weekend data showed China's factory output in August grew at its slowest pace in nearly six years, raising fears the world's second-largest economy was losing momentum.
"The fall in the real estate sector activity is affecting output. Everyone knows August is pretty weak, so if things improve in September, that would reassure investors," said Hirokazu Yuihama, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady on the day at 84.166, not far from its 14-month peak of 84.519 scaled a week ago.
Keeping pressure on the euro, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) projected lower growth for major economies on Monday and urged much more aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank to ward off the risk of deflation.
The euro was treading water at $1.2939, while the dollar edged down slightly against its Japanese rival to 107.15 yen but was still close to a six-year high of 107.39 yen touched on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note stood at 2.574 per cent in Asia, not far from Monday's US close of 2.591 per cent. It hit a two-month high of 2.651 per cent on Monday, before paring its rise on news of a drop in last month's US manufacturing output.
U.S. crude edged down about 0.1 per cent to $92.79 a barrel, pressured by the weekend data from China that cast doubt on the strength of global demand. On Monday, the expiring Brent contract for October dropped to its price since July 2012, while the new front-month contract added 0.2 per cent in Asian trade to $98.07.
Spot gold was steady on the day at $1,232.36 an ounce, supported by the Chinese data but undermined by expectations that the Fed will start hinting at interest rate hikes. On Monday, it fell to its lowest level since January.

UP bypoll: People have defeated communal forces  says AkhileshYadavWe want to thank the people that they have supported the Samajwadis and the direction in which the SP wants to take the state. Said Yadav.
Press Trust of India | Lucknow | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:16 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:33 pm
Buoyed by SP’s performance in the by-elections, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said people of the state have shown the door to divisive and communal forces.
“People of the state have given a befitting reply to the communal forces and have expressed intention that they need harmony and brotherhood,” he said.
The Chief Minister thanked people of the state for “failing” the communal powers. “Communal forces tried to gain mileage by spreading hatred, but the people by their power of vote defeated them,” he added.
Akhilesh said the SP Government in the state only concentrates on development works and has been working in this direction from day one and after by-polls it would continue to work more responsibly. “We want to thank the people that at such a time, they have supported the Samajwadis and the direction in which the SP wants to take the state,” Akhilesh said.
Senior cabinet minister Shivpal said that the people have voted against communal forces and for development. “In Lok Sabha elections communal forces lured the people, but now they are aware with the facts,” he said.
SP has won the Thakurdwara Assembly seat and was leading in eight others, while the BJP was ahead in two seats in Uttar Pradesh where bypolls were held for 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat.

Final norms for on tap bank licences this fi...Final norms for on tap bank licences this fiscal: RBI
PTI Sep 16, 2014, 02.21PM IST
(The Reserve Bank had earlier…)
MUMBAI: Final guidelines for on tap universal banking licences will be issued in the current fiscal, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor R Gandhi said here today.
"We are working towards issuing guidelines for full service banks on tap. I cannot give you a timeline, but it will be in this financial year," Gandhi told reporters on the sidelines of an annual banking event organised by FICCI and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) here.
The Reserve Bank had earlier issued draft guidelines for payment and small banks and is in the process of finalising the final norms.
"Now the public comments (on small and payment banks) have been received and we are factoring in them. Soon we will come out with the final guidelines on these two," Gandhi said.
On corporate governance reforms in the public sector banks, he said the central bank has already recommended certain suggestions to the government.
"Based on various committees, including the P J Nayak Committee recommendations, we have made certain suggestions to the government such as segregation of chairman and managing director posts and a separate committee for appointment of directors on board of PSU banks, and they are taking up the final decision," Gandhi said.
Replying to a query on lowering government's holding in public sector banks below 50 per cent as recommended by P J Nayak committee report, Gandhi said the government has to take a view on how much they want to invest in these banks.
On the liquidity coverage ratio norms which RBI announced in June this year, he said the banks as of now are in compliance with the norms and will be able to achieve the target.
"Banks are compliant as of now on LCR norms till 60 per cent as they hold excess government securities. They are comfortable in reaching the target," he said.
The RBI had said the LCR will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with a minimum requirement of 60 per cent from January 1, 2015 and reaching minimum 100 per cent on January 1, 2019.

02:20pm Interview
NCC is planning a Rs 600 crore (Rs 598.7 crore to be precise) rights issue, allotting 29.93 crore shares at Rs 20 per share. It will issue 7 shares issued on rights basis for every 6 shares held. The company’s board has approved raising upto Rs 650 crore in April 2014.
YD Murthy, executive vice president of finance at NCC says the rights issue will most likely open on September 29, and close on October 7.
The funds raised from the company's proposed rights issue will be used to repay its short-term debts, de-stress the balance sheet, raise the company’s ratings that can in turn help lower finance cost, says Murthy. At the moment, the company is working with Crisil for its ratings.
NCC has a consolidated debt of Rs 3700 crore. Its debt has been increasing due to an increase in working capital. Murthy says the rights issue will help lower working capital concerns. He adds that post the rights issue, the company’s net worth will go up to Rs 3000 crore and debt will come down to Rs 2000 crore from Rs 2,600 crore on a standalone basis. He expects to see debt reduction by this October end or November.
02:10pm Elections
BJP suffered a jolt in Rajasthan winning just one of the four seats and was losing ground in Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party (SP) was ahead during counting of votes in the bypolls today exactly four months after it swept the two states in Lok Sabha elections.
In Gujarat, ruling BJP could retain only six of the nine seats while Congress bagged two and was ahead in one. All the nine seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The BJP, however, had a reason to smile in West Bengal where it made its debut in the state assembly on its own by winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat. The bypolls for 33 seats spread over 10 states were held on September 13.
02:00pm Equity benchmarks extended losses ahead of FOMC two-day meet that will begin today. Investors will closely watch the outcome of this meeting as they expect some hint about interest rate hike.
The Sensex dropped 207.66 points to 26608.90 and the Nifty fell 73.25 points to 7968.75 while the BSE Midcap tumbled close to 3 percent and Smallcap plunged 3.2 percent.
About three shares declined for every share advancing on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Despite the slip in the Nifty and the Sensex, Mehraboon Irani of Nirmal Bang Securities does not think it is going to be a deep correction.
He with the US Federal Reserve meet round the corner, markets tend to become volatile. But he does not see the Fed hiking rates anytime soon. “It is going to be many quarters away according to me,” he told CNBC-TV18.
He believes the next positive triggers for the market will be the state elections, divestment dues and the gas price hike.
Bharti Airtel and Dr Reddy's Labs bucked the trend, up over a percent followed by ITC, Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma and Hero Motocorp with 0.3-0.6 percent.

State Bank of India cuts fixed deposit rates to 8.75% from9%State Bank of India increases its deposit rates for maturities between 180 to 210 days by 25 bps to 7.25%. (AP)
New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:24 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 2:26 pm
India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday revised fixed deposit (FDs) rates in select maturities and thus becomes the first lender to cut rates below 9%.
In a regulatory filing, the bank said it has lowered interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 8.75% from 9% for deposits maturing between one to three years, with effect from Thursday September 18.
The bank, however, increased its deposit rates for maturities between 180 to 210 days by 25 bps to 7.25%.
Speaking to a news channel, SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said that they have excess of liquidity at present and there is not enough demand to match it.
“The reason for the revision is the fact that we have a lot of liquidity, we have not seen that kind of credit demand and therefore this is basically adjusting our asset liability management (ALM),” Bhattacharya said.
SBI had last revised its term deposit rates in July when it cut bulk term deposit rates by 25 bps and retail term deposit rates by 50 bps for certain tenures.
The bank had cut bulk term deposit rates (Rs 1 crore and above) by 25 bps for tenures of 7-60 days to 6.25% and 61 days to less than one year to 6.75%. For retail term deposits (less than Rs 1 crore) the downward revision in rates affected deposits that mature between 7-179 days, which has been revised to 7% from 7.5%.
That apart, private sector lender IndusInd Bank recently cut interest rate on savings account to 4.5% per annum from 5.5% on daily balance up to Rs 1 lakh from September 1. However, it kept the interest on accounts that maintain a daily balance of more than Rs 1 lakh at 6%, the bank said on its website.
SBI shares were trading at Rs 2,610, marginally down about 0.5% on the BSE at 12:18 hours.

Global markets were lower today as investors awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week for clues on when the US will raise interest rates.

Rupee sees best single-day gain in a monthforeign exchange market
The Indian rupee posted its biggest single-day gain in nearly a month on Friday as custodian banks and corporates sold the greenback aggressively, although broader sentiment remained cautious ahead of key events, including retail inflation later in the day.
India is due to post consumer price inflation data later on Friday, with a Reuters poll expecting it have eased to 7.80 percent in August from July’s 7.96 percent.
Caution also remains ahead of a key week for global risk, with the Federal Reserve set to hold its policy meeting amidst concerns it may move to raise interest rates, while Scotland is due to hold its independence vote.
For the week, the rupee fell 0.5 percent, its worst weekly fall since the week to August 1, with the domestic share market in a consolidation phase following a recent string of record highs, most recently on Monday.
“There was aggressive dollar selling by custodians and corporates today,” said Vikas Babu Chittiprolu, a senior foreign exchange dealer with state-run Andhra Bank.
“The rupee will remain in a 60.50 to 61.30 broad range next week. On the CPI, market expects a slightly lower number than in July,” he added.
The partially convertible rupee ended at 60.65/66 per dollar, 0.5 percent stronger than its Thursday’s close of 60.9250/9350. This is the rupee’s best single-day performance since August 14.
Traders will continue to monitor movements in other Asian currencies and shares for near-term direction.
Overseas funds have bought a net $32.90 billion worth of debt and shares so far this year, but turned mild sellers in shares over the previous two sessions.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.03 while the three-month contract was at 61.62.

Disease threatens as Kashmir flood waters turn fetidDisease threatens as Kashmir flood waters turn fetid
By By Fayaz Bukhari | Reuters –  Mon 15 Sep, 2014

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Indian emergency workers on Monday battled to prevent waterborne diseases like cholera from spreading as fetid water swilled around the Kashmir valley more than a week after the worst flooding in more than a century.
More than 75,000 people were still in partly submerged homes in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city of more than a million people, where roads have been transformed into stagnant canals strewn with wreckage, trash and dead animals.
"Floating carcasses have become a big source of worry with most houses still waterlogged. We are struggling to get in touch with government health officials," said Abul Syed Rahman, who owns three hotels in Kashmir.
Altaf Hussein, a pediatrician who was treating flood victims in improvised camps, complained of shortages of life-saving drugs, intravenous fluids and sanitary products.
"We need aerial fumigation ... as these waters can cause waterborne diseases, including cholera," said Hussein.
Both the Indian and Pakistani sides of the disputed Himalayan region have seen extensive flooding this month with Srinagar particularly hard hit. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands are homeless.
Authorities say the cost of damage in Indian-administered Kashmir may run into billions of dollars.
There were signs the relief operation was gaining traction as authorities brought in heavy-duty pumps to evacuate water from low-lying residential areas, including two from state-controlled Indian oil company ONGC.
The federal government delivered 25 water filtration plants with the capacity to filter 400,000 liters a day, and 13 tonnes of water purification tablets.
More than 200,000 people have been rescued in the past eight days and communication networks partially restored.
"Finally, we are seeing some government officials trying to restore basic services. In the last eight days we had no help from the government," said Alam Wani, a Srinagar bank official.
Wani's two-storey house has been partially submerged since the onset of torrential rain, forcing him to move into a mosque with his family of eight.
HOSPITALS FLOODED
Hospitals were flooded when the Jhelum river burst its banks and staff scattered around the city were unable to get to work. Doctors were running out of medicines and surgical equipment as they struggled to provide emergency services in makeshift medical centers.
"Our medical headquarters is totally under water. It is very difficult to deal with critical cases. Thousands of patients need antibiotics and diabetics require insulin," said doctor Hina Rahman.
Another doctor, Nisar Bhat, said he had treated more than 30 patients suffering from gastroenteritis in the last 24 hours.
Doctors said flood waters had damaged expensive equipment like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray machines.
People have been coming in with respiratory infections and gastric problems, said Zubair Khwaja, a doctor who normally works at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences but has been volunteering with the Muslim Students Board, a group that runs a religious school in Srinagar.
Municipal authorities said they had started collecting rubbish from pools of stagnant water and the fire department was using 20 fire engines to pump out waterlogged areas.
With acres of stagnant water remaining in the city, Khwaja warned the risk of waterborne diseases would increase. "You can smell the air," he said.

Sakshi madrasa remarks his personalviewNew Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 1:32 am
By Liz Mathew
BJP on Monday distanced itself from party MP Sakshi Maharaj’s remarks that the madrasas were making the students “terrorists” and “jihadis”, and said it is the “job of the intelligence and investigation agencies to find who train terrorists.”
“Terrorism is an international problem. Terrorism has no religion and it is against humanity, peace and development. Our government has zero tolerance towards terrorists and terrorism. But it is the job of the intelligence and investigation agencies to probe who train them,” BJP national media convener Srikant Sharma said. “What Sakshi Maharaj said is his personal view. The party completely disassociates itself from his statement,” he added.
BJP distancing itself from the Unnao MP’s comments assumes significance in the wake of party’s poll plans for Maharashtra. In the past, the party has not always been so stridently opposed to the kind of statements Sakshi Maharaj or other saffron leaders made. In fact, in 2005, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had said it was a serious concern that instead of excellence, some madrasas are increasingly producing extremists. The party had also not reacted when Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s Praveen Togadia repeatedly demanded a ban on madrasas to save India from terrorism.
The party leadership, which had been silent on controversial comments on “love jihad”, has been learnt to be upset with Maharaj as he made the comment “without any provocation”.
The ruling party had not condemned nor distanced itself from a series of comments on ‘love jihad’ made by its leaders in Uttar Pradesh during the run-up to the September 13 byelections. In fact, it maintained that the comments were “reaction to the ground realities” in Uttar Pradesh where it said the state-ruling Samajwadi Party has tried to create “communal polarisation”.
Now, that BJP is gearing for Assembly polls in Maharashtra, where Muslims constitute 13.4 per cent of the total population and can influence the elections, the party does not want to be seen making statements that would hurt the minorities.
“The party’s official stance against (Maharaj’s) statement is a clear message that we do not want to entertain it,” admitted a party leader. According to a party leader, the leadership is likely to caution its “hot-blooded” leaders and put up a moderate face of BJP as it “is preparing for elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir”.
In its first Budget presented in July, the BJP-led government has allocated Rs 100 crore for madrasa modernisation.

While private sector companies in the list posted record profits in FY14, this wasn't the case for state-owned ones. While ONGC posted its highest profit in FY12, Coal India , SBI and NTPC did so in FY13.
The 10 companies account for one-third of the total profit earned by ET500 companies in FY14, the same as five years ago. Companies in the oil and gas and IT sectors posted half the profit earned by the top 10, less than the 60% of five years ago.
ITC is the only fast moving consumer goods company in the top 20 profit-making companies. At the 15th position, MTNL , which has reported losses in the preceding five fiscals, is the only accidental entrant in the list on account of a write-back of provisions on account of pension liabilities and amortisation of spectrum costs.

Public sector undertakings have traditionally been high dividend payers and, therefore, it is not surprising that three of the top five dividends paying companies are PSUs. Companies from high cash-generating sectors such as IT (TCS and Infosys) and FMCG (ITC and HUL) are prominent members of the top 10 club.
Pharma company Strides Arcolab is an accidental entrant in the top 10 club as it distributed the proceeds of the sale of its injectables business. While Coal India paid double the dividend that it paid in the previous year, HUL was the only company in the top 10 club whose dividend paid dropped 30% over the previous year.
The dividend paid hardly changed over a year ago in case of ONGC , NTPC and Reliance Industries . It grew more than 45% in case of IT majors TCS and Infosys . The top 10 dividend paying companies contributed 45% to the total dividend paid by ET500 companies for fiscal year 2014.

Govt to decide on diesel deregulation after state pollsGovt to decide on diesel deregulation after state polls, says oil ministry source
Nidhi Verma     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 13:49 IST

Govt will decide on ending government control on diesel pricing after elections in Maharashtra and Haryana in October, an oil ministry source said, even though local prices of the fuel are currently higher than the global rates, making a case for a cut in retail prices.
This is perhaps the first time that retail prices in India are higher than the global rates due to a sustained monthly rise in local prices since January 2013.
"We tinker with diesel prices once a month.There is a case for a cut in diesel prices towards the end of the month but a decision is yet to be taken on that," the source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
"The diesel under-recovery has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of 0.35 rupees per litre with effect from Sep. 16," a government statement said on Tuesday.

Rights issue will help lower working capital concerns: NCC
YD Murthy, executive vice president of finance at NCC says the rights issue will most likely open on September 29, and close on October 17.
Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
NCC  is planning a Rs 600 crore (Rs 598.7 crore to be precise) rights issue, allotting 29.93 crore shares at Rs 20 per share. It will issue 7 shares issued on rights basis for every 6 shares held. The company’s board has approved raising upto Rs 650 crore in April 2014.
YD Murthy, executive vice president of finance at NCC says the rights issue will most likely open on September 29, and close on October 17.
The funds raised from the company's proposed rights issue will be used to repay its short-term debts, de-stress the balance sheet, raise the company’s ratings that can in turn help lower finance cost, says Murthy. At the moment, the company is working with Crisil for its ratings.
NCC has a consolidated debt of Rs 3700 crore. Its debt has been increasing due to an increase in working capital. Murthy says the rights issue will help lower working capital concerns. He adds that post the rights issue, the company’s net worth will go up to Rs 3000 crore and debt will come down to Rs 2000 crore from Rs 2,600 crore on a standalone basis. He expects to see debt reduction by this October end or November.
He says at the moment the company has a good order book. He believes NCC will be able to ramp up execution, going ahead.
NCC is looking at multiple ways to pare debt – via stake sale in two of its BOT projects and continued monetization of its land bank.
Below is the verbatim transcript of YD Murthy's interview with Sumaira Abidi and Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18.
Sumaira: Your rights issue is almost concluded. Post that now there will be some bit of pairing off of debt that you will do with the proceeds over there. However, post that what are your other asset monetisation plans? I think there is some real estate subsidiary from where you could be expecting something, there is some stake sale in NCC Power. Can you take us through what the plans now are?
A: The rights issue is on, we have got Sebi approval. September 19 is the record date and the issue is likely to open on September 29 and it will close on October 17. We are expecting to receive almost Rs 600 crore of rights issue money minus the expenses, all the funds will be utilised to a large extent towards debt reduction of the parent company and that will stabilise our operations, that will help us to improve our working capital cycle and also that will help us to improve our rating. All these factors will help us to save on financing cost mainly the interest cost on nearly Rs 500-600 crore of debt reduction will be substantial in a full year.
We should be of the range of Rs 65-70 crore and added to that the rating upgrade that we are expecting and also what is happening is that now we are at Rs 2600 crore of debt and with the rights issue money the networth will go beyond Rs 3000 crore. The debt on the books of the company will come down to around Rs 2000 crore. So, the debt equity is improving substantially to around 0.6 or so and that will help us in negotiating better terms for the debt that we are having with the consortium bank and that will definitely result in saving of interest and commission on bank guarantee.
Coming back to other asset monetisation, we are having a long-term view of all these things and already we have Himachal Sorang, we have almost exited and power plant at Krishnapatnam also we have signed the documents with Sembcorp and once the coal ministry approval is received those monies will also be available to the company. We have got a good order book and going forward we will be able to ramp up our execution and concentrate on order booking and project execution and look at improvement in the topline.
Reema: You spoke about interest rate reduction of Rs 65-70 crore; that will be in FY16 and not FY15, right?
A: FY15, six months around Rs 30-35 crore will be there because the funds are expected in the third week of October at least for five months that benefit will be available to us.
Reema: In FY16 it will be the entire Rs 70 crore and you are planning to reduce debt to Rs 2000 crore by when?
A: Most of the rights issue money is going towards the debt reduction only by November it should happen or maybe even end of October.
Reema: You spoke about ratings upgrade. Could you tell us from which rating agency and by how much would your interest cost then come down purely on account of this rating? Can you give us some more details on the ratings upgrade that you are expecting?
A: That is difficult to say because they are independent agencies; they do their own background checks and all that. Definitely once my debt equity and my net worth increases and upside is definitely possible. Right now we are dealing with CRISIL as for our rating is concerned.
Sumaira: You spoke about your order book. Some of the newer orders that you have I believe you have taken at higher margins. What are the margins there and what will it do for your margins. Could you scale up that 9-10 percent mark in FY15?
A: Last year the order accretion was quite robust. We had almost Rs 10,000 crore of fresh order as compared to our business plan of Rs 6600 crore in that year. So, there was more than 35 percent growth in the order accretion in that year compared to the business plan and also because the competitive intensity has come down to a large extent we were able to bag orders with better margins. Last year we reported an EBITDA margin of 6.6 percent and going forward we are confident that we will be able to improve the margins.
Reema: When do you expect it to receive the approval from the coal ministry to transfer coal linkages with respect to the NCC power project?
A: The process is on. They are working on the policy paper regarding stake sale in independent power producers (IPPs) where the coal linkages are given by the government agencies. That is likely to happen in the next three-four months.
Reema: Could you tell us so far in this quarter, what would be the quantum of order win is totally?
A: I will not be able to tell you anything but it is going to be good.
Reema: Better than Rs 600 crore that you saw in Q1?
A: That is Q1, I am talking about Q2. We haven’t got the numbers so far. It will take some time.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is limiting the country's reliance on foreign debt and will continue to do so, governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
"We are limiting our reliance on foreign debt. It's important we keep it this way," he said during a speech to university students.
Rajan's comments came at a time when foreign institutional investors have nearly exhausted their USD 25 billion allocation in government debt, leading to expectations that India would raise limits soon.
Rajan also said the RBI had reduced the current account deficit "substantially".
The current account deficit for April-June stood at USD 7.8 billion, sharply higher than USD 1.3 billion in January-March but narrowing from USD 21.8 billion a year ago.

New Delhi: The government cleared 21 foreign investment proposals on Tuesday, but turned down the proposal of Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL) to raise the foreign stakeholding in the company beyond the current 74 per cent.
The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), which is headed by finance secretary Arvind Mayaram , had considered 35 proposals. The ones cleared include those of Bharti Shipyard, Verizon Communications, IndusInd Bank and ANZ Capital.
A finance ministry official confirmed that the proposal of SSTL was rejected. "The company is awaiting an official communication from FIPB, only then would it be possible for Sistema Shyam Teleservices to respond on the matter," a company spokesperson said in an email.
ET had earlier reported that Russian conglomerate Sistema JSFC's proposal to raise its stake in its Indian unit beyond 74 per cent has hit a hurdle with the telecom department saying that the plan will need Reserve Bank of India approval as it has been structured like an overseas debt deal and not as FDI .
According to a government official, the company has also not specified the extent to which the foreign holding would be raised. Sistema JSFC holds 56.68 per cent in SSTL, the Russian government 17.14 per cent and other foreign entities 0.13 per cent.

Results in some places not according to expectations:BJPPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:35 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 2:36 pm
Facing reverses in some seats in the Assembly bypolls, the BJP on Tuesday said the results in some places were not according to its expectations and people voted on local issues.
“We have won in many places and at some places, the results have been not up to our expectations… These by-polls have been fought over local issues and in places where the state governments have full majority,” BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.
Putting up a brave face, he said there was good news also for the party as “the lotus has blossomed in West Bengal.” Hussain said the by-poll results should not be seen in the national or state perspective as the elections have been fought by the party over local issues.
Asked to comment on party’s prospects in the coming Haryana and Maharashtra elections, he said the BJP will win those elections as they are being held for forming new governments to run these states.
Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Maharashtra and Haryana next month. BJP suffered a jolt in Rajasthan, winning just one of the four seats and was losing ground in Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party(SP) was ahead during counting of votes in the bypolls exactly four months after it swept the two states in Lok Sabha elections.
In Gujarat, ruling BJP could retain only six of the nine seats while Congress bagged two and was ahead in one. All the nine seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The BJP, however, had a reason to smile in West Bengal where it made its debut in the state Assembly on its own by winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat. The bypolls for 33 seats spread over 10 states were held on September 13.

Supreme Court allows Reliance Power to return land for DadriplantReliance Power has been allowed to return around 956 acre of land acquired by UP govt for letting the company set up its gas-fired power plant in Dadri.
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:30 pm
The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Reliance Power to return around 956 acre of land acquired by Uttar Pradesh government for letting the company set up its ambitious gas-fired power plant in Dadri.
The court disposed of a batch of petitions after accepting the company’s request to permit it give back the land. Taking on record this plea, the court held the petition to be infructuous and said all the parties were at liberty to approach appropriate authorities to claim damages.
The land has been mired in legal wrangles, with the Allahabad High Court on December 5, 2009, quashing a state move to acquire the land through an emergency clause. This clause had allowed the state to waive a provision obligating the authorities to seek objections from farmers before acquiring their land.
The judgement made it mandatory for the state government to go back and get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from each seller or get them to return the compensation received to the government.
Reliance Power and the state government had both contested the high court ruling.
After all arguments in the case were completed and the top court reserved its verdict just a fortnight ago, Reliance Power submitted its affidavit, saying it would have set up the project had there been no legal issues with the land acquired for the project.
“But the acquisition was challenged even before the project could start,” Reliance Power said. The company also claimed that in the 10 years since the project was envisaged, it has become more difficult to get a regular supply of natural gas.

TRS retains Medak LS seat by a huge margin
R. Avadhani
The Hindu A triumphant TRS candidate Kotha Prabhakar Reddy, who defeated his nearest Congress rival V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy in the byelection to the Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana.
TOPICS
election
TRS candidate Kotha Prabhakar Reddy trounced his nearest Congress rival and former Minister V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy by 3,61,277 votes. Although, the margin of victory was less compared to that of Mr. Rao, TRS leadership attributed it to the lower turn out.
The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) continued its sway over the Medak parliamentary constituency by winning the September 13 byelection by a huge margin of 3,61,277 votes.
Medak parliamentary constituency Returning Officer and District Collector Rahul Bojja declared the result as counting ended after 22 rounds. TRS candidate Kotha Prabhakar Reddy trounced his nearest Congress rival and former Minister V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy. The BJP-TDP combine candidate Toorpu Jayaprakash Reddy, came a poor third.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddy got 5, 71, 800 while the Congress nominee was way behind with 2,10,523 votes and the BJP, 1,86,334 votes. Right from the first round, the TRS nominee maintain an unassailable lead over the two rivals in all the seven assembly segments – Sangareddy, Patancheru, Narsapur, Medak, Siddipet, Dubbak and Gajwel (represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao).
With each passing round, Mr. Prabhakar Reddy, an influential transport company owner’s, lead swelled in every segment. The outcome not only enthused Mr. Prabhakar Reddy, who fought his maiden election but the rank and file of the TRS. The party had taken the election as a prestige issue after the Congress and the BJP-TDP combine fielded fairly seasoned politicians.
By-poll was necessitated following resignation of Mr Chandrasekhar Rao consequent to his taking over as the Chief Minister of Telangana State on June 2. He had won the Assembly election from Gajwel assembly segment as well as Medak LS seat. In the general elections, Mr. Rao had won with a majority of 3.92 lakh votes. He polled 6.57,492 votes against his nearest rival P.Sravan Kumar Reddy (2,60,463) and BJP’s Ch. Narendranath (1,81,177).
Although, the margin of victory was less compared to that of Mr. Rao, TRS leadership attributed it to the lower turn out. While the polling per centage in the general election was 77 per cent it declined to 67.45 per cent in the by-poll held on September 13.
TRS had gone to the voters projecting the Congress and the BJP-TDP candidates as opposed to the creation of separate Telangana State. The party in particular targeting the BJP nominee Jayaprakash Reddy, whose animosity against TRS and its pro-statehood stand, was well known. Incidentally, Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy had won his first assembly election on TRS ticket in 2004.
Congress and the BJP-TDP candidates made a vain bid to target the TRS Government's 100 days in office and exposing its failure to fulfil one single poll promise. However, the voters continued their loyalty towards the TRS, which is still seen as the party that had achieved Telangana for them.
Speaking to reporters after the declaration of results, Mr. Prabhakar Reddy said he would strive hard to achieve the dream of rebuilding Telangana State. Celebrations broke out in Hyderabad and across Telangana districts with TRS cadres bursting crackers and distributing sweets.

Arvind Kejriwal slams BJP for not taking decision one-rickshawsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:17 pm
Attacking the BJP for “policy paralysis”, the Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday threatened to undertake an agitation if a decision on the banned e-rickshaws was not taken in the next 10 days.
The AAP leader, who met Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, said that if a quick decision was taken, the government could have prevented a ban on e-rickshaws.
“The Congress government suffered from policy paralysis and did not take any decisions. The BJP government too is facing the same problem,” he said. Criticising the minister, Kejriwal said that Gadkari had announced in his rally that a policy decision would soon be taken on the matter of e-rickshaws.
“Nitin Gadkari had addressed a rally in Ramlila Maidan and assured that the ministry would come up with a policy on this within a month. But nothing has happened until now and over 2 lakh families of e-rickshaw drivers are starving. “If there is no policy on this in next days then we will launch an agitation,”  Kejriwal said after his meeting with the minister.
The AAP leader claimed that when he asked Gadkari about the assurance he made at the rally, the minister responded that they could not be implemented as they were not legal in nature. “He (Gadkari) said that his ministry later told him that those announcements could not be implemented as they were not legal. Strange!” Kejriwal tweeted.
Gadkari said that a notification for plying auto rickshaw will be issued in next 10 days. The High Court has banned plying of e-rickhshaws on road.
“A notification pertaining to e-rickshaw has been issued. We will put it on website and seek peoples opinion on it in the next ten days and will solve the problem immediately thereafter. We will issue (final) notification for plying of e-rickshaws after 10 days,” the minister had said.
Kejriwal said that a call by Gadkari was also made to Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi in this matter as many e-rickshaws have been confiscated by the cops.
“The e-rickshaw drivers have complained that many parts of their vehicles have gone missing. The Police Commissioner has assured that if the drivers and owners make a request for release of the vehicles before the court, the cops will not oppose the same,” the AAP leader said.

Specs: 4.5-inch (854x480p, 218ppi) capacitive touch screen | Mediatek 1.3 GHz quad core processor | 1GB RAM | 134mm height, 68mm width, 9.3mm depth and 140g weight | 2MP front and 5MP rear camera | 4GB internal memory with 32GB expandable slot |  Wifi 802.11 b/g/n, 3G, 1700 mAh  battery
Price: Rs 6,499
Design: As far as looks go, the A1 looks like a lot of other Micromax phones in the same price bracket. The big difference is the detailing around the camera, a brushed metal right that looks quite classy. There is an Android One logo towards the lower end of the rear flap, and I guess we will have to get used to seeing this more more devices in the near future. The phone is slim in a sturdy sort of way and feels a bit heavy in your hands. It is thinner than the new Moto G for instance and that is a good place to be. Another interesting feature is the rear speaker grille, which is something I have not encountered recently.
Display: I was a bit put off when I heard FWVGA when this phone’s screen specifications were being announced. But the 854x480p IPS display is anything but disappointing, especially at this price. The colours are vibrant and the icons sharp. Reading is not at all an issue. The screen sort of blends into the black bezel at the top and bottom and this seems like a good way to hide the hard edges that dominate many screens of affordable smartphones. The screen has good viewing angles and it is not such a problem using it in the sun.
Performance: This is what the Android One phones will be all about. I have used the phone only for a day, and this verdict is based on that 24-hour experience. But there is no doubt that the hardware and software gels wonderfully well on this phone. So there not even a semblance of a hesitation when you flip through the homescreen, open new apps or switch from one to another. This feels good.
Software: The OS is the purest form of Android. So there is nothing new for users who know their way around Android. All the Google apps come pre-loaded and you will enjoy using Google Now and maps on this phone. I have never seen Maps load so fast. Voice recognition also worked really well. One big difference in comparison to other Android phones is the Google Camera which replaces the native clicker. But you can start using it only when you have an SD card inserted. All photos are also backed up to Google Photos by default.
Storage: The phone has 4GB internal memory. The brand new out-of-the-box phone had 2GB available for use. It would be a good idea to invest on a 8GB card to start with, but then Amazon is offering it for free with A1 at the moment.
Camera: The native Google Camera app is something that sets this phone apart. The camera results are good, though far from being great.You can do everything you would on a regular camera app.
However, the fact that there is no gallery app and just Google photos can make it a bit confusing. Also, the phone does not save pictures on the device and you need an SD card for the camera to even start working.
Rear camera flash test. Right image: with flash. Left image: without flash.
Connectivity: I faced no issues with connectivity and got a good signal even in our basement office.
Verdict: The Micromax Canvas A1 and the entire Android One experience it offers is very good. The phone promises a kind of confidence not easily achievable in this price range. However, for users the tough choice will be in figuring out whether to opt for this phone or something else that offers similar or better specs at a slight different price.

Sensex, Nifty Fall Sharply; Midcap, Smallcap Stocks Crack
NDTV | Updated On: September 16, 2014 17:09 (IST)
Rupee Edges up to 61.87 Against Dollar
BSE Sensex and Nifty fell over 1 per cent amid sharp losses in oil & gas, real estate and banking stocks.
The losses in Indian markets tracked a fall in global shares, which slipped to a one-month low on Tuesday as markets braced for a Federal Reserve meeting later this week. Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, was down 0.2 per cent after hitting its lowest level since mid-August earlier in the session.
The Sensex ended 324 points lower at 26,492 after suffering its biggest one-day fall in over a month. Nifty fell 109 points to end at 7,932.
The selling pressure was stronger in broader markets with BSE midcap index falling 3.4 per cent while smallcap index slumped nearly 4 per cent.
Imtiyaz Qureshi, co-founder and director of Investeria Financial Services, said Nifty has support at 7,914 levels and if this level is breached on a closing basis, there could be another 100 point correction in Nifty.
Selling pressure by foreign investors also weighed on Indian markets. Overseas investors sold index futures worth Rs 1,394 crore on Monday, exchange data showed. Foreign funds also sold cash shares worth Rs 74.6 crore in the previous session.
With Federal Reserve poised to indicate monetary stance, emerging market currencies are seeing stress, said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin. The rupee yesterday fell to a one-month low against the dollar and today ended marginally higher at 61.07.
Among Nifty stocks, Tata Power fell over 6 per cent to be the biggest loser. BPCL fell nearly 5 per cent while heavyweights ONGC and Reliance Industries fell over 2 per cent. In the banking and financial services pack, Axis Bank and PNB fell over 3 per cent.

Buy Sun Pharma  Mahindra Ugine: Pritesh Mehta02:30 pm
Pritesh Mehta of IIFL told CNBC-TV18, " Sun Pharma is a typical uptrending counter which was in the process of correction for last two weeks. In fact it has found support at 61 percent retracement and the same level also coincides with the 50 day moving average. For last three days the stock has been taking support hovering on the same support which is a strong sign. So buy Sun Pharma for a target of Rs 830."
" Mahindra Ugine was a classic example for range breakout. For last ten weeks the stock was locked in a trading range between Rs 355 and Rs 470. Now the stock has infact given a break out last week and despite its weakness in broader markets it is continuously trading over the same. It is again a good sign, so buy Mahindra Ugine for a target of Rs 530," he said.

New Delhi, Sept 16:  
Terrorism, piracy, trafficking of drugs and women and children will top the agenda at the conference of Home and Interior Ministers of SAARC countries to be held in Kathmandu on September 19.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who will lead the Indian delegation to the conference, is expected to flag issues like cross-border terrorism and dismantling of terror infrastructure operating from some SAARC nations.
Issues like suppression of terrorism, maritime security, piracy, narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, combating corruption, and cyber crimes will be discussed threadbare at the ministerial-level and official-level meetings of the law enforcement authorities of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries.
Other issues to be discussed at the conference include mutual assistance in criminal matters, trafficking of women and children and promotion of child welfare in South Asia, an official release said.
Before the ministerial-level meeting, immigration authorities of all SAARC nations will meet on September 17, and Secretaries of Interior/Home will meet on September 18.
The fifth meeting of the SAARC Secretaries of Interior/ Home was held at Maldives in September 2012.

HIL MD resigns; shares tank over 8%HIL MD resigns; shares tank over 8%
R Yegya Narayanan
Coimbatore, Sept 16:  
Abhaya Shankar, Managing Director of HIL Ltd, a CK Birla Group company based in Hyderabad, has resigned.
Shares of HIL are down by more than 8 per cent in the wake of the announcement, though the market itself was weak because of the mixed outcome in the by-elections held.
In a communication to the stock exchanges, HIL said that Abhaya Shankar today submitted his resignation as Managing Director and Director of HIL during a board meeting. The board has accepted it and said that Abhaya Shankar would be relieved from the post on September 22. He has held the job since February 2008.
HIL said that till a replacement is made, the management committee consisting of senior managers will run the day-to-day operations of the company. It was not clear as to what led to the decision of Shankar to quit from his post.
Interim dividend
In a notification to the stock exchanges on September 5, HIL had said that its board of directors will on September 16 consider declaration of interim dividend for the financial year 2014-15. The board of directors in fact declared an interim dividend @ Rs 10 per share.
HIL Ltd’s board of directors on July 18 had decided to seek approval from the shareholders by way of special resolution through postal ballot, subject to the approval of the Central Government, waiver of recovery of excess remuneration of Rs 116.90 lakh paid to Abhaya Shankar for the financial year 2013-14.
The company said in its communication that the payout had exceeded the limits prescribed in Part II of Schedule XIII read with Section 198, 309 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. This special resolution was declared as having been approved by the shareholders with requisite majority by the company on August 30.
HIL, known earlier as Hyderabad Industries Ltd, is a well-known player in the building material solutions segment.
HIL shares shed 8.31 per cent or Rs 56.95 to Rs 628 on the NSE. The stock, which touched a high of Rs 688.90, fell to a low of Rs 621, before pulling back mildly.
But the overall market weakness also may have added to the stock’s performance with the Sensex shedding more than 200 points and the Nifty down by about 70 points as the by-election results sent a mixed signal.

RBI: Final norms for on-tap bank licences this fiscalRBI: Final norms for on-tap bank licences this fiscal
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Sept 16:  
Final guidelines for on-tap universal banking licences will be issued in the current fiscal, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor R Gandhi said here today.
“We are working towards issuing guidelines for full-service banks on tap. I cannot give you a timeline, but it will be in this financial year,” Gandhi told presspersons on the sidelines of an annual banking event organised by FICCI and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) here.
The Reserve Bank had earlier issued draft guidelines for payment and small banks and is in the process of finalising the final norms.
“Now the public comments (on small and payment banks) have been received and we are factoring them in. Soon we will come out with final guidelines on these two,” Gandhi said.
On corporate governance reforms in the public sector banks, he said the central bank has already recommended certain suggestions to the Government.
“Based on various committees, including the P J Nayak Committee recommendations, we have made certain suggestions to the Government such as segregation of the Chairman and Managing Director posts and a separate committee for appointment of directors on the board of PSU banks, and they are taking up the final decision,” Gandhi said.
Replying to a query on lowering the Government’s holding in public sector banks below 50 per cent as recommended by the P J Nayak committee report, Gandhi said the Government has to take a view on how much they want to invest in these banks.
On the liquidity coverage ratio norms which RBI announced in June this year, he said the banks as of now are in compliance with the norms and will be able to achieve the target.
“Banks are compliant as of now on LCR norms till 60 per cent as they hold excess Government securities. They are comfortable in reaching the target,” he said.
The RBI had said the LCR will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with a minimum requirement of 60 per cent from January 1, 2015, and reaching minimum 100 per cent on January 1, 2019.

Fed review  advance tax data to dictate marketsAdvance tax numbers, Fed review to dictate Sensex movement
Mahesh Nayak        Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 11:52 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
{mosimage}The US Federal Reserve policy review on interest rates on September 16 and 17 will dictate the course of stock market movement in India this week. All eyes will be on the Fed statement and its future course of action. On July 30, the Fed went according to its plan by cutting its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $25 billion.
The market has already discounted the $10 billion cut in bond purchases, but is more concerned about when the Fed is expected to increase interest rates in the US.
The US economy, since the Lehman Brothers crisis, has been standing on its feet due to the support of huge liquidity that has been pumped into the banking system by the Fed. Now is the real test for the US economy and it has to be seen whether, with the tapering, can the US continue to grow. The economic indicators are still giving mixed signals. The markets, however, have discounted that the increase in US interest rates could be around July 2015.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will closely watch the guidance given by the Fed when it announces its monetary policy on September 30. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has already shown his concerns on the damage it could cause on the rise in interest rates in the US. Any increase in rates will see a huge outflow of money from emerging markets and that could have a major impact on currency and markets.
Meanwhile, advance tax payment by India Inc on Monday, September 15, will provide a trigger for the equity market, which is now in a consolidating phase after a sharp rally in the past few weeks. The advance tax numbers will also hint on the Q2 (July-September 2014) corporate earnings. Advance taxes are collected in four installments -15 per cent by June 15; 40 per cent by September 15; 75 per cent by December 15 and 100 per cent by March 15.
On Monday, the government will also announce the Wholesale Price Index inflation numbers for August 2014. In July, the WPI was at 5.19 per cent.

J&K floods: Charges of discrimination  malicious and insidious   says ArmyStranded tourists from flood affected areas of Jammu & Kashmir being evacuated in Srinagar on Thursday. Source: PTI Photo
PTI | Udhampur | Posted: September 15, 2014 6:38 pm | Updated: September 15, 2014 6:40 pm
Refuting charges as “malicious and insidious” that preference was being given to tourists and out of state residents in their rescue efforts, Army on Monday said it is committed to the task at hand and does not discriminate on the basis of caste, religion, creed or region.
“Northern Command categorically refutes these charges as malicious and insidious (that Army in their rescue efforts, has been giving preference to tourists and out of state residents)”, a senior Army officer said here.
Over the last few days, some individuals have been spreading the such rumours, he said.
In Jammu and Kashmir, the Army has launched spontaneous rescue operations as the first responders across the entire state, the officer said.
Rescue efforts were carried out without any regional distinction, in the highest traditions of the Indian Armed Forces, and the newspapers, social media and electronic media are providing ample evidence of the same, he added.
“Indian Army is committed to the task at hand and does not discriminate on the basis of caste, religion, creed or region”, the officer stressed.
In this humanitarian crisis, our boat patrols worked tirelessly through extremely difficult conditions, and the identity of the beleaguered members of the Awaam (people) was neither possible nor practical to ascertain during the rescue, he said.
These rescue efforts have now been joined by local volunteers, which is a welcome step, and were always launched in close concert with the civil administration and police, he said.
“Not a single specific case has been reported where persons were denied rescue or relief because of their ethnicity, region or social status,” he said.
“It is pertinent to mention that large parts of the state were addressed by our teams throughout this mammoth rescue and relief effort, including South Kashmir and Jammu region, wherein the population was primarily local residents.
The statistics speak for themselves.
“A difficult and challenging task lies ahead where everyone will require to work together to mitigate the effects of the natural disaster which struck the state”, the officer said.
Belittling the efforts of those who have sought to bring relief to the people will only distract from this important task at hand, he said.

Vibrant nationalism fights shy unionismVibrant nationalism fights shy unionism in Scotland
By Philip Stephens
The Scots have faced dismal economic times, and it is much easier to champion a brave new future
©Bloomberg
They are hiding. It is a strange political campaign when one side is obliged to admit that many of its supporters are too shy to admit their allegiance. That seems to be what is happening in Scotland before this week’s momentous vote on independence.
If the visibility of the two sides were a guide to the outcome, Alex Salmond’s Scottish National party would be heading for a landslide victory. The separatists, festooned with the Saltire, brimming with energy and enthusiasm, are everywhere. Strolling around Edinburgh at the weekend I met more American tourists than I did proud campaigners for the 307-year-old union with England.
More
Foreign policy in Germany
One explanation comes in the question on the ballot paper. Framed as it was by Mr Salmond, it asks simply: “Should Scotland be an independent country?”. It invites a yes. The years since the financial crash have been as dismal for Scotland as they have been for most of the rest of Britain. How much easier it is to champion a brave new future than to argue that Scotland should be happy with its present lot.
In truth, the nationalist side is running two campaigns . The one most evident to the casual observer is the positive one: young people gathered around campaign stalls imagining a different future, disillusioned left-of-centre voters seeing in independence a route to a social democratic society, and Scots who view the referendum as their first chance to have a say. This is what Mr Salmond calls “civic nationalism”.
Alongside it sits the darker politics of grievance and identity, pitched, as by populists everywhere, at the disaffected and disempowered. It asserts that all of Scotland’s ills can be blamed on Westminster. This is the nationalism that promises, in the words of veteran SNP figure Jim Sillars, a “day of reckoning” for those who dare speak out against independence.
In this narrative, things will get better only when “Scotland is run by Scots”. As for the profound challenges and risks, it is all “scaremongering”, a conspiracy of English Tories, unionist lackeys and the British Broadcasting Corporation to do down a proud nation. The organising principle here is that if you say anything often enough and with sufficient confidence then, self-evidently, it must be true.
Mr Salmond marries these two strands of nationalism in a personality that can be at once charming and menacing. Of late we have seen a lot more of the intimidating than the solicitous.
The pro-unionist Better Together has not helped itself. Labour, at the head of the No campaign, has for too long taken its Scottish fiefdom for granted. Why was it left to the SNP to launch a hugely successful voter-registration campaign among the country’s urban poor?
More video
There has been nothing wrong in pointing up the downside of separation, the more so when the nationalist side paints a picture of an independent Scotland of milk and honey, free not just of English oppression but of the basic rules of economics. What has been missing has been a backdrop of optimism: any explanation as to how the partnership with its island neighbours offers Scots a voice beyond narrow geographical boundaries.
Hence the silent Nos. At the time of writing, the unionist side says their numbers are sufficient to counter the excitement and enthusiasm of the Yes side. The opinion polls, close as they are, seem to point in the same direction. But no one really knows. And they won’t until the polling booths close on Thursday evening.
There is, of course, one shy unionist who does not have a vote, in spite of owning a rather grand residence in Scotland. When Queen Elizabeth this weekend urged Scots to “think carefully” about where to put their cross, she was staying, just, within the bounds of constitutional propriety. No one imagined, though, that she was urging a Yes vote.

MH370: 58 hard objects found in India Ocean58 hard objects found in ocean in search for MH370
New Straits Times –  Mon 15 Sep, 2014
Print
KUALA LUMPUR: The missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 international search and recovery team has discovered 58 hard objects in the Indian Ocean floor, which are inconsistent with the seabed.
Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) is currently in the midst of retrieving the objects to be analysed for identification.
“We have found 58 hard objects in the ocean floor, but have yet to identify if they are from flight MH370.
“Now, we have to deploy our assets to the sea floor to verify whether the objects are from MH370’s wreckage, any other ship’s wreckage or hard rocks before coming to any conclusion,” he said.
Speaking at a press conference after opening the MCA Selangor State Convention here yesterday, Liow said the search for the missing flight was in a crucial phase.
The crucial phase involved deep sea search and mapping of 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean floor.
He said Petronas’ Go Phoenix vessel will be joining the search mission in the Indian Ocean from Sept 21 onwards.
“Go Phoenix is currently en route to Perth, Australia, and the ship will join Fugro Survey Pty Ltd’s Fugro Discovery, which is a vessel equipped with towed deep-water vehicles in the seabed mapping.
“It is expected to reach Perth on Sept 21 and both vessels will be deployed to the search area in near time,” he said, adding that Go Phoenix is usually used in oil exploration.
The vessels are expected to scan the sea floor using sophisticated side scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders and video cameras, with the hope of locating and identifying aircraft debris, he added.
Flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200 aircraft disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board.
Its flight path was said to have ended somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.
Meanwhile, police denied Indonesian media reports in Indonesia that they (police) were aware of the disappearance of MH370.
Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar told Bernama that he was shocked by such media reports since Malaysian police did not have any information about the missing flight.
“I would like to know which media and when such a report was published. I will ask my counterpart in Kapolri (Police Chief of Indonesia Jeneral Sutarman) whether he had said anything about the issue.
“I was not informed of any such report,” he said.
Yesterday, an Indonesian online portal (Tempo.co) quoted Sutarman as saying that Kapolri and the Malaysian police knew the reason for the disappearance of MH370 but would not elaborate further.

ERIC LENSEIGNE Country Director, Thales India
Eric Lenseigne, Country Director, Thales India, feels this is a country with endless possibilities, where you never get bored. In a chat with Business Line, Eric outlines how he prepared for his posting here, and what are the expectations of business about the Modi Government.
What image did you have of India before you came here and how was it different from what you saw?
A very large country obviously in terms of population. It’s a democracy so you have elections.
It’s a free enterprise market and it’s a market where you find extraordinary diversity. Basically anything is possible in this country. Human resources and capital are also there. This is a fantastic place where growth is bound to happen.
What are the things you would change to help India reach its potential?
One thing we have some difficulty with is unpredictability of timeframes, which includes a lot of aspects of decision making. These could be more predictable and then it would be easier to plan. That would help a lot.
Is this in any particular sector?
This is in all sectors which is making our life a little more difficult. Investment decisions are time-bound. I am asking for predictability of timeframes. I am not asking for predictability of events.
What you are saying is that in India things stretch on for too long which is not good for business…
Way too long and unpredictable. Investment decisions are based on time-bound predictions.
You decide you are going to make a JV because you expect such and such milestones and such and such events to develop at a given point in time.
So you start your operations in anticipation of that time. Now, if that time is pushed with no limit may be you will decide not to invest.
But isn’t this offset by the great market?
I think that’s a challenge. We at Thales and all of our competitors, friends, partners recognise that the market is absolutely huge and that’s why we are eager to work in India. 
Is this something that you face in the Centre or also in the States?
I will not be able to comment on that. It is too long and unpredictable all the way through. I understand that the new Government is trying to sort it out.  
So there is some ray of hope with the new Government?
It’s always helpful. We think that the market will be fine little by little. A bit quicker will be better.
You have worked in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Russia and West Asia. How different was it there compared to India?
Speed of decisions. I am sorry to come back to that. That’s probably the most striking factor.  
How has your family adjusted to India?
My wife and youngest kid are here. The others are studying in various places in Europe.  
Do they like it here?
Yes they do.
How difficult is it to blend in?
Both difficult and not difficult. Difficult because there is a huge cultural gap but at the same time, Indians are very open. It’s very easy to meet an Indian person. There is no formal barrier.  
Your child goes to the French Embassy School?
No, an international school where he meets a lot of Indians. They are blending if I can judge by the exchange on Facebook which I do see even though I am not allowed to.
Do your older children like India?
They come for vacations. I see much more of them now that I am in India than I did when I was in France.
Has there been any change in the ease of doing business with the new Government in place?
I see a new momentum, yes. Some of the challenges which I have mentioned are very well appreciated by the new Government.
We see that there is an attempt to solve issues. But obviously it is a Herculean task and it will take time.  
What promoted you to take up this job?
Well, I am fascinated by the country. 
How did you get to know about India?
News and books. It was not direct knowledge as I had very little experience with India.
What I saw in books and movies is probably the source.
 Any particular book or movie which inspired you to come to India?
Yes. But they are not by Indians.
One is the novel Shantaram. I believe it is written by an Australian.
The movie which comes to the mind of every western person is Slumdog Millionaire.
 
Your advice to people coming to India for business…
When you come to India and that is probably true for any country and probably more true for India, you have to adapt to the way of doing things here.
You cannot expect the methodology, the way of doing things and the decision making process to be exactly what you know and so you need to adapt to the specificity of this environment.
We have to adapt our strategy to a particular environment, we cannot expect the environment to adapt to our strategy.

India on Monday reacted strongly to Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit’s comments on Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed being “free to roam in Pakistan,” leading to doubts over any possibility of a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.
Speaking to journalists at an Assocham event, Mr. Basit said, “Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national, so he is free to roam around. So what is the problem ... He is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned.” Mr. Basit was responding to questions about reports that Saeed had been visiting areas along the LoC and border. The External Affairs Ministry questioned Mr. Basit’s statement, and called Saeed “the evil mastermind of the Mumbai attacks.” A Ministry spokesperson said it was unfortunate that Pakistan had never prosecuted him while he was convicted in Indian courts.

Two Vietnam veterans receive the Medal of Honor decades after heroismBy Dan Lamothe September 15 Follow @danlamothe

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Bennie G. Adkins stood ramrod straight on Monday as President Obama draped the Medal of Honor around his neck at the White House. It had been nearly five decades since he led Special Forces soldiers through a bloody ordeal that spanned a week in March 1966, but he still wore a crisp Army uniform, and saluted after receiving the nation’s top award for combat valor.
Adkins, 80, was one of two Vietnam War soldiers awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House. The other went to the family of Spec. Donald P. Sloat, who was killed on Jan. 17, 1970, while shielding a grenade to protect his fellow soldiers. He was just short of his 21st birthday.
The decision to award the medal to the soldiers so many years after the fact required special congressional approval.
“Normally, this medal must be awarded within a few years of the action. But sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the fog of war or the passage of time,” Obama said. “Yet when new evidence comes to light, certain actions can be reconsidered for this honor, and it is entirely right and proper that we have done so.  And that is why we are here today.”

The details of each case are a reminder of the intense fighting that U.S. troops faced during the Vietnam War.
Adkins was an infantry operations and intelligence sergeant in a detachment with the Army’s 5th Special Forces Group on March 9, 1966, when his camp was attacked by a large North Vietnamese force, Army officials said. He and several other soldiers were wounded by enemy mortar rounds, but he ran through explosions to drag several others to safety.

The battle continued for 38 hours, and Adkins braved enemy fire numerous times to retrieve ammunition, help transport U.S. casualties to an airstrip for care and shoot back with a variety of weapons. He and a small group of fellow soldiers eventually destroyed classified documents at the camp and evacuated it. They carried a wounded soldier to an extraction point, a move that left them unable to reach the last helicopter evacuating U.S. soldiers from the area.
Adkins, a 32-year-old sergeant first class at the time, led the remaining U.S. soldiers into the Vietnamese jungle for the next four days, evading not only enemy fighters but a tiger. Remarkably, the jungle cat may have played a role in Adkins and other soldiers escaping alive.
“It turns out that tiger might have been the best thing that happened to Bennie … during those days because, he says, ‘The North Vietnamese were more scared of that tiger than they were of us,’ ” Obama said, drawing laughter during the ceremony. “So the enemy fled. Bennie and his squad made their escape. And they were rescued, finally, the next morning.”
In all, it is estimated that Adkins killed 135 to 175 enemy fighters in the battle and its aftermath while being wounded 18 times.

Sloat, a machine gunner, was on a foot patrol in the Que Son valley when the lead soldier in his squad triggered a trip-wire attached to a booby trap set up by enemy fighters. A grenade rolled down a hill toward Sloat, and he picked it up looking for a place to hurl it before it detonated. Realizing there was no way to do so without wounding fellow soldiers, he pulled the grenade into his body, absorbing the blast and saving their lives.

“The blast threw the lead soldier up against a boulder,” Obama recalled. “Men were riddled with shrapnel. Four were medevaced out, but everyone else survived. Don had absorbed the brunt of the explosion with his body. He saved the lives of those next to him.”
Sloat’s award was accepted by his brother, Bill. For decades, his family knew only that the specialist was killed in action, and thought he had stepped on a landmine, Obama said. His mother, Evelyn, made it her mission to have her son’s actions recognized when she learned about them, but she died three year ago, he added.
“But she always believed — she knew — that this day would come,” the president said. “She even bought a special dress to wear to this ceremony.”
The ceremony had lighter moments, especially when Obama recounted his interactions with Adkins in recent days. The grandfather of six asked the president if he could sign back up, and Mary, his wife of 58 years, “was not amused,” the president quipped.
“A couple years ago, he came here to the White House with his fellow veterans for a breakfast we had on Veterans Day. He tells folk he was the only person he knows who has spilled his dessert in the White House,” Obama said, drawing laughter. “And I just have to correct you: that makes two of us.”

Epirus, Ranbaxy Win India Approval for Arthritis Drug Copy
Reuters | Updated On: September 16, 2014 08:10 (IST)
Future Group Acquires Supermarket Chain Nilgiris
Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc said India's drug regulator has approved its copy of a top-selling arthritis treatment, paving the way for its launch in the country early next year.
The company's Indian partner, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, will sell a copycat version of Johnson & Johnson's and Merck & Co Inc's infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug with annual sales of about $6 billion.
The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.
With changing regulations and a looming biotech patent cliff, the global market for biosimilars is forecast to rise to $24 billion in 2019 from about $1.2 billion last year, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
Infliximab, sold under the brand name Remicade, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. In India, it sells at about Rs 70,000 ($1,150) per month.
Like its main rivals, Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie Inc's Humira, the drug works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.
Epirus, a Boston-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing biosimilar drugs for sale, said it would launch the Remicade biosimilar in India under the name Infimab by the first quarter of 2015.
Chief executive Amit Munshi, citing various estimates, said the Indian market for Remicade was worth $8 million to $10 million a year. He declined to say how much Infimab would cost or to estimate how many patients might use the drug.
The drug will be made in Mumbai by India's Reliance Life Sciences, part of billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Group Holdings.
Remicade copycats are already being sold elsewhere. South Korean drugmaker Celltrion Inc won approval in July for its version in Japan and is hoping for U.S. approval in 2015.
Epirus is also in talks with Ranbaxy, as well as other Indian and international companies, about expanding sales of its biosimilar drugs in other regions, Munshi told Reuters.
"Ranbaxy has, under their license, quite a few markets in southeast Asia and North Africa," he said. "We're also working with other partners in places like Latin America."
Ranbaxy is not the only Indian drugmaker to explore production of biosimilar drugs. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, for example, is developing biosimilars with Germany's Merck KGaA.
Biocon Ltd has a tie-up with Mylan Inc, while Lupin Ltd has entered a deal to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster insulin, Lantus, in India.

 Diesel Prices Likely To Be Cut SoonYou are here: Home Economy
Diesel Prices Likely To Be Cut Soon
NDTV | Updated On: September 16, 2014 16:40 (IST)
Indian Firms Garner Rs 6,000 Crore via Non Convertible Debentures
The expectations of a cut in diesel prices rose today after the oil ministry said the losses on the fuel has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of Rs 0.35 per litre with effect from September, 16 2014.
This is perhaps the first time that retail prices in India are higher than the global rates. A Press Trust of India report citing sources said deregulation or freeing of diesel would be discussed after Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's return from his Vietnam tour. Deregulation would empower state-owned oil firms to change rates in tandem with cost like they do for petrol.
Global crude prices have fallen sharply to over two-year lows to around $97 per barrel. This together with monthly price increases of up to 50 paise a litre helped oil marketing companies wipe out their losses in selling the fuel.
The next revision in diesel prices is due this month-end. If the diesel prices are cut, it would be the first downward revision in over five years.
(Also read: Buying a Car? Why Petrol Beats Diesel Now )
The Narendra Modi government has continued with the previous UPA regime's policy of raising diesel rates by up to 50 paise a litre every month to bridge the gap between cost and retail prices. In January 2013, the UPA decided to deregulate diesel prices in stages through monthly 50 paise a litre increases.
In June 2010, the government had freed petrol from its control and rates have since then moved more or less in tandem with cost. The price of diesel has cumulatively risen by Rs 11.81 per litre in 19 instalments since January 2013. Diesel prices were last raised on August 31.
The government must take advantage of the lowest oil prices in a year to deregulate diesel, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Monday.
"Lower crude oil prices are helping consuming countries like us. Typically a lower oil price means a lower CAD (current account deficit), lower oil subsidies and lower inflation. We need to seize this moment to eliminate diesel subsidies completely. We should take this moment to eliminate diesel subsidies as soon as possible," Mr Rajan told a banking summit in Mumbai.

GMR to raise Rs 1 500 crore through Rights IssueGMR Infra to raise Rs 1,500 cr through rights issue
Raghuvir Badrinath | Bangalore Sep 17, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Bangalore-based publicly-held infrastructure developer GMR Infrastructure plans to raise Rs 1,500 crore in equity through a rights issue, which, along with the recently-concluded qualified institutional placement issue of Rs 1,500 crore, is expected to ease leverage.
For the past two years, GMR Infrastructure has been grappling with debt of Rs 40,000 crore with a gearing of four times. After the rights issue, which is expected by November, GMR’s net worth will go up to Rs 14,000 crore as a result of which the leverage will be down to 2.85 times.
The move to raise equity of Rs 3,000 crore in quick succession comes after a year during which GMR went about aggressively to trim its assets across airports, power projects and highways, which enabled it to infuse liquidity into its system to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore.

Rs 3,000 crore:
The move to raise equity in quick succession comes after a year during which GMR trimmed its assets across airports, power projects and highways
GMR Infrastructure’s promoters through their main holding company GMR Holdings have parallely raised a debt of Rs 1,000 crore from global private equity major KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) to fund their share of the rights issue.
The global investment firm said it has signed a term sheet to provide Rs 1,000 crore of structured long-term financing, with co-investors to GMR Holdings, which holds 64 per cent in GMR Infrastructure.
Grandhi Kiran Kumar, group director of GMR Holdings and managing director of GMR Infrastructure, said: “The infusion of additional equity from the promoters of GMR Infrastructure is a testimony to the promoters’ confidence in the long-term value of the group’s business. The rights issue, after successful conclusion, will improve the net worth of GMR Infrastructure and bring down the net debt-to-equity ratio to 2.85 against 3.5 prevailing as of March 2014. In addition, it will reduce the corporate debt of GMR Infrastructure. The partnership with KKR helps GMR strengthen its foundation for the next phase of growth.”
In addition to strengthening the balance sheet of GMR Infrastructure, the proceeds from the rights issue will also be used to support the funding requirement for projects and meet its financing obligations. Neither KKR nor GMR Holdings specify the terms of the contract. GMR Holdings is already under a debt of Rs 1,000 crore with as much as 73 per cent of that in short-term borrowings.
B V Krishnan, managing director, KKR Capital Markets, said: “We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with GMR, which represents a significant opportunity for KKR to partner with committed infrastructure groups.”
In India, KKR provides structured financing solutions through multiple capital pools, including a non-banking finance company, alternative investment funds and special situations capital pools. The firm looks to provide flexible, long-term capital, which can help companies achieve their objectives of balance sheet consolidation, de-leveraging and long-term growth.
KKR has executed more than $2 billion of structured financing to 21 business groups in India through its credit and capital markets business over the past five years.

Innovative products coming soon in non-life insuranceNon-life insurance space to have innovative products soon
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Sep 19, 2014 12:46 AM IST
Customers might soon see specific general insurance products suited to their profession, income-bracket, age and need, if the recommendations of the Working Group on File & Use guidelines for the non-life sector is accepted by the  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda).
The working group has said general insurers can launch a product for a short period in a defined pilot area with defined exposure limits on a pilot basis after informing Irda. After gaining experience on the product, they might finalise the product and take it through approval process depending upon whether it is a retail product or commercial.
Rakesh Jain, CEO of Reliance General Insurance, said from a use-and-file perspective, insurers will be enabled to offer customised products for different individuals rather than generic products.
The industry had been recommending a use-and-file system for some product types to co-exist with file-and-use system so that they could respond to customer requirements faster under a use-and-file system. The working group, after considerable deliberations on the subject, has recommended a use-and-file system for commercial products. Retail products will continue to be governed by file and use.
The current file-and-use system requires all products to be filed with Irda before these can be used. The working group report said the process of developing innovative products requires experimentation, testing, refinement and finalisation, but the current system does not afford this freedom of testing and refinement and jumps from experimentation to finalisation.
In April 2014, Irda had set up a working group to review the file-and-use norms for the general insurance industry. The regulator said these norms that have been followed since the past eight years, insurers have filed various products as well as add-ons and most of them have been approved by them.
Insurers indicated that product meant for specific risk profiles after assessing the individual customers would also be launched.
Though insurance companies do market testing across different segments before a new product is launched, officially companies are not allowed to launch pilot products.
Sector experts said this would enable insurers to test the market beforehand, so that they do not burn their fingers launching a product that is a misfit.
Having a product management committee as envisaged by the working group will ensure that the adequate due diligence is done before any product is sent for approval, with respect to its features, usability and pricing, said a senior non-life industry executive.
Amarnath Ananthanarayanan, CEO and MD, Bharti AXA General Insurance, explained that pilots should be allowed for specific geographies, since India is a diverse market. “A product launched as a pilot in north India may not be representative of the entire country. We are hoping that we are allowed to launch products in a few states pan India,” he added.
In order to bring a more structured approach to the process, which takes into account the interests of all stakeholders of an insurance product, the working group has recommended the creation of a board-led product management committee.
The role of product management committee will be akin to the role of a regulator within an insurer. The committee affords an internal self-regulatory mechanism that will create appropriate structures and processes for effectively managing the operations in the entire product life-cycle. All products either under file-and-use or use-and-file will be approved by the committee.
Products under file-and-use will be sent to Irda after the committee’s approval for regulatory approval process, while products under use-and-file might be sold by an insurer after the committee’s approval under information to Irda.
The working group's report said it is expected that Irda should revert with its observations on the products under file-and-use within 30 days of receipt of product filing, failing which insurers might be free to sell the product. Though the insurance regulations had talked about product approvals under 30 days, in practice there have been delays due to various causes. Jain of Reliance General Insurance added the 30-day approval will help Irda to have a time frame to revert to insurers.
At present, insurance companies have classified products as retail and commercial products. Retail products that are primarily designed for retail customers and commercial products that are primarily designed for customers other than individuals and includes firms, companies, trusts, associations, societies, government, etc.
Ananthanarayanan further said under the use-and-file guidelines, there is no clarity on whether it would mean flexibility in tariff. He said the exact meaning of the terminology should be clarified by the regulator.
 
It would also become easier to track products since the working group has recommended a Unique Identification Number (UIN). UIN is proposed to be allotted through an automatic online process and will be a unique number for each company, each product and each add on cover.
 
Under the existing file and use system, any product approval is valid till eternity. This is proposed to be changed and it is recommended that products once approved under any of the approval systems will remain valid for 5 years after which they will have to be filed again. The underwriting of a private general insurance company said that with changing market dynamics, it is not viable to have one product existing for several years and hence insurers would have the product segmented out every three years.

ONGC dips 9% in one week after government announces divestment planONGC dips 9% in one week after government announces divestment plan
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 01:26 PM IST
Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have dipped 3% to Rs 409, extending its three-day’s fall, after the government cleared 5% disinvestment in oil major.
On September 10, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had cleared the ONGC stake sale proposal.
Since then, the stock has declined 9% from Rs 445 on National Stock Exchange (NSE), against 1.3% fall in benchmark CNX Nifty at 1315 hours.
The merchant bankers will advise the government on the timing and modalities of Offer for Sale (OFS) and ensure best returns to the government, which holds 68.94% stake in ONGC, the PTI report suggests.
The CCEA also approved selling 10% of the government's stake in Coal India and 11.38% in NHPC.
Coal India is trading 2% lower at Rs 346, while NHPC down 2.4% at Rs 20.55 on NSE. Both these stocks have fallen more than 7% each since the divestment plan announced.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday that RBI is limiting the country's reliance on foreign debt and will continue to do so.
"We are limiting our reliance on foreign debt. It's important we keep it this way," he said during a speech to university students.
Rajan's comments came at a time when foreign institutional investors have nearly exhausted their $25 billion allocation in government debt, leading to expectations that India would raise limits soon.
 
Rajan also said the RBI had reduced the current account deficit "substantially".
The current account deficit for April-June stood at $7.8 billion, sharply higher than $1.3 billion in January-March but narrowing from $21.8 billion a year ago.

NEW DELHI: Xiaomi Tuesday sold 40,000 units of its entry-level Redmi 1S smartphone in just 3.4 seconds in the third flash sale for the product , the Chinese company said in a Facebook post.
Several glitches were reported on Flipkart.com after the start of the sale at 2.05 PM. A few minutes later, it showed an "out-of stock" message on the page promoting the device. An estimated over 200,000 people had registered for getting a Redmi 1S device in the latest sale. The Flipkart Redmi 1S page says that the fourth flash sale will take place on September 23, registrations for which will open at 6 PM today.
On Monday, Micromax has sold about 20,000 units of its first Android One smartphone, Canvas A1, through the Amazon website.
Xiaomi is providing complimentary micro-SIM card adaptor and a screen protector along with the Redmi 1S free of charge. The company, on its Facebook page, said that the accessories will be shipped separately free of charge in two to four additional business days.
Priced at Rs 5,999, the Redmi 1S competes with the likes of Moto E and Asus Zen Phone4 in the country. In addition, the Android One smartphones, which are backed by Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, are also competing head-to-head with Xiaomi's entry level device.

World Stocks Hit One-month Low  Focus on FedBSE Sensex, Nifty Hit Record Highs on Kotak Mahindra Bank-ING Vysya Deal
London: Global shares slipped to a one-month low on Tuesday as markets braced for a Federal Reserve meeting, when investors will be looking for clues on whether the US central bank could raise interest rates sooner than previously expected.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, was down 0.2 per cent after hitting its lowest level since mid-August earlier in the session. In Europe, the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.4 per cent.
Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar.
"The Fed is moving from a position of outright support, as we saw in the years after the financial crisis, to thinking about an exit strategy and the normalisation of policy and that could have some uncomfortable side effects," Henk Potts, director of global research at Barclays, said.
"The much bigger question is where interest rates will be in the medium term and where they will settle in the longer term."
The Fed will begin its two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first rate hike in more than eight years. The Fed will also release economic and interest rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.
It has said it does not expect to raise rates until 2015, but recent strong US economic data has led Fed officials to acknowledge they may need to act sooner than they thought just a few months ago.
Asian shares also slipped. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.7 per cent to its lowest since late June, while Japan's Nikkei snapped a five-session winning streak to close down 0.2 per cent.
Investors in Europe were also jittery ahead of a historic independence poll in Scotland on Thursday, with opinion polls suggesting the referendum remained too close to call.
In the currency market, the dollar index, which hit a 14-month peak on September 9 and is on its longest weekly winning streak since 1997, was almost unchanged at 84.272.
The euro held steady at $1.2937, hemmed in a $1.2859-$1.2980 range after a sell-off sparked by the European Central Bank's interest rate cut early this month faded. Traders awaited the German ZEW sentiment data, due at 0900 GMT, for hints about the single currency's outlook in the near term.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note stood at 2.563 per cent, compared with Monday's US close of 2.591 per cent. It hit a two-month high of 2.651 percent on Monday, before paring its rise on news of a drop in US manufacturing output last month.
In Europe, German 10-year yields fell back below 1 per cent ahead of the German ZEW survey, which is expected to show investor confidence in the region's biggest economy remained downbeat.
"The ZEW has been quite a disappointment in the past releases. The consensus is seeing a further downgrading of the current conditions and expectations' component," said Christian Lenk, a strategist at DZ Bank.
"It's a sentiment indicator by financial analysts so it's usually quite fickle. I doubt that it will have a major market impact as there are other major events looming in the near term."
Oil prices were steady with Brent crude trading at just below $98 a barrel, holding gains after recovering from a more than two-year low but capped by a soft global economic outlook.

The Reserve Bank had earlier issued draft guidelines for payment and small banks and is in the process of finalising the final norms.

Copra prices have moved up sharply by 150 percent over the past 18 months. Credit Suisse expects copra prices to correct from February 2015, and Marico to witness strong gross margin tailwinds in April-September period of FY16 which is not built in estimates.

YD Murthy, executive vice president of finance at NCC says the rights issue will most likely open on September 29, and close on October 7.
The funds raised from the company's proposed rights issue will be used to repay its short-term debts, de-stress the balance sheet, raise the company’s ratings that can in turn help lower finance cost, says Murthy. At the moment, the company is working with Crisil for its ratings.
NCC has a consolidated debt of Rs 3700 crore. Its debt has been increasing due to an increase in working capital. Murthy says the rights issue will help lower working capital concerns.

He expects to see debt reduction by this October end or November.

In Gujarat, ruling BJP could retain only six of the nine seats while Congress bagged two and was ahead in one. All the nine seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The BJP, however, had a reason to smile in West Bengal where it made its debut in the state assembly on its own by winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat. The bypolls for 33 seats spread over 10 states were held on September 13.

Amazon launches new original show  Transparent   hopes to catch up with NetflixSep 16, 2014 at 02:37pm IST
Amazon launches new original show 'Transparent', hopes to catch up with Netflix

Los Angeles: Online retail giant Amazon celebrated on Monday the launch of a new original show it hopes will help catch up with streaming pioneer Netflix.
Transparent, which had a red-carpet unveiling in Los Angeles, features a transgender character in the central role of a show which has already generated strong critical buzz.
"No one can ever doubt that the TV model has changed for good. Amazon, with its ability to draw in name talent, is impressively building on what Netflix and (rival streaming service) Hulu are doing," commented the Hollywood Reporter.
'Transparent', features a transgender character in the central role of a show which has already generated strong critical buzz.
#amazon #netflix #transparent
"This is huge, it's a game changer. There is nothing like this on television," its main star Jeffrey Tambor told AFP on the red carpet. "I couldn't be more proud."
It is not Amazon's first foray into producing its own original content - political comedy Alpha House debuted last year, but has so far failed to win the acclaim of Netflix series like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black.
House of Cards was the first online only show to win major awards nominations - and a win last year for big-screen director David Fincher, while Orange is the New Black<?I> won two Emmys this year.
The pilot episode of Transparent is already available, while Amazon has taken a leaf out of Netflix's book by releasing the whole season to binge watch on September 26, rather than airing an episode per week.
The half-hour dark comedy stars the lugubrious Tambor - from Netflix's Arrested Development - as father Mort Pfefferman coming out as transgender Maura to his three adult children (who have their own secrets to divulge too).
The cast of the show, which is definitely for an adult audience, also includes Gaby Hoffman of the hit series "Girls."
Adding to its creative heft it is directed by Jill Soloway, an Emmy-nominated writer on cult series Six Feet Under who won a directing award at the Sundance Film Festival last year for Afternoon Delight.
"Artistically, it's been a dream come true. I absolutely got to make the show I wanted to make," Soloway said, when the Amazon series was announced in August. "I am beyond excited to share Transparent with the world through Amazon.
Transgender roles in comedies are nothing new - Orange is the new Black features Laverne Cox, who made it to the front page of Time magazine in her role as Sophia Burset.
But a transgender main character is rarer, giving the series - the title of which is a play on words involving a gender-bending parent - an edge in a crowded new market.
Soloway said the casting of Tambor wasn't difficult.
"Luckily I didn't really have to think about it, because from the very moment I had the idea in my head, Jeffrey was Mort to become" Maura, she told the Hollywood Reporter.
"It wasn't a decision, it was an intuitive feeling thing," she added.
Netflix and Amazon have taken starkly different paths: whereas Netflix went straight for heavyweights Spacey and Fincher, and even ordered two seasons straight at once, Amazon was much more cautious.
The online retailer's approach has been much more inter-active: in 2010 it launched a process which produced traditional pilot episodes, which it then put online for free to guage audience reaction.
Only then did it order a whole season.
Critics have lavished praise on what they have seen so far.
"It's a nuanced, gorgeous first half-hour, brilliantly performed and laced with melancholy and humor; you could confidently put it up against the best HBO or Showtime half-hour pilots of recent years," wrote Time magazine's reviewer.
"And the fact that platforms like Amazon now exist to give shows like this a chance says that not only Maura Pfefferman, but the TV business itself, is going through an exciting transformation," he said.

Habitual Facebook users prone to phishing attacks by criminals
3

New York: If you are perpetually online on Facebook and do respond to anonymous friends' requests without considering how they are connected with those sending the requests, beware of phishing attacks.
According to a new study by an Indian-origin researcher, habitual use of Facebook makes individuals susceptible to social media phishing attacks by criminals.
"This is because they automatically respond to requests without considering how long they have known them or who else is connected with them," said Arun Vishwanath, an associate professor in the department of communication at the University of Buffalo in New York.
Phishing scams attempt to trick people into accepting friend requests and gathering crucial personal and financial information from them.
#facebook #phishing #cybercrime #social networking
Predictors of habitual use of Facebook include frequent interactions with the platform, a large number of friend connections and individuals' inability to regulate their social media consumption.
"Social media phishing is the attack vector of choice among cyber criminals and has been implicated in crimes ranging from home invasion to cyber bullying, illegal impersonation of individuals and organisation and espionage," Vishwanath added.
These scams attempt to trick people into accepting friend requests and gathering crucial personal and financial information from them.
"Hence, understanding why individuals fall victim to social media phishing scams is important from an organisational security, law enforcement and a national security standpoint," he noted.
The paper appeared in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication.

Mumbai, Sept 16:  
State-run Bank of Maharashtra today said that it plans to raise around Rs 500-1,000 crore by issuing Basel III-compliant Tier-I bonds this year.
“We will look at raising Basel III-compliant additional Tier-1 capital instead of taking up further equity right now. We may raise around Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore during this financial year,” bank Chairman and Managing Director S Muhnot told reporters here on the sidelines of an event organised jointly by FICCI and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA).
Currently, the city-based bank’s capital adequacy ratio is around 11.
The bank sees its credit growth to moderate to around 12 per cent to 15 per cent this fiscal.
“We are looking at around 12 per cent to 15 per cent growth this financial year as compared to 18 per cent to 20 per cent last year,” Muhnot said.
He said there are some signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector, adding that it would take one or two quarters for it to translate into growth in the banking system.

NSEL lacks credibility; merge NSEL with FTIL‘NSEL lacks credibility; merge NSEL with FTIL’
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 16:  
Stating that crisis-hit NSEL is “bereft of any credibility”, regulator FMC today said it has recommended the Government to consider merger of the spot commodity exchange with its promoter FTIL for speedy recovery of dues over Rs 5,300 crore from defaulters.
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the Government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Both Corporate Affairs and Finance Ministries are studying the feasibility of implementing the FMC’s proposals.
“The Commission, vide its letter dated August 18, has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to consider the merger/amalgamation of NSEL with FTIL in public interest so that the human and financial resources of FTIL are also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters at NSEL,” FMC said in its latest report.
The recommendation has been given to the Government in view of the depleted resources in terms of manpower and financial strength available at the disposal of NSEL, it said.
Also, “NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery from the defaulting members,” it observed.
The regulator has also recommended the government to consider taking over of the management of FTIL, thereby ensure the company takes full responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.
Taking over the FTIL management will help manage the affairs of the company in a professional way by bringing in an institutionalised framework as recommended by the Working Group appointed by the government, it added.
NSEL, a subsidiary of the Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd, has recovered so far a little over Rs 360 crore of dues from defaulters out of the total outstanding amount of Rs 5,689 crore.
Recently, FMC had said that the NSEL has not made much progress in recovery of dues from defaulters, which the spot exchange refuted saying the watchdog has adequate powers to speed up efforts to get back the investor money.

IndusInd Bank cuts interest rate on savings accounts to 4.5%Tweet
Mumbai, Sept 16:  
IndusInd Bank reduced its interest rates on savings accounts to 4.5 per cent from earlier 5.5 per cent per annum on daily balance of up to Rs 1 lakh.
For balance of above Rs 1 lakh, the interest rates continue to be at 6 per cent.
“The revised interest rates are applicable with effect from September 1, 2014 till further notice. The bank has the right to change the rate at its discretion,” IndusInd Bank said on its website.
The interest will be calculated on daily basis, at the end of day ledger balance in the account and paid at every calendar quarter on 30th June, 30th September, 31st December and 31st March.
After the interest rate on savings was deregulated by the Reserve Bank of India in 2011, banks including IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank were among the first few banks to increase rate above the earlier mandate of 4 per cent.
This aided banks to add more savings bank accounts and thereby expanding their retail client base. However, a higher interest rate also increases cost to banks.
YES Bank continues to offer an interest rate of 7 per cent per annum on savings bank account balance of Rs 1 lakh and above while 6 per cent per annum for balance below Rs 1 lakh. While, Kotak Mahindra Bank offers 6 per cent interest per annum on savings bank account balance over Rs 1 lakh and 5.5 per cent per annum on balance up to Rs 1 lakh.
Following them, old private sector lender, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, recently increased its savings bank interest rate to 5 per cent for accounts with a balance of Rs 1 lakh and above.
All public sector banks and big private banks offer interest rate of 4 per cent on savings bank accounts.

US central bank policymakers will also release fresh economic and interest-rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.

KPMG will do forensic audit of UCX: FMCKPMG will do forensic audit of UCX: FMC
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 01:55 PM IST
Commodity markets regulator FMC today said auditing firm KPMG has been appointed to conduct a forensic audit of the Universal Commodity Exchange after it found that its promoter allegedly siphoned off funds from the exchange.
The auditing firm will submit a detailed report in 4-6 weeks.
Meanwhile, the exchange has been directed to maintain the current cash balance of Rs 52.52 lakh intact in the Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) and not to withdraw any amount without the regulator's approval, it said.
FMC has also directed UCX, the country's sixth national level commodity bourse, to convert other investments in Optional Convertible Debentures (OCDs) and advances made out of SGF fund into liquid assets immediately.
"The exchange on August 28, 2014, has engaged M/s KPMG as the forensic auditor to carry out the forensic audit at UCX. KPMG is likely to submit its report to the Commission in 4-6 weeks," Forward Markets Commission said in its latest report.
KPMG will do forensic investigation into "the serious charges and allegations of misappropriation of funds by the promoter of UCX since the inception of the exchange," it said.
A forensic audit of UCX was ordered after taking into account preliminary findings on gross financial irregularities and diversion of funds from SDF and on the basis on feedback from the Board of Directors of the exchange, it added.
UCX is promoted by Commex Technologies chief Ketan Sheth, who owns 40% stake in the exchange. He was not available for comment when contacted.

The regulator was informed "that the Promoter has paid Rs 1 crore from one of his group companies to the exchange".

UCX, which was launched in April 2013, suspended trading in all commodities on July 19. It offered futures trading in oil seeds, pulses, crude oil and natural gas.
Currently, NCDEX, MCX, NMCE and ACE derivatives are the commodity exchanges that are active in the country.

CCI clears Temasek s 10.16% stake buy in IntasCCI clears Temasek's 10.16% stake buy in Intas
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 02:10 PM IST
Singapore government's investment arm Temasek Holding's proposed 10.16% stake purchase in Indian firm Intas Pharmaceuticals has got the approval of the Competition Commission.
According to the fair trade watchdog "the proposed combination is not likely to have an appreciable adverse effort on competition in India".
Under the deal, Dunearn Investments (Mauritius) -- a indirect subsidiary of Temasek -- would acquire 10.16% shareholding in Intas from ChrysCapital III LLC group firm Mozart Ltd.
Intas, incorporated in India, is a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company with global operations.
Clearing the deal in an order dated September 2, the Competition Commission of India said "there are no horizontal overlaps between the products and services of Intas and the rest of the Temasek group".
It also noted that Temasek had some minority investment in the companies engaged in the pharmaceutical and health sector in India including Medreich Ltd.
However, CCI said that "in respect of the overlapping products of Intas and Medreich Ltd, the combined market share is of minimal nature.
"Further, as stated in the notice neither Temasek nor any of its subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures has any significant vertical linkage with any of the business activities of Intas or its subsidiaries in India".
As per details in the order, post execution of the combination, Dunearn would secure all the affirmative voting rights which were earlier available to Mozart.
These rights are for the purpose of protecting the minority stake of Dunearn in the target company and would not be intended, nor likely, to result in operational control of Intas by the Dunearn, as promoters will continue to remain in its control and management, the order said.
Dunearn had approached CCI for approval on June 23.

Arvind Kejriwal slams BJP for not taking decision on e-rickshawsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:17 pm
Attacking the BJP for “policy paralysis”, the Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday threatened to undertake an agitation if a decision on the banned e-rickshaws was not taken in the next 10 days.
The AAP leader, who met Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, said that if a quick decision was taken, the government could have prevented a ban on e-rickshaws.
“The Congress government suffered from policy paralysis and did not take any decisions. The BJP government too is facing the same problem,” he said. Criticising the minister, Kejriwal said that Gadkari had announced in his rally that a policy decision would soon be taken on the matter of e-rickshaws.
“Nitin Gadkari had addressed a rally in Ramlila Maidan and assured that the ministry would come up with a policy on this within a month. But nothing has happened until now and over 2 lakh families of e-rickshaw drivers are starving. “If there is no policy on this in next days then we will launch an agitation,”  Kejriwal said after his meeting with the minister.
The AAP leader claimed that when he asked Gadkari about the assurance he made at the rally, the minister responded that they could not be implemented as they were not legal in nature. “He (Gadkari) said that his ministry later told him that those announcements could not be implemented as they were not legal. Strange!” Kejriwal tweeted.
Gadkari said that a notification for plying auto rickshaw will be issued in next 10 days. The High Court has banned plying of e-rickhshaws on road.
“A notification pertaining to e-rickshaw has been issued. We will put it on website and seek peoples opinion on it in the next ten days and will solve the problem immediately thereafter. We will issue (final) notification for plying of e-rickshaws after 10 days,” the minister had said.
Kejriwal said that a call by Gadkari was also made to Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi in this matter as many e-rickshaws have been confiscated by the cops.
“The e-rickshaw drivers have complained that many parts of their vehicles have gone missing. The Police Commissioner has assured that if the drivers and owners make a request for release of the vehicles before the court, the cops will not oppose the same,” the AAP leader said.

Results in some places not according to expectations: BJPPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 2:35 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 2:36 pm
Facing reverses in some seats in the Assembly bypolls, the BJP on Tuesday said the results in some places were not according to its expectations and people voted on local issues.
“We have won in many places and at some places, the results have been not up to our expectations… These by-polls have been fought over local issues and in places where the state governments have full majority,” BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.
Putting up a brave face, he said there was good news also for the party as “the lotus has blossomed in West Bengal.” Hussain said the by-poll results should not be seen in the national or state perspective as the elections have been fought by the party over local issues.
Asked to comment on party’s prospects in the coming Haryana and Maharashtra elections, he said the BJP will win those elections as they are being held for forming new governments to run these states.
Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Maharashtra and Haryana next month. BJP suffered a jolt in Rajasthan, winning just one of the four seats and was losing ground in Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party(SP) was ahead during counting of votes in the bypolls exactly four months after it swept the two states in Lok Sabha elections.
In Gujarat, ruling BJP could retain only six of the nine seats while Congress bagged two and was ahead in one. All the nine seats were earlier held by BJP and were vacated after their sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.
The BJP, however, had a reason to smile in West Bengal where it made its debut in the state Assembly on its own by winning the Basirhat Dakshin seat. The bypolls for 33 seats spread over 10 states were held on September 13.

Sensex ends 324 points down: Why  equity cult  has died in IndiaTop five reasons why equity cult died in India
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Sep 16, 2014, 03.45PM IST

BSE
(Since the beginning of the…)
NEW DELHI: The Sensex has rallied nearly 600 per cent in the past 20 years from 3,000 to nearly 27,000, but this has not been enough to enthuse retail investors.
For the record, the index today ended the day at 26,492.51; down 324 points; while Nifty shut shop at 7,932.90; down 109.10 points.
The participation of retail investors in the Indian equity market is yet to happen, but analysts are also not giving up on the idea that it will not happen at all.
They see the rally to continue in the long run, backed by fundaments, revival in economy , reforms taken by the new government and improving global outlook, which will infuse the much-needed confidence among retail participants.
India is firmly in a multi-year structural bull market, confirm analysts. Bull markets are actually life-altering events which can last up to 4-5 years. FIIs have been the main contributor to the rally that we have seen so far in the year 2014.
Since the beginning of the year, foreign investors have made a net investment of Rs 1.98 lakh crore ($33 billion) into the country's securities market.
"We don't know what starts a bull market, what is the matchstick or the tinderbox that starts it, but once it starts, it is amazing," said Ramesh Damani , Member, BSE.
The 1989 bull market demonstrated one thing that India was going to liberalise. What happened 20 years later? The 2000 bull market showed that India was going to become a tech superpower. Well, we became a tech superpower.
"The 2004 bull market saw the rise of the Indian middleclass. Well, that is happening now. So who knows where does this 2013 bull market start and where will it end? Bull markets actually are life-altering events," added Damani.
Let's look at some of the reasons why the equity cult died in India:
Lack of research by retail investors:
Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE, explains that most of the blame goes to retail investors themselves who do not research well and depend on others to make a decision.
They will take someone's tip in the lift and put Rs 20 lakh in it and for Rs 40,000 cellphone they will research it for two weeks, he added.
Ideally investors should understand the business, industry, nature of work of the company that they are investing in completely before putting their money into it. This will help them in making a good investment case, say analysts.
Investors should avoid investing based on recommendations. Instead they should utilise the opportunity to research those tips (companies) in detail to understand the business and logic before putting their hard-earned money.
Proper research should always be undertaken before investing in stocks. But that is rarely done. Investors generally go by the name of a company or the industry they belong to.
Investors try to time the market, which is not always a great idea:
One thing that even the world's greatest investor Warren Buffett doesn't do is try to time the stock market. However, investors back home rely heavily on the ideas of buying low and selling high.
But who decides these exact levels where they should either 'buy' or 'sell'? Well, nobody knows that for a fact. Or put differently, catching the tops and bottoms is a myth. It is so till today and will remain so in the future, say analysts.
A majority of investors, however, do just the opposite, something that financial planners have always been warning them to avoid, and thus lose their money in the process.
The biggest mistake on the part of retail investors is the fact that they come to the market when the market is doing well and they withdraw their money when the market is doing badly, explains Damani.
Too much expectation in short term:
Individual investors have a habit of falling prey to the herd mentality. They would believe on the other person more rather than their own instincts or research.
"Investors have excessive expectations in the short term, and very little patience over the long term. Unscrupulous and greedy promoters and merchant bankers add to the list," said Kalpraj Dharamshi, Proprietary Investor, in an interview with ET Now.
"IPOs have done a major disservice to investors because of may be out of 2000 IPOs over the last 15-20 years, 200 or less than that would be decent companies. All that money has just gone down in trade," he added.
Dharamshi is of the view that people look at the Nifty number and they decide everything about the market from that one number.
Trading with strict stop losses:
Investors should not expose their entire holding and trade with strict stop losses especially when the markets are trading near the higher end of the range.
When you are in a bull market, like the one that we are in right now, the only worry of retail investors is the bottom side.
"Make sure that you are protecting your capital and let the tide ride out. Every bull market I have seen in India has doubled or tripled the index sometimes. So why should this time be different," added Damani.

Optimism yet to turn into meaningful order inflow: Hercules01:30 pm
Hercules Hoists  is a manufacturer of material handling equipments that deals in various sectors across the economy such as infrastructure, manufacturing, power, etc.
Prakash Subramanian, President and CEO, Hercules Hoists feels there is a lot of optimism in the air that has yet to translate into meaningful order inflows.
The company’s total income in Q1 surged by 60 percent due to strike in comparable year, he says in an interview with CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Reema Tendulkar.
The debt-free company is looking at growing from a products company to a products and solutions company.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Yours is a company that is intricately linked to the economy. Have you seen a real pick up on the ground and what will growth in FY15 look like?
A: Our company is into the material handling business, which means that we are into hoisting equipments, we are into cranes, we are into stackers and so on and so forth. Our products are used in every possible sector of the economy. It could be in infrastructure, it could be in power, it could be in manufacturing and so on. We have a lot of optimism in the air but this optimism is yet to translate into hardcore business. So while we do know that more than Rs 20,000 crore of money is being planned to be pumped into the infrastructure and other sectors, this have to take off in terms of hardcore business because these projects have yet to start execution.
Q: Overall however, your total income in Q1 was significantly higher by around 60 percent if I am not mistaken. What led to that increase and what would your quarterly guidance be in terms of a run rate on revenues?
A: The simple reason for the increase was in Q1 of last year, we had an employee strike in the company. So Q1 numbers for last year were depressed in consequence and this year we have bounced back to our normal run rate.
Q: So this would be a normal run rate around Rs 30 crore that you would do every quarter?
A: Roughly, if the economy picks up, it should obviously do better but this is definitely the kind of run rate that are pushing for.
Q: What about the order book? Where does it currently stand at and any deals that you are bidding for?
A: In our business, it is not as if we get mega orders. Our orders are continuous, small sized and steady and the way things stand now looking at the way our standard products are, we have a delivery time of anywhere between two-six weeks for most of our standard products. So if I were to look at this two in perspective we would have an order book of about two-three months.
Q: What stood out is something that we addressed earlier during the break was your balance sheet which is completely clean. You have zero debt on the company. Can you take us through what your cash would be, whether you have any capex lined up and if in case you do have some funding requirements how will it be met?
A: One of the best points about Hercules Hoists is that we are a debt-free company. We have a good amount of cash surplus, which is invested in good Rs 20-30 crore easily, is invested in various kinds of liquid and short-term assets and the best part is that we are looking at growing the company from a standard products company to a products and solutions company. This means that as and when we get our technology organized, as and when we go into these solutions arena, we would also be looking at capex in a much more serious way.
Q: Overall, tell us what FY15 will look like in terms of a revenue growth as well as in terms of margins?
A: In terms of revenue growth, we definitely have to do what we were doing earlier in the range of about Rs 120 crore. If the market improves definitely, we should look doing much better than this.
On margins, again we would come back to our standard margin levels what we have been doing. Our profit before tax (PBT) last year was 25 percent, so it should definitely be plus that.
Q: Any guidance on your wind mill power business - extremely negligible in terms of revenue as well as profit but what is it there for, what are your plans for that?
A: We had invested in these windmills basically few years ago. The idea being that we would also be able to use this input into our production and so on and so forth. But basically, it is not in the standard line of business of the company. In the wind sector, the earnings are straightaway driven by how much wind you have in the year. So lesser the wind, lesser the power generation and lesser the power generation, lesser the income.
Q: The company is looking aggressively at new product developments, what are the key products that you are looking to launch soon and can there be a game changer?
A: Yes, we would look at this to be a game changer primarily because Hercules Hoists has traditionally been a mid-technology, mid-priced kind of company. Our products have not been hi-tech. they have not been very expensively priced neither are they the cheapest but what we have seen is an opportunity for us to bring in contemporary technologies, which are available with some of our international competitors. By investing significantly in terms of activities in the last one to one and a half years, we have now been able to come to a stage where we are ready to introduce products into the market, which are comparable with contemporary technologies worldwide. So this gives us an opening into the sectors where we were not present before on one hand and this also gives us the opportunity to look at export markets.
Hercules Hoists stock price
On November 21, 2014, Hercules Hoists closed at Rs 191.15, up Rs 1.95, or 1.03 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 225.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 93.55.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 5.76 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 33.19. The latest book value of the company is Rs 54.38 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 3.52.

Ahead of the Bell: US Producer Price Index... 
September 16, 2014 06:24 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Labor Department reports on U.S. producer price inflation in August. The report, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, will be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.
LITTLE INCREASE: Economists forecast that the producer price index rose 0.1 percent in August from the previous month, according to a survey by FactSet. That would match July's small gain and would be down from a 0.4 percent increase in June, which was driven by higher gas prices.
In the 12 months ending in July, wholesale prices rose just 1.7 percent, below a recent peak of 2.1 percent in April and also lower than the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2 percent.
MILD INFLATION: Higher food and gas costs pushed up producer prices earlier this year, briefly raising concerns that inflation might accelerate. But gas and food prices have since moderated, slowing wholesale inflation.
Wholesale gas prices fell 2.1 percent in July and natural gas costs also fell. That lowered energy prices 0.6 percent that month, the steepest fall since November.
That drop in wholesale gas prices has led to lower costs for consumers at the pump, leaving them more money to spend on other goods. The average price for a gallon of gas fell to $3.39 Monday, eight cents cheaper than a month ago.
Food prices, meanwhile, fell in May and June before rising just 0.4 percent in July. That's much lower than the big gains recorded earlier this year, when food prices soared 2.3 percent in April and 1.3 percent in March. They were driven higher by a drought in California and brutal winter storms and freezing temperatures in the Midwest.
Consumer prices have tended to track the costs for producers, rising just 0.1 percent in July. Consumer prices rose 2 percent in July compared with the previous year.
The Fed targets inflation at about 2 percent as a guard against deflation, which could drag down wages and spark another recession. At the same time, the Fed wants to avert excessive inflation and protect consumers and the purchasing power of the dollar.
Americans' paychecks, meanwhile, are barely increasing, which has limited consumers' willingness and ability to spend. That has made it harder for businesses to raise prices.
Low inflation has enabled the Fed to pursue extraordinary measures to boost the economy. It has begun to unwind some of those measures, cutting a monthly bond-buying program to $25 billion, from $85 billion last year.
Those bond purchases had ensured low interest rates that encouraged investors to pour money into the economy.

Ukraine  Scotland dent German investor optimism... 
September 16, 2014 06:18 AM EST | Associated Press
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — A key survey of German investor optimism fell in September for the ninth month in a row as the crisis in Ukraine, economic stagnation in Europe and the upcoming independence referendum in Scotland weighed on sentiment.
The ZEW institute said Tuesday its indicator of economic sentiment fell to 6.9 points from 8.6 points the month before. The index fell by less than expected; market analysts had foreseen a bigger drop to 5.0 points.
ZEW head Clemens Fuest said the downward trend "has slowed significantly." However, he said the economic climate is still characterized "by great uncertainty."
The index remains below its long-term average of 24.6 points.
It was based on a survey of 234 investment analysts conducted Sept. 1-15.

World Bank: Palestinian economy to shrink in 2014...and
versions
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Palestinian economy is expected to contract for the first time in seven years in 2014, the result of the recent Gaza war, continued Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on Palestinian trade and a drop in foreign aid, the World Bank said Tuesday.
The bank issued the report ahead of a meeting next week of donor nations to the Palestinians on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
The bleak forecast is a "wake-up call to everyone" that the status quo, particularly in Gaza, cannot continue, Steen Lau Jorgensen, the bank's top official in the West Bank and Gaza, told The Associated Press.
The bank predicts the overall Palestinian economy will shrink by 4 percent this year, ending a period of growth driven largely by international aid that began in 2007. The downturn is expected to be sharpest in war-battered Gaza, with a projected drop of 15 percent, the bank said.
Gaza has been largely sealed off by Israel and Egypt since the Islamic militant Hamas seized the territory in 2007, wresting control from Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, Israel and Hamas have engaged in three major rounds of conflict, including a 50-day war that ended in late August.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the latest war, about three-fourths of them civilians, and more than 17,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, according to the United Nations.
An international conference on raising funds for Gaza reconstruction is to be held Oct. 12 in Egypt, but the issue will also be the focus of a meeting next week in New York of representatives of key countries providing aid to the Palestinians. Palestinian officials estimate $6 billion is needed for Gaza reconstruction.
The World Bank said a unified Palestinian government must run the West Bank and Gaza, and restrictions on trade and movement in and out of Gaza must be eased considerably if reconstruction is to be a success.
Both seem remote possibilities.
Hamas and Abbas agreed earlier this year to form a unity government of experts in the West Bank and Gaza under Abbas' leadership. But key disputes remain unresolved and the government has not begun working.
Hamas appears unwilling to hand over power in Gaza, including control over the security forces, even though it agreed to the formation of the unity government, largely in hopes that this would offer a way out of a deepening financial crisis.
At the same time, it is unlikely Israel or Egypt will agree to ease restrictions on Gaza as long as Hamas remains the de facto ruler there. As part of the border blockade, Israel and Egypt bar virtually all exports from Gaza.
Israel allows imports of most consumer goods, but severely restricts the influx of construction materials for fear they could be diverted by Hamas for military purposes, such as building attack tunnels. A network of such tunnels was uncovered and destroyed by Israel during the last Gaza war.
Jorgensen, the World Bank official, said a unity government and an easing of restrictions are key to unlocking donor funds.
"It's not clear that you would have substantial amounts ... of new money coming in if there is no unified governance framework," he said. He added that under Israel's restrictions on bringing construction materials into Gaza, it would take 18 years just to rebuild the homes destroyed in the last Gaza war and meet housing demand.
Even without the task of rebuilding Gaza, the Palestinian Authority, Abbas' self-rule government based in the West Bank, faces a funding shortfall of about $350 million in 2014, the bank said.
The bank has repeatedly said that the Palestinian Authority can only reduce its dependence on foreign aid through economic growth which, in turn, has been hampered by continued Israeli restrictions on development.
According to the bank's projections, the West Bank economy is likely to stagnate this year, with about 0.5 percent growth, while the Gaza economy is expected to shrink by 15 percent.
Jorgensen said that aid to the Palestinian Authority should continue as long as it keeps along the path of fiscal reform. "I think no one wants the Palestinian Authority to collapse," he said. "The humanitarian disaster would be so immense."

Mitsubishi to build new car plant in Indonesia... 
September 16, 2014 05:55 AM EST | Associated Press
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Tuesday it will build a new car factory in Indonesia as part of a plan to raise its production capacity in the country from 160,000 to 240,000 vehicles per year.
Chief Executive Osamu Masuko said the Japanese automaker will invest $600 million in the assembly plant.  He said construction is expected to begin in May next year in Bekasi, a West Java town just east of the capital Jakarta.
The plant would begin production of multi-purpose vehicles in 2017, Masuko said after a meeting with Indonesian's Ministry of Industry M.S. Hidayat. Multi-purpose vehicles are also known as people carriers because they comfortably transport more people than regular cars.
Masuko said the growth potential of Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with 240 million people, was a reason for building the plant.
The factory's annual production of 80,000 vehicles would mostly be sold locally with about a quarter exported to the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries.
The Association of Indonesian Automotive Manufacturers expects Indonesia's car sales to increase by 10 percent this year to 1.3 million vehicles, helped by sales of low cost green cars.

China rig finds gas after Vietnam sea standoff... 
IAN MADER | September 16, 2014 05:47 AM EST | Associated Press
BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese exploration rig at the center of a tense maritime standoff with Vietnam earlier this year has made its first deep sea gas discovery in the politically volatile South China Sea, state media announced Tuesday.
The discovery by China National Offshore Oil Corp. was made about a month after its rig withdrew in July from Vietnam's exclusive economic zone to far less-contested waters closer to China.
The find by CNOOC's two-year-old, $1 billion deep sea rig is about 150 kilometers south of China's southernmost island of Hainan. It's unclear whether the discovery will become commercially viable, but the announcement represents a significant step in China's ability to seek resources beneath the South China Sea.
Petroleum reserves and fisheries are among the resources at stake in disputes over the sea, which is one of the world's busiest shipping routes and a patchwork of overlapping claims by governments including China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan. China claims virtually all of the South China Sea.
The find was China's first without the participation of foreign partners that in the past have included companies such as Chevron and BP, said Felix Tan, a Beijing-based analyst for energy and resources consultant Wood MacKenzie.
"This is the first discovery they've done all by themselves," Tan said in an interview. CNOOC has rapidly developed a deep-water exploration capability, he said.
"It's a bit premature to talk about the viability" of the field, however, Tan said. "There are a lot of tests to be done."
The gas field was discovered Aug. 18 at a depth of about 1,500 meters, CNOOC said on its website.
The depth is at the extreme cusp of what the industry considers a deep-water field, or those from 400 to 1,500 meters. Below 1,500 meters would be ultra-deep, where extraordinary pressures make the building of facilities extremely difficult.
Xinhua said the field's viability is still to be proven, but quoted a CNOOC manager, Xie Yuhong, as saying the well could be capable of producing up to 56.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, or about 9,400 barrels.

Russian ruble drops to historic low amid sanctions...and
versions
MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's currency dropped to an all-time low against the dollar on Tuesday as investors fret about long-term economic damage from Western sanctions.
The United States and the European Union last week imposed a new round of sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine that consisted in, among other things, blocking off Western financial markets to key Russian companies.
The Russian currency fell more than 1 percent to 38.80 rubles against the U.S. dollar by noon Moscow time Tuesday. The ruble has lost over 2.7 percent in just two days.
The Russian Central Bank allows the ruble to trade in a range against the dollar and sometimes intervenes in markets to prop it up. It has not been doing so in the past months, however, leaving the ruble to trade only 0.40 rubles away from the minimum level.
Economist Alexei Kudrin, who served as finance minister under President Vladimir Putin for 11 years until 2011, said Tuesday that the sanctions could send Russia into a long recession.
"The sanctions that have been imposed are going to have an effect (on the economy) for the next one or two years because they have limited opportunities for investment in this uncertain environment," Russian news agency Interfax quoted him as saying.
Most recently, the U.S. on Friday tightened the maximum credit duration for several state-owned Russian companies and banks to 30 days, effectively shutting them off from long-term loans. The U.S. and the EU indicated they may reverse some of the sanctions if they see Moscow supporting the peace process in Ukraine, where more than 3,000 have died since mid-April.
The Kremlin has promised to support companies that were hit with sanctions. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Monday the government may use $8 billion from the state pension fund to help them if needed.
Market jitters were further fueled by reports that the Russian government is preparing more retaliatory import bans, which could ultimately hurt Russian consumer spending. Russia in August banned imports of dairy products, meat and vegetables from the EU and the U.S., causing price hikes for some items.
Amid the uncertainty, investors continue to pull money out of the country at an accelerating pace. Experts like Kudrin predict some $110 billion could be withdrawn this year, almost twice as much as last year's $61 billion.

Your Stocks: Top chart picks by market expertsWatch the interview of Vishal Malkan, CMT at malkansview.com and Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO of ITI Wealth Management Pvt Ltd with Reema Tendulkar & Sumaira Abidi on CNBC-TV18, in which they spoke about specific stocks and sectors.
Below in the verbatim transcript of interview:
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO at ITI Wealth management
State Bank of India
In long term if one is willing to hold  State Bank of India (SBI) for couple of years I think you can get a target for Rs 3,200. Because State Bank of India is a play on the economic growth of the country and given that we are expecting the economy to grow at least by 6 percent for the next financial year and probably 6.5-7 percent for the year thereafter, State Bank of India also participate in that growth through increases its loans and advances as well as net interest margins.
I think non-performing assets (NPAs) have probably played out for State Bank of India and the worst is over relating to the stressed assets. So we are probably bottoming out on the NPAs front and this should be a good time to stay invested or may be if the bank does correct further then one can even look at accumulating at lower level.
Venus Remedies
Venus Remedies  is one of those midcap pharma companies which have been growing at a very good pace. Consequently the share price also has risen significantly over the last couple of months. But like many of the smaller companies you know when they expand very quickly you see a lot of pressure on their balance sheet.
Recently CRISIL has downgraded them to default because they have been unable to make some payments on their loans and that has put little bit of stress on their balance sheet. So given that the cycle until this issue is resolved you’re likely to see a little bit more downside because there could be further unwinding and this default can actually create cash flow problems because the company starts to move its working capital towards payment of loans, which is diverting short term uses of funds to longer term repayment and that could put the company into the severe cash flow problems.
At this point of time its better to wait till the numbers come out for the next quarter and then you have an idea what the balance sheet and how it is and then you can take a better call. At this point of time it may be worthwhile if one is a short term trader to cash out.
Vishal Malkan, CMT at malkansview.com
Bank of Baroda
If one is looking for a medium to long term then definitely  Bank of Baroda is a good stock and one can hold on to it for a while and he/she can see good returns on that may be Rs 1,000 plus rates can be seen. But for the time being as we see today’s correction, we can expect Bank of Baroda to retrace back to Rs 890-880, which could be again a good buying level.
Their might be some kind of consolidation in next few days in the banking sectors as we have seen a good run up in the last few days. So one should hold on for a long period of time with a stoploss of Rs 830.

Commodity Market Regulator Seeks NSEL-FTIL MergerHigh-Price Stocks: 1 Share at Price of a Smartphone
New Delhi: Stating that crisis-hit NSEL is "bereft of any credibility", regulator FMC today said it has recommended the government to consider merger of the spot commodity exchange with its promoter FTIL for speedy recovery of dues over Rs 5,300 crore from defaulters.
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Both Corporate Affairs and Finance Ministries are studying the feasibility of implementing the FMC's proposals.
"The commission, vide its letter dated August 18, has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to consider the merger/amalgamation of NSEL with FTIL in public interest so that the human and financial resources of FTIL are also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters at NSEL," FMC said in its latest report.
The recommendation has been given to the government in view of the depleted resources in terms of manpower and financial strength available at the disposal of NSEL, it said.
Also, "NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and physically incapable of affecting any substantial recovery from the defaulting members," it observed.
The regulator has also recommended the government to consider taking over of the management of FTIL, thereby ensure the company takes full responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.
Taking over the FTIL management will help manage the affairs of the company in in a professional way by bringing in an institutionalised framework as recommended by the Working Group appointed by the government, it added.
NSEL, a subsidiary of the Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd, has recovered so far a little over Rs 360 crore of dues from defaulters out of the total outstanding amount of Rs 5,689 crore.

Gold, Silver Up on Increased Buying, Firm Global Cues

Oil Down on Fed Uncertainty Over US Economy; OPEC in Focus
New Delhi: Gold prices rose further by Rs 10 to Rs 27,460 per 10 grams in the national capital today on increased buying by jewellers and retailers for the upcoming festive season amid a firming global trend.
Silver followed suit and advanced by Rs 100 to Rs 41,600 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Marketmen said apart from increased buying by jewellers and retailers to meet upcoming festive season demand, a firming global trend on speculation prices near an eight-month low will spur more buying as the US Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting, also boosted the sentiment.
Gold in London, which normally sets the price trend on the domestic front, rose by 0.3 per cent to $1,236.63 an ounce and silver by 0.2 per cent to $18.72 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity added Rs 10 each to Rs 27,460 and Rs 27,260 per ten gram respectively.
It had gained Rs 80 yesterday.
Sovereigns, however, moved in a tight range in scattered deals and settled at last level of Rs 24,400 per piece of eight grams.
Similarly, silver ready rose further by Rs 100 to Rs 41,600 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 90 to Rs 41,540 per kg. The white metal had gained Rs 250 in last trade.
On the other hand, silver coins maintained a steady trend at Rs 71,000 for buying and Rs 72,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Already Stores Start Christmas Shopping Frenzy EarlyStores start Christmas shopping frenzy early
Ben Popken TODAY
Summer isn't even officially over, but stores have already started trotting out their Christmas displays and holiday promotions.
If you're looking for someone to blame, look in the mirror, and take off that Santa hat!
Stores say they're doing this in response to customer demand. According to the National Retail Federation, 20 percent of all Americans have already started their Christmas shopping. By Halloween, they expect that number to double.
Video: Retail stores are already trying to entice holiday shoppers, and holiday displays are going up in early September. NBC’s Kerry Sanders reports from Clearwater, Florida.
In a cheeky nod to to the season, Kmart rolled out a "not Christmas commercial" in order to prime customers to begin socking away goodies for the holidays. It touts the chain's new "no money down" layaway program that makes it even easier to start a layaway plan.
In some ways that's gentler on consumers' pocketbooks. But the change makes the layaway plan a little more like a different form of credit, and a little less like a tool for budgeting and saving.
That's potentially problematic as layaway is sometimes a  choice of last resort for consumers who have either rejected or are unable to use credit cards . This year Americans are carrying more debt on their cards than they have in 6 years, totaling about 28 billion dollars. For some, that means they have less available credit. For others, it means they're more willing to run up a bit of debt for a while. 
After a lackluster holiday shopping season last year and middling back-to-school results, retailers are looking for low-risk ways to get shoppers to open up their wallets. Other retailers launched their layaway programs this month with looser rules as well, with Toys R' Us getting rid of its $5 service fee and Wal-Mart also easing up on its requirements.
It may seem like Christmas gets earlier every year but Kmart actually started promoting its layaway program the same time last year. The new normal is that "'tis the season" simply has a much longer ramp-up time to cater to interested customers. The rest of us just have to get used to seeing wreathes and pine cones mixed among the pumpkins and black cats on the store shelves.

US-Based Gilead Licenses Hepatitis C Drug to Cipla  Ranbaxy  5 OthersSebi Bars Four Season Farms From Disposing Assets
New Delhi/Mumbai: US drug maker Gilead Sciences Inc on Monday said it has licensed its hepatitis C drug to seven companies including Cipla Ltd and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd to make it available in 91 developing countries including India.
Cadila Healthcare, Mylan Laboratories Ltd, Sequent Scientific Ltd, Strides Arcolab Ltd and Hetero Drugs Ltd are the others who will now be able to make and sell the Sovaldi generic, the company said in a statement.
The companies will be allowed to set their own prices for the generic drug, and will pay a royalty on their earned sales to Gilead, it said.
Gilead's Sovaldi, chemically sofosbuvir, is hailed as a breakthrough in treating hepatitis C, but the company has come under fire over its product's $1,000-per-pill price tag in the United States.

Apple sells 4 million iPhone 6s on first dayApple sold 4 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in first day

iPhone 6 or 6 Plus: Which should you buy?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Apparently, a lot of people want the iPhone 6.
Apple sold a record 4 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones on Friday, the first day that the new iGadgets were available for pre-order, the company said Monday.
Demand for the new iPhones was so high that the iPhone 6 Plus sold out within hours. While many people who pre-ordered the iPhone 6 will get them this Friday, many others won't get their iPhones delivered until next month.
"Demand for the new iPhones exceeds the initial pre-order supply," Apple said in a statement. The company noted that an additional supply of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones will be made available to walk-in customers on Friday Sept. 19, beginning at 8:00 a.m. local time at Apple stores. People have already begun camping outside Apple Stores around the world to be among the first to get their hands on one of the new iPhones.

This is the first year that Apple announced how many iPhones it sold in the first day -- rather than in the first weekend. A year ago, Apple said it sold 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C smartphones in the first weekend .
 
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus: Which should you buy?
But the numbers aren't exactly "apples to apples," pardon the pun. The iPhone 5S was not available for pre-order. Also, the iPhone 5S went on sale in China at the same time as as it hit store shelves in the United States.
This year, the iPhone 6 will not be available in China until at earliest October. China was not listed among the 30 countries that will get the iPhone this month.

Offer for Italian Steelmaker Lucchini Below $100 Million: JSWSebi Bars Four Season Farms From Disposing Assets
Mumbai/London: JSW Steel has offered less than $100 million (Rs 600 crore at 1 dollar = 60 rupees) for troubled Italian steelmaker Lucchini's core assets in Piombino and will not take on any of the company's debt, JSW chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Monday.
The comments were Mr Jindal's first since Lucchini, Italy's second-largest steelmaker by capacity, announced late last week that it was considering a binding offer from JSW.
"The Lucchini acquisition cost will be sub-$100 million," Mr Jindal told reporters on the sidelines of a Mumbai lecture series, adding that JSW would not take on any debt.
A spokesman for Lucchini declined to comment.
Lucchini, previously owned by Russia's Severstal, was declared insolvent in 2012 and placed under special administration - a procedure designed to save large companies and avoid heavy job losses.
Italian media reports had previously speculated that heavy liabilities and a need to protect jobs meant that Lucchini could be sold for only one euro.
"The fact that JSW are not assuming any debt is positive. EU steel demand is about 30 per cent below the 2008 financial crisis, and Italy was back in recession in Q2 2014, so JSW are not buying something that has upside in the short or even the medium term," said VTB Capital's head of commodities research, Wiktor Bielski.
The Piombino complex employs about 2,000 people and can produce 2.5 million tonnes of steel a year. The Italian government has taken a keen interest in its sale as it struggles to pull the country out of its third recession in six years.

Regulator Seeks NSEL-FTIL MergerHigh-Price Stocks: 1 Share at Price of a Smartphone
New Delhi: Stating that crisis-hit NSEL is "bereft of any credibility", regulator FMC today said it has recommended the government to consider merger of the spot commodity exchange with its promoter FTIL for speedy recovery of dues over Rs 5,300 crore from defaulters.
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Both Corporate Affairs and Finance Ministries are studying the feasibility of implementing the FMC's proposals.
"The commission, vide its letter dated August 18, has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to consider the merger/amalgamation of NSEL with FTIL in public interest so that the human and financial resources of FTIL are also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters at NSEL," FMC said in its latest report.
The recommendation has been given to the government in view of the depleted resources in terms of manpower and financial strength available at the disposal of NSEL, it said.
Also, "NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and physically incapable of affecting any substantial recovery from the defaulting members," it observed.
The regulator has also recommended the government to consider taking over of the management of FTIL, thereby ensure the company takes full responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.
Taking over the FTIL management will help manage the affairs of the company in in a professional way by bringing in an institutionalised framework as recommended by the Working Group appointed by the government, it added.
NSEL, a subsidiary of the Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd, has recovered so far a little over Rs 360 crore of dues from defaulters out of the total outstanding amount of Rs 5,689 crore.
Recently, FMC had said that the NSEL has not made much progress in recovery of dues from defaulters, which the spot exchange refuted saying the watchdog has adequate powers to speed up efforts to get back the investor money.

Apple Will Allow Ingrate Public to Return the Sacred Gift of U2Busy bestowing gifts on those who will never appreciate them.
Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
Realizing that some users might feel a little icky about the corporate crypt keepers of their personal media collections reaching a ghastly digital arm through the Internet and foisting a U2 album into 500 million iTunes libraries, Apple has backtracked slightly.
Apple posted specific instructions for removing U2’s Songs of Innocence from users’ libraries six days after gifting the album to every iTunes user and automatically downloading it from the cloud into the libraries of those who had that feature enabled. Apple went as far as to create a specific link to automatically remove the album in only four more manual steps than the process that put it there.

I’m being hyperbolic with the affront here, but it’s a creepy precedent, and over the weekend I did have to skip over U2 songs I never asked for on my phone. Also, is Apple betraying a note of petulance in its page title, which refers to an "iTunes gift album"? Come on you ingrates, we bought you a present, and this is the thanks we get? It's almost as if people have no idea how much it costs to buy 500 million U2 albums directly from Bono. It's almost as if... people have never heard of U2 .

Sensex, Nifty Hit Record; Banks Surge on Kotak-ING Deal
BSE Sensex and Nifty fell over 1 per cent amid sharp losses in oil & gas, real estate and banking stocks.
The losses in Indian markets tracked a fall in global shares, which slipped to a one-month low on Tuesday as markets braced for a Federal Reserve meeting later this week. Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, was down 0.2 per cent after hitting its lowest level since mid-August earlier in the session.
The Sensex ended 324 points lower at 26,492 after suffering its biggest one-day fall in over a month. Nifty fell 109 points to end at 7,932.
The selling pressure was stronger in broader markets with BSE midcap index falling 3.4 per cent while smallcap index slumped nearly 4 per cent.
Imtiyaz Qureshi, co-founder and director of Investeria Financial Services, said Nifty has support at 7,914 levels and if this level is breached on a closing basis, there could be another 100 point correction in Nifty.
Selling pressure by foreign investors also weighed on Indian markets. Overseas investors sold index futures worth Rs 1,394 crore on Monday, exchange data showed. Foreign funds also sold cash shares worth Rs 74.6 crore in the previous session.
With Federal Reserve poised to indicate monetary stance, emerging market currencies are seeing stress, said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin. The rupee yesterday fell to a one-month low against the dollar and today ended marginally higher at 61.07.
Among Nifty stocks, Tata Power fell over 6 per cent to be the biggest loser. BPCL fell nearly 5 per cent while heavyweights ONGC and Reliance Industries fell over 2 per cent. In the banking and financial services pack, Axis Bank and PNB fell over 3 per cent.

Inflation Drops to Five-year Low on Fall in Fuel  Food PricesWholesale price inflation in August eased to 3.74 per cent, its lowest level in nearly five years, government data showed on Monday. An easing in food and fuel prices helped the August inflation cool off significantly.
In July, wholesale prices rose 5.19 per cent year-on-year, their slowest pace in five months.
During August, food inflation eased to 5.15 per cent against 8.43 per cent in July, aided by a 44.70 per cent year-on-year fall in onion prices.
The fuel and power inflation eased to 4.54 per cent in August against 7.40 per cent in July. A sharp fall in Brent crude prices saw petrol prices cut thrice in August. There are expectations that diesel prices may be cut for the first time in seven years. India imports three-fourth of its oil needs and a strong rupee helps cut import bill. The relative stability of the rupee against the dollar has also helped bring down the landed cost of crude.
(Read:  Diesel Price May Be Cut, First In 7 Years )
The Reserve Bank of India's next policy review meet is scheduled for September 30. Retail inflation, which the RBI tracks for setting lending rates, edged down marginally to 7.8 per cent in August from 7.96 per cent a month earlier. The retail inflation data was released on Friday.
DK Joshi, senior director & chief economist at CRISIL, said he does not expect the Reserve Bank cutting rates soon. The RBI will watch the inflation trend for a few months before taking any decision, he said.
The reading for June WPI inflation was revised to 5.66 per cent from 5.43 per cent earlier. (With inputs from Reuters)

IDFC to Begin Setting Up of Holding Company Soon
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 15, 2014 22:53 (IST)
Sebi Bars Four Season Farms From Disposing Assets
Mumbai: Infrastructure finance company IDFC, which recently raised Rs 1,000 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP), will soon start the process of transferring its assets and liabilities to a new holding company as part of transforming itself into a bank.
"The next step (after QIP) in the process of opening of the bank is transferring the assets and liabilities on the IDFC's balance sheet to a subsidiary which will become the bank," IDFC chairman Rajiv Lall told reporters on the sidelines of an annual banking summit organised in Mumbai by Ficci on Monday evening.
The city-based company recently completed its process to bring down the foreign holdings to meet the regulatory requirement of converting itself into a bank, the licence for which was bagged the infra lender in April along with the Kolkata-based micro-lender Bandhan.
The apex bank has made it mandatory for all those NBFCs and other financial sector players which bag banking licences, to surrender their existing business by transferring the assets and liabilities into a non-operative financial holding company.
This stringent demand made some of the leading NBFCs like Tata Capital and Mahindra Finance to withdraw their application in the run-up to the licensing process that came after 11 years and saw just two out of the 24 applicants passing the RBI test.
"With Rs 1,000 crore which was raised, foreign ownership such as FIIs, FDI, NRIs, has come down to within the statutory limit that has been imposed upon us as part of the regulation to transform us into a bank," Mr Lall said.
He said that the foreign holding, which was earlier 51 per cent, has come down to 49 per cent.
When asked why the QIP was offered at discount, he said, "The cardinal rule of raising capital is that the people you raise it from should be happy. So it is always good to leave a little bit of money on their table and not try to extract the last penny from investors. So in that spirit we gave a small discount and it was a very successful issue."

Banks Need Over $200 Billion Capital in 5 Years: FitchRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
New Delhi: Rating agency Fitch on Monday said Indian banks will require more than $200 billion (about Rs 12 lakh crore) in fresh capital as they prepare for the full implementation of Basel III capital requirements by March 2019.
The core capital position of the Indian banking system is weaker than that of many Asian banking systems that are also migrating towards the Basel III capital norms, a Fitch study said.
State-owned banks to account for 85 per cent of the capital requirement. As per the estimates, public sector banks require Rs 2.40 lakh crore equity capital by March 2019.
These banks account for a higher proportion of stressed assets - their stressed assets formed around 12 per cent of total system assets in 2013-14 compared with 10 per cent for the system - and have lower profitability, which have added to their capitalisation pressures.
Private lenders are much better positioned in terms of their capital levels and access to markets.
Stressed assets in the Indian banking system are likely to peak around 2014-15, though there will be near-term pressures due to economic slowdown and existing structural and policy-related constraints. Any improvement after that will be gradual, it said.
Banks are likely to raise mostly core equity and additional Tier 1 capital to meet the capital shortfall, it said, adding, capital raising, thus far, has been limited to a few banks, though Fitch expects greater momentum for the latter going forward.
Recent amendments by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to Basel III capital guidelines have created a more favourable environment for creditors and broadened the pool of investors, it said.
It may take more time for the banks to raise core equity capital because valuations have yet to recover, Fitch further said.

Apples 4 million iPhone 6 pre-orders in contextApple says it set a new record.(AP Photo/John Minchillo)
SHARE
Dan Frommer @fromedome
September 15, 2014
Apple sold 4 million of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in 24 hours—a record, according to the Wall Street Journal (paywall). How does that compare to other iPhone launches—and its normal sales rate?
Over the past year, through the company’s June quarter, Apple sold 163.7 million iPhones. That’s about 449,000 per day.
The Christmas period, Apple’s December quarter, is typically the busiest. Last year, Apple sold 51 million iPhones in 91 days. That’s about 560,000 per day.
Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C models on opening weekend last year, including pre-orders. Previous opening weekends:  5 million  for the iPhone 5 (including 2 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours);  4 million  for the iPhone 4S;  1.7 million for the iPhone 4; “ over 1 million ” for the iPhone 3GS; and 1 million for the iPhone 3G.
Apple sold 270,000 original iPhones during the first 30 hours of sales in June 2007.

How will this year’s opening weekend sales tally up? They actually may be smaller than last year’s for two reasons. First, supply—Apple quickly sold out of its first wave of iPhone 6 pre-orders. It’s not known how many units are being saved for walk-up customers, but it would be surprising if it was enough for the company to get close to last year’s opening weekend sales tally. And second, it’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison—the iPhone lineup is broader and priced differently this year.
Still, compared to other phone launches, and launches of consumer electronics in general, 4 million in 24 hours is pretty impressive. For example, Microsoft boasted last year that its Xbox One set a new record by selling more than 1 million units in its first 24 hours.

It’s not just decisions at the table that set responsible gamblers apart from gambling addicts. People who gamble for fun and keep a lid on their losses also act differently in their preparation and general approach to this potentially addictive pastime.
That’s the conclusion of researchers who surveyed 1,484 non-addicted gamblers in the UK to learn the habits of “positive players,” or gamblers who don’t give into reckless behavior when they gamble. (It should be noted that these habits, from a  study published last week in the Journal of Gambling Studies, are self-reported). Here’s what the study found:
What they play
Share
Tap image to zoom
The study subjects were found through the National Lottery, so it’s conceivable that there are more lottery players in this bunch than in the general population of gamblers. Aside from the lottery and scratch cards, two gambling options that are available everywhere and don’t require a large investment of time or money, responsible gamblers play less frequently than potential problem gamblers.
Where they play
In the UK, most casual gambling happens online (this sort of gambling is still illegal in most of the US ), or at the supermarket, a convenient enough place for most people. The responsible types generally don’t seek out casinos or racetracks.
Tap image to zoom
Why they play
People who aren’t addicted to gambling play because they want to have some fun, or want to feel the excitement that comes with a good hand. Potential problem gamblers often turn to gambling because of how they feel—they reported gambling more because they were depressed, bored, or upset, according to the study.
Tap image to zoom
How they control their play
According to the study, responsible gamblers use a variety of methods—more so than problem gamblers—to control how much they lose when gambling (because you will lose eventually, based on the odds). Nearly all of them set a spending limit beforehand; some reinforce that limit by only taking a certain amount of money with them, or leaving their ATM cards at home.
Not all responsible gamblers act the same way. But the researchers found they generally can be split into two groups—the majority, 63%, are “casual dreamers,” while  28% are “responsible thrill seekers.” Casual dreamers are older, averaging 49 years, and they’re looking for an enjoyable playing experience rather than a large prize. They’re less likely than their thrill-seeking counterparts to engage spending-control strategies, besides setting a limit on how much they’re willing to risk. Responsible thrill seekers, meanwhile, are younger, with an average age of 41, and they edge closer to potential problem gamblers—they play a variety of games with more frequency than the casual dreamers, and they are more motivated more by their emotions as a reason for playing. What makes them notably different from potential problem gamblers is their propensity to set limits on how much they’ll bet or how long they’ll play.

Who won New York Fashion Week (according to Twitter)Fashion
September 15, 2014
Last week, a colleague asked me facetiously, in regards to New York Fashion Week: “So who won?” It’s a question that could be answered many ways, of course. Marc Jacobs always wins. Opening Ceremony got coolest show. Hood by Air is the label to know. Thom Browne takes best use of hats . Eckhaus Latta, weirdest shoes . And so on. But according to Twitter metrics and The New York Times , there was one winner and his name is Michael Kors.
Share
Tap image to zoom
The Times reports that between the official dates of New York Fashion Week, September 4-11, Kors’ name and/or Twitter handle was shared about 113,000 times. But does that really mean he won?

In Kors’ case, it very well might. With a business expanding in Asia  and a near 50% jump in net sales last quarter, the designer has many reasons to be optimistic. His sunny, crisp collection reflected that.
Once upon a time, Fashion Week was a mere trade show for a relatively short list of editors and buyers. Today, designers grapple with a global audience that’s exploding via social media, to varying results. Runway shows are giving way to performance art and all-out spectacle, which often is rewarded by the Twitter-sphere.
While the clothes were important, Kors’ popularity on Twitter last week probably had as much to do with the celebrity presence at his show—Jessica Chastain, Jada Pinkett Smith, Olivia Munn, and Mary J. Blige were all in attendance —and a social media-friendly livestream complete with #Korslive hashtag. It also couldn’t have hurt that Kors gave fashion bloggers front-row treatment .

They’re smiling. But are they tweeting?(Reuters/Brendan McDermid)
But at least we saw the clothes. The same could not be said of Ralph Lauren’s “4-D” runway show for Polo: a video projected onto the mist of a fountain in the middle of Central Park. If the goal of the spectacle was to be shared via social media, it worked. But I gave up on Instagram that night, when feeds were clogged with blurry photos of the video projection, captured in the dark. Perhaps in-person it was magical, but the photos left something to be desired. In any case, topped off with Julianne Moore and a much-photographed shirtdress at Lauren’s eponymous runway show the following morning, it earned the designer the number two spot on the Twitter list.
Miley Cyrus undoubtedly gave Alexander Wang a bump when she wore pasties  to his after-party, and reveled for the many, many cellphone cameras in attendance. She walked the runway at Jeremy Scott’s show, too, which may be the only thing a lot of people could tell you about it.
I didn’t attend Marc Jacobs’ show , but from the comfort of my desk I did watch the live-stream, accompanied by a #MarcJacobsLIVE hashtag on Twitter. Attendees were provided with headphones through which a sensory audio soundtrack was streamed. The same was provided online, so I put in my earbuds and heard a cacophony of sound effects and a narrator who recalled the computer-generated voice of Stephen Hawking, while models strode down a hot pink shag carpet, around a matching house.

At the end of the show, the narrator left us—I felt included in the audience, even at my computer—with a parting thought, excerpted from the 1976 short film “The Girl Chewing Gum,” before the models made a final exit to silence and nature sounds: “There’s been too much going on. Can we move the house to a place where nothing ever happens and things are slower? I’ll be happy there.”
Perhaps we tweeted slightly less about Jacobs’ show because we were consumed by the experience—and that may have been part of the message.

How Crazy Pants Landed One CEO a Gig With Google (Seriously)Never mind about business casual

This article originally appeared in Business Insider. 
Joe Garvey, founder and CEO of a scavenger hunt startup called CLASH, estimates that he owes about 20 percent of his company's 2014 revenue to his crazy pants. Seriously.

Garvey owns half a dozen pairs of bright-colored or patterned pants that he says win him about five compliments per hour, on average, when he's hanging out in downtown San Francisco.
CLASH
The key is turning those compliments into conversations, and those conversations into connections that lead to business deals. Garvey told Business Insider that he landed one of CLASH's early gigs with Google after an employee he met at a bagel shopped was "floored by the pants."
"We were talking, and she said she worked at Google, and I told her that I set up scavenger hunts for tech companies," Garvey says. "She said, 'Oh, my team is always looking for off-site ideas!' and next thing you know, we're putting together a hunt for them."
CLASH
CLASH, which launched in 2012, has hosted events for Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Lyft, Vox, Yelp, Pinterest, Fitbit, Cisco, Pandora, and Sony, among others. Garvey describes the hunts—which typically involve drinking, neon facepaint, and goofy pictures —as "high octane."
The company is on track to reel in $1 million in revenue this year (and, as an incentive, Garvey promised his employees he'd get his nipples pierced if CLASH doesn't hit that target).
Garvey buys most of his crazy pants from a company called LoudMouth Golf , which also supplies loud trousers to the likes of Bill Murray and George Lopez.
He got his first pair when LoudMouth sponsored a "Pub Golf Crawl" event that he put on. After the party, he started wearing the pants out-and-about and couldn't believe how many people would compliment his style.
"I just felt so great!" he says. "They're the ultimate ice-breaker."
Here's another pair:

Could IUDs Be the Next Great Weapon in the Battle Against PovertyThis little piece of plastic could reduce single motherhood.

There aren’t any simple solutions to poverty. But of the tools we have, making effective birth control cheap and easily available for low-income women is pretty much a no-brainer. Growing contraception use has already helped bring down America’s teen pregnancy rate to its lowest levels in more than half a century. And in a New York Times op-ed published this weekend , Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution makes a compelling case that the humble IUD could help halt the ongoing rise of single mothers, who are disproportionately impoverished.
Jordan Weissmann
Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.
Here’s Sawhill’s argument, slightly condensed. “Marriage is disappearing,” she writes, and out-of-wedlock childbirth is becoming the norm, with more than 40 percent of new mothers unmarried. Some conservatives say the government should respond by working harder to promote matrimony—but they have little idea of how to do it . Some liberals (including yours truly ) say we need to accept widespread single motherhood as a fact of American life and expand the safety net to accommodate them—but that will, admittedly, cost money.

Sawhill believes we should split the difference. “What we need instead is a new ethic of responsible parenthood,” she writes. That starts with making sure women don’t get pregnant before they’re ready, since almost 70 percent of out-of-wedlock pregnancies are unplanned. How? In part by raising awareness about the challenges of single motherhood, and in part by promoting IUDs and other long-acting reversible contraceptives that are inserted in a woman’s body and must be removed by a doctor.
Many women, Sawhill reasons, end up pregnant because they misuse their birth control (the pill doesn’t work if you forget to take it). But IUDs and implants are basically foolproof—according to one major study, they are 22 times less likely to fail than the pill—because they don't require effort to use once implanted. Although the devices have had a troubled reputation due to health scares they caused in the 1970s and 80s , today’s models are safe. And while price turns some women off from them—an IUD can cost $1,000 upfront—Obamacare now requires health plans to cover the whole cost of the devices, just like other contraceptives. Medicaid also pays for them in states that have expanded the program under health reform. But Sawhill thinks we should do even more to make long-acting contraceptives widely available, for instance by educating doctors who aren't up to speed on their benefits.
“If these or other new forms of contraception were more accessible and less costly, and if more people understood how effective and convenient they are, unplanned pregnancies would decline,” she writes.
The nice thing about Sawhill’s argument is that, even if she frames it as a third path between conservative and liberal approaches to fighting poverty, it can complement either nicely—unless social attitudes get in the way. You won’t find many progressives who are opposed to the idea of making effective contraceptives available on the cheap to every poor woman in America. Fiscal conservatives could get on board, too, since helping low-income women avoid unintended pregnancy prevents the government from having to make welfare program payments when the child is born. According to Brookings’ calculations , preventing an unplanned pregnancy saves Washington at least five times what it costs. You’re most likely to find opposition from the religious traditionalists, like the groups that have challenged Obamacare's contraception mandate in court, who just can’t abide the idea of subsidizing birth control on principle. But good policy ideas are always going to make somebody unhappy.

As a conservative I have never understood why my fellow conservatives would object to this. More women who are unable to properly care for children not having them. It looks like a win for everyone to me.   More...

We shouldn't expect better birth control availability to work miracles. Researchers have found that around 40 percent of accidental pregnancies result from the misuse of contraceptives. On the one hand, that demonstrates just how much of a difference fail-safe options like IUDs can make. On the other, it shows that getting many couples to use contraceptives at all is still a formidable challenge. A giant educational campaign might help raise awareness, but Brookings’ own projections suggest that such a push would only reduce the number of children born to unmarried parents by just a few percentage points . That would be wonderful progress, but it wouldn’t be the end of single motherhood. Even if change came faster, there would still be millions and millions of one-parent families in need of a stronger safety net in the U.S..
But in the end, that simply means nobody should fixate on better birth control as a silver bullet for poverty (Sawhill, to her credit, doesn’t). There’s no good argument against promoting effective contraceptives. Like I said, it’s a no-brainer.

Harvard Investing Chief Planning to Step DownYou are here: Home Corporates
Harvard Investing Chief Is Planning to Step Down
Randall Smith, The New York Times | Updated On: September 16, 2014 10:42 (IST)
SpiceJet Mum on Sell-Out, Says Exploring All Options for Funds
The chief investment officer of the Yale endowment, David F. Swensen, set the bar for universities starting in 1988 when he created a widely imitated blueprint for high-octane investment returns with heavy doses of private equity and other alternatives to stocks and bonds.
Then from 1990 to 2005, Jack Meyer of Harvard gave Yale a run for its money with a streak of returns almost as sizzling, achieved by a team of swashbuckling in-house traders whose sky-high pay eventually led to their departures after an outcry from faculty and alumni.
But over the last decade, miscues by university management and more tepid investment returns have pulled down Harvard's results, culminating in the June resignation of Jane L. Mendillo, the chief executive of the Harvard Management Co., who started just before the market collapse in July 2008.
The performance of Mendillo, who is leaving at the end of the year, illustrates not only the vicissitudes of investing but also the revolving-door aspect of an operation like the Harvard endowment, where retaining top talent can be difficult because of the intense scrutiny and the availability of bigger paychecks elsewhere.
"The pressure on people in that kind of institution is tremendous from people who want to see good results all the time," said Keith Ambachtsheer, who runs an education program for nonprofit board members at the University of Toronto. "There's no patience for the fact that managing endowments is a long-horizon enterprise that naturally involves occasional periods of disappointing results."
Harvard officials defend Mendillo's record, saying that over the five years ended in June, the university's endowment, the nation's largest at $32.7 billion, matched its long-term record of 11 to 12 percent annual returns. They add that Mendillo coped well with multiple challenges during the financial crisis and stabilized the organization. And this month, Harvard is expected to report a return of about 15 percent for the year ended in June, the second-best of Mendillo's term.
In three of the five Mendillo years for which Harvard and its Ivy League rivals have reported detailed results, however, as well as for the five years ended in June 2013, its endowment trailed all seven other Ivies. Including a steep 27.3 percent decline during the market collapse year, its five-year return was just 1.7 percent, compared with an average of 4.2 percent for the others.
"Their performance was not very good," said Charles Skorina, a San Francisco endowment recruiter who calculated the five-year Ivy returns.
Results were all the more disappointing, he added, because Harvard pays "top dollar" for an in-house staff that invests about 40 percent of the assets, including $4.8 million for Mendillo in 2012, and $7.9 million and $6.6 million for her two highest-earning deputies. Other Ivies farm out most of their investments to outside managers and do not generally award such lavish paychecks.
In a letter sent last month to Harvard's president, Drew Faust, a group of nine Harvard alumni renewed its past criticism of the pay for the endowment's staff, noting that the total for 2013 of $132.8 million had doubled in the previous four years. "
Harvard officials say the higher pay levels reflect Mendillo's efforts to rebuild the staff, which had been depleted by the departures of numerous top traders, and the exceeding of certain benchmarks.
Some associates of Mendillo, who came up through the ranks at Harvard and then led both the Wellesley and Harvard endowments, say she acknowledged unhappiness with the scrutiny on Harvard's returns. "She didn't like it; she is a very private person and doesn't seek the spotlight. So the negative focus on absolute returns did bother her," said Verne O. Sedlacek, chief executive of Commonfund, which manages $25 billion for nonprofit groups. Sedlacek worked with Mendillo, 56, at the Harvard endowment for a decade. Harvard officials declined to comment beyond a brief statement applauding the latest five-year returns as a "strong recovery."
One former official of Harvard Management compared the endowment's cautious, defensive style in the Mendillo years to a soccer team that tries to keep possession of the ball instead of taking shots on goal. Many of the company's alumni called Mendillo more of a steady, capable manager than a visionary investor.
Returns in the first of the cellar years, ended in June 2009, were weighed down by the need to sell illiquid assets at a discount to produce cash for the university, as well as a decline of more than 50 percent in the endowment's real estate holdings - roughly double the decline of the U.S. stock market. But former Harvard endowment employees say returns in the other bottom-ranked years ended in June 2012 and 2013 were held back by less obvious factors like holding too few publicly traded U.S. stocks, which shot up 12.2 percent annually in those two years, and placing too big a bet on emerging stock markets, where Harvard underperformed market indexes that themselves produced annual losses of 6.7 percent.
Friends say Mendillo is looking forward to escaping the pressure cooker, where criticism of the recent results may have made it tougher for her to lead and retain top talent. For example, after the longtime head of private equity, Peter Dolan, resigned last year, his successor, Lane MacDonald, abruptly departed in February after just a few months in the job to manage a family office for the Johnson family, which owns a stake in Fidelity Investments.
Lawrence E. Golub, a Harvard alumnus whose Golub Capital lends to midsize companies, said Mendillo did "a great job" steering Harvard through the crisis and revamping its risk and liquidity profile. But he noted that the job required three separate skills in investing, managing and dealing with Harvard's various "constituents and interest groups." He added, "Any job with those challenges, that's a very tiring job."

Microsoft buys Minecraft for $2.5 billionMicrosoft buys Minecraft for $2.5 billion
By Jose Pagliery   @Jose_Pagliery September 15, 2014: 2:48 PM ET
 
What is Minecraft?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Microsoft is expanding its video game empire, buying the wildly popular Minecraft and the tiny production studio that designed it for $2.5 billion.
With Minecraft, Microsoft will be acquiring one of the most popular games ever. Minecraft has been downloaded more than 100 million times since it launched in 2009.
Minecraft is an online video game that mixes Lego-like building blocks with the endearing low-fi of 8-bit graphics -- all while getting chased by monsters. It gives players ("miners") a world where they can explore endlessly and build just about anything from scratch . It's alchemy with a virtual pickaxe.
If it seems low-end, that's because it is. The game was initially developed by a single man: Markus Persson, who launched Mojang studio.
Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) said it reached an agreement with Minecraft's Swedish game developer Mojang to buy the company sometime later this year. The deal had been rumored for a week prior to its announcement.
Related news: How 'Minecraft' became an Xbox blockbuster
The news was well-received by industry analysts, who say Microsoft is smart to adopt the massive community of loyal Minecraft fans.
Al Hilwa, a software analyst with market advisory firm IDC, compared the Minecraft deal to Apple's ( AAPL , Tech30 ) acquisition of Beats and Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) buying Twitch . It's a battle for customers by expanding beyond the company's typical, core business.
Plus, Microsoft can make this giant deal tax-free by using cash it keeps overseas, noted Daniel Ives at FBR Capital Markets.
U.S.-based multinational corporations like Microsoft often keep lots of profit outside the United States, because bringing it back home would force them to pay taxes. Ives estimates that roughly 90% of Microsoft's $86 billion in cash is kept abroad.
Mojang is based in Stockholm, so Microsoft can keep the Uncle Sam out of the loop.
 
EA investors mad for Madden
But buying Minecraft won't give Microsoft the brains behind the creation. On Monday, Larsson wrote a public letter saying he's leaving Mojang as soon as he signs the deal. Now that a major corporation is involved and Minecraft has gone mainstream, it's all too much for him.
"I make games because it's fun... but I don't make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits," he wrote. "I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm not a CEO. I'm a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter."
If Microsoft is buying Minecraft to pump out hit games, the odds are stacked against it. The video game world is full of one-hit wonders.
Angry Birds was a sensation that Rovio hasn't been able to replicate, and the company ended 2013 with a 50% drop in net profit. Rovio is dumping its CEO in January to try to turn things around.

Still, there's value in Minecraft's fan base alone, especially because it keeps growing. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of registered users grew from 14 million to 39 million. And it's more than double that number today.
The question now on fans' minds is whether a big company like Microsoft will let this independent, humble game maker roam freely and retain its unique flavor -- or suck the soul out of the studio.
That's what happened when Microsoft acquired Bungie, the makers of the multi-billion-dollar Halo franchise. And how did that end? They eventually split in 2007.

Uber drivers in New York City protest faresUber drivers in New York City protest fares

Uber drivers protest in NYC streets
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Uber drivers in New York are protesting for the second time in a month, fuming over the company's low fares. Fans of the cheap uberX service might want to take notice.
The drivers already have one win against the company: After forcing its higher-end Black and SUV lines earlier this month to begin taking fares for the cheaper uberX line, drivers showed up at the Queens offices on September 8 in protest.
Uber reversed the policy just ahead of a planned strike Friday.
Related: Is Uber CEO 'Darth Vader'?
Following a meeting that organizers say drew hundreds, the drivers staged a second protest Monday that drew much smaller numbers. But the angry drivers still sense they can win more concessions.
Their most common complaint concerned uberX fares, which the online car service cut by 20% in July, in order to undercut prices offered by the ubiquitous Yellow Cabs of New York City.
But the drivers are also upset that a built-in 20% tip prevents Uber customers from giving more, as well as the way the service calculates driver pay and other things.
Abdul Diallo, one of the protest's organizers, said he and others are protesting because they're tired of dealing with the company on an individual basis, when they felt they weren't being heard.
"Talking to them didn't work," he said.
He said drivers aren't getting a fair shake.
"When you offer cheap fares, you are pleasing the client," he said. "But that's only half the equation."
Cars, gas and other costs don't change when the company lowers fares.
Josh Mohrer, the New York office's general manager, said drivers were making more per hour with the lower uberX fares, though they're driving more at the same time. If any of them are upset about it, he'd talk to them one-on-one, not as a group. That's the way he said he handled the earlier controversy.
Diallo said the group is still gathering members and hasn't reached out to lawyers or unions in order to help formalize their collective.
Should Diallo and other protesters not get their way, he said using their growing numbers to follow through on strike threats isn't out of the question.
"If that's what we need to, then we'll do it," he said.
The New York drivers aren't the first to raise the issue. Their west coast counterparts in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle have made similar complaints about low uberX fares and other perceived slights.

Competition among companies like Lyft, Gett, Uber and others that offer car services, is becoming more heated. Each is offering special deals to undercut the other's prices.
With that in mind, Uber isn't planning to hike the low uberX low fares in New York anytime soon, said Mohrer.
"I don't see a reason to do it, as the drivers are making more money than ever," he said.
But in other markets, the service has raised fares after previously lowering them. In June, it cut uberX prices by a quarter in Indianapolis, Indiana and San Antonio, Texas as part of a promotion. A company spokesman said fares in those cities are now back to normal.
Josh Rajkumar, a JetBlue worker who checked out the scene Monday after grabbing lunch, said he's been taking Uber trips for a year, preferring the service's cordial drivers over brusque cabbies. When the company made uberX fares cheaper than cabs earlier this summer, he started using the service even more.
But despite driver friendliness, for Rajkumar, price is the deciding factor of whether or not to take an Uber.
"If it was still lower than a cab, I would still take it," he said.

Bosch Bangalore Plant Workers on Strike
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 16, 2014 13:26 (IST)
SpiceJet Mum on Sell-Out, Says Exploring All Options for Funds
New Delhi: Workers at auto component major Bosch Ltd's Bangalore plant have gone on strike from today with the company stating that it will consider the act as illegal.
"The employee union of Bosch Bangalore plant has chosen to go on strike with effect from September 16, 2014 in order to press for their unreasonable demands. Strike will be considered as illegal, "Bosch Ltd said in a filing to the BSE.
The management is in discussion with the Union to restore normalcy at the earliest with the intervention of the Additional Labour Commissioner, Karnataka, it added.
The company's Bangalore plant has a history of workers unrest, and in September 2011, the plant was shut down temporarily following strike by workers.
Last year in March, workers had gone on a tool down strike, and in November the company had shut operations of the Bangalore due to another tool down strike.
In August this year, workers at the company's Jaipur plant had also gone on a tool down strike but it was resolved within two days.
Shares of Bosch Ltd were trading at Rs 15,079.15 in the afternoon, up 1.34 per cent from the previous close on the BSE.

How Jack Ma Founded AlibabaThe market is giving Alibaba two thumbs up, too
Photo by Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Business Insider.
In 1995, a former school teacher from China named Jack Ma visited the United States for the first time. Ma had recently started a translation company to capitalize on China's export boom.

When he was in the United States, as part of his translation business, a friend showed him the internet. His friend told him that just about everything was on the internet. Ma decided to search for beer. The results didn't turn up a single Chinese option. In fact, he could hardly find anything about China on the Internet at all.  When he returned home, he decided to found China Pages, a directory of various Chinese companies looking for customers abroad, and some say, the country's first internet business. China Pages was a flop. But four years later, Ma took another stab at an internet business. He called his second company Alibaba. 
Next week, Alibaba will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange , in what could be the biggest offering in U.S. history. Bloomberg reports that Alibaba wants to sell 12 percent of the company . Analysts value the company at $160 billion. Tht would mean Alibaba raises about $20 billion, which is more than Visa, the current high for an IPO which raised $19.65 billion.  Ma still owns a 8.9 percent stake in the company, which means he'll be worth about $14.5 billion if the $160 billion valuation holds. Ma is no longer the CEO of Alibaba. He's the chairman, but he's still the face of the company. 
Ma has never been a typical tech CEO. He failed the college entrance exam twice before he finally got in. He founded an enormous tech company, yet he had studied to become a teacher and still doesn't know how to code. Back in the mid-2000s, when Alibaba was battling eBay in China , reporters used to call him "Crazy Jack" because of his animated manner of speaking and bold goals.

Ma's story starts in Hangzhou, China, a city of 2.4 million people near Shanghai, where he was born  in 1964 to parents who made a living as professional ping tan performers (a traditional style of storytelling and ballad singing). "I was scrawny when I was young, but I was a terrific fighter," Ma recalls in Alibaba, a book by Liu Shiying and Martha Avery . "I was never afraid of opponents who were bigger than I."  Although he got into fights with classmates—he was teased for his size—he turned on the charm when it came to foreign tourists. He used to go to a local hotel every day so that he could meet people and learn English. He also bought a radio so that he could listen to the English broadcast every day.
Despite how well he took to learning another language, he never excelled at math. Low marks on the mathematics portion of China's college entrance exam caused him to fail twice.  Finally, after rigorous prep for his third try at the test,  he passed, and eventually graduated from Hangzhou Teacher's Institute in 1988. He says that he was rejected for a number of jobs—including a manager position at Kentucky Fried Chicken —right after he graduated. 
However, he eventually became an English teacher, making about $12 a month at a local university. Here's a shot from the documentary Crocodile in the Yangtze , an amazing film that shows the rise of Alibaba: 
Crocodile of the Yangtze
During China's export boom, Ma ended up starting a translation company, which would ultimately lead him to visiting the United States for the first time in 1995 where he discovered the Internet. China Pages, his first attempt at an internet business, was ultimately frustrating. Ma was pressured into a joint venture with China Telecom and ultimately lost control of the company, according to the New York Times . 
But Ma was determined to try again. In 1999—as Internet fever was hitting Wall Street in the U.S.—Ma corralled 17 friends into his apartment. The team set to work building their own online marketplace. 
Screenshot/Crocodile of the Yangtze
The site, Alibaba.com , let exporters post product listings that buyers could browse, and it started to attract members from all around the world. By October 1999, the company had raised $5 million from Goldman Sachs and $20 million from SoftBank, a Japanese telecom company that also invests in technology companies. 
Footage from those early days (which you can see in Crocodile in the Yangtze ) reveal Ma as a captivating speaker who could make his big dreams infectious. Even as the team began to grow, Porter Erisman—the creator of the documentary and an early Alibaba employee—says it felt more like a close-knit family. Ma motivated the team by creating an ethos of being a scrappy little company ready to take on giants.  "We will make it because we are young and we never, never give up," he says on tape to gathering of employees. 
He made bold claims to the press about how fast the company would grow, at one point telling Erisman that if the company wanted to get some free advertising, they had to say some crazy things.

With a love of performance (probably inherited from his parents), Ma also helped create a quirky, fun atmosphere at the company. When Alibaba first became profitable, Ma provided every employee with a can of Silly String to go wild with. When the company decided to start Taobao, its eBay competitor, in the early 2000's, he got the team working on it to do handstands during breaks to keep their energy levels up.  Even today, Alibaba hosts an annual talent show every year in an enormous stadium that gets employees rehearsing for weeks. Ma has blessed hundreds of newlywed Alibaba employees in wedding attire during an annual ritual, according to  the Wall Street Journal .
Of course, he wasn't without mistakes in those early days. The company grew very fast but was burning through cash, and in 2001 Ma had to lay off his entire international staff. Erisman can remember a phone call after Ma had decided to close Alibaba's U.S. office, where Ma was questioning himself, wonder whether or not he was a bad person. 
Ultimately though, it was Ma's willingness to take risks and his dedication to creating a website that catered to the needs of China's citizens—many of whom were just discovering the Internet—that helped the company beat eBay in China in the mid-2000's . Taobao is now one of the top twenty most-visited websites globally, and, combined with another Alibaba site, Tmall, it had a total transaction volume of  $240 billion in 2013 .

Ma stepped down as the CEO of the company in 2013. The new CEO is Jonathan Lu, who had previously been the company's senior vice president.  "I thought it would be easier when I stepped down from CEO," he told the Wall Street Journal ,"But now I'm finding out being a chairman, if you want to be a good chairman, is much busier than being a CEO."
After the company filed for its IPO, Ma wrote a letter to Alibaba employees, which was printed by the Wall Street Journal . In it, Ma tells the team that there is "unparalleled ruthlessness and pressure" ahead, but that the company can overcome it by sticking to its original mission and culture.  Here's a nugget from the letter:  "We know well we haven’t survived because our strategies are farsighted and brilliant, or because our execution is perfect, but because for 15 years we have persevered in our mission of 'making it easier to do business across the world,' because we have insisted on a 'customer first' value system, because we have persisted in believing in the future, and because we have insisted that normal people can do extraordinary things."

A few weeks after Israel and Hamas signed an open-ended truce to end their nearly two-month-long war in Gaza, Israeli defense contractors are parading weapons used in the conflict at a conference in Tel Aviv. The annual Israel Unmanned Systems conference, which began Sunday and runs through Friday (Sept. 19), is jointly hosted with the US Embassy in Tel Aviv. According to its website, attendees include “senior officials from commercial and government entities” from Europe, Asia, North and South America.
The conference’s sponsors include the largest Israeli private defense contractors, among them Haifa-based Elbit Systems. Elbit’s  Hermes 450  (pdf), a “multi-role tactical high-performance unmanned aircraft system” (UAS)—in other words, a battle drone—operated this summer in the Gaza Strip, and may have carried out attacks.
Photos taken by an Agence France-Presse photographer  that appeared in a July post on The Aviationist, a blog, showed the aircraft flying over the skies of Gaza. It had a pod under each wing that looked like it could be a fuel tank, but which, according to an Israeli source quoted by the blog, was “a firing pod for a light missile.” The source would not independently confirm or deny that it was used in attacks on Hamas positions but David Cenciotti, founder of the blog, told Quartz that it’s highly likely that the Hermes 450 was the IDF’s vehicle of choice for such attacks.
According to Elbit’s website , the Hermes 450 has been “fighting terror for over a decade” and the company touts the aircraft as “the primary platform of the IDF in counter-terror operations.”
The conference is an opportunity for Elbit to showcase its prize aircraft in front of a consortium of arms buyers. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July that Elbit’s stock soared during the war, which analysts attributed to demand for Elbit’s products. Elbit is the nation’s biggest publicly traded developer  of military technology, an industry that provides Israel with about $7 billion in annual exports .
“They may not have the same amount of drones/UAVs the US forces have but they [Israel] have developed some hi-tech systems, some of those are exported to foreign air arms,” said Cenciotti in an email.
According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report  (pdf) about that year’s conflict in Gaza, the Hermes was one of two drones used by the IDF. The report cites estimates ranging from 48 to 87 Palestinian civilians killed by drones, out of that war’s total of 1,200-1,400 deaths, both civilian and combatant. (For comparison, the first five years of US drone strikes in Pakistan and other countries were estimated to have claimed 2,400 lives .) In this year’s Gaza war, more than 2,130 Palestinians were killed ; there’s no tally as yet of how many were due to drones.

The world is pumping carbon dioxide into the air at the  fastest rate since 1984 . Last month was the hottest August on record . The superlatives say it all: We’re running out of time to avoid climate change’s most disastrous consequences.
So why the inaction on slashing CO2 emissions? Chief objections usually  come down to the high costs  (paywall) of shifting from coal and other cheap, but high-polluting, energy sources.
“The main problem we are looking at among the leaders of countries and business communities is… a general perception that taking action [on climate change] will reduce economic growth, reduce creation of jobs,” says Felipe Calderon, former president of Mexico and chair of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.
But that’s a “false dilemma,” he says. “We don’t have to choose between economic growth and safe climate—we can have both.”
Here’s what the GCEC argued in its  report on climate change and economic growth , released ahead of UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon’s climate summit next week.
If the $90 trillion that will be spent globally on cities, agriculture, and energy systems in the next 15 years is invested in low-carbon infrastructure and technology, economies actually will save money. Mind you, that low-carbon infrastructure will cost more upfront, about $4 trillion extra, turning that $90 trillion into a $94 trillion commitment. But according to the GCEC, the investment would generate $5 trillion in savings from factors like lower operating costs for renewable energy sources (versus fossil fuels) and increased energy efficiency, making this the cheaper option in the long run.
And that’s before you calculate the benefits of avoiding disastrously high levels of CO2. As things stand, it is almost certain that the planet will warm to more than 2ºC (3.6ºF) higher than preindustrial levels, which is basically global warming’s Sleepy Hollow Bridge, beyond which wait Sandy-on-steroids storm surges, ice-sheet collapses, rampant droughts, and other assorted climatic calamities. Crossing that threshold will shave 0.5% to 2% off global GDP by mid-century, according to the GCEC report.

The report focuses on three areas—cities, agricultural land, and energy—in which policy can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while boosting growth.
Historically speaking, we’ve been pretty bad at anticipating how much energy the poor countries will use as they grow. Not much has changed; but for argument’s sake, the GCEC has forecast that China, India, and other developing countries will demand 20% to 35% more energy by 2030. Most of that most of that is likely to come from coal:
Tap image to zoom
(Global Commission on the Economy and Climate)
Much of the $45 trillion in energy-infrastructure spending needed to meet this demand won’t fall to rich Western countries to decide, but to fast-growing nations like China and India. Current technology would allow renewable energy to make up up half of the new electricity generation capacity from now until 2030. But will emerging economies invest in it—or in cheap coal-fired power plants?
On this matter, the incentives are fairly screwy. Right now, the world’s governments spend about $600 billion a year to make fossil fuels cheaper, while putting up only $100 billion for renewable energy subsidies:

(Global Commission on the Economy and Climate)
Cheaper fossil fuels might help businesses in the short run, but they come with other costs—like the lives of 7 million people a year:

(Global Commission on the Economy and Climate)
If anything, carbon should cost more than it does. Taxing carbon to cover its associated costs will compel businesses and governments to invest in sustainable growth. But while the prices of wind, solar, and other renewable energies is falling, carbon taxes still might increase the burden on poor households in the medium term. Therefore, the report advised, some of the revenue generated should help offset those costs.
Tap image to zoom
(Global Commission on the Economy and Climate)
It’s also worth considering one of the main reasons we need all this fossil fuel: cars.
Sprawl, it turns out, is expensive. Cities designed long ago for car commuting are seeing their costs of public services, utilities, and infrastructure soar—the US, for example, now shells out $400 billion a year in these costs.
Governments have a choice: they can allow cities to grow in an unplanned, unstructured, and usually car-dependent way, adding another 1 billion cars to city roads. Or they can invest in building more compact cities with better transport systems, maximizing resources at the same time as they slash emissions. Taking the latter path will save up to $3.4 trillion by 2030, according to the report.

(Global Commission on the Economy and Climate)
Another area the report explored is agriculture, which contributes about a quarter of the Earth’s greenhouse gas emissions. One fourth of the planet’s arable land has been exploited so willy-nilly that it barely grows anything anymore. Instead of restoring it, we continue to clear forests to make more of it—razing what are essentially huge sponges of CO2 absorption.
Here, too, the incentives are off. Funds that currently subsidize industrial agriculture in rich countries would be better spent on R&D to improve productivity and restore degraded farmland, according to the report. Rehabilitating just 12% of degraded land would feed 200 million people and generate $40 billion a year in farmer income.
What would happen if these and the other recommendations from the GCEC magically came true? The group estimated that the planet would achieve 90% of the emissions reductions that need to happen by 2030 to undershoot that 2ºC threshold. It’s heartening to see carefully plotted, market-based solutions to what increasingly seem like insurmountable problems. Then again, the realization that 72 pages worth of comprehensive global recommendations would still only get us most of the way there is a reminder of just how radically the world will have to change if we’re to avoid the coming meltdown.

Poverty Rate Falls for First Time Since 2006  Remains Way Too HighA woman and her daughter in the impoverished rural town of Fluker, Louisiana.

The official U.S. poverty rate fell last year for the first time since 2006, dipping to 14.5 percent, according to a new annual report by the Census Bureau . For the past several years, it had hovered around 15 percent. In total, 45.3 million Americans lived under the poverty line during 2013, including some 14.7 million children.
U.S. Census Bureau
The official poverty rate is sometimes criticized as unreliable because of its odd origins and narrow definition of income. The statistic was basically MacGyvered into existence in the 1960s by a lone Social Security Administration economist who based it on cost of food for a family of three, since that was just about the only data on living standards she had to work with. Since then, the stat has only really been updated for inflation. While it counts cash payments such as Social Security towards a family’s finances, it doesn’t account for benefits such as food stamps. As a result, it vastly understates the decline of material need in America over the decades.

That said, it does provide a decent snapshot of poverty as it exists today. For several years, Census researchers have been honing an alternative statistic known as the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which takes into account more government benefits along with geographical variations in the cost of living for a much more sophisticated approach to quantifying need. But in 2011 , the SPM was only 1 percentage point higher than the cruder, official measure we've been using since the Johnson days.
In short, poverty has been high for years now, and its persistence has been one of the clearest indicators of the weaknesses of the economic recovery. Last year’s drop, while welcome news, came far too late.

Stay invested in SBI  may test Rs 3200: Lancelot D Cunha02:00 pm
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO at ITI Wealth management told CNBC-TV18, "In long term if one is willing to hold  State Bank of India (SBI) for couple of years I think you can get a target for Rs 3,200. Because State Bank of India is a play on the economic growth of the country and given that we are expecting the economy to grow at least by 6 percent for the next financial year and probably 6.5-7 percent for the year thereafter, State Bank of India also participate in that growth through increases its loans and advances as well as net interest margins.”
“I think non-performing assets (NPAs) have probably played out for State Bank of India and the worst is over relating to the stressed assets. So we are probably bottoming out on the NPAs front and this should be a good time to stay invested or may be if the bank does correct further then one can even look at accumulating at lower level,” he said.

House Republicans back Syrian rebel trainingThe US President said that in an important second step he ensured protection of American personnel, embassies and consulates. (AP Photo)
Associated Press | Washington | Posted: September 16, 2014 9:16 am
U.S. lawmakers raced Monday to authorize an expanded mission to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels before heading back to the campaign trail, with House Republicans preparing legislation backing a central plank of President Barack Obama’s strategy against the Islamic State group.
The Obama administration says the training operation is needed to establish credible, local ground forces to accompany U.S. air strikes against the militants who have conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria, beheaded two American journalists and become a top U.S. terrorism threat in the region and beyond. The House and Senate are both on a tight schedule, looking to wrap up work Friday before an almost two-month recess in preparation for November’s elections.
The authorization under consideration will likely be included as an amendment to a spending bill Congress must pass to keep the government open until mid-December. That would give lawmakers the opportunity to hold a separate debate and vote on the matter _ something members of both parties want.
The measure doesn’t authorize U.S. combat troops in Iraq or Syria or explicitly ban them, reflecting a congressional divide between hawks seeking tougher action than that proposed by Obama and lawmakers weary from more than a decade of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also compels the Pentagon to present Congress with a plan 15 days before any training begins, according to a House Armed Services Committee aide, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about ongoing deliberations and demanded anonymity.
Democrats are reviewing the proposal, which would enable the military to take over what has previously been a limited, covert operation to beef up rebels battling extremist groups and President Bashar Assad’s army. The administration isn’t likely to protest the conditions. It has sent more than 1,000 troops to Iraq to provide military assistance and bolster security of U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel. But Obama, too, opposes any U.S. ground offensive.
Republicans were to gather for internal talks Tuesday morning. A House vote could be held as early as Wednesday, by which time lawmakers will have had opportunities to question the administration’s top national security officials. The House Rules Committee voted late Monday to have six hours of debate on the amendment, once it is taken up. The Senate is expected to follow after a House vote.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel briefs House and Senate committees Tuesday and Thursday, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey also testifying. Secretary of State John Kerry appears before separate panels Wednesday and Thursday.
Obama’s approach to fighting the Islamic State group largely sidesteps Congress. The president isn’t asking for permission to expand strikes in Iraq and target the militants’ operational bases and command structures in Syria, a source of consternation for some Democrats continued…

Sensex recovers 44 points in early tradestock exchanges
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced.
In their worst single-day drop in nearly 7 weeks, Sensex plunged 324 points to 26,492.51 and Nifty tanked 109 points to 7,932.90 on negative cues from jittery global markets before the US Federal Reserve’s much awaited monetary policy meeting that starts later on Tuesday.
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced. Major markets in Asia ended down and those in Europe were weak in morning trades.
Domestic investors also took money off the table in recent outperformers in sectors including realty, banking, consumer durables and oil & gas. All the 12 BSE sectoral indices ended in the red.
Smallcap and midcap stocks, which in previous sessions had bucked a weak trend, saw a huge sell-off with their indices falling over 3 per cent each.
The 30—share Sensex after resuming higher at 26,854.90, improved to 26,861.29. However, it succumbed to widespread selling in blue-chips and slipped to day’s low of 26,464.03, before ending at 26,492.51: down 324.05 points, or 1.21 per cent. This is its worst drop since August 1 when Sensex had plummeted 414.13 points. Tuesday’s closing is also its weakest since August 26 (26,442.81).
Among major laggards, Tata Power suffered the most by plunging 5.85 per cent. Others include Tata Steel, Hindalco, NTPC, Tata Motors, ONGC, RIL, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and L&T.
Bucking the trend, stocks of Dr Reddy, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys gained.
The 50—share Nifty dropped 109.10 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close below 8,000 mark at 7,932.90 after moving between 8,044.90 and 7,925.15 intra-day. Tuesday’s drop is also Nifty’s worst show since August 1 when it fell 118.70 points.
“Market players will be looking for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years. Consensus is that the Fed will hike interest rates next year and it may declare the timelines on Tuesday,” said HDFC Securities in a note.
Sectorally, the BSE Realty sector index suffered the most by losing 3.42 per cent, followed by Power down 3.26 per cent, Capital Goods 2.70 per cent and Oil & Gas 2.67 per cent.

8 cos that have revenues of over 1% of India s GDP | Dynamatic is Infy of aerospaceBharat Petroleum
(Each of these mega giants…)
The listing of ET500 is all about India Inc's biggest companies. But even within them exists a group of an elite few which represents the super-big, with each clocking Rs 1 lakh crore in annual revenues.
All these companies have striven hard to make it to the elite group and, in most cases, will continue with their effort to maintain their rankings next year as well.
ETIG reviews their prospects.
Indian Oil
Firmly in the top place for ET 500 listing, Indian Oil, a public sector Maharatna company, is the largest Indian company with revenues touching nearly Rs 500,000 crore.
It remains India's biggest petroleum retailer with a 47.1% market share and biggest petroleum refiner with 65.7 million tonne of refining capacity.
The company grew its revenues at a consolidated annualised growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% over the last five years.
The company's profitability suffered in the past due to the subsidies over a large chunk of refined products it sold.
However, the situation has changed with petrol getting decontrolled in 2010, and diesel, also on the way to being decontrolled soon.
This will bring some stability to its earnings, going forward. The company is also upgrading its existing refineries while adding a new 15-million tonne refinery at Paradip.
It plans to spend Rs 12,000 crore during FY15, after having spent Rs 26,100 crore in the preceding two years.
With its expanding capacities and expansive market reach, IndianOil is sure to stay at the top of ET500 in the years to come.
Reliance Industries
The company has long emerged the biggest private sector company in India and has been occupying the second position in ET500. The company has increased its revenues at a CAGR of 23.3% over the last five years. Its petroleum refining and petrochemical complex at Jamnagar is the biggest in the world processing 1.3 million barrels of crude oil every day. RIL is in the midst of implementing a multi-year mega capex binge, investing Rs 180,000 crore by FY17. In spite of its growth and a strong balance sheet, RIL has failed to generate superior returns for investors mainly due to its weakened return ratios. Nevertheless, it is sure to continue its elite position in the ET500.
Bharat Petroleum
Featured as one of the most promising PSUs for the next five years, Bharat Petroleum occupies the third spot in ET500 with revenues exceeding Rs 2.65 lakh crore, which grew at a CAGR of 14.6% over the past five years. Besides running the second largest petroleum retailing business in India, BPCLhas buit a successful portfolio of E&P assets. It will also benefit from the deregulation of retail fuel prices. With a strong position in the domestic petroleum retail industry and a likely booster from its E&P businesses over the next few years, the company is set to reinforce its position in the ET500 listing.
 
Hindustan Petroleum
The company has maintained its overall fourth rank in the ET500 listing for a third consecutive year. It reported revenues of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, with an annualised growth of 13% over the last five years. It sold 31 million tonne of petro products, yet barely half of it came from its own refineries. The company is actively considering setting up another refinery in Rajasthan and an LNG import terminal in Gujarat. The company, however, will need to grow faster in the coming years not to lose its ET500 rank, as Tata Motors is close on its heels.
Tata Motors
Tata Motors, the world's fourth largest bus manufacturer and the fifth largest truck maker, has 54% share in the domestic commercial vehicle market. In FY14, it reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 2.3 lakh crore. On a consolidated basis, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 26.9% between 2009-10 and 2013- 14. In FY14, JLR contributed as much as 85% to the total revenue compared with 54% in FY10.
With concerted efforts and new launches such as Evoque and Range Rover Sport, it has boosted sales substantially. In 2013-14, JLR contributed as much as 85% to the total revenue earned by the company, compared with 54% in 2009-10. JLR generated free cash-flow of £1.1 billion in 2013-14 compared with £101 million in 2009-10, dispelling worries of servicing debt burden. Strong cash generation from JLR has helped in reducing the debt-equity ratio to 0.92 in FY14 compared with 4.28 in FY10.
State Bank of India
Over the past two years, sluggish growth and high interest rates have resulted in an increase in SBI's stressed assets. In addition, lower capex has meant a decline in demand for loans, which resulted in subdued growth in net interest income. However, during the tough times, SBI undertook a cost optimisation exercise. In the past two consecutive quarters, overhead expenses have grown below 10% year-on-year against nearly 25% in the previous four quarters. These constitute more than 35% of operating expenses. With a 16% market share, the lender will be a major beneficiary of a revival in the economy.

NSEL lacks credibility; merge with FTIL: FMC...Financial Technologies India Ltd
(To ensure that FTIL takes…)
NEW DELHI: Stating that crisis-hit NSEL is "bereft of any credibility", regulator FMC today said it has recommended the government to consider merger of the spot commodity exchange with its promoter FTIL for speedy recovery of dues over Rs 5,300 crore from defaulters.
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Both Corporate Affairs and Finance Ministries are studying the feasibility of implementing the FMC's proposals.
"The Commission, vide its letter dated August 18, has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to consider the merger/amalgamation of NSEL with FTIL in public interest so that the human and financial resources of FTIL are also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters at NSEL," FMC said in its latest report.
The recommendation has been given to the government in view of the depleted resources in terms of manpower and financial strength available at the disposal of NSEL, it said.
Also, "NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery from the defaulting members," it observed.
The regulator has also recommended the government to consider taking over of the management of FTIL, thereby ensure the company takes full responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.
Taking over the FTIL management will help manage the affairs of the company in in a professional way by bringing in an institutionalised framework as recommended by the Working Group appointed by the government, it added.
NSEL, a subsidiary of the Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd , has recovered so far a little over Rs 360 crore of dues from defaulters out of the total outstanding amount of Rs 5,689 crore.
Recently, FMC had said that the NSEL has not made much progress in recovery of dues from defaulters, which the spot exchange refuted saying the watchdog has adequate powers to speed up efforts to get back the investor money.

IS supporter warns of attacks against US: SITEThe message on a well-known militant Islamist online forum is one of the few responses from supporters of IS to Washington's announcement.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIRUT: A supporter of Islamic State militants has warned of attacks on the United States and its allies if they continue to carry out military action against the group that has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria , the SITE monitoring service said.
The message on a well-known militant Islamist online forum is one of the few responses from supporters of Islamic State to Washington's announcement last week that it was prepared to extend airstrikes against the group into Syria.
The posting on the Minbar Jihadi Media website condemned "intervention in the affairs of other peoples" and said it would trigger an equal response, SITE said late on Monday.
"It will lead to an equal reaction of the same strength in targeting the American depth and also the nations allied to it and in all aspects," the message said in a translation from Arabic, according to SITE, which tracks militant forums.
The United States has stepped up its military response to the hardline group, which has beheaded several Western hostages.
On Sunday Islamic State released a video that it said showed the beheading of a British aid worker.
US President Barack Obama is calling for a coalition of Western and Middle Eastern countries to fight Islamic State.
"I direct a sternly worded warning to each of those nations involved with America, or that are allied with it in their war against the Islamic Caliphate, that their local and international interests will be legitimate targets," the posting by a supporter referred to as "Amir al-Thul" said.
The posting used religious language and said the author was speaking from a "blessed pulpit" but it was not clear what influence he had on the actions of Islamic State.
The message called on the public in the United States and its allies to oppose government actions against the group.

India may become fifth-largest exporter by 20130: HSBCIndia may become fifth-largest exporter by 2030, says HSBC report

India has the potential to become the world's fifth largest exporter of goods by 2030 in value terms, says HSBC Trade Forecast.
The country has the potential to become an export hub for autos and it is well-placed to further develop its textile industry, the HSBC report said.
This is despite the fact that the country's near-term growth prospects remain lacklustre, with the economy likely to expand by 5.3 per cent in 2014 and 6.3 per cent in 2015 - well below the rapid growth rate of around 8 per cent a year in 2001-11.
"Despite struggling with a number of structural impediments to growth, prospects for medium-term growth in trade remain strong," the HSBC report said.
India's Trade Confidence Index increased from 126 in the second half of 2013 to 137 in the first half of 2014. In the near term, respondents see Europe as the most promising trading destination, pushing Asia into second position.
"The economic potential for India remains strong, with the growing population and rapidly expanding middle class - it presents opportunities for business. India is forecast to emerge as the world's largest middle class market, surpassing both China and US," HSBC India Managing Director and Head, Commercial Banking, Sandeep Uppal said.
The UAE is likely to remain top export destination for the country till 2030, and China is forecast to emerge as the second largest export market, displacing the US.
Sector-wise, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment and textiles will help accelerate overall export growth. By 2021- 30, pharmaceuticals exports are likely to emerge as one of the top ten contributors to total export growth.
The domestic pharmaceuticals sector is relatively advanced and in a position to compete globally, the report said.
Major brand products in developed markets are undergoing patent expiration and Indian producers are ready to capitalise on a shift in spending towards generic alternatives, it added.
"While India is already well known for IT, in the medium term we foresee strong growth in pharmaceutical exports with auto as a sector to watch out for in the longer term," Uppal added.

People have rejected BJPs politics of polarisation:CongressPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:02 pm
As BJP suffered reverses in the assembly bypolls, Congress on Tuesday said the results should ring alarm bells for the saffron party as people have rejected its “politics of polarisation” and claimed anti-incumbency factor has set in within 100 days of Modi government coming to power.
“People did not like the attitude of BJP and Modi government. While the Prime Minister himself kept silent, BJP leaders and ministers in the Modi government played the politics of polarisation through their statements,” Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said.
He noted that Congress’ gains in Gujarat and Rajasthan were significant as in the Lok Sabha polls it had drawn a blank in both states. “Now we will try to improve our performance,” said Ahmed, who is is AICC general secretary in-charge for poll bound Haryana.
Turning to Uttar Pradesh, the Congress spokesman alleged that “full authority” had been given to people who were responsible for inciting riots in the state.
“Leave aside caste, creed and religion, these communalforces were acting as triggers to incite fight between husband and wife,” he said in an obvious reference to BJP raking up the issue of “Love Jihad”, the alleged forcible conversion of Hindu girls through marriage.
He said that the bypoll verdict shows that “this is the first government whose anti-incumbency factor has started working within 100 days of coming to power. Alarm bells are ringing for the BJP”.

Bihar: Health Minister says Rs 2 cr bungling is no scam  CM snubshimManjhi has already given a clean chit to Nitish Kumar and also rejected BJP's demand for a CBI probe.
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:56 pm
First, it was letter war between former chief minister Nitish Kumar and his former deputy Sushil Kumar Modi over drug purchase irregularities in purchase of medicines worth Rs 67 crore by the JD(U) government between July and December 2013.
Now, it is state Health Minister Ramdhani Singh, who further raked up a controversy by saying that “Rs 2 crore bungling cannot be called a scam”. The minister, however, was promptly rebuffed by Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi who said “scam is scam” irrespective of amount swindled”. Manjhi, however, has already given a clean chit to former chief minister Nitish Kumar and also rejected BJP’s demand for a CBI probe.
Health Minister Ramdhani Singh on Monday said, “We have detected bungling of Rs 2 Cr in medicine purchase and this cannot be called a scam. A scam should involve swindling of crores of rupees”. Singh, however, reiterated the government stand on clean chit to Nitish Kumar but added that tenure of BJP leaders Nandkishore Yadav and Ashwini Kumar Chobey as health ministers would be put under scanner.
Singh might well have embarrassed the government by admitting bungling in drug purchase, a point being emphasised upon by BJP soon after revelation of additional director KK Singh health committee about irregularities in the drug purchase by Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Private Limited, a government body under health department.
BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “Now that the health minister has admitted irregularities in the drug purchase, let there be a CBI probe into the matter”.

Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at ING Vysya Bank, said though the August wholesale inflation numbers showed a broad-based easing, the bigger impact has come from an easing in commodity prices. Global commodity prices have a bigger impact on wholesale inflation than retail inflation because of higher weightage of manufacturing in WPI, she added.

115 000 to lose health insurance on missed Obamacare deadline2
The government now will inform insurance companies to cancel their coverage effective Sept. 30. The cancellations affect only those who enrolled on HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act that was used by consumers in 36 states, including Illinois, to compare and purchase health insurance.
Andrew Slavitt, the No. 2 official at the federal agency, said those who lose coverage may be able to re-enroll for a plan through a special enrollment period if they're able to submit documentation that confirms their eligibility.
“If people are willing to pay their premiums and demonstrate they are eligible for coverage” they can “continue to be enrolled,” Slavitt said in a conference call.
He urged those who learn they've lost coverage to call the federal call center at 800-318-2596.
Federal officials also said Monday that they could not verify the income of about 279,000 households, which could affect the amount they pay in monthly insurance premiums.
The Medicare agency said it was sending notices to those households, which include about 363,000 people, this week.
It was unknown how many of them are in Illinois.
They will have until the end of the month to send additional documentation to support their income.
Though their policies won't be canceled if they do not respond, they could see an adjustment to their monthly premiums beginning Nov. 1 to reflect the income amount the federal government has on record, Slavitt said.
Those households also could face an additional tax liability on their 2014 tax return.
The issues are related to technological problems with HealthCare.gov that left the government unable to determine the income of about 1.2 million households that bought insurance on the website through mid-April.
Federal officials have resolved, or are in the process of resolving, the vast majority of the cases, or about 900,000 households.
Similar issues plagued the effort to verify the citizenship and immigration status for about 1 million others.
By mid-August, the federal government had resolved a majority of those cases.
It is unclear how many of them were able to retain coverage.

India slams Pak for clean chit to Hafiz SaeedIndia slams Pak for clean chit to Hafiz Saeed
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 15, 2014
First Published: 20:17 IST(15/9/2014) | Last Updated: 08:18 IST(16/9/2014)

India hit out at Pakistan on Monday over its remarks that Hafiz Saeed had no case against him, saying he was the “evil” mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks and it was up to Pakistan to bring the chief of terror outfit Jamat-Ud-Dawa (JuD) to book.
The development cast a fresh pall — after the foreign secretary-level talks failure — on the strained India-Pakistan ties that had rekindled hopes of improvement following Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to India during Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony.
“Our views on Hafiz Saeed are very clear. To us, he is the evil mastermind of the attacks on Mumbai and one of the accused in an Indian court for the killings on streets of Mumbai. We have repeatedly asked Pakistan that he should be apprehended and taken through normal judicial process,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.
Read: Hafiz Saeed our national, free to roam around: Pak envoy
“Alas! He has never been arrested on account of 26/11. Therefore.... he is only free because he is a Pakistani citizen,” he added.
His statements came in reaction to Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit's remarks that “Hafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around.”
Basit also said, “So what is the problem... he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned. Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him.”
The exchange of words came close on the heels of India calling off foreign secretary-level talks with its neighbour last month following Basit’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
There has been a deadlock in dialogues between the two countries after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which armed gunmen unleashed a reign of terror in the city in late November and killed more than 150 people.
Asked about Pakistan’s stand that there was not enough evidence to prove Saeed’s involvement in the Mumbai attacks, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said, “99% evidence in this case is in Pakistan. That is because the entire conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. The planning for this dastardly act was done in Pakistan.”
Recently, Saeed, known for his anti-India tirade and designated as a terrorist by the US, has also accused India of indulging in “water-terrorism”.
He had blamed dams constructed in ‘Indian Kashmir’ as the reason responsible for the flood disaster that had claimed over 200 lives in Pakistan.

Rare respiratory illness confirmed in 10 states  expands to New York and AlabamaBy Mark Berman September 15 Follow @markberman
Will Cornejo, 13, recovers at a Denver hospital. (Cyrus McCrimmon/Denver Post)
The rare and severe respiratory illness sickening children around the country has expanded to new states, and health officials believe there could also be unconfirmed cases in other places.
These children — and it has only affected children so far, for reasons we explain here — are suffering from enterovirus 68, an uncommon virus strain that can cause severe breathing problems.
Alabama and New York are among the newest states with confirmed cases of the virus. The Alabama Department of Public Health confirmed Monday that four of six specimens from Mobile County positive for the virus. That follows the New York State Department of Health’s confirmation Friday that more than a dozen children in two parts of the state have enterovirus 68.
As of Monday, there are now 10 states with confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Alabama and New York, there are now confirmed cases in Indiana and Louisiana, with those four states joining Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri.
Health officials in New York say samples from around the state are being sent to a laboratory in Albany for testing to see if there are cases in other parts of the state. Unlike New York, which has a laboratory that can test for the strain, most other states have sent their samples to the CDC, and they are awaiting responses to see whether they have the strain.
Connecticut has also joined the list of states with possible cases. The state’s Department of Public Health said over the weekend that it has received reports of clusters of children in two different areas who may be suffering from this virus; it is awaiting confirmation from the CDC.
The precise number of children with this virus, along with the number of states where it has occurred, is unknown. But one hospital in Kansas City, Mo., is believed to have seen hundreds of cases, which suggests that the national number could be significantly higher.
There is no vaccine for this virus strain. Enteroviruses are actually very common, causing between 10 million and 15 million infections a year (many people who get them just wind up with a cold or don’t even get sick). But this strain is fairly rare — not appearing very often since it was first isolated in California in 1962 — and it has caused concern for health officials, particularly since it can lead to breathing problems for children.
Authorities in some states that are awaiting word from the CDC, including Utah and Ohio, have said they expect to be told they have cases of the virus.
This post has been updated with the full list of states that have confirmed cases now that the CDC revealed that there are cases in Louisiana and Indiana.

(The BJP, however, had a reason…)
NEW DELHI: The BJP today suffered a major blow in in the Assembly by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat,the states it had swept in the Lok Sabha polls four months ago, losing 13 of the 24 seats held by it.
Considered yet another test of popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, today's reverses in the by-elections come after the party's disappointing performance in the assembly by-elections in Bihar, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the last two months.
Out of the 32 Assembly seats across nine states for which counting of votes was taken up today, BJP won 10, Congress seven and Samajwadi Party seven while TDP, Trinamool Congress, AIUDF and CPI(M) bagged one each. One seat in Sikkim was won by an Independent. In three seats in UP where results were awaited, BJP was leading in two and Samajwadi Party in one.
It was Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was on a high after a near-total sweep of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, that delivered a humiliating blow to the saffron party as it lost seven of the 11 seats held by it, including one held by its ally Apna Dal. BSP's absence in the by-elections had made it a virtual straight fight between SP and BJP in the politically crucial state.
Equally crushing was the defeat in Rajasthan where BJP conceded three of the four seats to Congress, which also managed to wrest three of the nine seats in Gujarat, where the elections were held for the first time in 12 years sans Narendra Modi.
All the seats in Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9) and Rajasthan (4) were held by BJP and the bypolls were necessitated after the MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha.
Gloating over BJP's reverses, the Congress and Samajwadi Party called it as a defeat of the communal forces. They said people had rejected the Narendra Modi Government and BJP's "politics of polarisation".
The BJP, which is hoping to do well in the coming assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, conceded that the bypoll results were not up to expectations and said that people had voted on local issues.
The only solace for BJP on an otherwise dismal day was its entry in West Bengal Assembly.
BJP candidate Shamik Bhattacharya won the Basirhat Dakshin seat in North 24 parganas district by a margin of 1,742 votes against its nearest Trinamool Congress rival and former Indian soccer captain Dipendu Biswas. The seat was earlier held by CPI(M).
BJP retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Prime Minister Modi, albeit with a reduced margin. Ranjanben Bhatt thumped her Congress rival Narendra Rawat by over 3.29 lakh votes. Modi had won the seat by 5.7 lakh votes.
In the other two Lok Sabha bye-elections, Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, the stronghold of ruling SP, Tej Pratap Singh, the grand nephew of Mulayam Singh Yadav, defeated BJP's Prem Singh Skahkya by a margin of more than 3.21 lakh votes. Mulayam had vacated the seat after he chose to retain Azamgarh.
In Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, the ruling TRS retained the seat vacated by party chief K Chandrasekhar Rao. Its candidate K Prabhakar Reddy won by 3,61,277 votes.
In Uttar Pradesh, out of 11 assembly seats, Samajwadi Party won seven seats and BJP one. In Gujarat, BJP won six seats and Congress three, while in Rajasthan Congress bagged three and BJP one. In Andhra Pradesh, ruling TDP retained the Nandigama seat.
In West Bengal, Trinamool and BJP won one seat each. The BJP also made other advances in eastern region wresting Silchar constituency in Assam from the Congress. The All India United Democratic Front and the ruling Congress retained Jamunamukh and Lakhipur seats respectively in the state.
CPI-M won the Manu (ST) Assembly constituency in Tripura while Independent candidate R N Chamling, brother of Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling, won Rangang-Yangang assembly seat in Sikkim by 708 votes defeating his nearest Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) nominee.
Last month, the saffron party suffered a 4-6 defeat at the hands of the RJD-JD(U)-Congress alliance in Bihar and yielded two strongholds to Congress in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the by-elections. In July, it lost all the three assembly seats in Uttarakhand to Congress in the by-elections.
In UP, among the seats lost by BJP were Bijnor, Thakurdwara, Nighasan, Hamirpur, Charkhari, Sirathu, Balha. It retained Saharapur (city seat).
Charkhari was earlier held by Union Minister Uma Bharati. In Gujarat, BJP lost Dessa, Mangrol and Khambalia seats to Congress. It managed to retain Maninagar, Tankara, Talaja, Anand, Kheda and Limkheda assembly seats.
In Rajasthan, BJP lost in Nasirabad, Weir and Surajgarh Assembly constituencies. It retained Kota city.
In West Benagl, whereas Trinamool Congress bagged the prestigious Chowringhee seat. TMC candidate Nayana Bandopadhyay won by a margin of 14344 votes against her nearest rival BJP's Ritesh Tiwari.
AIDUF's Abdur Rahim Ajmal won the Jamunamukh seat defeating Congress' Bashir Uddin Laskar by 22,959 votes in Assam.
AIUDF President Badruddin Ajmal's son Abdur Rahim Ajmal retained the seat polling 62,153 votes.
The ruling Congress retained Lakhipur seat as its candidate Rajdeep Goala defeated his nearest BJP rival Sanjay Thakur by 9172 votes garnering 40,090 votes, while Thakur got 30918 votes. In Silchar, however, BJP's Dilip Kumar Paul won.
Telugu Desam Party's Tangirala Sowmya won the Nandigama Assembly bypoll in Andhra Pradesh by 74,827 votes.
Riding on the sympathy wave, Sowmya, a software engineer, got 99,748 votes. The by-election was necessitated following the death of Sowmya's father due to a cardiac arrest.
CPI-M candidate Prabhat Chowdhury trounced his nearest INC candidate Mailafru Mog in Manu (ST) constituency in Tripura. The constituency fell vacant after former Idustries and Commerce Minister Jitendra Chowdhury was elected to the Lok Sabha.

People have moved beyond love jihad: Sachin Pilot on Congress s victory in Rajasthan bypolls8
0
New Delhi: The Congress was in a celebration mode in Rajasthan as the party won three out of four seats in the state in the recently held bypolls. Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot thanked people and said that it was the result of the party's hard work in the past few months.
"It took a lot of hard work in the past 3 to 4 months. Team work paid off," Pilot said.
Asked about the factors that may have led to the Bharatiya Janata Party's defeat in the bypolls, Pilot said, "India has moved beyond Love jihad and Hindu-Muslim issues." At the same time he added, "The big picture is not who said what but the improvement in Congress's performance. What matters is the hard work and the verdict."
He said that the Congress's impression had improved in the past few months. "People have moved away from the kind of impression the Congress had. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi bestowed faith in me," Pilot said.
The Congress won the Weir, Nasirabad and Surajgarh seat while the BJP only won Kota.

Jaipur: In a jolt to the Vasundhara Raje government, the opposition Congress on Tuesday wrested three Assembly seats of Weir, Nasirabad and Surajgarh from the ruling BJP which could retain only the Kota seat.
Out of four Assembly seats which went to polls on September 13, BJP managed to win only one, bringing down its strength in the 200-member Rajastahn Assembly to 160 from 163.
In Nasirabad Assembly constituency, Congress candidate Ramnarayan Gujjar defeated BJP's Sarita Gena by a margin of 386 votes. Ramnarayan got 66,648 votes while BJP's Sarita got 66,262 votes.
Twenty-three candidates were in the fray including four each of BJP, and Congress, and one CPI-ML.

Congress regained its old Scheduled caste seat of Weir with its candidate Bhajanlal defeating BJP veteran Gangaram Koli by 25108 votes.
In Surajgarh Assembly constituency, BJP's former minister Digamber Singh, who shifted from Bharatpur and is said to be Raje loyalist, lost to the Congress candidate.
Congress' Shravan Kumar secured 70527 votes while Singh secured 67257 votes. With the victory in three seats, Congress tally in the Assembly is now 24.
BJP retained Kota city with party candidate Sandeep Sharma winning the Kota-South Assembly constituency by defeating Congress candidate Shivkant Nandwana by a margin of 25,707 votes. Sharma got 84,233 votes while Shivkant got 58,526 votes.
Twenty-three candidates were in the fray including four each of BJP, and Congress, and one CPI-ML.
The bypolls were necessitated after sitting MLAs Sanwar Lal Jat (Nasirabad), Om Birla (Kota-South), Santosh Ahlawat (Surajgarh) and Bahadur Singh Koli (Weir) resigned from the Assembly following their election to Lok Sabha.
Immediately after the Assembly polls in November last year in Rajasthan, BJP had won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state in May this year.

Bihar: Health Minister says Rs 2 cr bungling is no scam  CM snubs himManjhi has already given a clean chit to Nitish Kumar and also rejected BJP's demand for a CBI probe.
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:56 pm
First, it was letter war between former chief minister Nitish Kumar and his former deputy Sushil Kumar Modi over drug purchase irregularities in purchase of medicines worth Rs 67 crore by the JD(U) government between July and December 2013.
Now, it is state Health Minister Ramdhani Singh, who further raked up a controversy by saying that “Rs 2 crore bungling cannot be called a scam”. The minister, however, was promptly rebuffed by Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi who said “scam is scam” irrespective of amount swindled”. Manjhi, however, has already given a clean chit to former chief minister Nitish Kumar and also rejected BJP’s demand for a CBI probe.
Health Minister Ramdhani Singh on Monday said, “We have detected bungling of Rs 2 Cr in medicine purchase and this cannot be called a scam. A scam should involve swindling of crores of rupees”. Singh, however, reiterated the government stand on clean chit to Nitish Kumar but added that tenure of BJP leaders Nandkishore Yadav and Ashwini Kumar Chobey as health ministers would be put under scanner.
Singh might well have embarrassed the government by admitting bungling in drug purchase, a point being emphasised upon by BJP soon after revelation of additional director KK Singh health committee about irregularities in the drug purchase by Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Private Limited, a government body under health department.
BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “Now that the health minister has admitted irregularities in the drug purchase, let there be a CBI probe into the matter”.

People have rejected BJP s politics of polarisation: CongressPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:02 pm
As BJP suffered reverses in the assembly bypolls, Congress on Tuesday said the results should ring alarm bells for the saffron party as people have rejected its “politics of polarisation” and claimed anti-incumbency factor has set in within 100 days of Modi government coming to power.
“People did not like the attitude of BJP and Modi government. While the Prime Minister himself kept silent, BJP leaders and ministers in the Modi government played the politics of polarisation through their statements,” Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said.
He noted that Congress’ gains in Gujarat and Rajasthan were significant as in the Lok Sabha polls it had drawn a blank in both states. “Now we will try to improve our performance,” said Ahmed, who is is AICC general secretary in-charge for poll bound Haryana.
Turning to Uttar Pradesh, the Congress spokesman alleged that “full authority” had been given to people who were responsible for inciting riots in the state.
“Leave aside caste, creed and religion, these communalforces were acting as triggers to incite fight between husband and wife,” he said in an obvious reference to BJP raking up the issue of “Love Jihad”, the alleged forcible conversion of Hindu girls through marriage.
He said that the bypoll verdict shows that “this is the first government whose anti-incumbency factor has started working within 100 days of coming to power. Alarm bells are ringing for the BJP”.

Medak poll result endorsement of my govt: KCRelection
Chief Minister of the nascent Telangana State said it could not be called a referendum on his Government as it had done little in the last three months. Reiterating that his Government would fulfil all the poll promises, he advised the Opposition parties to be constructive after biting the dust in the by-election.
Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the Medak Lok Sabha byelection result was an endorsement of his Government’s functioning during the first 100 days.
An elated Chief Minister told reporters in Hyderabad on Tuesday after the result was announced that it could not be called a referendum on his Government as it had done little in the last three months.
“KCR and TRS mark of governance is yet to begin as the Government is still formulating policies to transform the State into golden Telangana (Bangaru Telangana),” he said.
Reiterating that his Government would fulfil all the poll promises, he advised the Opposition parties to be constructive after biting the dust in the by-election.
On Opposition parties' demand for convening the Assembly session immediately, Mr. Rao said the Government was well aware of its constitutional obligations. However, the Government would utilise the relaxation provided in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014 to get the budget passed till December 2.
Referring to the demand to officially hold the Hyderabad Liberation Day celebrations on Wednesday, the Chief Minister pointed out that no Government in the past had organised it officially. The party would, however, organise celebrations to mark the occasion across the new State.

Sena backs Sakshi Maharaj's remarks, says Madrassas have become 'factories for jehadis'

Mumbai: The Shiv Sena on Tuesday backed Bharatiya Janata Party MP Sakshi Maharaj's remarks that children studying in Madrassas are trained to become terrorists.
An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna has repeated Maharaj's assertion that Madrassas have become "factories for jehadis". The editorial also questioned the benefit of religious education provided in Madrassas.
It also questioned the government aid to these religious schools.
Sakshi Maharaj alleged that Madrassas were giving "education of terrorism".
#sakshi maharaj #madrassas #jehadis #bjp
Sakshi Maharaj on Sunday alleged that Madrassas were giving "education of terrorism", drawing sharp reaction from other parties which accused the BJP of trying to create communal polarisation by spreading "canard". The BJP too has washed its hands off the controversy saying his views were personal.
"There should be a common board for the Madrassas and they should check what's being taught there. They teach terrorism in Madrassas. Just the way in schools, we are taught good values, they should teach Muslim kids good things as well, and not just teach them the Quran and how to become jihadis.
"Why is there a different code for Madrassas and schools? Madrassas should also teach the same things rather than teaching terrorism," the MP from Unnao constituency said.
Maharaj alleged that students were not being taught about nationalism in religious schools. "Tell me about one Madrassa where the tricolour is hoisted on August 15 and January 26," he said.

Researchers create ceramic that recovers shape after being smashedSep 16, 2014 at 03:38pm IST
Researchers create ceramic that recovers shape after being smashed

New York: Researchers have developed a technology that can lead to production of a material that is thermally insulating but also extremely light-weight and non-breakable.
The team of researchers from California Institute of Technology in the US has developed the method by taking advantage of the unusual properties that solids exhibit at the nanometer scale, where features are measured in billionths of metres.
"The applications of this technique are practically limitless," said Julia Greer, a professor of materials science and mechanics.
Representational image
With the method, researchers demonstrated that a ceramic that contains about 99.9 percent air can be made incredibly strong and made to recover to its original shape after being smashed by over 50 per cent.
A ceramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling.
"Ceramics have always been thought to be heavy and brittle," Greer said.
"If you use the concept of the nano-scale to create structures and then use those nano-structures to construct larger materials, you can obtain nearly any set of properties you want," she added.
To prove this, researchers used a direct laser writing method called two-photon lithography to "write" a three-dimensional pattern in a polymer by allowing a laser beam to cross-link and harden the polymer wherever it is focused.
The parts of the polymer that were exposed to the laser remain intact while the rest dissolved away, revealing a three-dimensional scaffold.
Then the researchers used another method to etch out the polymer from within the structure, leaving a hollow architecture.
Since pretty much any material can be deposited on the scaffolds, the method could be particularly useful for applications in optics, energy efficiency and bio-medicine.
For example, it could be used to reproduce complex structures such as bone, producing a scaffold out of bio-compatible materials on which cells could proliferate.
The study appeared in the journal Science.

US rate hike fears hit markets as BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty fall most in 7wksSensex drops about 324 pts to end at 26,492.51; Nifty slips 109 pts to end below 8,000 mark.
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:48 pm
In their worst single-day drop in nearly 7 weeks, BSE Sensex plunged 324 points to 26,492.51 and NSE Nifty tanked 109 points to 7,932.90 on negative cues from jittery global markets before the US Federal Reserve’s much-awaited monetary policy meeting that starts later today.
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced. Major markets in Asia ended down and Europe was weak in morning trades.
Domestic investors also took money off the table in recent out-performers in sectors including realty, banking, consumer durables and oil & gas. All the 12 BSE sectoral indices ended in the red.
Full Coverage: Indian rupee vs US dollar, others
Smallcap and midcap stocks, which in previous sessions had bucked a weak trend, saw a huge sell-off with their indices falling over 3 per cent each.
The 30-share Sensex after resuming higher at 26,854.90, improved to 26,861.29. However, it succumbed to widespread selling in blue-chips and slipped to day’s low of 26,464.03, before ending at 26,492.51 — down 324.05 points, or 1.21 per cent. This is its worst drop since August 1 when Sensex had plummeted 414.13 points. Today’s closing is also its weakest since August 26 (26,442.81).
Among major laggards, Tata Power suffered the most by plunging 5.85 per cent. Others include Tata Steel, Hindalco, NTPC, Tata Motors, ONGC, RIL, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and L&T.
Bucking the trend, stocks of Dr Reddy, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys gained.
The 50-share Nifty dropped 109.10 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close below 8,000 mark at 7,932.90 after moving between 8,044.90 and 7,925.15 intra-day. Today’s drop is also Nifty’s worst show since August 1 when it fell 118.70 points.
“Market players will be looking for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years. Consensus is that the Fed will hike interest rates next year and it may declare the timelines today,” said HDFC Securities in a note.
Sectorally, the BSE Realty sector index suffered the most by losing 3.42 per cent, followed by Power down 3.26 per cent, Capital Goods 2.70 per cent and Oil & Gas 2.67 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 74.59 crore yesterday as per provisional data. issued by stock exchanges.

Rajasthan: Congress wins 3 out of 4 assembly seats inbypollsThe victory is being seen as a major comeback for the Congress party in the state under the leadership of Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot. (Source: PTI)
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:41 pm
The ruling BJP government was left red-faced Tuesday morning as the decimated Congress yet again asserted itself and swept away three out of the four assembly seats that went to bypolls on September 13. Assembly seats – Weir, Surajgarh and Nasirabad – gave the Congress a clear victory while the BJP retained it Kota South seat.
BJP legislators Sanwar Lal Jat, Om Birla, Santosh Ahlawat and Bahadur Singh Koli, who were elected from Nasirabad, Kota (South), Surajgarh and Weir assembly constituencies, had vacated the seats after being elected in the recent parliamentary elections.
While the overwhelmed Congress camp attributed the victory to growing dissatisfaction among the electorate with the Vasundhara Raje led government, BJP spokespersons maintained that bypolls are contested on local issues. Party spokesperson Kailash Nath Bhatt said, “While the larger polls were held on national and state-level issues, bypolls are always contested on smaller, more local issues. This does not go to show that the people are unhappy with the state government.”
Congress’ Bhajanlal Jatav in Weir won by a margin of 25,108 votes, Sharwan Kumar by 3270 votes in Surajgarh and Ramnarayan Gurjar by a thin margin of 386 votes in Nasirabad. BJP’s Sandeep Sharma managed to retain the Kota South seat and won by a margin of 25,707 votes. BJP leader Om Birla had earlier won this seat by a whopping margin of over 56,000 votes. Recounting was held for Nasirabad seat after BJP workers raised doubts but the Congress managed maintain its lead.
The victory is being seen as a major comeback for the Congress party in the state under the leadership of Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot. Though the three new Congress legislators will add to a decimated count of 23 MLAs in the state assembly and in no way are in a position to threaten the BJP’s dominant majority, the victory comes as a huge morale booster for Congress that was smarting from its ignominious defeat in both the assembly and parliamentary elections.
Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ramnarayan Dudi said that the party was confident of sweeping the upcoming local body elections slated later this year.
PCC chief Sachin Pilot said soon after the results were announced, “For us it is a victory not on three but all four seats. Even in Kota South, which the BJP has retained, their voteshare has shrunk significantly. The ruling BJP government misused their power, blatantly violated the model code of conduct, used muscle and money power in an effort to influence voting in the four seats but they have got their befitting reply. The state government should not have stopped out welfare continued…

Kurds in Europe take up arms against ISgroupThere are no exact numbers on how many people have left Europe to fight the Islamic State group.
Associated Press | Koege | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:26 pm
Shaho Pirani says he’s just a phone call away from leaving his quiet life in Denmark and joining Kurdish forces battling against Islamic State militants in Iraq.
The 30-year-old Kurd, who fled from Iran with his older brother in 1991, says he feels a moral duty to help the Peshmerga, the armed forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government, to fight the “psychopaths” of the Islamic State group.
“I feel so helpless,” Pirani said in an interview in his home in Koege, a tranquil Copenhagen suburb with neatly trimmed lawns and hedges. “I am ready to die for the Kurdish cause.”
While more than 2,000 Europeans are believed to have joined the Islamic State organization and other jihadist groups as foreign fighters, a smaller number has left Europe in recent months to fight against the Islamic militants, primarily with Peshmerga forces in Iraq’s Kurdish north, Kurdish Diaspora leaders and security officials say.
Unlike with Islamic State fighters, however, European governments don’t show any intention to stop the Kurdish volunteers from getting involved in the conflict. Though they, too, stand to get weapons training and combat experience and could return traumatized by the horrors of war, the Kurdish fighters are not seen as a threat to the West.
“Our focus as a security service will be more on groups like IS and not people going to defend areas against the IS,” said Trond Hugubakken, spokesman for the Norway’s PST security service.
Traveling to participate in an armed conflict is rarely a crime in itself, so European security officials say they act only if they suspect a fighter has committed war crimes or might engage in terrorist activities after returning.
There are no exact numbers on how many people have left Europe to fight the Islamic State group. But Mehmet Tanriverdi, deputy chairman of the Kurdish Community in Germany, said he knew of “dozens” of Kurds who had traveled from Germany and other European countries to join the Peshmerga.
Shwan Zulal, an associate fellow at King’s College and the director of London-based Carduchi Consulting, said the stream of Kurdish fighters from Britain was “nowhere near the number of people that have gone and joined ISIS.”
British authorities might be “somewhat worried” about Britons volunteering to join Kurdish forces, Zulal said. But he could not imagine anyone being prosecuted for “fighting the United Kingdom’s enemies.”
Britain, Germany, the U.S. and other countries are sending light weapons and ammunition to the Peshmerga. Aided by American airstrikes, the Kurdish forces have recovered some territory seized by Islamic State militants in recent months.
Edmond Messchaert, spokesman for the Dutch Justice Ministry on counter terrorism, said Dutch Kurds are not being blocked from joining the Peshmerga and would not be prosecuted on return unless they committed war crimes.
It is not as clear-cut when continued…

Govt to form database on suppression of prop...Government may form database on suppression of property sales amount

(The guidance value of land…)
NEW DELHI: In an exercise aimed at checking blackmoney, economic intelligence agencies have started identifying instances where proceeds from property sale have been suppressed in a bid to defraud the government of revenue from stamp duty.
The government may also form a database of the suppressed sales proceeds to help authorities decide on appropriate guidance price for land in an area, which is "closer to reality" and discourages blackmoney transactions, according to official documents.
The guidance value of land is the minimum price set by the state governments below which property cannot be registered.
The matter of sharing such details between Income Tax and Controller of Stamps departments was discussed during the meeting of Economic Intelligence Council (EIC) headed by the Finance Minister.
"It was reported that in large number of cases, the actual amount for which the property is purchased or sold is much more than the amount at which it is registered.
"A suggestion was mooted that instances of suppression of sale proceeds detected by Income Tax department could be used by Controller of Stamps department to build up a date base which would serve as supporting material for them to arrive at the prevalent price in an area. Thus the guidance value can be increased and brought closer to reality," said the minutes of the meeting.
The field formations of Income Tax departments have been told to share relevant information in suitable cases in Regional Economic Intelligence Council (REIC) forum.
During the meeting, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has been told to have a relook at the issue by taking into consideration the provision enumerated in the Stamp Act also, as per the minutes.
"There is flow of blackmoney in suppression of property sales details and and also loss of revenue. Concerned authorities are devising ways to check them," said a government official , who attended the meeting.
He said it is a usual practise to take large amount of blackmoney without mentioning it in sale deed. "It is illegal flow and efforts are on to check it," the official said.
One reasons behind some people suppressing sale proceeds is high rate of stamp duty also, he said. Stamp duty is a kind of property tax to be paid in every deal at a prescribed rate on the transaction value or calculations based on circle rate, whichever is higher. The rate varies from state to state.
There has been a demand form real estate sector to reduce stamp duty to check flow of blackmoney.
"Land and real estate are possibly the most important class of assets used for investment of blackmoney. As immovable properties are not usually comparable, valuations are different. This imparts flexibility to the valuation process, and makes it an ideal investment for blackmoney.
"As an asset class both 'black' and 'white' savings are utilised for investment in land and real estate, which provides hedge against inflation apart from a profitable alternative for investment of black savings," said a Finance Ministry report on blackmoney.

Fed-watching: It s all about word choiceFed watching: It’s all about word choice

Sometimes it’s what’s missing or been edited out of a document that provides the best information. That could be the case Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve ends its two-day meeting and releases its latest policy statement.
Fed watchers will be scouring the document to see if the phrase “considerable time” is still included. If not, it likely means the first interest rate hike from the Fed will come sooner than expected next year. That change in timing could cause a fresh bout of market volatility.
Low rates have been a key driver of the bull market in stocks. Wall Street doesn’t expect the Fed to raise short-term rates, now pegged near 0%, until mid-2015. But that forecast is likely to be pushed forward if the Fed deletes its “considerable time” terminology. It has pledged to keep rates low for a “considerable time” — or roughly six months, says Fed chair Janet Yellen — after the end of its bond-buying program, which could come as early as October.
“Some (investors) are interpreting this prospective change as indicating that the (Fed) will start raising rates in March,” says Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA.
He disagrees. The Fed is “likely to move cautiously considering the surging dollar, weakness in Europe and fear of repeating (last year’s) ‘taper tantrum’ sell-off,” he says. Also, “The removal of the words ‘considerable time’ would be accompanied by language emphasizing that future rate (moves) are data dependent.”
For now, Grigoli says he’s not changing his “positive approach” to the market.

NSEL lacks credibility; merge NSEL with FTIL: FMC to govt
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Post your opinion here
 
Stating that crisis-hit NSEL is "bereft of any credibility", regulator FMC today said it has recommended the government to consider merger of the spot commodity exchange with its promoter  FTIL for speedy recovery of dues over Rs 5,300 crore from defaulters.
To ensure that FTIL takes responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) at the earliest, Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has also suggested the government to consider taking over the management of FTIL.
Both Corporate Affairs and Finance Ministries are studying the feasibility of implementing the FMC's proposals.
"The Commission, vide its letter dated August 18, has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to consider the merger/amalgamation of NSEL with FTIL in public interest so that the human and financial resources of FTIL are also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters at NSEL," FMC said in its latest report.
The recommendation has been given to the government in view of the depleted resources in terms of manpower and financial strength available at the disposal of NSEL, it said.  
Also, "NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery from the defaulting members," it  served.
The regulator has also recommended the government to consider taking over of the management of FTIL, thereby ensure the company takes full responsibility to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.
Taking over the FTIL management will help manage the affairs of the company in in a professional way by bringing in an institutionalised framework as recommended by the Working Group appointed by the government, it added.
NSEL, a subsidiary of the Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies India Ltd, has recovered so far a little over Rs 360 crore of dues from defaulters out of the total outstanding amount of Rs 5,689 crore.
Recently, FMC had said that the NSEL has not made much progress in recovery of dues from defaulters, which the spot exchange refuted saying the watchdog has adequate powers to speed up efforts to get back the investor money.

Hyderabad, Sept 16:  
The GMR group is planning to set up an aerospace training centre in Hyderabad on the lines of the one established by Morocco.
With the help of French multi-national firm Safran, the group has sent a team to the African country to study the model adopted by it. It has sought the help of Telangana Government in this regard.
P S Nair, Chief Executive Officer (Corporate – Airport Sector), who is a member of the team, has said that the company would like to play a leading role in setting up the training institute. He said that it would approach the Government to seek its assistance in establishing the institute.
Talking to media on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Aeronautical Society of India here on Tuesday, he said that all the players in the ecosystem must take part in the initiative.
Earlier addressing the conference, G M Rao, Chairman of the group and President of the society, said that the Moroccan model had helped it to become a destination of choice for aerospace companies. “Today, Morocco’s aerospace and defence sector is its one of the major GDP contributors. We would like to replicate the model,” he said.
“We have developed relationship with the Safran team in Morocco. They are ready to guide us in creating the aerospace training institute in Hyderabad. I appeal the State Government to help us in this,” he said.

Facebook users at greater risk of falling prey to social media scams: StudyReuters
New York, Sept 16:  
Habitual use of Facebook makes individuals susceptible to social media phishing attacks by criminals, an Indian-origin researcher has found.
This is likely because users automatically respond to requests without considering how they are connected with those sending the requests, how long they have known them, or who else is connected with them, researchers said.
Predictors of habitual use of Facebook include frequent interactions with the platform, a large number of friend connections, and individuals’ inability to regulate their social media consumption.
“Social media phishing is the attack vector of choice among cyber criminals and has been implicated in crimes ranging from home invasion to cyber bullying, illegal impersonation of individuals and organisation, and espionage,” said Dr Arun Vishwanath, author of the study, from the Department of Communication, University at Buffalo.
“These scams attempt to trick people into accepting friend requests and gathering intel from them. Hence, understanding why individuals fall victim to social media phishing scams is important from an organisational security, law enforcement, and a national security standpoint.” Vishwanath said.
Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.
The study was published in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication.

MCX-SX gets conditional renewal from SebiMCX-SX gets conditional one-year renewal; Sebi seeks business plan
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 23:43 IST
As crisis at its erstwhile promoter group continues to cast a shadow, MCX Stock Exchange on Monday got a one-year conditional renewal to function as a bourse and regulator Sebi asked it to submit a long-term sustainable business plan and take other remedial actions.
Besides, the exchange would not be allowed to introduce any new contract till it meets minimum networth requirement of Rs 100 crore, for which it has been given three-months time.
The current recognition of MCX-SX, which was set up by Jignesh Shah-led Financial Technologies Group, expired on Monday, but Sebi has now decided to extend it for a period of one year, commencing September 15 and ending on September 15, 2015.
The renewal is subject to five specific conditions and compliance to other conditions specified by Sebi from time to time, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a statement.
"The exchange shall build its networth (undisputed) to the level as prescribed in Sebi (SECC) Regulations 2012 within a period of three months from the date of renewal of recognition. Further, the exchange shall also submit a business plan to satisfy the regulator about the long term sustainability of the exchange," the regulator said.
While the exchange has been claiming to have a networth of Rs 100 crore, the regulator does not share the same view and pegs the figure at about Rs 56 crore, sources said.
Sebi further said that MCX-SX "shall not introduce any new contracts till fulfilment of networth requirement" and it would have to comply with Sebi's directions with regard to entities which have been declared not 'fit and proper' person.
The regulator also asked the exchange to "take immediate steps to rectify the deficiencies pointed out in the systems audit as well as special audit."
Besides, the exchange will have to take necessary steps for compliance with shareholding requirement by all the shareholders as per SEBI (SECC) Regulations 2012, Sebi said.
Earlier in March this year, Sebi ruled that Financial Technologies group was not "fit and proper" to own stakes in any stock exchange and directed it to divest existing holdings in MCX-SX and four other entities.
This order followed Shah-led group coming under scanner of various agencies, including CBI, for alleged irregularities in the grant of license to MCX-SX, as also for the payment crisis worth thousands of crores at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), also set up by the same group.
While FTIL Group has challenged the Sebi order on their 'fit and proper status', they no more qualify as 'promoter' in MCX-SX and some other entities such as Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).
Last year also, while granting a one-year renewal to MCX-SX, Sebi had asked the exchange to strengthen its governance structure to continue remaining a recognised bourse.
Sources said that it might be difficult for MCX-SX to meet some of the conditions set by Sebi for the latest renewal.
The bourse earned total revenue from operations of Rs 91.83 crore for the latest fiscal 2013-14, down from Rs 155.23 crore in the previous year.
It incurred a loss of Rs 154.53 crore for the last year, as against a profit of Rs 21.42 crore in 2012-13. The exchange has attributed the loss to commencement of new segments and fall in volumes in the currency derivatives segment.
"The sentimental fallout of the defaults in another Exchange floated by the erstwhile promoter and introduction of zero pricing by competitor among other events leading to negative publicity also contributed to the fall in volumes," MCX-SX said in its annual report.
"With the management and Board level changes as well as relaxations in the regulatory regime for CD Segment, your Directors feel the company would be able to see better volumes in the CD segment and consequently improve its financial performance in the coming years," it informed its investors.
MCX-SX was notified a 'recognised stock exchange' on December 21, 2012. Its shareholders include top public sector banks, private sector banks and domestic financial institutions who, together hold over 88 per cent stake.
It offers trading in Capital Market, Futures & Options, Currency Derivatives and Debt Market segments. It has also received in-principle approval from Sebi for operationalizing SME trading platform.
It commenced operations in the Currency Derivatives Segment on October 7, 2008. It launched Capital Market Segment, Futures and Options Segment and flagship index 'SX40' on February 9, 2013 and commenced trading from February 11, 2013.
The Debt Market Segment was launched on June 7, 2013, and trading commenced from June 10, 2013. The Exchange started live trading in cash-settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF), on 10-year Government of India security, in its Currency Derivative Segment from January 20, 2014.
MCX-SX had first got a license from Sebi to operate as a stock exchange in September 2012 and this permit was to expire on September 15, 2013, before getting extended by a year.
The bourse began operations in February 2013. However, the trading volumes of the exchange has been quite low as compared to rivals BSE and NSE, while problems at group entity NSEL in July 2013 further worsened the situation.
While Sebi has decided to renew its license twice now, the regulator has been asking MCX-SX to work towards strengthening its governance practices and comply with all applicable regulations to operate as a stock exchange.
Sebi also previously warned that the licence can be withdrawn in case of any non-compliance to its directions.

India and China Have Outgrown the Westreddit
NEW DELHI -- From the heady days of "Chindia," when China and India were twinned together in the global imagination, comparisons between the two countries have taken on a more modest hue. Once united by their shared status of being giant Asian countries with booming demographies and unlimited economic potential, the two are perceived to be very different today.
India's incomplete domestic transformation, recently slowing economy and its flourishing and contentious democracy mark it as starkly different from China, which has shot ahead economically -- with a GDP  of more than four times India's size -- while remaining resolutely authoritarian, under one-party Communist rule.
Despite these stark differences -- and the bitter legacy of the 1962 war between the two nations, which culminated in a decisive Chinese victory and bequeathed to both nations the world's longest unresolved border dispute -- the two nations are moving towards each other in a wary embrace.
China's new leader, President Xi Jinping, who has impressively consolidated his power in Beijing, arrives in India this week at a time when India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is still basking in the glow of a decisive electoral victory. The two will meet in Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat on his 64th birthday on Wednesday.
Though there have been no clashes on the frontier in decades, both countries' media tend to bristle at each other's alleged provocations. A series of irritants has continued to plague the political relationship.
Delhi is miffed by China's claim to the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls "South Tibet", its support for Pakistan in the acrimonious geopolitics of the subcontinent, and its insistence on issuing stapled visas to Indians living in Kashmir to underscore Beijing's view that Kashmir is disputed territory. In turn, China looks askance at India having given refuge to the Dalai Lama and his followers since 1959, and his maintaining a Tibetan government in exile on Indian soil, though New Delhi fully recognizes Beijing's sovereignty over Tibet and does not allow Tibetan protestors to disrupt Chinese leaders' visits. At the same time, Mr Modi has tended to align his government with those critical of China's territorial claims in the South China and East China Seas and signaled his determination to prioritize India's relations with Japan and Australia, as well as with countries in India's immediate neighborhood.
TRADE IS TELLING
But economic relations tell a different story. Of course, China is way ahead. China started its liberalization a good decade and a half before India, shot up faster, hit double-digit growth when India was still hovering around 5 percent, and with compound growth, has put itself in a totally different league from India, continuing to grow faster from a larger base. Indian visitors to China, including then-Chief Minister Narendra Modi, emerge with acute cases of infrastructure envy, contrasting China's gleaming skyscrapers and six-lane expressways to India's own ramshackle facilities and congested roadways.
Yet bilateral trade volume has multiplied several hundredfold in the last three decades, crossing $70 billion USD by the end of 2013 from a level of only $30 million in 1992. (The trade balance is, however, skewed 2 to 1 in China's favor.) China has now overtaken the U.S. as India's largest single trading partner , and the two countries seem well on course to reach their proclaimed target of $100 billion in annual trade by 2015.
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and Infosys recruits Chinese staff for their headquarters in Bangalore. There are dozens of Chinese engineers working in (and learning from) Indian computer firms and engineering companies from Gurgaon to Bangalore, while Indian software engineers in Chennai and Bangalore support the Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer Huawei.
By and large, India is good at things that China needs to improve at, notably software, where it has been unable to rival India's IT dominance; China excels at hardware and manufacturing, which India sorely lacks. So India's Mahindra and Mahindra manufactures tractors in Nanchang for export to the United States. The key operating components of Apple's iPod were invented by the Hyderabad company PortalPlayer, while the iPods themselves are manufactured in China.
Philips employs nearly 3,000 Indians at its "Innovation Campus" in Bangalore who write more than 20 percent of Philips' global software, which in turn goes to Philips' 50,000 strong workforce in China to turn into brand-name goods. China's manufacturing muscle is on display in India, with telecoms equipment maker Huawei clocking $800M in Indian sales, amounting to about 2 percent of its global revenues.
WE'VE OUTGROWN THE WESTERN WORLD ORDER
Politically too, the temperature has begun warming. India and China both see themselves as having outgrown a world order dominated by the West. They are moving beyond traditional bromides like their joint advocacy of the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," to pragmatic cooperation in the framework of the BRICS grouping. They recently came together to announce the creation of the BRICS Bank, which will be located in Shanghai and headed by an Indian.
China has supported Indian participation in the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation and India has extended China observer status is the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Strikingly, in 2013, China's new Premier Li Keqiang chose India, rather than America or any European country, as the destination for his first ever official foreign visit. The Chinese Foreign Minister was also the newly-elected Modi's first official visitor, and President Xi has already had a chance to meet the new Indian Prime Minister at the BRICS summit in Brazil in July.
Neither leader will be at the U.N. climate change summit later this month, a reflection of their shared rejection of Western attempts to place the onus for global warming on developing countries rather than where it rightly belongs.
Indeed, the Chinese are sparing no effort to make the impending presidential visit a success. President Xi's gesture in turning up at Mr Modi's home town for his birthday is unusual, especially since he had already had to adjust his dates to arrive after President Pranab Mukherjee's return from a trip to Vietnam.  He has also gladdened Indian hearts (never pleased to be "hyphenated" with Pakistan) by taking Islamabad off his South Asian itinerary because of the political troubles there.
A stray remark by Modi on a recent visit to Japan about some countries' expansionist inclinations, which was widely read as a criticism of China, has not been matched by China, whose Assistant Foreign Minister told reporters in Beijing that "China has never, and will not, use so-called military or other means to try and hem in India."
INVESTMENT DEALS
Against this background, significant economic gains are expected from the Xi visit. The visiting Chinese president, who is travelling with a delegation of over 100 senior business executives, including the heads of China Harbour, China Railway Construction Group and Huawei, as well as of the four biggest Chinese banks, is expected to announce some $100 billion of Chinese investment commitments over the next five years, nearly three times the $35 billion secured by Prime Minister Modi during his widely-hailed trip to Japan.
Much of this will feature investment in the new Indian industrial parks, a pet project of Mr Modi's. China will initially invest $7 billion in industrial parks in Pune (for automobile manufacturing) and Gandhinagar in Gujarat (for power equipment). There are also indications that China is also planning to set up an industrial park in Tamil Nadu for the textile sector.
Other areas of likely investment, according to Chinese diplomats in India, include the modernization of railways, with $50 billion worth of investments contemplated in improving rolling stock and running bullet and hi-speed trains in India; upgrading highways and ports; power generation, distribution and transmission; and food processing. The billions of dollars that will be needed in loans to finance Indian infrastructure projects (which will mostly take place as joint ventures with Chinese firms) will be funded by Chinese banks. Such loans, often tied to purchases from Chinese equipment manufacturers, have already relieved pressure on heavily indebted Indian companies.
There are still significant areas where progress is needed. India's complaints about the trade balance are augmented by worries about Chinese dumping and non-trade barriers to Indian investment in China. People-to-people contact is limited: though tourism, particularly of Indian pilgrims to the major Hindu holy sites in Tibet, Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, can be said to be thriving -- nearly 600,000 Indians visited China for business, tourism and study in 2012, while only 140,000 Chinese returned the compliment.
Clearly, there's a long way to go before Sino-Indian relations can be described as truly close. But they're improving, and President Xi's visit is poised to be the capstone of this rising edifice.

How to save the unionSeptember 15, 2014 3:52 pm
Gifted amateurism is no foundation for a united kingdom
By Janan Ganesh
©AFP
Britons will feel a peculiar sensation on Friday morning. The union will be saved – or so the polls suggest – yet seem frailer than it ever has been. Perhaps 45 per cent of Scots or more are going to vote for secession in Thursday’s referendum , a number that outstrips all but the most grandiose expectations at the start of the campaign. Many of those voting the other way will do so out of risk-aversion rather than any emotional fealty. Had it not been for the euro crisis, which deprived nationalists of a neat answer as to which currency an independent Scotland would use, the United Kingdom would be done for.
Even the unionist side has accepted the reality of Scottish otherness. David Cameron has absented himself for most of the campaign because he has the wrong accent (English) and belongs to the wrong party (Conservative). This is simultaneously shrewd judgment by the prime minister and the ultimate proof of what a brittle thing the UK really is.

UK voters and the economy
The problem is about to get worse. Not only has the union been tugged loose by this referendum, it will keep loosening the day after. All the main parties in Westminster have promised to divest more powers to Edinburgh, starting almost immediately. With all the authority of a man who scraped 29 per cent of the vote at the last general election, Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron’s predecessor, has promised “nothing less than a modern form of Scottish home rule”. The fact that he is in no official position to offer anything of the sort, and that neither the English nor the Welsh nor the Northern Irish nor parliament itself have been consulted, seems just a rumple to be ironed out in good time.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless. Irreversible promises to do with the governing arrangements of the UK are being thrown around as campaign bait by desperate men in the last ditch.
Their punishment will be the ordeal of having to honour them. On top of everything it already runs, Scotland is being offered the chance to vary tax rates and welfare benefits. This is not quite devolution-max – generally taken to mean autonomy over everything other than foreign affairs and defence – but then it is only a starting bid. Alex Salmond , Scotland’s nationalist first minister, will ask for more and, with the vote-share he is about to achieve, he is entitled to. The two capitals will haggle their way to devo-max or some approximation of it.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless
At that point, MPs representing Scottish seats in Westminster, who are overwhelmingly Labour, will be voting on legislation that scarcely affects their constituents. Anybody who thinks this will be allowed to stand does not talk to enough Tory MPs, many of whose private views on Scottish independence already range from insouciance to glee.
In short, Scottish home rule means English home rule, which in turn means a separate constitutional wrangle about what shape this should take. There may be a federal UK, as Mr Brown suggests, but England’s preponderance would leave it looking freakishly askew. The alternative is to break up England itself into self-governing regions, an old idea that usually runs into a wall of local intransigence. The northeast voted against the creation of its own assembly 10 years ago by a crushing margin. City mayors were rejected in most of the big cities outside London in 2011.
The point is not that greater devolution to Scotland is a bad idea. It is right and unavoidable. The point is that it opens vast and nearly unanswerable questions about the governance of the rest of the kingdom that politicians, in their desperation to scrape over the line on Thursday, have not thought through. The time to ponder a new settlement was the confirmation of the referendum two years ago, when devo-max could have been added as a third option on the ballot. Debate would have swirled around the meaning and implications of that middle way.
Now, it is hard to avoid the image of Mr Cameron and his peers scrawling a new constitution on the back of a panini wrapper as their trains hurtle north for a jaunty last-minute campaign stop they never expected to have to make. There must be a point at which the British traditions of amateurism and muddling through become indistinguishable from the chaotic caprice of a banana republic.
A question nags: how unionist is unionism really? When even supporters of the UK envisage gradual divergence between Edinburgh and Westminster – ever-looser union, to invert the founding text of the EU – then Mr Salmond’s point is largely made for him. Unionism used to suffer from absolutism; many of its adherents resisted the creation of a Scottish parliament long after it had become irresistible. Now it suffers from the opposite problem. It craves the legal fact of the union without any of the content. For all the fervour on both sides, the difference between nationalism and unionism is fading to vanishing point.

Thou shalt not speak  Congress tells its leadersPrint
Written by Manoj C G | New Delhi | Posted: September 15, 2014 9:47 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 3:16 am
In an unprecedented move, the Congress on Monday gagged its leaders from airing their views in public. But hours after the party said only the designated spokespersons were “authorised” to speak on “behalf of the party”, two of its visible faces — former union minister Manish Tewari and Rashid Alvi — hit back, saying they would continue to interact with the media.
Hours after the party’s communication department chief Ajay Maken tweeted that “only the spokespersons… are authorised to speak on behalf of the party”, general secretary and spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed drew another red line at the AICC briefing. He said there was no bar on general secretaries talking to the media on issues related to states, implying that they should refrain from talking on issues which do not fall in their domain. He, however, said the direction was not aimed at any particular leader.
Maken even tweeted the list of 18 spokespersons. This list, released in January this year, comprises five senior spokespersons and 13 spokespersons. Alvi is not in the list, and Tewari ceased to be a spokesperson in October 2012 after becoming a union minister.
The move clearly indicates the simmering tension and tussle within the Congress after its crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. On one hand, its leaders have been speaking in different voices on key issues, and on the other, there has been open criticism against the leadership.
In fact, a group of young AICC secretaries went to the extent of asking the elders to refrain from making negative comments in public.
They were upset with general secretary Digvijaya Singh’s suggestion that party vice president Rahul Gandhi should be seen and heard more and the debate triggered by his colleague Janardan Dwivedi’s demand for fixing an age limit for holding active party posts.
Ahmed said it was not a gag order, but a reminder that the 18 designated spokespersons were the only ones authorised to speak on behalf of the party. It is another matter that many of them, including P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sandeep Dikshit, have hardly addressed more than one press conference at the AICC office after the poll defeat.
Sources said Maken’s missive was aimed at Tewari and Alvi who began their mornings with “television bytes”. This eroded the media department’s utility and at times their comments too were not in congruence with the party’s views, they added. Both Tewari and Alvi are former party spokespersons. For instance, Tewari contradicted the party line on the issue of former Chief Justice P Sathasivam’s appointment as Kerala Governor earlier this month, when he said there was “no constitutional or legal bar” on his appointment.
The immediate provocation, sources said, was Tewari and Alvi’s reaction to BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj’s allegation that madrasas across the country were imparting “education of terror” and “love jihad”. The communication department, sources said, had decided that the party should not join issue with Maharaj as it felt these remarks were “orchestrated” and aimed at polarisation. It felt the party should continued…

Will the Ebola virus go airborne (And is that even the right question)By Sarah Larimer September 15 Follow @slarimer

The Ebola virus, which has killed more than 2,400 people during the ongoing epidemic in West Africa, spreads through contact with bodily fluids . That means you can catch it from infected blood, for example, or if you come in contact with vomit from an Ebola patient.
You can't catch it from breathing in the same air as someone suffering from Ebola — at least you can't right now. But as the virus continues to spread and mutate , could airborne transmission become a concern?
Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, raised that possibility in a New York Times op-ed last week.
"Why are public officials afraid to discuss this?" Osterholm wrote in a piece headlined "What We're Afraid to Say About Ebola." "They don’t want to be accused of screaming 'Fire!' in a crowded theater — as I’m sure some will accuse me of doing. But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic."
When asked about the piece and the possibility of airborne Ebola, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Post on Monday that he wasn't "pooh-poohing" the idea, but that the terrifying scenario probably wouldn't occur — and that officials should focus on more imminent concerns.
"The fact is, historically, it is unlikely to happen," Fauci said. "Not impossible, but unlikely. What is very, very likely is that if we don't do something transformationally bigger than what we're doing now ... this is going to get even more out of control than it is."
. @chriscmooney (2/n) opinions of many virologists IMO. Not scared 2 talk about airborne transmission--just trying to be realistic about risk
— Tara C. Smith (@aetiology) September 12, 2014
But what about if a person is standing next an Ebola patient, and he or she spits while talking? That's something we should worry about, right?
Just forget the hypotheticals, Fauci said.
"It's very difficult for people to separate a hypothetical possibility from a likelihood," Fauci said. "If we got overly concerned over every hypothetical possibility, people would be frightened all the time."
Discussions like this can be frustrating to scientists, said Rich Condit , a panelist on the podcast this Week in Virology .
"This is what bothered me more than anything else — and it comes from the [op-ed's] title itself — is this idea that scientists are reluctant to discuss openly something, or are considering it in private," said Condit, a smallpox expert.
"It fosters …" Condit added, before stopping. "Oh, this is so annoying!"
It fosters a public distrust of scientists, Condit continued. And that can sometimes be really dangerous.
It's true that the situation in Africa could change, said Christian Brechot, president of the Pasteur Institute . But it's also true that there's no evidence to show that Ebola has gone airborne. And that means that instead of asking whether medical teams are ready for airborne transmission, Brechot said, we should be asking if they are ready for any scenario.
"We should work all together to prepare, to prepare for anything to happen," Brechot said.
Osterholm was not available for comment Monday.
More than 2,400 Ebola-related deaths have been recorded in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization, with 4,784 probable, confirmed and suspected cases of the virus reported in the Ebola-ravaged region.
Scientists sometimes talk differently than other people, Condit said. They don't like to communicate absolute certainties, and they're used to being wrong. That sometimes conflicts with what the public wants to hear and leads to misunderstandings.
Turning the conversation about Ebola toward whether the virus could be transmitted through the air, he said, would be "a huge distraction from the real problem" of getting care to those who need it.
"It's not true," Condit said. "It's not true that they're all worried. It's not true that they're keeping stuff under wraps. It's just not true."

Cognizant shines in Indian IT sectorAugust 14, 2011 4:42 pm
Cognizant shines in Indian IT sector
By James Fontanella-Khan in Mumbai
Francisco D’Souza, the chief executive of Cognizant Technology Solutions , exudes confidence at a time of heightened global uncertainty and as most Indian information technology companies are underperforming expectations.
The 42-year-old is not one for bragging, but is fully aware that the group he helped found is considered IT’s rising star by most sector analysts.

Investor demand for Alibaba’s bonds reaches $55bn
The Nasdaq-listed group, headquartered in the US but which operates predominantly from India, saw revenue grow 40 per cent in 2010 and expects 32 per cent growth in sales this year to $6.06bn. That compares with 2011-12 growth estimates for the entire sector of about 15 per cent, according to Nasscom, the body representing the $70bn-plus Indian IT industry.
In the last quarter, Cognizant, which was spun off from US business intelligence group Dun & Bradstreet in 1996, overtook Wipro to become India’s third-largest software exporter by sales. Industry experts expect the fast-growing group to eventually surpass number two Infosys and challenge the dominance of Tata Consultancy Services , the sector’s top player with revenues of about $8bn.
Mr D’Souza tells the Financial Times that the secret to the company’s success has been its positioning in the IT market as partly low-cost Indian IT outsourcer and partly high-end western consultancy.
“Clients had two views of the market,” says Mr D’Souza. “[They] viewed Indian companies on one side as being very good for low-end mechanical work, and they viewed [consultancy] companies as having higher-end skills: deeper industry knowledge, better onsite project management and the ability to drive change.”
Cognizant tried to position themselves in the middle to differentiate their offering, he says.
TCS, Infosys and Wipro are facing stiff competition from companies such as Accenture , IBM and Capgemini and are battling above-inflation increases in wages that could eventually erode their cost benefits. Jitters in developed markets – where most of the IT companies’ clients are based – also remain a matter of concern.
To keep growing, Cognizant came up with its own “secret sauce”, as Mr D’Souza puts it. The group has focused on investing more than its peers on innovation – resulting in generating lower margins – and deepening its relationships with existing clients.
“We made a decision to set operating margins at a target level of 19 to 20 per cent, lower than our key offshore competitors, to give us the room to reinvest everything above that into the business,” says Mr D’Souza.
Its other strength has been that about 90 per cent of its annual growth comes from existing clients.
Cognizant began offering simple back-office services. Today it spends most of its money on developing high-end IT services, as well as working closely with its clients to build a presence on social networks.
Analysts say its success comes from its focus on developing ideas to help companies boost revenues rather than on cutting costs.
“Cognizant prepared better to grow faster in the pack,” says Sudin Apte, principal IT analyst at Offshore Insights. “The company [also] took a bold step and increased its spend in a tough economy on activities such as R&D and innovation, account management, building new offerings and solutions, and continued recruiting at senior and middle management level when arguably many others cut their budgets.”

The leaders of the three main partiesWhat happens now?
The leaders of the three main parties at Westminster have signed a pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland, if Scots reject independence.
The pledge, which appears on the front of the Daily Record newspaper, has been signed by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.
It has three parts and also commits to preserving the Barnett funding formula.
The "Yes" campaign has argued the only guarantee of more powers is a vote for independence.
The first part of the agreement promises "extensive new powers" for the Scottish Parliament "delivered by the process and to the timetable agreed" by the three parties.
The second says the leaders agree that "the UK exists to ensure opportunity and security for all by sharing our resources equitably".
The third "categorically states" that the final say on funding for the NHS will lie with the Scottish government "because of the continuation of the Barnett allocation for resources, and the powers of the Scottish Parliament to raise revenue".
The Barnett formula is the method used to determine the distribution of public spending around the UK.
The shadow foreign secretary denied the powers pledge had come too late in the referendum debate.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Douglas Alexander said: "Here in Scotland, we have been talking about these powers for many months. What we are saying today is we can have the best of both worlds. We can have a stronger Scottish parliament but with the strength, stability and security of the United Kingdom.
"That pledge, that vow that we can have faster, safer, better change is actually a vision around which Scotland can unite."
He added: "I don't think there's any embarrassment about placing policies on the front page of papers with just days to go. I think the 'Yes' campaign are struggling.
"The economic risks suddenly became very real last week, and at the same time we are offering what I believe most of use here in Scotland which is faster, safer and better change."
Mr Alexander dismissed "Yes" campaign claims that independence is the only way to get the government Scotland votes for.
Elsewhere...
Confidential papers passed to the BBC suggest a radical cost-saving plan will be implemented in the Scottish NHS after the referendum.
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney will meet apprentices at an engineering firm in Renfrew. They will argue that independence will allow Scotland's economy to grow.
Labour leader Ed Miliband and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown will be on the campaign trail for Better Together. Mr Miliband will say a vote for independence will be "an irreversible decision" and "a risk to jobs".
Also speaking on BBC Breakfast, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "If there was a serious intention to deliver more powers, why hasn't that happened before now?
"Tory MPs, including Christopher Chope, have already said they would block more powers. If we vote 'No', there are no guarantees at all."
She added: "They [the pro-Union parties] are treating voters in Scotland with contempt."
Asked how a "Yes" vote guarantee "better lives" for people in Scotland, she replied: "Independence is not a magic want, but it is a massive opportunity.
"We can make life better, not overnight, but over time."
The pledges were first outlined by the former prime minister, Gordon Brown, on Monday .
The way the announcement has been made echoes the original pledge by Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband of greater devolution for Scotland. That promise was also first announced by Mr Brown.
Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, the prime minister said more powers had always been part of his plan .
"I always said right from the start of this campaign, if Scotland voted 'No' to separation, the rest of the United Kingdom would say 'Yes' to further devolution," said Mr Cameron.
"If Scotland wants more devolution - and I think Scotland should have more devolution - you have to answer the prior question 'Do you want to stay in the United Kingdom?'
"And of course that wasn't just my view; that was the view of the leaders of other United Kingdom parties who all thought it was important. Let's settle the question of separation and then look at devolution."
Mr Cameron also said the question of whether Scottish MPs at Westminster should vote on laws that do not affect them will get "more pressing" if there is further devolution to Scotland.
Final days
On the penultimate day of campaigning ahead of Thursday's referendum, the "Yes" side will focus on jobs and the NHS, while the "No" side will promise change and a "better Britain".
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney will meet apprentices at an engineering firm in Renfrew. They will argue that independence will allow Scotland's economy to grow, creating jobs and opportunities.
Ms Sturgeon will then join carers to talk about the NHS and welfare reform.
Ahead of the visit, she said: "In just two days' time, polling stations will open and voters across the country will hold Scotland's future in their hands. Independence is our opportunity to build a better future - creating jobs and protecting our NHS.
"Only a 'Yes' vote will ensure we have full powers over job creation - enabling us to create more and better jobs across the country. So instead of almost 40,000 young people leaving Scotland each year as is currently the case, there will be more opportunities for our young people here at home.
"As part of the UK, our NHS budget faces knock-on impacts of the privatisation, cuts and charging agenda that is ripping the health service south of the border to bits. With a 'Yes' vote we can ensure our NHS is protected for future generations by enshrining it in our written constitution."
Labour leader Ed Miliband and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown will be out on the campaign trail for Better Together.
Mr Miliband will say a vote for independence will be "an irreversible decision" and "a risk to jobs, the economy and the NHS" and he will highlight the offer of more powers from the pro-Union parties.
He is expected to say: "In the next 48 hours Scotland faces a historic decision which will shape its future and the whole of the UK's future for centuries to come.
"The will of the people of Scotland for economic and political change has been heard and we will deliver.
"Change is coming with more powers on tax and welfare for the Scottish Parliament.
"We will change the British state too, the House of Lords and the way we work together across our nations. I ask the people of Scotland to lead that change of our whole British constitution."
On Monday, Alex Salmond met with pro-independence business leaders in Edinburgh, while Mr Cameron made a speech in Aberdeen promising further devolution.
The first minister argued that an independent Scotland would be prosperous and fair, and he criticised the "scaremongering" of the "No" campaign.
The prime minister said he wanted Scots to stay part of the United Kingdom with his head, his heart and his soul.

More than 100 companies call for overhaul of business rates
Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's, Boots, Whitbread, and General Motors sign    open letter warning that business rates are "critical problem" for UK

Comments
More than 100 of Britain’s biggest companies have called for business rates to    be overhauled and called the controversial tax a “critical problem” in an    open letter that marks the most vocal intervention in the debate so far.
Companies including Tesco, Marks & Spencer and General Motors have signed an    open letter, published in The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday, that says business    rates are “no longer fit for purpose for the 21st century” and must be    revamped in order to “unleash investment”.
The signatories of the letter are primarily retailers, but it has also been    backed by manufacturers, bookmakers, coffee shops, gyms, and property    companies.
Business rates bring in roughly £25bn for the Treasury every year, but    businesses claim the tax has grown out of kilter with economic realities and    is hindering investment.
George Osborne has committed to a review of the tax by 2017, but critics are    concerned that this will only lead to the Government tinkering with the    administrative process behind the tax.

Retailers lobby political parties on business rates
01 Jul 2014
In the letter, the businesses, which also include Boots, Asda, Whitbread,    Ladbrokes and Heineken, say: “Business rates are higher than property taxes    anywhere else in Europe and are the second highest in the OECD. This is a    critical problem for all of British business.”
The letter calls for all political parties to commit to a “fundamental reform” of the tax in the their manifestos for the General Election next year.
It adds: “A modern, sustainable and transparent system would unleash    investment that could bring skilled and entry level jobs and new and    expanded businesses into our local communities. Those who seek a competitive    tax regime as a draw for investment and jobs should apply that logic to    business rates.
“It is no longer an option to say that reform is too difficult or complicated    and we call on all political parties to commit to fundamental reform in    their manifestos for the next General Election.”
Helen Dickinson, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said the    breadth of industries represented in the letter “shows the strength of our    collective belief that the existing system is no longer fit for purpose”.
She said: “Today’s open letter proposes that the political parties should make    a commitment to look at deeper reform of business rates if they form the    next government after the election.”
Business rates are calculated through a valuation of Britain’s property and    the annual rate of inflation. The revaluation of property is scheduled to    take place every five years, but the Government postponed the valuation that    was due to take place in 2013 and enforced in 2015, claiming that it would    cause uncertainty for businesses.
This prompted an outcry from businesses that have been left facing a rates    bill based on property values in 2008, the peak of the market. This has lead    to businesses appealing their rates bill in an attempt to move it in line    with present values.
The Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has estimated it    will repay £4.2bn between 2010 and 2015 from appeals, including interest    charges, which reflects the chaotic state of the existing system.
Jerry Schurder, head of rating at property agent Gerald Eve, said: “It is    clearer than ever that businesses across the spectrum are challenging the    rating system which, if left unaddressed, will continue to severely impact    on enterprises of all sizes and sectors and cause harm to the UK as a place    to operate from.
"A property-based tax remains the most appropriate means of raising revenue    for local services but it needs significant reform to make it fit for    purpose.
“In practice, this means a number of fundamental changes. Most important are a    reduction in the overall tax burden alongside more frequent revaluations to    allowing the tax to fluctuate in line with prevailing economic conditions    and ensure the load is spread as fairly as possible.
“George Osborne must use December’s Autumn Statement to announce an expansion    of the terms of reference of the ongoing review of business rates    administration to encompass comprehensive reform of rates, with the aim of    creating a system that genuinely supports investment and gives businesses a    fair deal.”
The letter
As the Daily Telegraph has consistently pointed out, the current system of    business rates is no longer fit for purpose for the 21st Century.  Business    rates are higher than property taxes anywhere else in Europe and are the    second highest in the OECD. This is a critical problem for all of British    business.
A recent survey demonstrated that 93% of MPs agree that the fundamental    reform of business rates would revitalise our high streets and town centres.    Manufacturers, retailers, the hospitality trade, property, service    industries and businesses large and small are all held back by business    rates.
A modern, sustainable and transparent system would unleash investment that    could bring skilled and entry level jobs and new and expanded businesses    into our local communities.
Those who seek a competitive tax regime as a draw for investment and jobs    should apply that logic to business rates.
It is no longer an option to say that reform is too difficult or    complicated and we call on all political parties to commit to fundamental    reform in their manifestos for the next General Election.

Industrial recovery still away; like construction: HSBC08:00 am
HSBC has turned neutral from underweight on India after the clear outcome of the Lok Sabha elections on May 16. According to Jitendra Sriram, MD and head of Research, HSBC India, the clear mandate with BJP coming to power is expected to turnaround India’s growth story.
He believes the catalysts are falling well in place for earnings recovery but the market may take a little breather now.
Speaking to CNBC-TV18 from the sidelines of HSBC Global Connection Conference, Sriram says the industrial recovery is still some time away. He, however, believes the domestic mutual fund industry is seeing flows after many years of slump. 
Furthermore, Sriram believes the inventory levels in housing market continue to remain high and therefore, it is too early to play realty as a setoral theme.
Going ahead, he expects to see more traction in activity for infra space like railways and roads. Sriram is also bullish on the construction sector and expects the industry to revive soon in south India.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: You have been underweight on India for a while. Yesterday we got some signs of cooling off in the market. What is the sense you are getting from here on? Are we in for a period of price wise correction?
A: Firstly, we were underweight prior to the elections. Post elections we have turned neutral on India especially given the kind of verdict that came through and all the improvements, which we expect in terms of stable governance.
The key question that is on investors' mind at this point of time is whether it is too much too soon? You have seen a sentiment related uptick and whether now it translates into earnings.
You have had seven, eight months of continuous uptick in the market month after month. But will the baton passed into earnings uplift be as smooth as what it was in terms of sentiment uptick.
Thankfully, the monsoons have revived and so it brings to some rest the fact that inflation will potentially start coming up into next year. So catalysts are now falling in place for earnings led recovery. Maybe the market will take a bit of a breather now given that we have seen a lot of upswing in the market prior six months or so.
Having said that, the key parts to look at is that we have seen a lot of activity in midcap. Part of it has go to do with the fact that domestic mutual fund industry is finally seeing some inflows after three, four years of struggle and lot of valuations in the frontline names have moved up. There is still an arbitrage available in the midcap universe at this juncture.
Q: How are you approaching the global space now? Should we worry about the slow down or worry about the rate hike?
A: There is clearly an expectation that sometime by the middle of next year, US will start to tighten. But India still has a lot of benefit into 2015 because globally the Federal Reserve being such a big counter balance to most global forces, you will see the Fed tightening.
On a counter side, you will have India starting to ease into next year after a long pause. So you will have a situation where cost of capital dynamics by and large for the world as a whole might be seen inching up. Whereas, for India you might see it coming off, which should place us as an advantage.
The catalysts or the fundamentals are definitely starting to form a fairly steady base for India. Question is maybe in one quarter or so you might take that breather before you allow that earnings to start catching up and allow for market valuation to be more sensible for the next upmove.
Q: I was going through the list of speakers at your conference. You have some capital goods players like Thermax, Bharat Forge who will be speaking. What is the sense you are getting about whether the capital expenditure (Capex) cycle has turned at all. Are there any signs of a nascent recovery?
A: Industrial capex recovery is still a little while away because most of the capital goods industrial companies are still reeling from the hangover of the past capital binge.
If you go sector by sector, capacity utilization, whether it is something like petro chemicals, cements, steel, in most places there is still ample headroom in capacity utilisation, commercial vehicles in all these areas will still require one or two years of growth before they feel constraint on capacity to further put up capex.
So industrial capex might be a little while away, but the areas which could see more activity in the intermediate period would be on the infrastructure side whether its railways, defense, affiliated areas where we are still lacking on the capacity severely and where we could see that being the initial engine of growth.
A lot of these names will also be exposed in some piece to these sectors as well which is where we see the near-term growth catalyst forming for these companies.

In their worst single-day drop in nearly 7 weeks, Sensex plunged 324 points to 26,492.51 and Nifty tanked 109 points to 7,932.90 on negative cues from jittery global markets before the US Federal Reserve's much-awaited monetary policy meeting that starts later on Tuesday.
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced. Major markets in Asia ended down and Europe was weak in morning trades.
Domestic investors also took money off the table in recent out-performers in sectors including realty , banking, consumer durables and oil & gas. All the 12 BSE sectoral indices ended in the red.
Smallcap and midcap stocks, which in previous sessions had bucked a weak trend, saw a huge sell-off with their indices falling over 3 per cent each.
The 30-share Sensex after resuming higher at 26,854.90, improved to 26,861.29. However, it succumbed to widespread selling in blue-chips and slipped to day's low of 26,464.03, before ending at 26,492.51 - down 324.05 points, or 1.21 per cent. This is its worst drop since August 1 when Sensex had plummeted 414.13 points. Today's closing is also its weakest since August 26 (26,442.81).
Among major laggards, Tata Power suffered the most by plunging 5.85 per cent. Others include Tata Steel, Hindalco, NTPC, Tata Motors, ONGC, RIL, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and L&T.
Bucking the trend, stocks of Dr Reddy's, Bharti Airtel , ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys gained.
The 50-share Nifty dropped 109.10 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close below 8,000 mark at 7,932.90 after moving between 8,044.90 and 7,925.15 intra-day. Tuesday's drop is also Nifty's worst show since August 1 when it fell 118.70 points.
"Market players will be looking for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years. Consensus is that the Fed will hike interest rates next year and it may declare the timelines today," said HDFC Securities in a note.
Sectorally, the BSE Realty sector index suffered the most by losing 3.42 per cent, followed by Power down 3.26 per cent, Capital Goods 2.70 per cent and Oil & Gas 2.67 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 74.59 crore on Monday as per provisional data released by stock exchanges.

"Our UK performance remained strong over the final quarter, with sales increasing 33%. Our International business grew 6% or 14% in constant currency. However, due to the fire at our Barnsley distribution centre, we lost sales during the quarter of between £25m and £30m with a retail gross margin impact of c.200 basis points. After adjusting for insurance proceeds, we expect profit before tax for the year to be in line with market expectations.

More than 60 firefighters tackled the blaze after they were called to the scene
A fire which caused an online fashion retailer to cease trading is being treated as arson, police have said.
The fire at the ASOS distribution centre near Grimethorpe, Barnsley broke out at about 22:00 BST on Friday.
South Yorkshire Police said the incident was being treated as deliberate following initial investigations with the fire service.
The blaze at Park Spring Road caused "substantial damage" and has forced the company to stop taking orders.
More than 60 firefighters tackled the blaze overnight and about 500 people were evacuated from the five-storey building.
On a holding page on its website, ASOS said: "We have pressed pause on the ASOS website, this is due to a fire in our Barnsley distribution centre in the early hours of Saturday.
"Thankfully no-one was hurt and we expect to be back to normal for you in the next day or so."
Overnight back-up
Andy Hayter, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service: "Early intervention was the deciding factor in saving this building"
The blaze is believed to have spread from the second floor to the third and fourth floors.
Ten fire engines, including three from West Yorkshire Fire service, were drafted in to help overnight.
One worker at the warehouse, Lukasz said: "There was a big smell like burning plastic or something like that.
"I think that's why they evacuated us from the area because it was dangerous to breathe that.
"Everyone is safe, nobody was hurt and I think everyone will be alright."
The Barnsley warehouse is the company's major global distribution centre.
It has other facilities in the US, China and Australia but most orders go through Barnsley.
In a statement, the company said no new orders were currently being taken and existing orders yet to be shipped, would also be delayed.
It is understood the warehouse contains more than 10 million boxes of packaging.
Simon Rodgers, Investigating Fire Officer for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, said: "The fire involved four floors of the warehouse and the blaze was contained in the area of origin by firefighters.
"ASOS staff had a good evacuation process in place which assisted the emergency services and allowed the fire to be brought under control more quickly."

CalPERS Eliminates Hedge Fund Program in Effort to Reduce Complexity and Costs in Investment Portfolio
Decision not based on performance of program
SACRAMENTO, CA – The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) today announced that it will eliminate its hedge fund program, known internally as the Absolute Return Strategies (ARS) program, as part of an ongoing effort to reduce complexity and costs in its investment program.
The staff recommendation, supported by the Investment Committee, will exit 24 hedge funds and six hedge fund-of-funds valued at approximately $4 billion.
“We are always examining the portfolio to ensure that we are efficiently and cost-effectively achieving our risk-adjusted return goals,” said Ted Eliopoulos, CalPERS Interim Chief Investment Officer. “Hedge funds are certainly a viable strategy for some, but at the end of the day, when judged against their complexity, cost, and the lack of ability to scale at CalPERS’ size, the ARS program is no longer warranted.”
Following the 2008 global financial crisis, CalPERS began examining ways to ensure it was less susceptible to future large drawdowns. The System restructured its investment operations, improved its internal oversight and control functions, and refocused some of its investment programs. In February 2014, the CalPERS Board adopted a new asset allocation mix that reduces risk to the portfolio, while still being able to achieve its return goal of 7.5 percent. CalPERS earned 18.4 percent during the 2013-14 Fiscal Year and has averaged a 12.5 percent return for the past five years and an 8.4 percent return for the past 20 years.
In September 2013, the CalPERS Board adopted a set of Investment Beliefs to inform the strategic decision making of the System. Investment Belief 7 states that “CalPERS will take risk only where we have a strong belief we will be rewarded for it.” Investment Belief 8 notes that “Costs matter and need to be effectively managed.”
“The Investment Beliefs exist to provide a compass for the System’s work to achieve its strategic goals,” said Henry Jones, CalPERS Board Member and Chair of the Investment Committee. “While the ARS analysis was no simple matter for CalPERS, the Investment Beliefs provide guidance for a straightforward and principled conclusion that fits our needs.”
CalPERS will spend approximately the next year strategically exiting current investments in a manner that best serves the interests of the portfolio. Existing ARS staff will be reassigned within the Investment Office.
“The staff dedicated to our program have worked diligently and we will ensure that their talent can continue to help CalPERS meet its investment objectives,” said Eliopoulos.
CalPERS is the largest public pension fund in the U.S., with approximately $300 billion in assets. CalPERS administers health and retirement benefits on behalf of 3,090 public school, local agency, and state employers. There are more than 1.6 million members in the CalPERS retirement system and more than 1.3 million in its health plans. For more information about CalPERS, visit www.CalPERS.ca.gov.

Bad time to break up UKThis is a very bad time to break up Britain
By Gideon Rachman
Scottish nationalists could soon find there are worse people in the world than London’s ‘Tory toffs’
Until recently, I thought I did not much care if Scotland voted for independence. But, now, as the prospect becomes very real, I am surprised by how upset I feel. I follow the polls obsessively. I fume at the incompetence of the No campaign and the insularity of the Yes . And my sense of foreboding grows as the day grows closer.
Why should that be? The answer is that the Scottish referendum has made me realise how much my own sense of identity, and personal security, is tied up with my British nationality. Meanwhile my job – covering world affairs – tells me that the world is in a more dangerous state than for decades. That makes it a terrible time to break up Britain.
More
Cracks appear in Brics
As the child of immigrants, I always feel a sense of gratitude and pleasure when I write on a customs form: born London, nationality British. My forebears were not so lucky. My grandparents were Jews from different parts of eastern Europe who emigrated to South Africa in the years before the Holocaust. My parents emigrated again, not wanting to live or bring up children in apartheid South Africa. It feels like a personal triumph that my own children were born in the same country as me.
My ingrained sense that Britain represents stability is reinforced by my travels – often to more troubled parts of the world. I spent last week in Ukraine and felt lucky, as ever, to be able to return to my own safe corner of the world.
Britain’s political stability is what set this nation apart from the rest of Europe in the 20th century. All the other big nations experienced dictatorship or defeat or civil war or tyranny. Britain remained free, stable, democratic and apparently immune to fanaticism.
If the United Kingdom breaks up, that deep stability will be shaken. It is not that I expect civil war to break out. But I do not think a divorce between Scotland and England will be easy or friendly. There will be arguments about the currency, about the debt, about oil. Above all, there will be bruised and bitter feelings on both sides. On a personal level, I feel affronted to hear Scottish nationalists accuse the English of not caring about social justice, or of being narrow-minded and warmongering. That is not my experience, or the experience of millions of other immigrant families that were welcomed into England. Indeed, while the rhetoric of Scottish nationalism sometimes attacks the English for their alleged chauvinism, it is noticeable that England is a much more racially diverse country than Scotland.
Anybody who suggests the security situation in Europe might be relevant to Scotland’s referendum campaign is shouted down for scaremongering
I suspect that my own irritation with the rhetoric of Scottish nationalism is widely shared in England. That will mean that, at least for a while, that the English are unlikely to adopt a magnanimous attitude in any negotiations on independence. This could turn nasty quite quickly. In fact, even a narrow No vote could leave a legacy of frustration and resentment on both sides of the border.
Even in good times, I would worry about the implications of the break-up of the UK. But the current international environment is grimmer than for decades. An angry Russia has just annexed part of a neighbouring country. President Vladimir Putin boasts of his country’s nuclear arms and his ability to over-run Ukraine in two weeks. The EU he faces is weak and divided. The US is more detached than it has been for years. A far-right candidate has just topped an opinion poll for the next French presidential race. Meanwhile in the Middle East, a jihadist death cult has seized control of large parts of Iraq and a murderous civil war is raging in Syria. Hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees will wash up on the shores of Europe this year.
These troubles are lapping at the borders of the United Kingdom. Anybody who has witnessed the thousands of would-be migrants desperately trying to make it across to the Channel to England (before doubtless realising their mistake and heading for socially just Scotland) will have seen a vivid illustration of how global security issues affect everyday life.

Yet the Scottish referendum campaign has been conducted as if the rest of the world stops at London. There has been almost no discussion of foreign affairs – apart from the nationalists’ inane refrain that a morally superior Scotland will not have to join in “illegal wars”. The nationalists also insist that an independent Scotland will get rid of nuclear weapons. (Ukraine did just that, when it became independent, and now bitterly regrets it.)
Anybody who suggests the security situation in Europe might be relevant to Scotland’s referendum campaign is shouted down for scaremongering. Alex Salmond, the leader of the Yes campaign, has even talked of his admiration for the way Mr Putin has restored Russian pride – remarks that were made as Russian troops were moving into Crimea.
If the world keeps going bad, the Scottish nationalists could soon discover that there are many worse and more dangerous people in the world than the hated “Tory toffs” in London. By then, however, it could be too late. If the vote goes the wrong way on Thursday, the UK will break up. George Robertson , a proud Scot and a former head of Nato, was not exaggerating when he said that the “forces of darkness” in the world would love that.

Epirus  Ranbaxy get nod for arthritis drug copy in IndiaNatalie Grover and Zeba Siddiqui     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 17:16 IST

Ranbaxy Laboratories , domestic partner for Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc, will sell a copycat version of Johnson & Johnson's and Merck & Co Inc's infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug for arthritis with annual sales of about $6 billion.
Epirus Biopharmaceuticals said that the domestic drug regulator has approved its copy of a top-selling arthritis treatment, paving the way for its launch in the country early next year.
The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry 's biggest sellers.
With changing regulations and a looming biotech patent cliff, the global market for biosimilars is forecast to rise to $24 billion in 2019 from about $1.2 billion in 2013, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
Infliximab, sold under the brand name Remicade, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. In India, it sells at about 70,000 rupees ($1,150) per month.
Like its main rivals, Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie Inc's Humira, the drug works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.
Epirus, a Boston-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing biosimilar drugs for sale, said it would launch the Remicade biosimilar in India under the name Infimab by the first quarter of 2015.
Chief Executive Amit Munshi, citing various estimates, said the Indian market for Remicade was worth $8 million to $10 million a year. He declined to say how much Infimab would cost or to estimate how many patients might use the drug.
The drug will be made in Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Life Sciences.
Remicade copycats are already being sold elsewhere. South Korean drugmaker Celltrion Inc won approval in July for its version in Japan and is hoping for US approval in 2015.
Epirus is also in talks with Ranbaxy, as well as other Indian and international companies, about expanding sales of its biosimilar drugs in other regions, Munshi told Reuters.
"Ranbaxy has, under their license, quite a few markets in southeast Asia and North Africa," he said. "We're also working with other partners in places like Latin America."
Ranbaxy is not the only Indian drugmaker to explore production of biosimilar drugs. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, for example, is developing biosimilars with Germany's Merck KGaA.
Biocon has a tie-up with Mylan Inc, while Lupin has entered a deal to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster insulin, Lantus, in India.

France s Orange announcedOrange to launch a voluntary offer to buy the Spanish operator Jazztel
Paris, Tuesday 16 September 2014
NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA OR JAPAN
Orange announces today that the Group will launch a friendly voluntary cash tender offer for the acquisition of 100% of the capital of Jazztel, a company listed in Spain (BMAD:JAZ). Through this transaction, Orange will create the second biggest fixed-line broadband operator and one of the most dynamic players in the mobile segment in Spain, thereby accelerating the movement of its customers towards convergent offers. In an economic context that has continued to recover, this operation will enable Orange to accelerate its growth in a highly-competitive market.
This offer will enable shareholders of Jazztel to receive 13 euros per share in cash, a premium of 34% compared to the volume weighted average closing price over the last 30 trading days. This offer values Jazztel at an Enterprise Value / EBITDA 2015-multiple of 8.6x(1)  after accounting for the synergies generated by the integration of the two entities. The price of 100% of Jazztel’s capital amounts to 3.4 billion euros.
The offer is conditional on the acceptance of at least 50.01% of Jazztel’s capital, excluding shares for which an irrevocable undertaking agreement has been signed. The lead shareholder, Mr Leopoldo Fernandez Pujals, who holds 14.5% of the capital, has made a commitment to participate in the offer. Other executive members of Jazztel’s Board of Directors, Mr José Miguel Garcia Fernandez, CEO, and Mr José Ortiz Martinez, General Secretary, have also agreed to the offer.
Jazztel is a major player on the Spanish telecom’s market and is one of the most dynamic competitors in the triple play and mobile services segments. This operation will generate estimated global synergies for the combined entity of up to 1.3 billion euros, in particular thanks to savings in operational expenditure and investments in networks.
In order to preserve its balance sheet strength, Orange SA will issue a combination of financial instruments: securities giving access to its share capital for a maximum amount of two billion euros and perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds. The equity credit of such a financing package, as granted by rating agencies, is planned to equal the total consideration eventually paid to Jazztel shareholders. Given the solidity of the Group’s balance-sheet, the cash tender offer is not conditional upon the obtention of financing.
In this context, Orange confirms its financial objectives.
This transaction remains subject to the approval of the relevant authorities.
The offer will be subject to the shared jurisdiction of the Spanish Securities Commission (the “CNMV”) and the UK Takeover Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in the UK (the “UK Takeover Panel”). The UK Takeover Panel has shared jurisdiction with the CNMV on the basis that Jazztel has its registered office in the UK and its securities are admitted to trading on the Spanish market (which is a regulated market in a member state of the European Economic Area) but not on a regulated market in the UK). The CNMV will be responsible for matters relating to the consideration offered (in particular the price) and matters relating to the offer procedure and the UK Takeover Panel will be responsible for matters relating to employee information and company law matters (in particular the percentage of voting rights which confer control and any derogation from the obligation to launch a mandatory offer, as well as the conditions under which Jazztel may undertake any actions which might result in the frustration of the offer).
The UK Takeover Panel has confirmed that Rule 8 of the UK Takeover Code, which requires certain public disclosures of holdings and dealings in Jazztel securities during the course of the offer, will not apply.

SBI cuts interest rate on medium term depositsSBI cuts medium-term deposit rate by 25 bps
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 17, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Flush with funds, the country’s largest commercial bank, State Bank of India, has cut the interest rate on medium-term deposits (one year to less than three years maturity) by 25 basis points (bps) to 8.75 per cent.
It also raised the deposit rate by 25 bps in the 180-210 days category to 7.25 per cent. The new rates will be effective from Thursday.
This is the second time in this quarter that the bank has revised deposit rates. In July, it had reduced the interest rate on fixed deposits up to 179 days by 50 bps and on bulk deposits by 25 bps.
SBI said the latest revision was due to abundant liquidity, coupled with slower than anticipated credit pick-up. A senior executive said deposits have been growing at a healthy rate of 13-14 per cent but credit expansion remained tepid at only seven per cent.
Inflation is trending down at a faster clip. So, this rate adjustment (cut) will continue to ensure savers are compensated adequately with a positive real rate on their deposits, the bank said.
About the effect of SBI action on other banks, R K Dubey, chairman and managing director of Canara Bank, said “We will take a call depending on the situation. Every bank will go to its asset-liability committee and decide.”
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, has increased the interest rate on bulk deposits (above Rs 1 crore) on the maturity period of 30-45 days by 10 basis points. The rates have been increased to 8.35 per cent from 8.25 per cent and the new rates are effective Tuesday.

("The inflation trending…)
MUMBAI: Country's largest lender State Bank of India today cut its interest rate offering for medium-term deposits by 0.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent, citing slower-than -expected pick up in advances.
However, it increased rates for shorter tenor deposits of 180-210 days by 0.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent per annum.
"In view of abundant liquidity coupled with slower-than- anticipated credit pick up, State Bank of India ( SBI ) has decided to cut the deposit rates by 0.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent," the bank said in a statement.
The downward revision of rates is for deposits between one and three years and is applicable from September 18, it said.
The bank added that with the inflation trending down -- consumer price inflation for August eased to 7.80 per cent -- the rate adjustment will continue to ensure that the depositors are compensated "adequately with a positive real rate on their deposits."
It can be noted that banks have been complaining about issues in credit offtake, even as the sentiment has improved following the formation of a stable government at the Centre.
The system's year-on-year increase in credit stood at 10.94 per cent for the fortnight ended August 22, which is almost at par with the 10.61 per cent observed in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

By Robleh Ali of the Bank’s Financial Market Infrastructure Directorate, John Barrdear of the Bank’s Monetary Assessment and Strategy Division, and Roger Clews and James Southgate of the Bank’s Markets Directorate.
Modern electronic payment systems rely on trusted, central third parties to process payments securely. Recent developments have seen the creation of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which combine new currencies with decentralised payment systems. Although the monetary aspects of digital currencies have attracted considerable attention, the distributed ledger underlying their payment systems is a significant innovation. As with money held as bank deposits, most financial assets today exist as purely digital records. This opens up the possibility for distributed ledgers to transform the financial system more generally.

Although digital currencies could, in theory, serve as money for anybody with an internet-enabled device, at present they act as money only to a limited extent and only for relatively few people. The economics of the schemes as currently designed, both in terms of individuals’ incentives and at a macroeconomic level, pose significant challenges to their widespread adoption. Digital currencies do not currently pose a material risk to monetary or financial stability in the United Kingdom. The Bank continues to monitor developments in this area.

How might macroprudential capital policy affect credit conditions? (333KB)
By Rashmi Harimohan of the Bank’s Monetary Assessment and Strategy Division and Benjamin Nelson of the Bank’s Prudential Policy Directorate.
Macroprudential capital policy is designed to make the financial system more resilient and reduce the likelihood and severity of financial crises. In doing so, it can have an impact on credit conditions and economic growth more generally. This article considers the effects on credit conditions over the near term. The direction and magnitude of those effects are likely to depend crucially on the state of the financial system and the economy as well as the way in which banks, financial investors and borrowers respond to changes in macroprudential capital policy. 
Household debt and spending (187KB)
By Philip Bunn of the Bank’s Structural Economic Analysis Division and May Rostom of the Bank’s Banking System Division.
This article is the first study to use microdata to assess the role of debt levels in determining UK households’ spending patterns over the course of the recent recession. There is evidence that high levels of household debt have been associated with deeper downturns and more protracted recoveries in the United Kingdom. Cuts in spending associated with debt are estimated to have reduced the level of aggregate private consumption by around 2% after 2007, unwinding the faster growth in spending by highly indebted households, relative to other households, before the financial crisis. 
Enhancing the resilience of the Bank of England’s Real-Time Gross Settlement infrastructure (50KB)
By Ed Kelsey and Simon Rickenbach of the Bank’s Market Services Division.
The Bank of England operates the United Kingdom’s Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) infrastructure for the settlement of the main electronic sterling payment systems. This infrastructure plays a vital role in the safe functioning of the UK financial system, and therefore in maintaining financial stability. The Bank continuously seeks to improve the resilience of its infrastructure. Recently, enhancement of the resilience of payment infrastructure has become a higher priority for central banks. The Bank, together with other central banks, worked with SWIFT to develop a new RTGS contingency infrastructure with which to settle payments should the principal infrastructure become unavailable. The Bank is the first central bank to adopt this contingency solution.

UK short-term interest rate expectations implied by the forward curve declined a little over the review period, following the release of the August 2014 Inflation Report. Euro-area short-term interest rates fell relative to their UK counterparts, reflecting a combination of loosening of monetary policy by the ECB and weaker-than-expected economic data. Sterling rose early in the review period, briefly reaching a new post-crisis high. The currency subsequently depreciated, broadly consistent with moves in international interest rates. Geopolitical risks remained a key concern for market participants and contributed to a brief sell-off in risky assets, although much of this subsequently unwound.

Expect rate cut only by January-February: Canara Bank chiefRs 3,500-crore QIP only by November as govt approval is yet to come, says RK Dubey
Mumbai, Sept 16:  
Public sector lender Canara Bank’s chief R K Dubey ruled out a reduction in policy interest rate in the next one or two months at least.
“In the coming two months, food inflation should come down and when it consistently comes down only then we could see a rate cut. So, I expect a movement in interest rate by January or February… It could be around 25 to 50 basis points and by March if inflation goes (down) the way it has been planned then we may see a rate of 1 per cent also, said RK Dubey, Chairman and Managing Director, Canara Bank.
Further, the bank’s fund raising plan of Rs 3,500 crore has been delayed to November as it awaits approval from the Government.
“We have started the process of QIP (quantitative institutional payment) and are ready for it but will not happen this quarter. We have got approval (from shareholders) in June but we await an approval from the government. It may happen in October or first fortnight of November,” Dubey said.
On the deposit rate cut as done by SBI, Dubey said, “Every bank has a different asset liability mismatch and depending on that our ALCO (Asset Liability Committee) will decide.
Dubey also said there has been no sale of NPAs (non-performing assets) after the new norms set out by the RBI. There is no pick up. Till now there has been no sale. With 15% (upfront cash by ARCs to banks) it is tough, things have changed as every bank is in the market. Till last quarter it happened without any hassle, he added.
According to him, fresh NPAs or slippages have reduced considerably. “By September, NPAs should go down. We have a gross NPA of 2.6 per cent as on June 2014 (it was 2.4 per cent as on March 2014, 2014) and may go down to 2.4 per cent. If there is sale of NPAs it can be 2.2 per cent or if no sale then 2.5 per cent,” Dubey said adding that corporate credit is still slow.
“Our retail, SME and agriculture growth is robust at about 25-40 per cent. Even if corporate credit grows at 10-15 per cent, we will meet our target of 16-17 per cent credit growth,” he said.

Modi: Xi s visit to benefit Gujarat  IndiaModi: Xi's visit to benefit Gujarat, India
Our Bureau
Tweet
Ahmedabad, Sept 16:  
Apparently unfazed by the electoral reverses the BJP suffered in by-elections earlier in the day, or the fresh Chinese incursions on Sino-Indian borders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday exuded confidence that the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping here on Wednesday would benefit both Gujarat and India.
Addressing a public reception at the airport, where the BJP had put up a podium, the Prime Minister said the Chinese President’s visit was one reason why he (Modi) was visiting Gujarat at this time. He described Xi’s visit as “very important” and said his aim was to make India and Gujarat develop further.
Recalling his years as Gujarat CM, Modi said his experience in the State had stood him in good stead in New Delhi as well. “I am satisfied with what I have done. It is due to the experience I gained as CM in Gujarat that I have been successfully running the Government in Delhi.”
The PM, who arrived at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport here this afternoon, was accorded a tumultuous reception by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the State Government, led by Governor OP Kohli, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, BJP’s National President Amit Shah and Ahmedabad Mayor Minakshiben Patel.
This is Modi’s first visit to Gujarat after taking oath as Prime Minister on May 26. After installing Anandiben as his successor, Modi, who served as Gujarat CM for 13 years, left for New Delhi on May 22.
He is scheduled stay for the night at Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar tonight. He will call on his mother Hiraben and other family members on September 17 morning as he celebrates his 65th birthday on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, he will launch a series of programmes of the State Government at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, and receive the Chinese President at the airport in the afternoon.

To set up 1,000-MW solar park in Anantapur district
Hyderabad, Sept 16:  
NTPC Ltd has drawn up plans to set up a 4,000-MW ultra mega power project at Pudimadaka near Visakhapatnam wherein it has been allotted 1,200 acres by the Andhra Pradesh Government.
The thermal power project has been in pipeline for the past several years. With both the Central and the State Governments keen to provide necessary support for the project, NTPC has decided to initiate the project which entails an outlay of Rs 20,000 crore.
The project is based on imported coal and requires about 19.8 million tonnes of coal per annum.
After the signing-in ceremony of allotment of land to NTPC in the presence of Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal, AP Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and NTPC Chairman and Managing Director Arup Roy Choudhury, the Union Power Minister said that the project would be completed by 2019.
Solar park
NTPC has also signed up another memorandum of understanding with the Andhra Pradesh Government for setting up of a 1,000-MW solar park in Anantapur district. The project entails an outlay of Rs 7,000 crore.
The State Industries Department has allocated 5,500 acres for the solar park.
The ultra mega power project at Pudimadaka, the first one from NTPC, has to pass through several mandatory processes such as geotechnical and topographical surveys, environment impact assessment and finally secure clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests before work on the project begins.

J&K flood: 13 bodies found in flooded city  toll crosses 200J&K flood: 13 bodies found in flooded city, toll crosses 200

Srinagar, Sept 16:  
Rescue workers today spotted 13 bodies lying in a house in Jawahar Nagar area of the city, taking the death toll in flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir to over 200.
“We spotted 13 bodies in a house which had collapsed due to flooding late yesterday,” Abdul Hamid, a rescue worker, told PTI after bringing two bodies to the Gogjibagh bank of the flood channel.
While two bodies were taken out from the debris of the house last night, it will take some time to bring to shore the other nine bodies as they were trapped in the debris.
“The concern is that dogs are eating the bodies,” he said.
The identity of the deceased persons could not be ascertained as the bodies were in a semi-decomposed state but the rescue worker said they were most likely of non-locals.
“From the appearance, we gather they were one or two non-local families who could not escape the flood water in time or could have been killed in the collapse of the house,” he said.
Three children and two elderly were among the dead.
Although authorities started dewatering operations in Jawahar nagar and Rajbagh areas of the city by pressing in 30 dewatering pumps, the water level has reduced by few inches only over the past 24 hours.
“It will be a long time before the roads in this area will be visible again,” Aamir Nazir, a local resident, said.

Kerala submits affidavit justifying its right to formulate new liquorpolicyThe decision to allow liquor license to five-star hotels was considering the interest of the tourism industry.
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:17 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 5:24 pm
Kerala government on Tuesday submitted an affidavit in a single bench of the high court, justifying its right to formulate a new liquor policy which envisages closure of all bars in the non-five-star categories.
While hearing a bunch of petitions from bar hotel owners in Kerala, the Supreme Court had asked the state government to furnish its affidavit in the high court, which was directed to hear all petitions pertaining to the liquor license of hotels owners. Last week, the SC had stayed the closure of all bars in the non-five-start category, until September 30.
The affidavit said the government has the right to frame its liquor policy and the new one was aimed at bringing down alcohol consumption in a phased manner.  The government has right to revoke the liquor license issued to bar hotel owners in tune with its new liquor policy provided they were served with mandatory notice.
It said the government has the right to either monopolize the liquor business or go for complete prohibition. A few outlets of the state-owned Beverages Corporation were also slated for closure and it was not practical to close down all outlets at one stretch. The decision to allow liquor license to five-star hotels was considering the interest of the tourism industry.
The court would consider the petitions on September 18. Last week, the  Supreme Court had questioned the logic of allowing bars in five-star hotels.

BJP repeats LS election success in AssemblybypollBJP activists dance in-front of their party office to celebrate their victory in Basirhat Dakshin Constituency in State Assembly by-election in Kolkata on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Subrata Nagchowdhury | Kolkata | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:11 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 9:47 pm
Facing setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, good news came for the BJP in West Bengal where the party won one of the two assembly seats where bypolls were held. The BJP’s victory in the Basirhat (South) seat came despite the might of the ruling Trinamol Congress and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s vow not to allow the BJP win a single seat in the state.
It was after a gap of 13 years that the BJP has found representation in the West Bengal assembly.  Shamik Bhattacharya, who won the seat with a margin of 1,586 votes, said, “The victory indicates the political trend in Bengal — the BJP is fast emerging as the main opposition political party. It now officially enters the precincts of the assembly and will make more inroads in 2016.” Incidentally, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had come first in 21 assembly seats and second in nearly 40 assembly segments.
The last time the BJP won an assembly seat was when its candidate Badal Bhattacharya won the bypoll from Ashoknagar in North 24 Parganas in 1999. He was the MLA till 2001 when fresh assembly polls were held.
The chief minister, having realised that Basirhat (south) was a tough contest for the party as the BJP had surged ahead in this assembly segment by over 30,000 votes in the last Lok Sabha polls, had pressed all her might to win the seat.  Top Trinamool Congress leaders who were given charge of the bypolls — almost half a dozen MPs, over 10 ministers and other top party functionaries — were crestfallen with the Basirhat (South) result. The leaders feared action from party chief Mamata Banerjee as she had repeatedly asked them to ensure that the BJP does not make a match out of this seat.
What went wrong will be analysed threadbare and action will be taken, said a top Trinamool leader who did not want to be named.  Trinamool general secretary leader Mukul Roy, however, tried to put up a brave face, saying that the party had gained in Basirhat (south). “The TMC managed to recover 28,000 votes out of a Lok Sabha deficit of 30,000 votes,” he said.
The Basirhat (south) seat had been a CPM stronghold since 1977 and was vacated recently following the death of party MLA Narayan Mukherjee.  The BJP victory is of much significance for more than one reason. First, this is the first time that the BJP has won as a single party. In 1999, when it won the Ashoknagar bypoll, the BJP had the Trinamool Congress as its ally.
The second important factor is a major shift of CPM support continued…

Status quo in LS bypolls  BJP  SP  TRS retain 1 seateachIn the general elections this year, Modi had set a record margin by winning the Vadodara seat by 5,70,128 votes.
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:57 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 4:58 pm
The three Lok Sabha constituencies where bypolls were held voted for status quo with BJP, SP and TRS today retaining Vadodara, Mainpuri and Medak seats respectively.
BJP, SP and TRS are in office in the states of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana from where they won the respective constituencies. Their candidates had vacated the seats necessitating the September 13 byelections.
BJP candidate Ranjanben Bhatt won the Vadodara seat trouncing Narendra Rawat of Congress by a margin of ,29,507 votes, according to District Collector Avantika Singh, who is the returning officer.
The seat was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he retained Varanasi seat.
Bhatt secured 5,26,763 votes while Rawat got 1,97,256 votes, Singh said.
In the general elections this year, Modi had set a record margin by winning the Vadodara seat by 5,70,128 votes defeating Congress General secretary and party’s candidate Madhusudan Mistry.
Modi had got 8,45,464 votes while Mistry secured 2,75,336 votes.
In Mainpuri, a stronghold of ruling Samajwadi Party, Tej Pratap Singh, the party candidate and grand-nephew of Mulayam Singh Yadav, defeated his nearest rival Prem Singh Skahkya of BJP by a margin of more than 3.21 lakh votes.
The Mainpuri seat was vacated by SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, who decided to retain Azamgarh seat. Mulayam had won by 3.64 lakh votes. The SP had won five seats in the Lok Sabha elections in UP that was swept by BJP, which bagged 71 of the 80 seats. BJP ally Apna Dal notched two.
In Telangana, TRS again asserted its supremacy in Medak Lok Sabha constituency with its nominee K Prabhakar Reddy winning by 3,61,277 votes.
Reddy polled 5,71,800 votes, pushing Congress’ V Sunita Laxma Reddy (2,10,523) and BJP’s T Jayaprakash Reddy  (1,86,334) to second and third positions.
The Medak Lok Sabha seat was vacated by K Chandrasekhar Rao after he became Chief Minister. Rao had won with a margin of 3.97 lakh votes in the May elections.

CPM wins Tripura by-poll  candidate grabs 64% of votes polled in former ministers strongholdPrint
Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:53 pm
Tripura’s ruling Communist Party of India – Marxist, or CPM, has won the assembly by-polls as expected with its candidate grabbing roughly 64% of the total votes polled in the tribal-reserved Manu seat in the state’s southern region.
The CPM’s Pravat Chowdhury, who recently quit his government job in the state’s agriculture department, beat his closest rival Mailafru Mog of the main opposition Congress by a margin of more than 15,000 votes.
The Manu constituency was a stronghold of former Rural Development and Industries Minister Jitendra Chowdhury, who is now a Lok Sabha member. Chowdhury had won the seat undefeated since 1993 till his departure for Parliament this year.
In a surprise, the BJP with 1550 votes has secured third place in the by-polls ahead of other, more entrenched parties such as the Trinamool Congress and tribal parties such as the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra and Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura.

TRS wins Medak LS seat  TDP gains Nandigama assemblysegmentPress Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:53 pm
Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) reigned supreme in Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, while the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) retained the Nandigama assembly segment in Andhra Pradesh.
The bypoll results were on expected lines and threw up no surprises since voters chose to back ruling parties in largely one-sided contests.
TRS nominee K Prabhakar Reddy recorded a huge victory margin of 3,61,277 votes in Medak, which was vacated by TRS supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao after he became Telangana chief minister, though it fell short of Rao’s 3.97 lakh votes victory margin in the May elections.
The Congress came second, with V Sunita Laxma Reddy getting 2,10,523 votes, pushing back BJP’s T Jayaprakash Reddy (1,86,334).
Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao saw the victory as an endorsement of the TRS-led state government’s functioning.
“People have endorsed what we did in these three months (after coming to power),” Rao said at a press conference, where he criticised Congress, TDP and BJP for attacking his government without any real basis.
There was no stopping TDP in Nandigama (SC), where its nominee Tangirala Sowmya, a software engineer, won by 74,827 votes.
The election in this segment in Krishna district was necessitated after the death of Sowmya’s father T Prabhakar due to cardiac arrest, just days after his election in May.
She polled 99,748 votes, even as her Congress rival Bodapati Babu Rao finished a distant second with 24,921 votes.
The main opposition YSR Congress Party did not field any candidate after the TDP requested other parties to make the election unanimous.
“We may consider this victory as a gift from people in the Chandrababu Naidu government which is completing 100 days in office today and Vijayawada (in Krishna district) being declared as capital of Andhra Pradesh,” Sowmya said.

IIT-B has overtaken its counterpart in Delhi for the first time. IIT Delhi has been the leader in India throughout the first 10 editions of the QS rankings. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay has for the first time emerged as India's leading university in the world university rankings.
IIT-B has overtaken its counterpart in Delhi for the first time. IIT Delhi has been the leader in India throughout the first 10 editions of the QS rankings. The bad news however is that not a single Indian university features in the top 200 rankings. Just like last year's rankings, the top-placed Indian institution is 222nd in the world — IIT-B. IIT Delhi has slipped one rank to 235th this year.
IIT-B's success is down to improvements in its reputation among both academics and employers. It is now in the top 60 in the world in the QS international survey of employers and its position of 160th in the academic survey represents a rise of 23 places. But it has work to do on research citations and the proportions of international students and faculty, which are all outside the top 300, if it is to break into the leading positions in the ranking.
University of Calcutta has jumped 50 ranks since last year's ranking and is placed 650th in the world while the University of Delhi has jumped 20 ranks to 430th.
IIT Kanpur is ranked 300th globally followed by IIT Madras (321), IIT Kharagpur (324), IIT Roorkie (461) and IIT Guwahati (551).
The number of Indian institutions in the ranking has grown from 11 to 12, with Banaras Hindu University joining the group below 700th place . But the overall standing of the remaining institutions is similar to last year: six have gone up and five have gone down, with the two leading IITs well ahead of the rest.
India's strength is in the QS survey of academics, where the two leading IITs, the University of Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science all feature in the top 200.
All but one of the Indian institutions in the ranking has improved on this measure — a good foundation for the future since it is accounts for 40% of each university's score. They are much less competitive, however, in terms of the number of times their academics' research is cited.
The weakest elements for India are the proportions of international staff and students.
Dr Karthick Sridhar, vice-chairman, Indian Centre for Assessment and Accreditation says, "With the increasing globalization of higher education, Indian universities need to compete to attract the best students, as well as best qualified faculty from across the world. Students continue to use rankings as one of their decision-making tools to choose their destinations. The prestige associated with higher ranks also drives universities to benchmark themselves globally."
Ben Sowter, who is responsible for the rankings as head of the QS Intelligence Unit, said, "India may not have made as much progress as it would have liked in the new rankings, but new measures always take time to be reflected in higher positions. Indian universities are engaging with the rankings more than ever before and this should bear fruit in the medium term."
Mohandas Pai, member, board of governors, IIT Hyderabad said, "All great universities have full academic, financial and administrative autonomy to chart their own future. Indian universities lack the autonomy needed to be world class. They are controlled so heavily by regulators/government that they cannot innovate, be current nor aspire to reach the top. They are also starved of adequate research funding. Unless these issues are settled urgently even hopes are optimistic."

Apple has released a toolApple releases U2 album removal tool
By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor
Apple and U2 announced the giveaway last Tuesday
Bono and Apple join forces for charity Watch
Apple has released a tool to remove U2's new album from its customers' iTunes accounts six days after giving away the music for free.
Some users had complained about the fact that Songs of Innocence had automatically been downloaded to their devices without their permission.
It had not been immediately obvious to many of the account holders how to delete the tracks.
The US tech firm is now providing a one-click removal button.
"Some customers asked for the ability to delete 'Songs of Innocence' from their library, so we set up itunes.com/soi-remove to let them easily do so. Any customer that needs additional help should contact AppleCare," spokesman Adam Howorth told the BBC.
Users who want to remove the new U2 album can now click a button to do so
Users who remove the album and do not download it again before 13 October will be charged for the 11 tracks if they subsequently try to add them again.
"It's embarrassing for Apple that it's had a bit of a backlash," commented Ian Maude from the media consultancy Enders Analysis.
"It was giving something away to its customers - so that part was really good - but what it should have probably done was make it optional. Not everybody's a U2 fan as it's just discovered.
"Is there any long-term impact? No. It's moved very quickly to fix the problem."
'Blood, sweat and tears'
Apple made the album available to about 500 million iTunes customers in 119 countries to coincide with its iPhone 6 and Watch launch event last week.
Some users had requested an easy way to delete the music from their media libraries
U2's singer Bono acknowledged at the time that not everyone would appreciate the gift.
"People who haven't heard our music, or weren't remotely interested, might play us for the first time because we're in their library," he wrote on the band's site .
"And for the people out there who have no interest in checking us out, look at it this way… the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys are in your junk mail."
Bono added that Apple had "paid" for the giveaway, and reports have suggested that prime placement of banner ads publicising the album on the iTunes store and other publicity provided by the tech firm might be worth as much as $100m (£62m) .
Sales of earlier U2 albums have re-entered iTunes' charts and the band has also raised its profile ahead of an expected tour as well as a planned follow-up album called Songs of Experience.
Apple is promoting U2's new music as well as offering earlier albums at discounted prices
The new tracks on Songs of Innocence have, however, split the critics.
The Drowned in Sound site suggested that U2 no longer had it in them to make a great album, adding that giving  away songs for free had "somewhat devalued a record that cost six years of their lives and a lot of money to make".
But Rolling Stone magazine gave the album its maximum score, saying that it was "a triumph of dynamic, focussed renaissance".

Accumulate Lupin for long term: Phani Sekhar02:30 pm
Phani Sekhar of Angel Broking told CNBC-TV18, "The lack of clarity in  Lupin  on the financial contours is something which is majorly responsible for the correction today. But apart from that at this stage of Lupin it is an excellent deal for them and from a longer term perspective valuations as compared to the nearest comparable rival would be Cipla are not very demanding. So I guess from a longer term perspective it is a good time to accumulate Lupin."
On September 16, 2014 Lupin closed at Rs 1,362.60, down Rs 51.40, or 3.64 percent. It has touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,442.30.

ONGC Videsh signs LOI with PetroVietnam for joint explorationONGC Videsh signs LOI with PetroVietnam for joint exploration
BS Reporter | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 03:48 PM IST
ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), theoverseas exploration arm of ONGC Ltd, said it has signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with PetroVietnam, Vietnam's state-owned oil producer on Monday for exploration of oil and gas acreages in the offshore areas of that nation.
The agreement was signed by the two companies in the presence of Indian President Pranab Mukherjee, who is on a visit to that nation, and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan. "The LOI provides for expansion of exploration activities by OVL by considering participation in 2-3 additional blocks subject to technical and commercial viability and approvals," OVL said in a release.
PetroVietnam, in turn, could participate in a few of the exploration blocks of ONGC Videsh on mutually agreeable terms subject to due-diligence.
ONGC Videsh forayed into Vietnam in 1988 after bagging exploration license for a Block there. The company later bagged two exploration blocks in 2006. While one of them was relinquished after completion of the work program, the other block is under exploration. The two firms have since been engaged in further discussions for cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector of Vietnam.
ONGC Videsh is the wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC and is India's largest international oil and gas exploration and production company. At present, ONGC Videsh has participation in 35 projects in 16 countries including Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya,Mozambique, Myanmar, Russia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. The firm is currently producing around 160,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas per day and has total oil and gas reserves of 637 million tonne of oil equivalent (mtoe).

Kingfisher loan default only a ‘trickle’: Vinod Rai

TOPICS
economy, business and finance
As industrialist Vijay Mallya fights his wilful defaulter tag, former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai has said Kingfisher Airlines’ loan default is just a “trickle” and the overall problem of huge bad loans at public sector banks can be blamed on ‘cronies’ using connections to borrow money.
Mr. Rai, who was the CAG during 2008-2013, has also stressed the need to understand the trend of non-performing assets (NPA) of private sector banks being very low in comparison to that of public sector lenders.
Observing that cronies have neither the domain knowledge nor the financial strength to deliver, Mr. Rai in his new book has said that they use their connections to borrow from the banking sector, especially from public sector lenders that are prone to manipulation.
“This is the underlying reason for non-performing assets (NPAs) of public sector banks going up manifold,” he has written in the book titled ‘The Dairy of the Nation’s Conscience Keeper — Not Just An Accountant’
“Stories of Kingfisher Airlines and Bhushan Steel are only now emerging in trickles. The amount that has gone into corporate debt restructuring is another story; it contains all the marquee names,” he said.
On September 1, state-owned UBI declared Kingfisher Airlines, its promoter Vijay Mallya and three other directors wilful defaulters. Kingfisher owes about Rs. 7,000 crore to 17-banks consortium, led by State Bank of India.
Last month, a consortium of banks ordered a forensic audit into the books of account of cash-starved Bhushan Steel, which has total exposure of about Rs. 40,000 crore to lenders.
The move came close on the heels of the arrest of Bhushan Steel Vice Chairman and Managing Director Neeraj Singal by the CBI in an alleged cash for loan scam involving Syndicate Bank Chairman S K Jain.
According to Mr. Rai, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data showed that gross NPAs of public sector banks increasing to 3.61 per cent, which by all standards marked unprecedented high levels in 2013.
“Even if we were to accept the argument that these banks had to advance money in difficult times, why is it that the NPA of private sector bank is only half this percentage? It does not require much analysis to ascertain the reasons,” he noted.
Further, the former CAG has raised concerns about the appointment process at public sector bank boards.
“Many of those who bemoan the malfeasance that has crept into appointment processes, are aware of the names of the nominee government directors on public sector bank boards, and the absence of ‘fit and proper’ criteria for their nomination.
“However, few take steps to correct the situation. Somewhere, someone will have to take the bull by the horns. The process cannot be delayed by even a day,” Mr. Rai said.

The biggest ever U.S. IPO is expected to price and start trading early this week. Yahoo (YHOO) owns a 22% chunk of the Chinese company. Expect to see investors Yahoo-ing this week at least.
And if they’re not Yahoo-ing, they’ll be Yellin’. Fed chair Janet Yellen Wednesday ends a two-day meeting. Could higher rates be coming? Investors think not. If they’re wrong – expect a mad dash for the door. Hope you have your sneakers on.

Uncommon Customer Experiencereddit
My mother used to say, "Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want."
The greatest of marketing masters will tell you they've earned their stripes by learning from their biggest mistakes. At least that's what the honest ones will tell you. As marketers who must measure the metrics, we don't always get the results we want, so we learn our lessons and become a little smarter each time for the next.  We take big leaps of faith, and try crazy ideas in order to stand out above the rest.  When these ideas work, we become heroes. When our leaps result in belly flops, we become smarter -- except of course, when we don't.
Either way, every mistake is a gift bestowed upon you. These learning events are gifts for which you pay dearly, but they also bring us lessons one could never buy.
Today's consideration, however, is not about you, your mistakes, or the vast experience you may have accumulated throughout your career. No. Today is about the experience your prospects are gaining.
Unfortunately, learning from mistakes is also true for consumers. Every prospect you capture has been someone else's customer, and at some point in time, they did not get what they want. Otherwise, they would still be loyal customers of your competition. In fact, they were probably disappointed enough times, by enough other brands, that they have since become fully skeptical of your company and hesitant to trust your marketing. All they really want to get is what they are promised. In fact, they want you to want to give them what they are promised too. So, there is only one thing to do.
Keep your promises!
Good companies look to eliminate risks, break down barriers, create immediacy and so their marketers sweeten the deal with better pricing. Meanwhile, consumers instinctively assume the fine print of the special offers is somehow concealing a hidden "catch."
Better companies know their prospects are skeptical, and so they work hard to prove their credibility. Meanwhile, prospects suspect that the testimonials posted on the website are staged and scripted.
The marketplace is loaded with "step right up" incentives targeted at prospects that distrust these offers and do their best to stay at arm's length. The more prospects build walls and try to keep their distance, the harder marketers are working to convince them. When you've tried those tactics, you'll find that nothing speaks louder than good performance.
The best companies are uncommonly committed to keeping their word and delivering on their marketing promises. They are working to manage advocacy programs rather than scrambling to kick off another race-to-the-bottom price slashing sale or spending their time trying to triage another PR crisis.
Finally, when your prospects choose to trust you and become your customer, it is your ultimate mission to give them exactly what you promised. When you do, you create a new experience for your customers unlike most relationships they've encountered before.

4 Reasons Guest Blogging Should Be a Part of Every Entrepreneur s Strategyreddit
Guest blogging is one of the greatest opportunities you have to build your personal brand, boost your domain authority and get more traffic to your website.
The power of guest blogging cannot be understated. It's important to develop and maintain a blog on your own website, but if you're already adhering to best practices internally, it's time to take your expertise -- and your personality -- further out.
Guest blogging is great for you and even greater for your business, as long as you can be consistent and authoritative. Over time, you'll see the benefits, which include these four powerhouses:
1. More personal brand recognition. First and foremost, the more often you post, the more people will recognize you as an authority. Bring social media into the equation, and you'll be set up with an awesome personal-brand-building engine.
2. Backlinks and greater authority for your site. Hopefully, your guest blogging platform of choice will allow you to include some links back to your site, peppered throughout your post (only when relevant of course). If not, even brand mentions are being considered in Google's algorithms, meaning a non-linked company mention is almost as valuable as a full link.
3. Increased web traffic to your site. If people like what you have to write, they'll be interested in learning and reading more. Help direct them with links or a personal bio, and they'll immediately check out your website to discover more about who you are and what you do.
4. Opportunities for relationship building through comments. Blog comments are ripe with great discussion, especially when you write strong opinion pieces. Take advantage of the opportunity to engage with your audience directly and build your reputation.
Some people have recently argued that guest blogging is on the decline, due to a number of changes in Google's algorithms from the Panda and Penguin updates. But despite the power decrease, guest blogging is still quite useful in building domain authority. And even without the SEO benefits, guest blogging is an incredibly powerful tool all-around.

Meet the New Wolves of Wall Streetreddit
Wall Street is in the midst of some pretty massive changes right now. And I'm talking about Wall Street as it relates to Main Street. I'm talking about how individual investors are being courted (hunted) and cared for (killed) by the new wolves of Wall Street.
Brokers have now become an endangered species as the model has been attacked on two sides by fee-only investment advisers (aka, RIAs) and discount brokers advocating a DIY approach. And now there's a third entrant attacking both the brokers and RIAs: robo-advisers. All in all this evolution is good for investors as it ultimately brings down costs.
But don't underestimate greed's resilience and its willingness and ability to adapt. As they say, "the more things change, the more the stay the same." Many brokers are making the switch to RIAs. In fact, they're doing it in droves (witness the growth of the likes of LPL Financial). Changing your title and even your business plan, however, won't magically turn a wolf into a sheep but it does make him harder to identify.
Make no mistake. There are plenty of wolves left on Wall Street . They just don't call themselves wolves anymore. In fact, they do everything in their power to look like innocent, cuddly sheep. They setup as RIAs now. Many even preach a low-cost, passive or index-based approach to investing, aligning themselves with the likes of Burton Malkiel , Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle , some of the most respected names in the business.
It's the ultimate hypocrisy. You see, while they preach a low-cost approach and may actually use low-cost products like index ETFs , they'll charge you an arm and leg for the privilege -- as much as 2 percent per year. As Meb Faber put it , "you're a predator if you're charging 2% commissions and or 2%+ fees for doing nothing." I'm sure the wolves, who normally brag about 'eating what they kill,' would take this as a compliment. Meb continues,
Anything more than 0.5% or so on top of fund fees is either paid a) out of ignorance, which is not always the investor's fault or b) as a tax for being irresponsible.  For the latter I mean a fee to keep you out of your own way of chasing returns and doing something stupid, much in the same way someone pays Weight Watchers or any other diet advice program when you know what you should be doing (eat less, exercise more).
I'd say that anything more than 0.25% for "managing" a passive portfolio of index ETFs these days is obscene (it's not even really "managing" if it's passive - more like "overseeing"). And there are plenty of advisers charging nearly ten times that amount. And what's the money for? What are you paying these fees for year after year? Because if the funds themselves do all the work and merely need to be rebalanced a couple of times it might take 15 minutes per year.
At the end of the day, you're paying for the pleasure of their company. And that 2% fee might not seem like much but it really adds up over time. As Albert Einstein famously said, "compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it." Over 40 years, on $100,000 initial investment, that 2% fee you're paying compounds into roughly $2 million. Even Kate Upton 's company is not worth that much.
That chart above shows the growth of $100,000 over 40 years assuming a rate of return of 9.68% for the index fund (the return over the past 40 years) and 7.68% for the investor paying 2% to his adviser. The DIY guy ends up with a little over $4 million and the guy with the wolf, I mean adviser, ends up with a little less than $2 million. That's right, the wolf ends up eating over half of your profits.
So when I call these fees "predatory" or "obscene" this is why. Wolves preaching a low-cost, passive approach and charging these fees represent the height of hypocrisy - or the height of greed - take your pick.

Tribune staff report
Urban Outfitters apologizes for "bloody" Kent State sweatshirt.
Urban Outfitters says Kent State sweatshirt no longer on sale was "part of our sun-faded vintage collection."
Kent State University and many on the Internet criticized Urban Outfitters Inc. on Monday for selling a sweatshirt with its college logo and what appears to be spattered blood, saying it evoked memories of the 1970 shooting where four students died.
“This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today," the Ohio-based university said in a statement on its website. "We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit.”
Urban Outfitters sells bloody Kent State sweatshirt, quickly apologizes
If you're going to sell a college-branded sweatshirt with what looks a whole lot like bloodstains and bullet holes on it, maybe you don't pick the school with one of the most infamous shootings in history.

Urban Outfitters, which apologized on Twitter, sold the item for $129 on its website as part of an assortment of vintage clothing. It has since sold out. But it is being offered on eBay for a "Buy It Now" price of $2,500.
"It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State in 1970 and we are extremely saddened that this item was perceived as such. The one-of-a-kind item was purchased as part of our sun-faded vintage collection," the company said on Twitter.
Urban Outfitters said the red markings were the result of distressing and "wear and fray." Kent State invited anyone interested in buying the sweatshirt to tour its recently opened May 4 Visitor Center, noting the date when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire, killing four and wounding nine other students during a campus protest of the Vietnam War.
The company said a visit would help them "to gain perspective on what happened 44 years ago and apply its meaning to the future."
@PeterBella How do we know they sold out? UO may very well have lied about this. IF they sold out, perhaps 1 person or organization did so to remove them from the marketplace.

AN  ICON OF BRAND EQUITYreddit
Olive Garden has issued a strongly worded defense of its unlimited salad and breadsticks on Monday, because it had to.
In a 24-slide presentation published Monday , Darden, the owner of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille and others, defended its Italian chain's breadstick and salad strategy, complicated menu and overall “brand renaissance.” The report came just days after Starboard Value, an investment firm, issued a 294-slide presentation eviscerating everything from execs’ use of corporate jets to Olive Garden’s insistence on not salting the pasta water.
Darden called its endless salad and breadsticks an "icon of brand equity," and staunchly defended its tactic of piling tables high with buttery carbs and offering a bottomless bowl of salad soaked in Italian dressing.
"It conveys Italian generosity and our salads have the highest loyalty rating of any menu item based on the menu satisfaction surveys we conduct," the company said in the presentation.
Darden remained silent about its refusal to salt its pasta water. When asked about Olive Garden's pasta water, a Darden spokesperson referred The Huffington Post to the presentation.
Darden's full breadstick and salad defense, circled in red below:
Starboard's take on Olive Garden's salad and breadsticks, from its presentation released Thursday:
Darden and Starboard are currently locked in a battle over the restaurant company's future. Over the past several months, Darden has struggled as customers have ditched sit-down restaurants for fast-casual eateries like Chipotle and Panera Bread. The company reported a loss of $19.3 million on Friday and Olive Garden has had five quarters in a row of declining same-store sales, a key retail metric.
Starboard is urging shareholders to dump all 12 of Darden’s board members at the company’s shareholder meeting on October 10 and replace them with a group of its own nominees. Darden is offering a slate that includes four new independent candidates, four continuing independent candidates and four slots to be filled by Starboard, Matthew Stroud, the company's senior vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.

"Paradoxically, equity volumes remain tepid despite the disinflationary conditions. We expect the FOMC meeting this week to signal the end of QE in October. We would, however, highlight that global liquidity measures have been much more dependent on China's money supply changes," he adds.
 
12:25pm RBI Governor on foreign debt
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is limiting the country's reliance on foreign debt and will continue to do so, governor Raghuram Rajan said.
"We are limiting our reliance on foreign debt. It's important we keep it this way," he said during a speech to university students.
Rajan's comments came at a time when foreign institutional investors have nearly exhausted their USD 25 billion allocation in government debt, leading to expectations that India would raise limits soon.
Rajan also said the RBI had reduced the current account deficit "substantially".
The current account deficit for April-June stood at USD 7.8 billion, sharply higher than USD 1.3 billion in January-March but narrowing from USD 21.8 billion a year ago, reports Reuters.
12:00pm Equity benchmarks remained marginally under pressure with the Sensex falling 44.25 points to 26772.31 and the Nifty declining 16.50 points to 8025.50 but the outperformance in broader markets continued.
The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gained 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Advancers beat decliners on the Bombay Stock Exchange by a ratio of 1470 to 1163.
ONGC topped the selling list, falling 2.5 percent and Oil India declined 1 percent. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) like BPCL, HPCL and IOC fell 1.5-3 percent. Diesel prices will not be touched till October 15, at least till Maharashtra and Haryana elections, reports CNBC-TV18 quoting unnamed government sources. OMCs didn't revise petrol price as revision unwarranted, sources add.
Shares of Axis Bank, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Sesa Sterlite and Coal India lost 0.7-2 percent. Top lenders State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank slipped 0.2-0.5 percent.
However, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's Labs bucked the trend, rising 1-1.7 percent followed by Infosys, HDFC, ITC, Wipro, Hero Motocorp and Hindalco with 0.3-0.7 percent.

Sensex, Nifty consolidate; oil stocks weak, pharma steady
Oil & gas stocks are taking a toll on the benchark indices. The index is down 0.8 percent. ONGC, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, Sesa Strelite and Coal India are major laggards while Dr Reddy's Labs, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Wipro and Bajaj Auto are top gainers in the Sensex.

India to benefit from falling oil prices | Cos hold diesel price cutdistribution
(India’s vicious economic…)
NEW DELHI: India is expected to reap multi-layered benefits from the falling global oil, gold and coal prices as crude trades near the $100 barrel mark and gold prices have struck to a 7-1/2-month low.
India's vicious economic cycle (between 2010-2013) of slowing growth, elevated twin deficits and a skewed savings profile was amplified by surging global oil and gold prices, both of which are now in retreat with oil at 17-month lows of US$97/bbl, Deutsche Bank said in a report.
Decelerating global oil demand strengthens the case for a sustainably lower oil price. In addition, a decline in coal prices to 5-year low has further sweetened the investment thesis for India.
Brent crude price has breached the US$98/bbl level last seen in April 2013. Falling crude prices can drive multi-layered benefits for the Indian economy through lower CAD, lower fiscal deficit and easing inflationary pressures, said the global investment bank.
The global investment bank''s oil & gas team also estimates that every US$1/bbl decline in crude prices would drive a US$1bn decline in net imports.
In FY15 Deutsche Bank estimates oil subsidies to fall by 44 per cent YoY - the sharpest drop in any one year since FY10 - to Rs 0.8 trillion (USD13bn) and by a further 42 per cent in FY16 to Rs 0.6 trillion (USD9.6bn) on a fall in oil prices and increase in diesel retail price.
OMCs, PSU banks and automobiles stand out as the direct beneficiaries of a sharp dip in oil and gold prices, said the Deutsche Bank report.
"Certainly, one should hold on to all the oil marketing companies. If there is any dip, one should use it. Crude oil price has corrected to $98, which is about a 17-month low. So, it is really great news not only for oil marketing companies, but also for the Indian economy itself," said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research.
"As the economy improves, oil import is going to increase beyond $155 billion. So, it is a fantastic development for India, particularly for OMC companies. One should hold on to them," he added.
Declining oil, gold and coal prices should result in multi-layered benefits for the Indian economy as it will have positive impact on its external accounts, capital markets and savings profile, added the global investment bank.
Gold slipped nearly 3 per cent for the week, its biggest weekly drop since the week ended May 30. The weakness in gold also pulled down other precious metals, with silver falling to a 14-month low.
India's household savings have seen an unsustainable and economically inefficient share of physical savings, following escalated oil and gold prices.
Physical assets rose to 68%-69 per cent of households savings in FY12/13 - highest in 4 decades. Deutsche Bank believes that the fading glitter of gold should trigger a much needed shift away from physical savings to financial savings through bank deposits, mutual funds, and insurance .
The declining lure of gold is amply evident in a sharp dip in the investment component (mainly coins and bars) of gold demand, which has now dipped to 23 per cent of total gold demand in Q4FY14 vs. 42 per cent in Q3FY13.
Technical Outlook on Gold:
Gold prices have shown a strong support at about Rs 25,000 per ten grams on technical charts.
"So any dip in prices should be seen as an opportunity to accumulate gold and then aim for Rs 31,800 target within a year," said Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution , Religare Securities Limited.
"However this does not take into account newer developments in the global financial and geopolitical space and prices will react significantly to these changes," he added.
S M Sakthi Prakaash, Lead Research Analyst at WealthRays Securities, is of the view that fundamentals are looking very weak for gold and its value is expected to fall in the coming year.
However, retail buying could provide support for gold prices at lower level and could prevent a steep fall in gold prices. Gold futures may be expected to trade in the range of Rs 25000-25500 in the next 6 months to 1 year, he added.

The VHP and Bajrang Dal created ruckus after vice chancellor Kaul appealed to students to help their Kashmir classmates in the time of devastation. About 100 Kashmiri students are studying in different departments of the university.
The activists barged into the university and straight away moved to the VC office. They lodged their protest against Kaul’s appeal and vandalised his office.
The university staffers rushed Kaul to Sanjeevani Hospital, where his condition is said to be stable. Raising voice against ‘hooliganism’ on the university campus, teaching and nonteaching staffers have decided to keep university shut for a day on Tuesday.
Ujjain police registered a case against accused persons and claimed that they arrested them.

Friends for benefits: PM Modi reaches out to China via JapanHow PM Modi is reaching out to China via Japan
AP  Beijing, September 16, 2014

Comments
Chinese President Xi Jinping's trip to India this week highlights subtle shifts in the regional power dynamic that are bringing warmer ties between the two Asian giants, challenging China's traditional relationship with Pakistan, and opening a new chapter in Beijing's ongoing competition for influence with arch-rival Japan.

Xi is due in New Delhi on Wednesday for a three-day visit focused on trade, investment and the resolution of decades-old border disputes.
With the world's second-largest economy and a proven track record at building highways, railways, and industrial zones, China has much to offer India as it seeks to upgrade its creaky infrastructure.
The visit is the latest sign of easing suspicions between the two huge countries - which between them have 2.6 billion people - dating from a month-long border war in 1962 that left around 2,000 soldiers dead. That conflict ended in a standoff with both sides accusing the other of occupying its territory.
Xi's visit "will definitely enhance the bilateral political mutual trust," Chinese assistant foreign minister Liu Jianchao told reporters in Beijing last week.
While ties have been steadily growing for years, they've been given a major boost under new Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who's signaled he wishes to pursue a more vigorous foreign policy.
Xi is the first Chinese head of state to visit in eight years, while the country's prime minister, Li Keqiang, made India his first overseas visit shortly after taking office last year.
"Good relations with India are a key part of China's regional strategy and Xi's visit creates the opportunity for direct face-to-face communication on the problems that still exist, such as the border issue," said Zhao Gancheng, director of the Asia-Pacific Center of the Shanghai Institute for International Studies.
Modi spoke repeatedly to top Chinese officials in the first weeks of his administration, and during a recent visit to India, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi described the new relationship as "the emerging tip of a massive buried treasure."
There's certainly plenty of room for growth. China may be India's biggest trading partner, but commerce between them dropped to an anemic $65 billion last year, with China exporting $48 billion more goods than it imported. For Modi, boosting trade and foreign investment is critical to making good on his campaign promise of creating jobs for the 13 million young Indians entering the labor market each year.
HT Analysis: Modi-Xi agenda: Work for 'Hindi-Chini buy-buy'
China also has a strong vested interested in preventing India from drawing too close to the West and especially to Japan, which has enthusiastically courted Modi's government.
Recently, Modi paid a five-day visit to Japan, bringing home pledges of billions of dollars in aid and investment and an agreement to strengthen their economic and security ties. Modi has emphasized the value of their shared commitment to democracy in contrast to China's one-party authoritarian communist system.
In light of that visit, Xi is expected to make investment pledges matching or exceeding the $35 billion Modi received in Japan - a sign of how Modi has been able to leverage the rivalry between China and Japan to maximize gains for India.
"China, I think, is conscious that we have a good equation with Japan," said Jayadev Ranade, president of the New Delhi-based think tank Center for China Analysis and Strategy.
Both sides have said the border disputes shouldn't impede relations and recent years have brought regular consultations between both their diplomats and troops on either side high along the Himalayan frontier.
That's despite the occasional Indian accusation of Chinese incursions and an increased Chinese military presence along the border that has prompted India to deploy more armored units, refurbish air strips, and construct new roads in the area.
China lays claim to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, an immense territory of nearly 84,000 square kilometers (more than 32,000 square miles), while India says China is illegally occupying the region of Aksai Chin, a rocky and largely empty 37,000-square-kilometer (14,000-square-mile) region far to the east.
Talks have yet to produce a long-term solution, but until they do, China says its policy is to avoid conflict.
"We are all committed to tranquility and peace at the border. We will strive for an equitable and reasonable solution based on negotiation and consultation. We have confidence and capability for that," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Thursday.
While both Xi and Modi are strong leaders who've shown initiative, they're constrained on the border issue by domestic sentiment, particularly rising nationalism in China, Ranade said.
"There will be many issues raised and discussed but I don't see a major breakthrough on the border issue. These are difficult issues," Ranade said. "But even if they are discussed in a tangible fashion, which I expect the Modi government will do, it will be a move forward."
Xi's visit comes during a swing through the region that also includes stops in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, where Chinese companies are at work on a major port and other infrastructure projects.
He won't, however, be stopping in on long-time ally and Indian rival Pakistan amid an outbreak of violent political protests in the capital, Islamabad. That offers further evidence for those who see a growing Chinese ambivalence toward Pakistan, although Ranade said the fact that the country was included on the original itinerary shows Beijing still values the relationship.
"Under the circumstances, it's inappropriate to have such a high-level visit," said the Shanghai Institute's Zhao. Beijing hasn't commented on reasons for the visit's cancellation and the Foreign Ministry says China and Pakistan remain friendly neighbors.
China and Pakistan had in the past found common cause in checking India's growth as a regional power, but China's own stratospheric rise has alleviated that need. Beijing also has grown increasingly concerned with the threat to stability in its northwestern region of Xinjiang posed by Islamic radicals hiding out in northwestern Pakistan.
At the same time, Pakistan's political dysfunction and economic malaise also offer little incentive for Chinese companies to take on the sort of major projects there that they're now eyeing for India.

Residents of flood-hit Srinagar hit out at govt apathyComments
A banner on one of the tents in a relief camp in downtown Srinagar's Kani Mazaar that says "We don't need Indian choppers" speaks of the anger at the grossly inadequate government rescue and relief measures after the floods hit Jammu and Kashmir.
People from all walks of life have taken up the task to put their lives back together. Doctors are helping in relief camps by putting in the hours and supplying with medicines. Young men are chipping in as volunteers supplying relief material and helping sort out the traffic.
A doctor at a health camp in a mosque in Shah Mohalla area of old Srinagar, 100 metres away from the valley's most-visited SMHS Hospital, which is still five feet under water, asked "Where is the administration?"
All the patients of the SMHS hospital have been shifted to SKIMS Hospital in the suburbs of Srinagar, 12 km away. The SMHS caters to the patients from the old city and rural areas.
Makeshift hospitals
Realising that most parts of the old city were cut off from other hospitals, a group of doctors, who work at the hospital, put up at a hostel nearby decided to operate from a mosque.
The main prayer hall has been converted into a pharmacy. Five round tables in the compound function as ENT, ophthalmology, medicine, dentistry and gastroenterology departments, each attended to by specialist doctors.
Another small room has been marked as the orthopaedics unit.
 
Since Wednesday about 2,000 patients have been examined and provided free medicines. The medicines dispensed to patients have been pooled by the doctors from their samples given to them by representatives of pharmaceutical companies.
Charities and other organisations working for flood victims also provide a steady supply of medicines.
Asked what the government did for this medical outreach, the doctor, requesting anonymity, said, "Nothing. Local residents help in distributing medicines and queuing up patients. Some volunteers help with keeping records."
Mohammad Rajab, a local resident, told HT that Dr Showkat Kadla, one of the leading gastroenterologists of the valley, donated a few lakh rupees out of his own pocket for the health camp.
Charity organisations step in
Another such health camp operates out of a house vacated by its generous owner in Hyderpora area. Twenty-one doctors voluntarily work in six shifts in this camp set up by the Coordination Committee Hyderpora, which also runs one of the largest relief camps in the local mosque.
Like Hyderpora, all major relief camps - Sanat Nagar, Baghat Gurdwara, Makhdoom Sahab, Rajouri Kadal, HMT and others - where thousands of people have taken shelter, are being run by local committees and volunteers from other places.
Nazir Ahmad, one of the coordinators of Hyderpora committee, said that currently 3,200 people are living at the mosque camp, nearly half the number of flood victims a couple of days ago.
Asked about the governmental help, Nazir said that five trucks of rice were provided by the state food and supplies department for the first time on Sunday.
Vegetables, oils and spices have been coming from charities and purchases, while professional chefs have been hired by the committee to prepare meals.
On Monday, this reporter spotted a few policemen for the first time since the floods ravaged the city.
They were manning a traffic bottleneck near Magarmal Bagh in uptown Srinagar, but a larger number of civilian volunteers were directing the traffic through the congested road that leads to Batamaloo that houses the biggest bus stand.
The absence of the police has made the traffic chaotic on several other roads that remain the only link between flooded and non-flooded areas, hindering the movement of relief material and volunteers.
Death and stink
Shopkeepers in areas where the flood waters receded opened their shops to salvage whatever little they could.
Mujtaba Sheikh, a resident of Chattabal area, which has the largest concentration of the leather garment makers in the city, said, "The water has ruined everything. Nothing we recovered from the shop is worth the market."
Besides huge losses, the residents of these areas complained of the stink emanating from the flotsam and the slimy silt, awaiting fumigation and other disinfecting processes by the government.
Some of them were spraying phenyl and bleaching powder provided by relief camps or bought from the market.
But the stink, which is threatening in more than one way, comes from the decomposing carcasses of more than 315 cows that died in the flood.
Barring a few that were swept away and are rotting in nearby localities, all the heavily bloated dead cattle are laying in the sprawling farm.
"Unless disposed of quickly, these carcasses pose a grave threat to the people of Chattabal which is submerged under water. We are trying to hire a JCB to remove the carcasses," said Naqshab, a volunteer with Athrot, a charity that did a commendable work during 2005 Kashmir earthquake.
In scores of low-lying localities - Batamaloo, Qamarwari, Bemina Housing Colony, Karan Nagar, Tengpora and Rajbagh - where people apprehend flood waters will remain stagnant for long unless pumped out, relief efforts suffered because of inaccessibility.
"The ground floor of our house is three feet under water. My parents didn't leave because they think it is a hassle to go to someone's place when the entire population has suffered. So every day after doing my bit at a health camp, I wade in four-foot deep water to reach my home along with supplies," said Dr Humaam, a resident of Sir Syed Abad in Bemina.
He said volunteers of a local charity have come twice since last Tuesday and offered milk, bread and other eatables.

Oil cos hold 35 paisa cut in diesel, 55 p hike in petrol
Under-recovery or the difference between retail price and its imported cost on diesel was 8 paisa per litre in the first half of September. The under-recovery in the second half has turned into over-recovery or profit of 35 paisa per litre.

Oil cos hold 35 paisa cut in diesel, 55 p hike in petrol
Under-recovery or the difference between retail price and its imported cost on diesel was 8 paisa per litre in the first half of September. The under-recovery in the second half has turned into over-recovery or profit of 35 paisa per litre.

Diesel prices, for the first time in over 5 years, should have been cut by 35 paisa on falling global rates but oil companies have decided to hold on to the rates pending a government decision on deregulation.
Under-recovery or the difference between retail price and its imported cost on diesel was 8 paisa per litre in the first half of September. The under-recovery in the second half has turned into over-recovery or profit of 35 paisa per litre.
"Naturally, when there is an over-recovery or profit, rates should have been cut but oil companies are holding the price line as they await a clear decision from the government on diesel price deregulation," an official said.
This would have been first reduction in diesel rates in over five years. Diesel rates were last cut on January 29, 2009 when they were reduced by Rs 2 a litre to Rs 30.86. Since then rates have only increased as international oil prices climbed. Since January 2013, diesel prices have been raised by up to 50 paisa a litre every month to eliminate under-recoveries.
The official said Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is in Vietnam on an official tour and a deregulation or freeing of the fuel pricing from government control will be discussed upon his return.
Deregulation would give oil companies powers to change rates in tandem with cost like they do in case of petrol since June 2010. Like diesel, state-owned oil companies have also not changed petrol rates which warranted a 54 paisa increase as its benchmark gasoline rates had firmed up in international market.
"There are elections in Maharasthra and Haryana and anincrease now would not have been a very popular decision," the official said. This is perhaps the first time that retail prices in India are higher than global rates.
A government statement on fortnightly under-recoveries stated that diesel under-recovery has been wiped out and there is over-recovery of Rs 0.35 per litre with effect from September 16.  Oil companies calculate the desired retail selling price of petrol and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international benchmark price and rupee-dollar exchange rate.
Average benchmark gasoline rates have increased from USD 109.25 per barrel in second half of August to USD 111.04 in September. Exchange rate has averaged Rs 60.54 to a US dollar in September as compared to Rs 60.73 to a dollar in second half of August.
The combined effect of this should have resulted in an increase of 54 paisa a litre in price of petrol, but state- owned oil companies are holding on to the rates, the official said.
The next revision in diesel and petrol prices is due at the month end. Once the Cabinet approves de-regulation or freeing of diesel prices, oil companies can change rates in tandem with cost like they have been doing in case of petrol since June 2012.
The NDA government has continued with the previous UPA regime's policy of raising diesel rates by up to 50 paise a litre every month to bridge the gap between cost and retail prices.
Originally, petrol and diesel prices were deregulated in April 2002 when NDA government was in power. Administered pricing regime, however, made a back-door entry towards the end of NDA regime in the first quarter of 2004 when crude prices started inching up.

Congress-led UPA controlled rates as international oil prices went through the roof. In June 2010, however, it freed petrol price from its control and rates have since them moved more or less in tandem with cost.
In January 2013, the UPA decided to deregulate diesel prices in stages through monthly 50 paise a litre increases. Rates were last raised on August 31 after which losses have dipped.
Rates have cumulatively risen by Rs 11.81 per litre in 19 instalments since January 2013.

For the first time in the history of the regulation era on diesel , the under-recovery, or revenue loss, applicable on the fuel for the second fortnight effective Sep 16 has been wiped out, and there is instead a profit on sales, the government announced on Monday.
Announcing the product-wise under-recovery of state-run oil marketing companies, the petroleum ministry said that diesel in the second fortnight of the month effective Sep 16 will go into "over-recovery" of 35 paise a litre, fuelling expectations of a rate cut for the first time in seven years.
The ending of under-recoveries caused by selling diesel below cost has been made possible by the softening international oil rates and the monthly price increases.
Diesel prices have been raised monthly by 50 paise a litre in line with the government's January 2013 decision. Rates have cumulatively risen by Rs 11.74 per litre in 19 instalments since January 2013.
While the government is keen to pass on the benefit of cheaper oil to consumers, it is hesitant to free diesel prices just before assembly elections in four states - Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand, an official source told IANS.
"In the case of PDS kerosene and domestic LPG (cooking gas), the under-recoveries for the second fortnight of September 2014 will continue to be (as in the previous fortnight) Rs 32.67 per litre and Rs 427.82 per cylinder, respectively," the petroleum ministry said.
"Oil marketing companies, effective Sep 16, 2014, are now incurring combined daily under-recovery of Rs 190 crore on the sale of diesel, PDS kerosene and domestic LPG," a statement said. This is lower than Rs 195 crore daily under-recoveries during the previous fortnight.
Diesel currently costs Rs.58.97 in Delhi, Rs 67.26 in Mumbai, Rs 63.81 in Kolkata and Rs 62.92 in Chennai.
With international crude oil prices dropping below the $100 a barrel-mark last month, petrol rates were cut thrice during the month resulting in a price difference with diesel that has fallen below Rs.10 a litre.
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said that the country should take advantage of lower international oil prices to deregulate diesel.
"Typically a lower oil price means a lower CAD (current account deficit), lower oil subsidies and lower inflation. We should take this moment to eliminate diesel subsidies as soon as possible," Rajan said on Monday addressing a b"nkers' conference in Mumbai organised by industry chamber Ficci.
The international crude oil price of the Indian Basket on the previous trading day on Monday, had dropped to Rs.$95.50 per barrel.

How much more can the Federal Reserve do for US economy? Time for Yellen to decide
New York Times Sep 16, 2014, 03.15PM IST

(The Fed has indicated it…)
By Binyamin Appelbaum
WASHINGTON: For Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve's chairwoman, the easy part is over. The first phase of the Fed's retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, plotted by her predecessor, is nearly complete. Now, as Yellen nears the end of her first year in office, it is her turn to chart the way forward.
Yellen and her colleagues on the Fed's policymaking committee, who convene here Tuesday and Wednesday, are broadly agreed that the Fed's ability to improve economic conditions is nearing the end of the line, and they are inclined to start raising short-term interest rates around the midpoint of next year.
But the group of 17 officials continues to grapple with a pair of questions, one economic and one strategic, that will determine the details of the retreat: How much better can the job market get? And given that uncertainty, does it make more sense to pull back sooner, even if that means leaving unemployment too high, or to keep rates anchored longer, pressing ahead until it is clear the economy no longer needs the Fed's help, even if the result is an abrupt retreat?
The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will add just $15 billion to its bond holdings in October. Then it plans to end the purchases, concluding a series of "quantitative easing" campaigns that have expanded its portfolio to $4.2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from less than $1 trillion before the 2008 crisis.
That will let officials focus on the Fed's central policy tool, the level of short-term interest rates, which have been fixed near zero since December 2008.
The Fed has indicated it plans to hold interest near zero well into next year, to encourage businesses and consumers to borrow money and investors to take larger risks. But the internal debate has shifted in recent months as job growth has increased to a monthly average of 215,000 jobs so far this year, a level that some of the Fed's economic research has suggested is about as strong as it is likely to get.
Fed officials who support the campaign have stopped pushing to extend its duration, while moderates are warning that the Fed may need to beat an earlier retreat.
"Fed rhetoric has turned marginally more hawkish in recent months," Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in an analysis last week. He said he now expected the Fed to start raising rates in June 2015 rather than the third quarter.
Economists at Bank of America made a similar shift. "There has been a gradual change in rhetoric from Janet Yellen and her allies," their report said, though it added the projection was "more of a guess than a forecast."
Yellen has made clear since taking office that she is deeply concerned about the persistence of high unemployment, and that she continues to regard the Fed's stimulus campaign as an effective response.
In her first public speech after taking the helm of the Fed, in March, she told the stories of three Chicago-area residents struggling to find work. In August, she paused before entering a reception at the annual Jackson Hole conference to speak with demonstrators urging the Fed to continue its campaign.
"We're doing everything we can," they said that she told them.
But the next day, when Yellen delivered a professorial survey of the many unanswered questions about labor markets, some analysts saw evidence that she, too, had growing doubts about how much more the Fed could do.
  Yellen is also a low-key leader who speaks regularly with her colleagues in a constant search for common ground. Like Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor - but unlike some previous, more autocratic Fed chairmen - she lets other officials speak first at policy meetings, preferring to summarize the discussion rather than speaking at the outset to set the frame of the debate.
But Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that Bernanke, despite his preference for consensus, proved willing to act forcefully, as in September 2011 when the Fed expanded its stimulus campaign despite three dissenting votes.
"I think it's going to be very collegial, and what we've seen so far is consistent with that, but nevertheless there are things she's going to feel more strongly about," Hatzius said.
Many investors also are skeptical that the Fed intends to move faster. Asset prices that incorporate expectations about interest rates generally reflect an expectation that rates will rise more slowly than the predictions Fed officials made in June.
This may reflect greater pessimism about the economic outlook. It also reflects a view that the projections are misleading. An average of the predictions obscures the reality that the Fed's leadership, including Yellen, is more supportive of stimulus.

Govt likely to stick to budgeted borrowing p...Government likely to stick to budgeted borrowing plan in second half of the fiscal

("Government borrowing…)
NEW DELHI: The government is likely to stick to its scheduled borrowing programme of Rs 2.3 lakh crore for the second half of the fiscal.
The borrowing programme for the second half of the fiscal (October-March), according to sources, will be decided at a meeting between the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank on September 26.
"Government borrowing is expected to be in line with the budget announcement. Second half borrowing is likely to be unchanged," sources said.
The government borrows from the market through issue of T-bills and dated securities to meet the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit for the 2014-15 financial year has been pegged at 4.1 per cent of the GDP.
"The fiscal deficit target is ambitious, so increasing borrowing now can put the government in a precarious position," sources said.
The government, however, could tinker with its borrowing programme towards the close of 2014 in view of the performance of the economy.
The gross market borrowing through issue of dated securities in current fiscal has been pegged at Rs 5.97 lakh crore, Rs 34,000 crore higher than 2013-14 fiscal.
During the fist half, the government has pruned the borrowing programme by Rs 16,000 crore to Rs 3.52 lakh crore, with the objective to provide more liquidity in the system.
Besides other things, the realisation through disinvestment will have a bearing on the market borrowing programme of the government.
The government has already laid down the roadmap for stake sale in four major PSUs--SAIL, ONGC , Coal India, NHPC -- which could fetch the exchequer Rs 46,000 crore, more than the Rs 43,425 crore budgeted target.
Also the government's tax revenues look optimistic as the indirect tax collection rose 4.6 per cent in April-August period to over Rs 1.94 lakh crore.

OVL to expand oil and gas exploration in offshore Vietnam

(OVL will consider exploring…)
NEW DELHI: ONGC Videsh Ltd , the overseas arm of state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has signed an agreement to expand its oil and gas exploration in offshore Vietnam.
The Indian flagship firm will consider exploring in 2-3 blocks out of the 5 areas in South China Sea that Vietnam had offered on nomination basis in November last year.
The five blocks or areas - 17, 41, 43, 10&11-1 and 102&106/10, offered in November last year lie outside the territory claimed by China in the South China Sea.
"OVL and PetroVietnam, the major oil producing state-owned company of Vietnam, signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) on September 15 to participate in the exploration of oil and gas in offshore Vietnam," the company said in a statement here.
The LoI was signed by OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma and PetroVietnam President and CEO Do Van Hau in Hanoi during the state visit of President Pranab Mukherjee to Vietnam.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was also present at the signing.
"The LoI provides for expansion of exploration activities by OVL in Vietnam by considering participation in 2-3 additional blocks subject to technical and commercial viability and requisite approvals," it said.
In turn, PetroVietnam may consider participation in some of the exploration blocks of OVL on mutually agreeable terms subject to due-diligence.
OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration license for Block 06.1. The company got two exploration blocks - Block 127 and Block 128, in 2006.
However, Block 127 was relinquished after completing the work programme, and the other Block 128 is currently under exploration.
Additionally, ONGC Videsh and PetroVietnam have been engaged in further discussions for possible expansion of cooperation in hydrocarbon sector of Vietnam, the statement said.
OVL had relinquished Block 127 in offshore Phu Khanh Basin after it failed to find any oil or gas in the area.
Though it had decided to withdraw from adjacent Block 128, it has decided to stay put because of India's strategic interests in the region. The exploration period for the block has been extended until June 15, 2015.
China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where Block 127 and 128 are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region.
OVL continues to own 45 per cent in Vietnam's offshore block 6.1 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate.

TRS wins Medak LS seat  TDP gains Nandigama assembly segmentPress Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:53 pm
Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) reigned supreme in Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, while the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) retained the Nandigama assembly segment in Andhra Pradesh.
The bypoll results were on expected lines and threw up no surprises since voters chose to back ruling parties in largely one-sided contests.
TRS nominee K Prabhakar Reddy recorded a huge victory margin of 3,61,277 votes in Medak, which was vacated by TRS supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao after he became Telangana chief minister, though it fell short of Rao’s 3.97 lakh votes victory margin in the May elections.
The Congress came second, with V Sunita Laxma Reddy getting 2,10,523 votes, pushing back BJP’s T Jayaprakash Reddy (1,86,334).
Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao saw the victory as an endorsement of the TRS-led state government’s functioning.
“People have endorsed what we did in these three months (after coming to power),” Rao said at a press conference, where he criticised Congress, TDP and BJP for attacking his government without any real basis.
There was no stopping TDP in Nandigama (SC), where its nominee Tangirala Sowmya, a software engineer, won by 74,827 votes.
The election in this segment in Krishna district was necessitated after the death of Sowmya’s father T Prabhakar due to cardiac arrest, just days after his election in May.
She polled 99,748 votes, even as her Congress rival Bodapati Babu Rao finished a distant second with 24,921 votes.
The main opposition YSR Congress Party did not field any candidate after the TDP requested other parties to make the election unanimous.
“We may consider this victory as a gift from people in the Chandrababu Naidu government which is completing 100 days in office today and Vijayawada (in Krishna district) being declared as capital of Andhra Pradesh,” Sowmya said.

Bypoll drubbing is a message to Modi and Shah from hinterland IndiaSep 16, 2014 at 04:55pm IST
Bypoll drubbing is a message to Modi and Shah from hinterland India
7
0
The drubbing of the BJP in UP is a 'watershed' event. One might ask why employ such an adjective for by-elections which merely change how many are sitting on which side of the aisle in the state legislature. Well, here's why:
1) Even though people have voted in a single party majority in Parliament and a one-man government at the Centre, they do not want either the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi to get too comfortable. The UP and Rajasthan bypoll results are a message to both written in bold letters: The 'magic' show is over.
2) There is and will always be place for regional parties in this country - be it the Samajwadi Party or Trinamool Congress. One party domination across geography had been rejected by the Indian electorate long ago on the ground that only localisation builds customisation - local party pays greater heed to local needs and concerns. So while the BJP might deny the Congress (another national party) political space, any attempt to decimate regional parties might be taken personally by voters in hinterland India.
A clever foreign policy and high-speed trains are all good, but deep in India the issues are still basic: Water, power, roads, food prices and jobs.
#narendra modi #amit shah #bjp #congress
3) A clever foreign policy and high-speed trains are all good, but deep in India the issues are still basic: Water, power, roads, food prices and jobs. The bypoll results actually ask Modi in the face: "Have you stopped looking at the smaller picture, Mr PM?" For a man who came to 7 Race Course Road riding on popular aspirations for a better life, this reminder actually might make him readjust his focus.
4) A political being like Modi will not miss the early signals of the bypoll reverses - coming as they are so soon after his massive victory in the general elections and in a geography which he had won so convincingly. We might see a change of tack in both his external communication strategy as also in his welfare programmes. The former might actually start in an institutionalised way, while the latter might get more geo-targeted and geared towards shorter-term gains. Modi would have realised by now that public memory is short and patience even shorter.
5) BJP president Amit Shah, who got his big promotion thanks to UP, just got an ice-bucket poured on him. He needs to take saffron hardliners like Yogi Adityanath, BJP's star campaigner, off the field. He also needs to realise that 'love jihad' can never replace development as a campaign premise. After Tuesday's drubbing he will be under tremendous pressure: Internally, there will be barbs coming in from the way-laid 'seniors' of the party, externally his political invincibility will be questioned nationwide.
6) Echoes of these bypoll results will be heard in both Haryana and Maharashtra, going to the hustings in October. For the Congress in Haryana, there couldn't have been a better timing. And, in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena will now be able to resist their ally-turned-bully a bit more effectively by exploiting its near-desperation to win the assembly polls.
7) Assembly elections will be held in UP in 2017. That may be still some way off, but Tuesday's results will re-energise the grassroot SP worker who had almost come to believe that end was nigh. Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, often regarded as being helpless and a stooge in the hands of his father and uncles, might gain some strength and use it to beat his government to shape. You might actually see a more independent and aggressive Akhilesh now, and the Samajwadi Party claiming more of the Opposition space even nationally.
8) Finally, where does all this leave Mayawati? By deciding not to contest the by-elections, she has pushed herself into political oblivion as of now. To come back from there she will need a partner in 2017. Is the Congress listening?

Andhra Pradesh: Chandrababu Naidu-led government completes 100 days6

Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu who completed 100 days in office on Tuesday said that he would "not celebrate" the occasion. "I am not celebrating (the first) 100 days in office. My only objective is to take the crisis-ridden state forward towards the path of development," he said at a function in Hyderabad.
At the event, he released a booklet brought out by the AP State Information and Public Relations Department to commemorate the government's first 100 days in office.
In his foreword, Naidu said, "We have completed 100 days in government. During these crucial days, we have striven hard to formulate policies for our state. We realise that every step of ours is going to lay a strong foundation in scripting the future of our sunrise country".
The no-nonsense CM, however, said that he will not be celebrating the event as he has much to do for the state.
#chandrababu naidu #andhra pradesh #telangana #tdp
Chandrababu Naidu assumed office as Chief Minister of (residual) Andhra Pradesh on June 8 this year, which is his third stint after his first stint as chief minister between 1995 and 1999 and his second term from 1999 to 2004.
Placing Andhra Pradesh among the top three states in the country by the year 2022 and making it the number one state by 2029 are declared objectives of the TDP-BJP government.

Ahmedabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited his hometown Ahmedabad on Tuesday, a day ahead of the Chinese President, Xi Jinping's visit to Gujarat. This is Modi's first visit to the state since taking over as Prime Minister. Jinping visits Gujarat on Wednesday, also Modi's birthday.
In Ahmedabad, Modi addressed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and thanked them all for their support.
"It's been a long time since I've had the fortune to be among all of you. No honour matches the feeling of your own people respecting you. Such honour brings tears to my eyes. I am in the land where I grew up among the people with whom I worked for years. My experience in Gujarat and learning from all of you is really helpful to me in Delhi," Modi said.

Bazaz s Kashmir premonition came true hours laterSep 16, 2014 at  05:18pm IST
Srinagar resident's premonition about floods came true hours later

0
Srinagar: Tawheed Bazaz, 35, a resident of Srinagar, had a premonition that the flood waters which had inundated the city centre, Lal Chowk, early last Sunday, would also reach their Mandir Bagh locality. "It came true just hours later as the muddy flood waters made their first appearance in our locality that evening after having inundated the posh areas of the capital," Tawheed said.
As the family sat for dinner, he told his father and mother that they must all move out before it was too late as water had begun entering the locality.
Even Bazaz's neighbours had advised them to shift to the nearby bakery building. However, Tawheed's father advised his son to stay calm and not to press the panic button. "Flood waters have never entered our area. I have lived here all my life."
Tawheed Bazaz, 35, a resident of Jammu, had a premonition that the flood waters which had inundated the city centre, Lal Chowk, early last Sunday, would also reach their Mandir Bagh locality.
#tawheed bazaz #jammu and kashmir floods #kashmir floods #death
"Late that evening I again went out and this time the water level was going up fast. I rushed in and took my father and mother upstairs. I thought we will be safe on the first floor.
"Suddenly there was a frightening thud and as I opened the window to see what had happened, I saw gushing flood waters entering our front yard and in no time inundated our first floor. The water level continued to rise menacingly and finally we decided to take shelter in the attic. I thought we were safe now," Tawheed said.
"We were awake whole night and thought our story will be over with few more feet of water. I was really concerned about my parents. My wife and children had gone to my in-laws home in (uptown) Rawalpora three days back.
"My wife was worried and because of the breakdown of the telecommunication links we couldn't talk. I got few calls from my friends that night who told me that the posh localities of Rajbagh, Jawahar Nagar, Gogjibagh, Wazir Bagh, Lal Chowk, Maisuma and adjoining areas had all been inundated and that thousands were marooned. This added to our tensions.
"I watched dreadfully. Our ordeal had begun with daybreak as no help was in sight."
Tawheed says that a bit of complacency did them in as never in living memory had the Jhelum breached its embankments and caused a flood situation in their locality near Lal Chowk.
"I started thinking of how to get to the bakery shop where most of our neighbours had taken shelter as the walls of our house started to develop cracks. An idea struck my mind and I started collecting timber planks lying in our attic. We had a big rope and I and my father started tying them to prepare a raft. We sat over it and moved out. Luckily we got inside a neighbours home and through a window we were inside the high rise and concrete bakery building.
"I heaved a sigh of relief as we joined our neighbours," he added. His wife Rehana, 34, a government teacher, in the meanwhile contacted some friends and relatives to arrange a rescue boat. "However, her efforts couldn't bear fruit."
"Local volunteers moved in our area and they brought in bottled water and food into the bakery building for us. We survived and finally my wife arranged a boat after a gap of six days and we all were rescued."
Then, there is the case of Khalida, 58, who had to virtually fight to get her mother, brother and his wife rescued from the posh Rajbagh locality. "They were on the third floor. I contacted everyone in the administration and pleaded that my mother, a diabetic patient needs evacuation. Thank God they were safe and were rescued after five long days," Khalida told IANS at the Rawalpora relief camp.
"I visited all the relief centres set up by the locals wading through the flood waters, thinking they may have been rescued."
While Tawheed and others survived and were rescued there are still hundreds others who are stranded in their homes in the worst affected localities of capital Srinagar. Rescue teams have not yet been able to reach them. Scores of families are without water and food in the Bemina, Batmallo, Mehjoor Nagar and other localities, were the water levels are still high.
While the state administration virtually collapsed in the aftermath of the catastrophic floods, the army, air force and National Disaster Rescue Force (NDRF) teams rose to the occasion.
The tireless efforts of the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and teams of NDRF have not gone unappreciated.
Because of their efforts so far over 234,000 people have been rescued from different parts of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a defence spokesman.
"Eighty transport aircraft and helicopters of Indian Air Force and Army Aviation Corps are continuing their efforts in rescue and relief operations. The army has deployed around 30,000 troops for rescue and relief operations in the flood-affected area.
"So far, 2,451 sorties were undertaken by the helicopters and aircraft of armed forces and 3,435 tonnes of relief material has been dropped by the Indian Air Force. A total of 224 boats of Army and 148 NDRF inflatable boats are actively involved in the rescue operation," the spokesman said.
It was not only the capital city that bore the brunt of the floods, south Kashmir districts in Kashmir valley and the twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri too were badly hit by the incessant rains.
"No one came to rescue us. They were busy in the posh areas of the capital city rescuing people. The administration should concentrate on other areas too as people are in dire need of safe drinking water and eatables," said Abdul Rashid a resident of Mehjoor Nagar.
"Our house has collapsed now due to the floods. We have nowhere to go," Tawheed said. He is very frightful of another challenge of nature, the fast approaching winter.
"They are promising us the moon, but I doubt the relief will reach the poor. The influential people will get the promised relief, but the same reaching the poor and people without connection is doubtful with uncontrolled corruption in the government having already touched the peak," said Maqsood Ahmad, a resident of flood hit Rambagh area

Why some Facebook users spy on their lovers' online activity

New York: Look closely at your partner's recent Facebook behaviour to find out if he is spying on you. According to a new study, some young lovers are increasingly monitoring their partners and boast about their relationships on the social networking site.
"Facebook users in romantic relationships are more likely to use the social networking site to post photos and affectionate comments on their partner's wall," said researchers from the Pennsylvania-based Albright College.
Neurotics are more likely to use Facebook to monitor their partner and to brag about their relationship, they found.

During the study, the team analysed users with romantic relationships about their Facebook behaviours and motivations.
The participants were measured against personality traits like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.
"Individuals high in Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem (RCSE) -- an unhealthy form of self-esteem that depends on the outcome of one's relationship status -- are more likely to engage in such activities," explained Gwendolyn Seidman, an assistant professor of psychology at the Albright College.
These people face a big blow to their self-esteem than those with lower levels of RCSE, he added.
A neurotic person uses the social networking site to reduce their fears of rejection and anxiety within the relationship, the study concluded.

Real estate sector should improve transparency through self-regulation‘Real estate sector should improve transparency through self-regulation’
V. Sajeev Kumar
Tweet
Kochi, Sept 16:  
Anurag Jhanwar, Director, Real Estate Ratings, CRISIL, has stressed the need for enhanced transparency in the real estate sector, which can be achieved through self-regulation by developers.
“The good news is that we are now seeing developers coming forth and embracing this concept by opening themselves up to third-party evaluation, a positive sign indicating dedication towards customer-centricity and professionalism,” he said.
He was here to announce the CRISIL 7-star rating to Asset Kasavu, the villa project developed by the Kochi-based Asset Homes at nearby Kalamassery. It is the first villa project in South India to receive the CRISIL rating.
To a question, he said efforts taken by the Narendra Modi Government for the sector were in the ‘right direction’. However, it would take some time to get the desired results. The announcements made in the Union Budget would definitely boost the sector, he added.
According to Jhanwar, CRISIL Real Estate Star Ratings provide a city-specific all-round assessment of real estate projects and help buyers benchmark and identify quality projects within their cities. The key factors evaluated in the star ratings process are the quality of legal documentation, construction related risks, financial flexibility/ viability of the project, innovative attributes of the project, besides the background and track record of the project sponsor.
V. Sunil Kumar, Managing Director, and Anil Varma, Executive Director, also announced the launch of seven new projects as part of the company’s 7th anniversary celebrations across seven locations in Kerala.
The company will be organising a Mehfil in Dubai featuring ghazal maestro Pankaj Udhas in connection with the seven new project launches.

BHEL to accelerate UP thermal power projectsWill complete thermal projects in time: BHEL to UP govt
Virendra Singh Rawat | Lucknow Sep 16, 2014 08:50 PM IST
State-run engineering and power equipment enterprise Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) on Tuesday assured the Uttar Pradesh government of meeting timelines on the various thermal power projects in the state.
BHEL is currently working on commissioning several Greenfield projects apart from the repair of existing units. BHEL Chairman and Managing Director B P Rao met state Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan here to discuss such projects.
The Navratna enterprise is working on commissioning unit one and two of Anpara D project (2X500 MW) before April and June 2015, respectively.
Besides, it has undertaken repairing of several units of Obra and Harduaganj thermal power projects. Two units of these projects are likely to be ready by November 2014.
Two other units of Obra would be completed by May and August 2015, respectively, Rao said.
BHEL would assist Uttar Pradesh state power generation utility, Utpadan Nigam, in improving the performance of four units of 250 Mw each, commissioned in the last two years in Harduaganj and Parichha.
Utpadan Nigam and BHEL have agreed to iron out outstanding issues related to payments and work progress so that projects are completed according to stipulated schedule.
On Monday, Jaypee Group paid Rs 589 crore to BHEL against dues related to the 3X660 megawatts Bara thermal power project in Allahabad. Jaypee venture Prayagraj Power Generation Co is completing the project.
In fact, BHEL had stopped work on the project over pending payments. Rao said the company would restart the work after issuing revised project and cost schedules.
 
BHEL has further promised to complete unit of the 3X660 mw Lalitpur thermal power project by March 2015, but sought timely payments from the government.
UP is trying to augment its power generation capacity manifold to tide over yawning power availability and supply gap.

India-China relations go beyond plain arithmetic : Narendra ModiPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:37 pm
As Chinese President Xi Jinping embarks on a landmark visit to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the relationship between the two countries goes beyond “plain arithmetic” and he was confident that the neighbours can “script history” by enhancing cooperation.
Reflecting the importance India attaches to the visit, Modi said India and China have a “unique chemistry” that can make for a defining moment and create a bright future for the entire mankind.
He summarised the possibilities of the bilateral ties moving ahead as ‘Inch’ meaning India and China towards Miles — Millennium of Exceptional Synergy — and said every inch both cover can “rewrite history” of humanity and every mile crossed will go a long way in making the planet a better place.
“India and China are bound by history, connected by culture, and inspired by rich traditions. Together they can create a bright future for the entire mankind,” Modi told Chinese journalists based here.
Elaborating on the nature of the relationship, he said, “The arithmetic and chemistry of our relations convince me that together we can script history and create a better tomorrow for all of mankind.”
Xi will arrive at Ahmedabad on Wednesday on a three-day visit to India which will be the third by any Chinese president to India. President Hu Jintao had visited India in 2006 and Jiang Zemin had come here in 1996.
Referring to the large population base of India and China, Modi said that when India and China gain, almost 35 per cent of the world’s population benefits.
He said when India and China strengthen relations, almost 35 per cent of the world’s people come closer and when the economic cooperation increases, lives of almost 35 per cent of the world’s population undergoes qualitative changes.
Modi hoped that India and China together cover several miles and said several miles that take not only the two nations forward but also all of Asia and humankind towards the path of progress and harmony.
Modi and Xi will hold talks on two occasions — first when the Prime Minister will host a private dinner for the visiting dignitary after his arrival in Ahmedabad on September 17 and then in New Delhi on September 18 in restricted and delegation-level format.
India and China are bound by history, connected by culture, and inspired by rich traditions. Together they can create a bright future for the entire mankind.

Major blow to BJP in bypolls  worst hit in UP; Congress gains ground in Rajasthan  GujaratPrint

Four months after its stunning victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP suffered a setback in the assembly bypolls on Thursday, losing 13 of the 23 seats held by it in Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan and Gujarat . The only solace for the BJP came from West Bengal, where it won the Basirhat seat.
The results come close on the heels of the party’s disappointing performance in the assembly bypolls in Bihar, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the last two months.
However, even as opposition parties termed the BJP’s setback as a reality check for its “acche din” slogan, the party was quick to shield Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government from any negative impact of the results.
Counting for bypolls in three Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly seats across 10 states began on Tuesday morning.
But while the party officially blamed “local factors” for the defeats in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, there was a grudging though muted acknowledgment that its losses could be due to “failure” of the Modi government to show immediate results, as promised during the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.
“We promised the voters the moon during the Lok Sabha campaign. People thought everything would change overnight. But unfortunately, things were so bad that the change is still not very visible. Moreover, in bypolls, local factors overshadow national factors,” said a BJP leader.
The same leader admitted that the results could impact the party’s bargaining power vis-a-vis the Shiv Sena for the coming Maharashtra Assembly elections, where the longstanding alliance between the two parties is under strain due to differences over seat-sharing.

In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP lost seven of the 10 seats held by it as well as one belonging to its ally Apna Dal to the ruling Samajwadi Party.
In Rajasthan, it conceded three of four seats to the Congress, while in Gujarat, it lost another three seats to the Congress.

Equally crushing was the defeat in Rajasthan where BJP conceded three of the four seats to Congress, which also managed to wrest three of the nine seats in Gujarat, where the elections were held for the first time in 12 years sans Narendra Modi.

“The results in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are not up to our expectations. We will sit with the state leaders and do a seat-by-seat analysis to see what went wrong. But the bypoll results do not bring any change in the national scenario,” said Srikant Sharma, BJP’s national media convenor. However, he admitted that there have been “some issues” and the organisation could not transform the work done by the Modi government into votes in some states.

Privately, BJP leaders admitted that its high-pitch campaign, highlighted by the provocative remarks on “love jihad” which were apparently aimed at communal polarisation, backfired on the party. “It is true that the party failed to rein in those leaders by sending strong signals, the top leadership should have issued strong statements against it,” admitted a party leader. “Although we have much to talk about with regard to the 100 days in power, the first message on inflation falling came out yesterday,” he added.
“This is not what we have been expecting, but this was not a test on the central government’s performance. It will take time to reflect the good work done by the government in elections. Many leaders have gone to the government and are focusing on governance, while the party is also in the process of restructuring… It is true that we should have consolidated our organisational strength,” said BJP general secretary Murlidhar Rao.
In Rajasthan, BJP leaders admitted that although Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has been “doing good work”, she has failed to take everyone along. “The state leaders complain that she tries to run a one-woman show and does not take the state unit into confidence, whereas Congress leaders worked silently. Leaders should realise that arrogance will not be tolerated by party workers or the voters,” said a BJP leader.
Although no leader was ready to admit that the bypoll results are a reflection on the Modi government’s performance or party president Amit Shah’s leadership skills, a party general secretary admitted that it would “look bad on Amit Shah’s leadership”.
Since Shah, who was credited for BJP’s spectacular victory in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections, took over the party leadership in July, the BJP has lost the bypolls in three seats in Uttarakhand, and the NDA was defeated in 13 of the 18 seats in Bihar. “The behaviour of the party president has been over-centralising. He has failed to take along the people, including his own team in any capacity. There is lot of resentment inside the party,” said a senior national office bearer.

A section of leaders said while the delay in allocating charge to his team created confusion, Shah’s decision to drop young leaders like Varun Gandhi from the national team upset many of his followers in Uttar Pradesh — a factor that worked against the BJP candidates in these constituencies.
BJP MPs also blamed the party’s electoral setback in Uttar Pradesh on the alleged misuse of government machinery by the Samajwadi Party government in the state, their money and muscle power and even free distribution of alcohol.
However, party MP from Moradabad, Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar, said the party suffered defeat because of the unwise distribution of tickets. “Rajnath Singh and Kalyan Singh know Uttar Pradesh like the palms of their hand. But they did not have any role in deciding the candidates,” he said. Thakurwara, where BJP lost to SP’s Navab Jan, falls under Moradabad Lok Sabha constituency.
Yogi Adityanath, the BJP’s star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, also blamed ticket distribution. “There has to be an analysis of how tickets were distributed, he said.
Bhartendra Singh, MP from Bijnor — the BJP lost the Bijnor assembly seat also — admitted that the party did not have “vibrant, progressive and young leaders” in the state. “We have different groups and lobbies within the party, which is a part of any democratic political party. We do not have a face that reflects the aspirations of the people and appeals to the youth. We should have a progressive, attractive, young leader in Uttar Pradesh and that leader should be given time,” said Singh.
Anupriya Patel, leader of Apna Dal, a constituent of the NDA, blamed the SP’s “money and muscle power” for the defeat of her mother and party chief Krishna Patel’s in Rohaniya. The BJP was backing Apna Dal candidate in Rohaniya, a seat left vacant by Anupriya.

Kerala submits affidavit justifying its right to formulate new liquor policyThe decision to allow liquor license to five-star hotels was considering the interest of the tourism industry.
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:17 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 5:24 pm
Kerala government on Tuesday submitted an affidavit in a single bench of the high court, justifying its right to formulate a new liquor policy which envisages closure of all bars in the non-five-star categories.
While hearing a bunch of petitions from bar hotel owners in Kerala, the Supreme Court had asked the state government to furnish its affidavit in the high court, which was directed to hear all petitions pertaining to the liquor license of hotels owners. Last week, the SC had stayed the closure of all bars in the non-five-start category, until September 30.
The affidavit said the government has the right to frame its liquor policy and the new one was aimed at bringing down alcohol consumption in a phased manner.  The government has right to revoke the liquor license issued to bar hotel owners in tune with its new liquor policy provided they were served with mandatory notice.
It said the government has the right to either monopolize the liquor business or go for complete prohibition. A few outlets of the state-owned Beverages Corporation were also slated for closure and it was not practical to close down all outlets at one stretch. The decision to allow liquor license to five-star hotels was considering the interest of the tourism industry.
The court would consider the petitions on September 18. Last week, the  Supreme Court had questioned the logic of allowing bars in five-star hotels.

Nothing personal against Singh: former CAG V...PM gets acclaim & blame; nothing personal against Manmohan Singh: Former CAG Vinod Rai
PTI Sep 16, 2014, 05.17PM IST
("The Prime Minister is the…)
NEW DELHI: With his new book creating a major controversy, former CAG Vinod Rai today said he has nothing personal against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but all the "acclaim and the blame" has to be taken by the head of the government.
Rai's remarks about the alleged inaction of the former Prime Minister during various scams have generated sharp reactions from Congress party leaders, while other political parties have used his observations to hit back at the previous UPA regime.
The former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said that Singh should also get credit for taking prompt action with regard to ordering of coal block auction, after certain irregularities were brought to his notice.
"The Prime Minister is the head of the government and he may not have any role in the decisions which some of them, like Commonwealth Games he was not directly responsible for any thing.
"But ultimately the acclaim and the blame, both have to be taken by the head of the institution. In that respect, I have brought it out and nothing personal," Rai told PTI in an interview.
"It is certainly not to do with an individual," he said. Giving an example, the former CAG said, "Our Indian team went to England to play cricket and in all the Test matches we performed very poorly.
"Didn't the blame of it come to very large measure on the captain of the team? May be a large number of players did not function or play properly, but the blame had to be taken by the captain."
Rai further said: "If I am the CAG today and if something goes wrong in my organisation, even if I did not have a role to play in it, the responsibility revolves around me.
"I give you the classic example that six, eight months back, when Navy had some accidents, the chief resigned on moral responsibility but he did not have any role to play in those accidents but the responsibility revolved around him," he said.
Rai's new book, 'The Diary of the Nation's Conscience Keeper -- Not Just an Accountant', talks about various issues observed during his 2008-2013 tenure as CAG, including on Singh's role at times like 2G and coal block allocations.
Reacting to Rai's observations, Singh said on Sunday, "I, indeed, did my duty. Well, I do not want to comment on other people what they have written."
Asked for his comments on this, Rai told PTI, "That was his way of interpreting duty and it is perfectly fine because no two individuals would react similarly in a particular situation. If you were sitting on that seat, you would have had a different interpretation. That is perfectly natural."

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki India, the country's largest car maker, today announced its second plant at Manesar in Haryana has crossed the 25 lakh cumulative production milestone this month.
"The Manesar facility achieved the 25 lakh production milestone in 7 years and 8 months," Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Plants) Rajiv Gandhi said in a statement.
The plant manufactures some of the top selling models like Swift, DZire and now Celerio . This milestone would be the fastest for any car manufacturing plant in the country, he added.
Spread over 600 acres, the Manesar facility houses three units, Manesar A, B and C with total annual capacity of 8,00,000 vehicles. In addition, the Manesar campus also has the diesel engine plant and a suppliers park.
A grey Swift Zxi was the 2.5 millionth vehicle that rolled out from the Manesar B Line.
Highlighting the role of employees in reaching the milestone, Gandhi said: "While we achieve the milestone, we have successfully implemented several ideas from the employees on the important production pillars of productivity, cost, quality and safety."
Early this year, Maruti Suzuki had also commissioned a 1-MW solar power plant inside the Manesar facility set up at an investment of Rs 10.3 crore.
The company's twin facilities at Gurgaon and Manesar have together rolled out over 14 million vehicles cumulatively.

Expect gold prices to trade negative: Sushil Finance

Sushil Finance's report on Gold
Gold
Gold rose on Monday after weak Chinese factory data, but the precious metal hovered just above an eight-month low as investors worried that the Federal Reserve may start hinting at plans to raise U.S. interest rates sooner than expected.
Gold prices fell early in the session, but bounced as the S&P 500 equities index edged lower after data showed China's factory output grew in August at the weakest pace in nearly six years.
Growth in other sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may risk a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures
Investors will watch the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as it starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Some believe the Fed could signal that it may begin raising rates sooner than mid-2015, the current target for many economists.
Outlook
We expect gold prices to trade on the negative note plans to raise U.S. interest rates sooner than expected and expectations for a stronger U.S. currency in the longer run likely to keep Bullion market under pressure.

Is a home affordable at Rs 35 lakhLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3
Is a home affordable at Rs 35 lakh?
The affordable housing challenge definitely can be conquered and is well within our reach. The only key factor is teamwork between each entity involved in creating an environment to enable the success of affordable housing in India.
Post your opinion here
Vinit Deo
Posiview Consulting
The challenge lies in the concept itself. Is a home affordable at Rs 35 lakh? Rs 20 lakh? Rs 5 lakh? The term will be defined and understood differently by each of the stakeholders involved in our Indian affordable housing challenge. The concept of affordable housing has been discussed, debated, and deliberated immensely, and now, its time to get our hands dirty and get to work. It is important to realize the aspects that can enable the affordable housing dream in India. And it is not the job of one stakeholder alone, but in fact, a team effort to make headway in providing the 26 million affordable homes needed for the urban poor in our country. It cannot rest on the shoulders of the Government alone, but needs proactive involvement from the real estate developers and financial support from the banking and finance industry. It’s a challenge that can only be won by India together, and not in isolation.
Developers will need to play their part in the affordable housing challenge, and their success rests on innovation. As curtailing costs of construction, labor, administration, etc. come with their own set of limitations, the industry will need to explore newer methods to reduce costs. This is not impossible and has been proven successful by more than a few affordable housing brands in the country today. The developers need to employ innovative techniques in construction of affordable housing, while ensuring the quality of the construction. Today along with the brands such as Vastushodh, Maple, and VBHC, major corporate groups are venturing in this space such as Tata Housing, Mahindra Lifespaces, and TVS. The focus for each of these and other new entrants into this sector has to be on innovation in construction with an aim to lower costs and maintain quality. This needs to be a major contribution proactively made by the Indian real estate industry to conquer this national challenge.
It is not the developers alone as one of the major needs of this sector is capital. The banking and finance sector will need to play an important role in addressing this national challenge. Affordable housing requires a steady flow of capital for its successful implementation, and the banking and finance sector needs to support the industry and home buyers with customized financial instruments and terms to provide an extra boost to this sector. There needs to a robust re-finance scheme for construction of affordable housing projects along with other capital-intensive methods. These need to be made available on pan-India level for a large impact to this segment. From the affordable housing consumer point of view, the budget has already made an allotment of Rs 4000 Cr for low cost housing to the National Housing Bank (NHB). A process of identifying the right consumers truly in need of this finance will be an additional responsibility of the sector to ensure the funds go in the right pockets. The BFSI segment will play an integral role in conquering this affordable housing challenge.
The most important role will need to be Government support and intervention to create an affordable housing environment conducive for success. Inevitably, land takes up the largest chunk of cost in any real estate project. India as a geography has no shortage of developable area; its just that we do not have adequate infrastructure to support the extended areas in thr outskirts of the cities and beyond. The policies of the new Government in areas like Industrial Corridors, Smart Cities, building new Habitats, Rurban mission will bring more areas in the fold of development. These will enable the industry to offer homes at truly ‘affordable and accessible’ price levels. The second responsibility of the Government, in an industry where time truly means money, is to ensure faster approvals for affordable housing projects. Timely approval processes can save huge costs to the developer, which can be passed down to the homebuyer. A synchronization of private and public thought and approach is indispensable to the success of winning this challenge.
The affordable housing challenge definitely can be conquered and is well within our reach. The only key factor is teamwork between each entity involved in creating an environment to enable the success of affordable housing in India. It is the true partnership between developing, funding, and administrating that will ensure success. Bridging the gap between the demand of affordable homes and the supply is true progress for India, and if we stick together, the Indian affordable housing dream can be achieved.

Buy GSFC; target of Rs 140: Emkay
Brokerage house Emkay Global Financial Services is bullish on Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC) and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 140 in its September 12, 2014 research report.
Post your opinion here
Emkay's research report on  Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC)
"Company’s fertilizer business has suffered from higher inventory and poor availability of raw material in FY14 (segment revenues dropped by 27% yoy to Rs 31bn and EBIT dropped by 47% to Rs 2bn) however the same has improved in current year. Complex fertilizer sales volumes are expected to improve by ~25% to 1.4 mn mt in FY15 and further to 1.8mn mt by FY16. Supply of phos acid from its TIFERT venture (a JV between GSFC, Coromandel and GCT at Tunisia) will increase raw material availability. Management expects EBIDTA margin in complex fertilizer to increase to Rs 2500/mt vs Rs 2000/mt seen in previous year driven by price increase taken by the company to compensate for expected increase in gas price.
"Company aims to achieve revenues of Rs 150bn over next five years driven by ongoing capex which includes increase in complex fertilizer capacity and commissioning of Nylon and Melamine plant. Current valuations are lucrative at 25% discount to book value and 6.3xFY16 estimated EPS. Company’s strong investment value of ~Rs 8bn and significant investment in working capital at net current assets of Rs 21bn (with recovery of pending subsidy from the from government) and net debt of Rs 4.5bn makes the company more lucrative. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with revised price target of Rs 140 based on 6xFY16 EV/EBIDTA", says Emkay Global Financial Services research.

Aurobindo gets USFDA approval for anti-infection drugAurobindo gets USFDA approval for anti-infection drug

Bosch workmen on strike over wage renewalBosch workers in Bangalore on strike
BS Reporter | Bangalore Sep 17, 2014 12:42 AM IST
Production has stopped at the main manufacturing unit in Bangalore of Bosch, largest supplier of automotive components to original equipment makers, after a strike begun by employees on Tuesday. Around 2,600 employees (including 350 temporary workers) affiliated to the MICO Employees Association, the official trade union, said they were on strike from the first shift.
They want a rise in pay and other benefits like more of medical facilities and hospitalisation expense reimbursement. The rise they want in their monthly salaries is about Rs 20,000.  A pay rise is done once every four years and the management is yet to announce a rise for the four years starting January 2013.
Bosch has four manufacturing plants in the country at Bangalore, Naganathapura, Nashik and Jaipur. However, the management concluded wage negotiation at its Nashik plant in April this year. In other three plants, the wage talks are still continuing.
Even though the workers union had served a strike notice two weeks ago, the management has termed it as illegal. ?We have termed the strike illegal because the matter is under negotiation in the presence of labour commissioner. When the negotiations are going on, the Union cannot go on strike,? a company spokesperson said.
The Management is in discussion with the Union to restore normalcy at the earliest with the intervention of the Additional Labour Commissioner, Karnataka, the company said in a filing to Bombay Stock Exchange.
This is the second such strike at Bosch's Bangalore plant in the last 18 months. In March 2013, the employees had gone on strike to protest against suspension of an employee by the management.
"We have not reported for duty from the start of first shift this morning. However, the management is continuing with the strike with the help of trainees and management staff," a member of MEA said.
The company is prepared to meet the market demands as it has stocked a huge inventory in case if the strike prolongs for a longer period, he said.
The current Cost to Company (CTC) offered to a workman in Bangalore plant is Rs 65,000 and after negotiations, the company is willing to offer an increase of Rs 17,000. The Union is asking for much higher amount. The Union has also demanded for walk-in/walk-out medical benefits, Bosch spokespersons said.
"Over a period of 20 months, 36 negotiation meetings have been held. During this negotiation process, the Management put forth its best offer for the Union's consideration, but hasn't been able to reach an agreement due to their unreasonable demands," he said.
The Government is supporting a conciliation process through the Additional Labour Commisioner's (AdLC) office. "The company urges its workmen and union to acknowledge the current business situation and resolve this issue amicably through dialogue and cooperation," he added.
Earlier, in September and October 2011, the workers had launched a 16-day 'tool-down' strike to protest the company's move to outsource certain jobs, thereby causing a production loss of close to Rs 100 crore. Before that, in March 2011, production was affected at the plant for a couple of days over the demand for a wage hike, an issue, which was settled amicably after Labour Commissioner, intervened.

Why archaic citizenship laws must go
Anil Malhotra
The Hindu It is time Parliament reconciles the concept of freedom, personal liberty and natural justice with the determination of nationality.

Colonial-era laws infringe on the fundamental rights to life and personal liberty of persons of Indian origin
A debate on the need to repeal obsolete laws has been set in motion in India with the government appointing a committee to look into the matter. Even our erstwhile coloniser, Great Britain, initiated the process of repealing 38 such laws last year, which were passed between the years 1849 and 1942, pertaining to the construction and maintenance of the Indian Railways. Meanwhile, our own post-independence efforts to weed out obsolete laws, through a process of spring cleaning, remain pending.
An area that requires immediate attention in this regard is conflicting laws regulating citizenship. Take for instance the colonial-era laws, The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, and The Foreigners Act, 1946. Even though Parliament has since enacted The Passports Act, 1967, The Citizenship Act, 1955, and created the Overseas Citizenship of India scheme in 2005, we continue to rely on these archaic pieces of legislation. Most of these laws enacted during colonial rule are redundant and do not stand the test of the principles of natural justice. They also confer unfettered, arbitrary and draconian powers on government authorities and need to be taken off the statute book.
Read: What is dual citizenship
A comprehensive law
The Passports Act, 1967, is a comprehensive law relating to the issue of passports and travel documents. It provides statutory safeguards in procedures involving the variation, impounding and revocation of passports, with rights of appeal to aggrieved persons with regards to offences and penalties levied under this Act. However, the simultaneous existence of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and The Foreigners Act, 1946, conferring absolute and unlimited powers to remove or summarily deport a person from India without following the due process of law, are anathema to a democratic country and an anti-thesis to the rule of law. Powers of house arrest, detention, solitary confinement and summary removal from India under these Acts clearly infringe upon the fundamental rights of life and personal liberty guaranteed under the Constitution. Therefore, these British-era laws are completely misplaced in this day and age.
The Central government has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a person, who was a citizen of India, has lost that citizenship by having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a “foreign State” as per Section 9(2) of The Citizenship Act, 1955, read with Rule 30 of The Citizenship Rules, 1956. Further, under Section 9(2) and Rule 30 above, mere proof of the fact that the person has obtained a passport from a foreign country is not sufficient to sustain an order for deportation or prosecution unless there has been a decision by the Central government under Section 9(2) of the Act. Moreover, the enquiry by the Central government under Section 9(2) of the Act is a quasi-judicial enquiry. This proposition of law is well settled by the following judgments of the Supreme Court : State of A.P. vs. Abdul Khader AIR (1961) SC 1467; Government of A.P. vs. Syed Md. AIR (1962) SC 1778 and State of U.P. vs. Rehmatullah AIR (1971) SC 1382. Thus, this process of determination of nationality is well settled in law.
With an estimated 21,90,9875 non-resident Indians spread across over 200 countries (Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs statistics), there have been compromises in the area of dual nationality, which is otherwise prohibited under Article (9) of the Constitution and Section (9) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. The categories — “Persons of Indian Origin” (PIO) and “Overseas Citizen of India” (OCI) — were carved out to confer limited benefits on persons of Indian origin. Therefore, PIOs and OCIs now enjoy limited rights in India and can enjoy residence rights here without any visa, registration, sanction or other permissions. Moreover, under Article (5), every person who is domiciled, born or whose parents were born in India, or who has been ordinarily resident in India for not less than five years preceding the commencement of the Constitution, shall be a citizen of India. Hence, inherent rights flow to those whose nationality is determined by law.
Under the 1946 Act, disputes relating to questions of determination of nationality when a foreigner is recognised as a national of more than one country or it is uncertain as to what nationality is to be ascribed to a foreigner, such person may be treated as the national of the country with which he appears to be most closely connected. The 1920 and 1946 Acts permit the removal or the deportation of a person from India without providing any forum or procedure for determination of the question of the nationality of the foreigner or giving any statutory rights in this process. There are no tribunals available to determine these questions as of now. However, the Citizenship Act, 1955, and the Citizenship Rules, 2009, prescribe that if any question arises as to whether, when or how any person had acquired the citizenship of another country, the Central government shall first determine such questions. The Supreme Court interpreting these provisions has held that a person could not be ordered to be deported or removed from India unless the Central government takes a conscious decision upon holding a quasi-judicial enquiry that a person has ceased to be an Indian citizen. A foreign passport simply will not label a person as a foreigner, and determination of his nationality is his fundamental right. It is time Parliament reconciles this concept of freedom, personal liberty and natural justice with the determination of nationality.
Debatable question
Given the social circumstances today when emigration is common, international Indians qualify to be PIOs or OCIs. If they wish to reconnect with their homeland, they should not be categorised as foreigners by invoking the colonial provisions of the 1920 and 1946 Acts. The Citizenship Act, 1955, itself creates harmony. The retention of a foreign passport today cannot lead to deportation and summary removal from India. Why then do we need to retain the colonial enactments which were brought in to regulate the entry of foreigners into India in circumstances prevailing in 1946? This is a serious issue which must be addressed in Parliament.
Today, persons of Indian origin face problems due to marital disputes with spouses of foreign origin or nationality issues arising out of foreign domiciles. The desirable approach, therefore, would be to create appropriate forums or authorities within the legal system that would address such issues by granting opportunities for hearing and redressal. Accordingly, deportation or removal of a person to a foreign jurisdiction would be an abject surrender to a foreign dominion. Having resolved to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic Republic, we in India are capable and competent of adjudicating our nationality issues to provide redressal for persons of Indian origin. Our post-independence laws provide the solutions which our vibrant judiciary interprets to protect fundamental freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. Hence, pre-independence laws in conflict with rights today must be revoked.

Power from the people: what privatisation has meant for BritainSnapshot ‘Come Home at Once’, Bantam Press
I’m 20 years younger than him, but I felt I knew what he meant. Since returning to Britain from Moscow in 1999, after eight years away, I’d come to feel some grand existential alteration had taken place in the country where I grew up.
It was hard to pin down the nature of the process. It wasn’t simply Thatcherism, or globalisation, or neo-liberalism, or consumerism, although these currents fed into it. Nor was it the death of socialism, although socialism as a theory in action was, for sure, pretty much dead. Instead, it seemed to me, to adapt the phrase coined by the Nobel prize-winning writer JM Coetzee in his 1983 novel Life and Times of Michael K, that a meaning had taken up residence in the system without becoming a term in it. I wondered if it had. I wondered whether I might be bold enough to call it.
The perception of change is a treacherous field. Perhaps Craig-Martin and I were merely getting older. I was in the cusp of midlife when the Momart warehouse burned. “Things ain’t what they used to be,” is hardly an insight. Tobias Smollett’s Humphry Clinker had the same anxiety in the 18th century. Was the world, he asks, “always as contemptible as it appears to me at present?”
Smollett has Clinker quote Horace, a reminder that the middle-aged have been moaning about things getting worse for thousands of years. “If the morals of mankind have not contracted an extraordinary degree of depravity within these 30 years,” says Clinker, “then I must be infected with the common vice of old men, difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti [tiresome, complaining, a praiser of past times]; or, which is more probable, the impetuous pursuits and avocations of youth have formerly hindered me from observing those rotten parts of human nature, which now appear offensively to my observation.”
But you can be disappointed in the present without idealising the past. And Craig-Martin had an advantageous perspective. He belonged to two countries – America and his adopted Britain. Of the two, he had seen absolute transformation in only one: Britain. On the surface, the US had changed radically, he told me. But, underneath it was, he said, barely altered. When he visited, it was still the same place it was mid-century, when he was a boy.
What we think of as our perception of change in society tends to be the noticing of differences: things used to be a certain way, now they are another way. Often the difference involves technology – “I haven’t used a typewriter for so long” – or changes in government policy – “Can you believe we used to smoke on planes?”
To put those differences together to attain the cumulative significance of change over decades you have just lived through – a period too distant for journalism, too recent for history – is harder. We noticed when Margaret Thatcher began privatising council houses, and remember when a lot more people lived in council houses than they do now. We notice rocketing house prices, and remember when they were lower. We notice how in London more and more people are sharing smaller and smaller spaces.
These are the differences. But the generational change that encompasses them, since Thatcher, has been a large increase in the population of Britain without a corresponding increase in the number of homes, due to housing market failure and the abdication of responsibility by the state to do anything about it. It is simple but it is not obvious.
. . .
I don’t think it’s coincidence that it was around the time of that conversation with Craig-Martin, when I was hitting my early forties, that I became fascinated by the generational arc of the signature policy of the post-1979 Conservatives, privatisation; the way this extraordinary change wasn’t a set of straightforward, one-off acts – “You’re nationalised, boom, you’re privatised, the end” – but an unfolding series of steps and consequences whose shape is still emerging decades after shares in water or electricity companies first went on the market.
After eight years away, I’d come to feel some grand existential alteration had taken place in Britain
To perceive such shapes you need that much-maligned sixth sense, hindsight. Hindsight, the sense that may generate grumpy old men and sentimental affection for a non-existent past idyll but is also a prerequisite for wisdom, is the only sense we aren’t born with, and the only sense that grows sharper with age.
When you climb a hill out of town, at first you can only see the individual buildings around you. Gradually, as you gain height, it becomes possible to see the entire town. So it is as you climb through the years. It becomes possible to see not just individual events but the shape a series of events makes through time. You remember a wedding, children, rows, holidays, estrangement; eventually, you may perceive the shape of a failed marriage. You remember the privatisation of the railways, annoyances at ticket barriers, accidents, chaos; eventually, with effort, you may perceive the shape of a failed policy.
Not long ago I visited a coal power station at Cottam in Nottinghamshire. It had been privatised in 1991, along with the state organisation that built and ran it, the Central Electricity Generating Board. It was built where it was to be close to the coalfields that fed it. All but one had since closed. The coal I watched streaming in on conveyor belts came from abroad.
None of this was surprising. Margaret Thatcher took on the miners in the mid-1980s and beat them; the plant was privatised more than two decades ago; end of story. It was pretty much over for Britain’s coalminers by the 1990s. Terribly old news, and a bit fresh for the history books.
But when I visited I saw there was something else going on at Cottam – something that mocked the “privatisation” of 1991. The event of privatisation had seemingly occurred but, in fact, new privatisation events were still taking place, and the true shape of electricity privatisation through time was, is, still emerging.
For Cottam had been renationalised, but by the French government not the British. In 2000 it was acquired by the French state concern Electricité de France, which also owns a huge chunk of the rest of Britain’s electricity industry, including all its nuclear plants. There, in Nottinghamshire, all the supposed goals of privatisation – to dismantle state control over industry, to give ordinary Brits a financial stake in its success, to show inefficient, socialistic European state companies how much more successful privatised, entrepreneurial British executives would be – were being defeated, day by day, hour by hour.
. . .
Over the past decade, between writing novels, I’ve poked around in the British privatisation story. I looked at the privatisation of the British postal service, which is far from over, and can’t be separated from the much earlier privatisation of its Dutch equivalent; at the water industry, first privatised then, much later, alienated; at the privatisation of council houses, still trickling on after decades. In doing so, I’ve seen a gap emerge between what privatisation was supposed to be and what it has actually become over time. This suggests the Coetzean missing term for what has happened to Britain since 1979 is an expanded concept of “privatisation”.
The meaning that has taken up residence in the system describes not only privatisations in the narrow sense but subsequent developments such as government outsourcing, the delocalisation of Premier League football and the demutualisation of building societies.
This isn’t privatisation as a narrow financial-political exercise, but privatisation as the dispersal of control over national economies of democracies away from the nations in which they are manifest towards tax havens, multiple jurisdictions, super-rich families and authoritarian states.
Despite Craig-Martin’s perception of changelessness, what is happening in the US now shows how an economy that already seems overwhelmingly in private hands can still experience a form of privatisation. Tax inversion , whereby large, publicly quoted US corporations shape-shift from American firms with an overseas subsidiary to overseas firms with an American subsidiary, doesn’t, on the face of it, appear to have anything to do with privatisation as traditionally understood. Yet by labelling the tax-dodging strategy “unpatriotic”, President Obama and his fellow Democrats have made it clear they believe the American nation still has some transcendental claim over the likes of Burger King, Walgreens and Pfizer.

The rush in 1984 to buy British Telecom shares
With hindsight, it was always likely that, if the government of a country like Britain constantly broadcast an anti-government message – that its own employees were a danger to prosperity, that salvation lay with private enterprise – mere flotation on the stock market couldn’t be the end of privatisation; it would have to go further, be more private, more set apart. Publicly quoted companies must become private equity companies, and private equity companies must become multi-jurisdictional entities, based everywhere and nowhere. That which was supposed to be private with respect to a government becomes private with respect to a people.
Hindsight is of little practical use without its counterpart, foresight. Yet in a way that, too, is being privatised. I interviewed a wealth management expert in London, a woman who specialised in advising extremely rich families how to protect and expand their treasure. I asked her how far ahead a wise family would plan. “A hundred years,” she said.
Not being wealthy enough to have sought her services, this was a revelation. It was one thing to know that the fourth dimension of the economy, the dimension of time, mattered. But this was being dragged to the brink of the well of economic time and obliged to look into its dizzying depths. How, I wondered, could democratic governments, with their rodent-class lifespan of four to seven years, hope to keep up with jurisdiction-hopping billionaire clans shuffling their assets to a century-long schedule? Or, indeed, with the generational strategies of big commercial corporations, or the sovereign wealth funds of authoritarian states like China and Russia?
I asked a wealth management expert how far ahead a wise family would plan. ‘A hundred years,’ she said
The few hundred British politicians who represent the interests of non-billionaires do have help as they flit in and out of power. Civil servants are society’s wealth manager. We pay them to have foresight. But, in the view of Margaret Thatcher’s heirs, society doesn’t need wealth managers; ordinary citizens are served by the free market, individual choice and enlightened self-interest. State-sponsored foresight smacks of central planning, and central planning is a Soviet relic, or worse.
Earlier this year a Conservative minister, Francis Maude, reacted to the “discovery” of an internal Whitehall job spec for mandarins, which pointed out that the long-term concerns of bureaucrats and the short-term wants of politicians were bound to conflict, as if it were the amber light for a putsch.
Tesco is thinking more than five years ahead. So is Electricité de France, and Siemens, and the Chinese government, and Exxon, and Google. They apply the wisdom of hindsight, and they look generations ahead. In the real world, when you strip the state of its duty to make long-term plans, or denigrate the practice, you don’t liberate citizens from planning. You make them subject to the private plans of others.

Marriott International wants to give its housekeepers a raise -- and it is hoping customers will chip in.

Beginning this week, a number of the company's hotels will begin providing envelopes in guest rooms to encourage visitors to tip workers. The initiative, called "The Envelope Please," is a partnership with A Woman's Nation, a nonprofit organization founded by journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver.
@Elliot Foley My dear, what do you think your idea will do for room rates then? That management will absorb the cost? Dream on.

"In conversation with Maria, she said it had struck her that too often women are in positions that we forget to acknowledge," Arne Sorenson, chief executive and president of Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott, said in an interview.
"In a hotel, obviously we tip the bellman or wait staff. But often we don't see our housekeepers," he said. "We don't have that personal interaction, so we just don't think about it."
The American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade association, suggests tipping housekeepers between $1 and $5 per night.
The association recommends leaving the money daily rather than at the end of a stay to ensure that the person cleaning the room each day is the beneficiary.
Housekeepers make up the largest group of employees within hotels managed by Marriott, comprising more than 20,000 positions in the United States and Canada alone. They are paid by the hour, and their schedules tend to vary throughout the year on the basis of hotel occupancy levels.
In 2012, maids and housekeepers earned a median salary of $19,780, or approximately $9.51 per hour, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"We think it's a great idea," John Boardman, executive secretary-treasurer of Unite Here Local 25, said about Marriott's tipping initiative. "It highlights the hard work that housekeepers do every day. We think it's a nice acknowledgment." The local represents workers at more than 30 Washington area hotels.
Even so, only a small fraction of the company's housekeepers belong to labor unions. Less than 10 percent of Marriott's workforce is unionized, according to Sorenson.
Marriott operates 18 brands, including its namesake line of hotels, as well as Ritz-Carlton, Gaylord and Renaissance hotels. The company announced last week that it plans to open 1,300 properties by 2017, taking its total number of hotels to more than 5,000.
Shriver said she got the idea for leaving envelopes in guest rooms after talking to housekeepers — and hotel guests — around the country. She approached Marriott executives with the concept about a year ago.
"I was talking to room attendants, who were overwhelmingly women, and they would tell me that people were pretty sophisticated about tipping the bellman or concierge, but they hadn't been educated that they could leave a tip for a room attendant," Shriver said in an interview. "There didn't seem to be a general awareness that you could, or should, tip a room attendant."

There are few things in life that one can afford to take for granted, but light switches are one of them. All they require is an almost subliminal flicker from the brain and a touch from the finger, and hey presto, there is light.
Yet the latest fashion is for furniture that forbids passivity and forces us to engage with it more actively. Knauf and Brown, a Canadian design company, has come up with a lamp mounted on a wooden stick that sits in an acrylic vase. To turn it on, you have to lift it out of the vase and put it in a giant, low-voltage copper coil, which connects with a flash of copper on the stick, thus completing the circuit and causing the light to work.

To go with this large, unsightly contraption, the duo have designed a matching mirror that you can’t see yourself in – as it is made of suede. It is only when you turn the thing upside down that you get to see your reflection. Similarly, there is an occasional table that you need to tow around with a stick to be able to use at all.
All this hard slog is in the name of mindfulness – the movement that teaches us how to be “in the moment”. Doctors, MPs, and business leaders have seized on it as the answer to the stresses of modern life; it was only going to be a matter of time before furniture designers joined in too. To turn on a light mindfully means being thoroughly caught up in what you are doing – and if the process takes 10 times longer, that’s all to the good.
This idea of objects that clamour for our full attention is also behind a collection designed by a group of students from the Swiss university Ecal. They have come up with a light that you switch on by touching its shadow and a fan that is operated by blowing on it. Both are stylish looking if not terribly practical; yet the judges at the Milan Furniture Fair this year were so turned on and blown away they awarded the collection first prize.
It is all very well in the avant-garde design world. But at home do we really want to be down on all fours with our everyday objects?

Extreme exercise and CEOs
I have some experience of what it means to be in the moment when turning on a light, having recently bought a lamp base in a car boot sale and wired it up myself. Every time I turn it on I’m mindful of how it works; but far from being a good thing, I worry that I may not have connected the wires properly and might be about to electrocute myself.
Equally, I’m entirely in the moment with my kitchen. That is because I have just finished a cosmetic revamp that has gone awry. The new floor is an egg-yolk yellow, which is so overwhelming that I have had to paint the walls grey to tone it down. Every time I walk into the room I am on full alert, thinking does this work?
What I long for instead is something that fosters passivity. I dream of taking my kitchen for granted once more. But is this unmindful? And is it therefore wrong?
Helen Sanderson is a therapist and designer who is an expert on mindful interiors and founded the Ministry of Calm. Encouragingly, she is not especially impressed by the lamp in the copper coil. She says it might be OK for a real mindfulness freak. But for the rest of us, it is better to do things on autopilot, as it frees our minds to do other things.
Yet what about our homes more generally? Is passivity a good thing, or not? I suspect I am calmest and happiest in a house I don’t see at all, which is an irony given the effort I put into making the place look good. It is only when things are wrong that I notice them. Once they are right, I sometimes think “how nice” in the vaguest sort of way, but otherwise I wander about, happily oblivious.
Sanderson replies that houses, like gardens, grow and change and need constant pruning and replanting. You need to tend them every now and then, but not so constantly that you are prevented from getting on with your life. When you have started changing things, you need to finish the revamp to “release your energy”. To get stuck, like I have, is bad. I must finish my revamp and stop thinking about it.
The first thing that grows in houses is dirt, she says. My house, I’m pretty sure, is spotless as the cleaners had just been in. Sanderson glances at my new lamp and suggests I do something about the grey thatch of dust that has collected on the shade. “Do you have a cleaner?” she asks, glancing at a long, dangling cobweb in the corner of the sitting room.
Now that she has drawn my attention to the dust and the cobweb, I urgently want them gone. Yet when I was blind to them, they didn’t matter, which surely proves that dirt is only a problem if you look for it. One of the happiest people I know lives surrounded by filth and half-empty bottles and cans sitting on sticky counters, oblivious to all of it. Sanderson doesn’t agree. Even if you aren’t conscious of dirt, she says, it still subliminally prevents you from being truly calm.
After dirt, the second enemy of mindfulness is clutter. I am with Sanderson on this, although I explain that for me clutter is other people, and they are rather difficult to take to the rubbish tip.
‘Do you have a cleaner?’ she asks, glancing at a dangling cobweb in the corner of the sitting room
A family house is inevitably strewn with children’s discarded shoes and socks, piles of newspapers, empty yoghurt pots and beer cans. Short of throwing my family away, I’ve recently adopted the strategy of confining them to their own little pigsties and keep well clear myself. Sanderson suggests I train the children better instead. It is an excellent point, except that since they are grown up, it’s a bit late for that.
As for the yellow lino, her verdict is polite, if a little implausible. “Yellow is a good colour for eating. It helps with the digestion.” The problem is less the colour itself than my attempt to make it look deliberate by adding yellow cushions, a vase of sunflowers, a big yellow (chipped) fruit bowl. The effect of this on the mind was very uncalming, she explains. “The eye constantly is looking for the other yellow.” So I swept up all offending items and put them in the hall.
Next she set to work on my shelves, removing half the things I’d arranged there: a pretty, lustreware jug with a broken spout; a bowl of wooden fruit; assorted plates; candlesticks.
Another problem is the refrigerator, which is draining my energy by forcing me to walk to the other end of the room whenever I wanted milk for my tea. “Ease is part of calm. Your house must support you,” says Sanderson. The fridge would be better moved out of its corner, but to do that would attract attention to how ugly it is. The answer, she says, is to buy a Smeg. I have always resisted buying one, partly because the name sounds like Smug and because they cost three times as much as normal ones, but I’ll now almost certainly buy one, telling myself it is not an indulgence – I’ve been prescribed one by a therapist.

“We’ve taken the temperature down a bit and created more harmony,” Sanderson says, surveying her handiwork. I look around and even though I don’t feel calm, I do feel pleased – as well as vaguely annoyed that a mindfulness expert can make a better fist of arranging my kitchen in half an hour than I’ve made in a decade.
Yet to have a properly mindful home, a harmonious kitchen won’t do it. What is needed is a special empty space in which to sit quietly and listen to yourself breathe. I suggest a tiny room at the turn of the stairs that used to be my study but I no longer use as, a) I now work in bed or at the kitchen table, and b) it is full of towering piles of unsold and yellowing copies of books I’ve written. Absolutely everything must go, says Sanderson. All I need in there is a cushion. And maybe a candle. And a blind that will diffuse the light.
After she leaves, I go to work at once throwing things away. Never mind mindfulness: having a jolly good chuck out is one of the surest ways of lifting the spirits ever invented. Even though I’m not quite ready to sit on a cushion and breathe, I could always use the empty room as a refuge from the yellow. Though now the kitchen is arranged so nicely I’m on my way to not noticing it at all.

'Find a mentor within the company who resembles the leader you'd like to grow to be.'
Looking back on my own successes and failures as both an employee and employer, there are definitely things I did, didn't do or could have done better.
0
Clearly define what success means for you. Set short-term and quarterly career goals with your manager that will help lead you to your long term goals. It's important to include your manager in this planning so that he or she can help you define those goals, be accountable for them and create a shared vision of success. Make it a habit to check in with your manager on a quarterly basis to review your goals and progress, as well as receive feedback. Even if it's not standard practice for your company to do 360-degree reviews, having your manager or a peer collect 360-degree feedback for you can be an incredibly productive way to receive constructive criticism that will help you understand your strengths and opportunity areas most thoroughly.
Volunteer for mini-leadership roles. Not a manager or an executive yet? It's not too early to practice. Many companies are always looking for people to volunteer to help coordinate happy hours, onboard new employees, or plan the holiday party. All of these will warrant thanks from the leadership team, but more importantly, they serve as opportunities to get cross-functional exposure and practice management and leadership skills.
Be known as a great resource. Are you an Excel genius? An expert on local restaurants? Fabulous at proofreading? Go beyond your job description by being an open resource for others in the company who could benefit from your talents. I believe that paying it forward will serve you well one way or another in the future. Helping people on your team and people on other teams doesn't go unnoticed. Recognizing individuals who go above and beyond is a favorite topic of conversation for our management team and a great way for you to get exposure inside boardroom walls, without breaking down the doors.
Find a friend and a mentor. Find someone within the company who is on another team but is at a similar level or role as you to be a friend, a sounding board and a place to go for candid feedback. Find a mentor within the company who resembles the leader you'd like to grow to be. Be proactive with scheduling monthly or quarterly time to give you advice, feedback and unbiased guidance in your long-term career goals.

'European venture capitalists have had to work in a more capital constrained environment.'
Beneath the low beams of a converted warehouse in Amsterdam lives a company with many of the attributes of a Silicon Valley startup, except that at less than a year old it has zero venture capital and says it is already making enough money to sustain itself.
Fairphone started in 2010 as a campaign against smartphone makers' use of conflict minerals. Last year, after a series of artistic and social protests to highlight what it says are injustices in global supply chains, its founders decided to make and sell phones of their own.
The company has now sold more than 41,000 phones in Europe using African minerals it certifies as "conflict free", and will begin selling in the United States in 2015. Co-founder Bas van Abel, a 37-year old Dutch artist, concedes his company is far from a panacea for the ills of mass-manufacturing, but says it is working to improve conditions for the Chinese workers who assemble the handsets.
"We had to be economically viable because we wanted to be part of the economic system," said Van Abel.
Europe's politicians would like more success stories like Fairphone. In a continent where one in five young people are out of work, governments are pumping more and more cash into startups in the hope they can goose economic growth. Exact numbers are hard to determine, but according to AngelList, a website for new companies, there are now more than 4,700 startups in Europe, compared with nearly 14,000 in the United States.
0
As in North America and Asia, most European tech startups focus on software. In the Netherlands, though, Fairphone and a handful of other firms are trying to change manufacturing. Some are taking the principles of what's known as the sharing economy pioneered by car-poolers like Lyft or room-sharer Airbnb, and applying them to the way things are made. That could reshape not just how people produce things, but how they buy them, and even the economics of intellectual property.
The Dutch focus on manufacturing stems partly from the Netherlands' strong design culture, and the ground-breaking 3D printing community found there and in neighboring Belgium. Belgian 3D printing firm Materialise, a pioneer in 3D printing, has been around for more than two decades.
The Dutch startups capture many of the main differences with startups in the United States. Like all young European firms, they face big financing challenges. Europe is the world's biggest single market, but it struggles to fund its newest firms. According to Thomson Reuters data, venture capitalists invested an average of $4.7 million in each of more than 1,600 new European firms last year. That compares with $7.14 million per firm in India, $8.6 million per firm in the United States, and $12.3 million in China.
Fairphone was born as part of a Dutch state-backed project; its early capital came partly from a UK government-funded incubator. But Van Abel says its single biggest source of funding was downpayments from individuals – mostly German – who wanted to buy its phones.
"We just put a ‘buy me' button on the website somewhere and people could push that button and pay 325 euros (per phone)," he said. "We got more than 3 million euros ($3.9 million)."
Van Abel admits child labor and bribery are hard to avoid when dealing with mines in Democratic Republic of Congo. The project wants people to think more about the way they consume things. "We want our customers to understand they are part of the process," he said. "We've proved there's a market that ... wants social values as part of the product proposition."
That sentiment is a familiar one.
"Europeans culturally are much more reserved than Americans," said Jon Bradford, managing director at TechStars, an incubator, who has helped dozens of startups in Europe from London to Moscow. "You should not necessarily (think) that because someone is quiet and doesn't run around and say ‘look at me, aren't I awesome,' that that is a limiting factor when it comes to their ambition."
USE THE NETWORK
The dream of starting a tech company on a few thousand dollars and turning it into billions is one of Silicon Valley's greatest exports. As the cost of computing has fallen, it has moved within reach of more people. In a study published in March, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found nearly half of all new jobs in 18 countries are created by young, growing companies.
That's one reason why cities around the world have begun to encourage high-speed boot camps where startups pool resources such as office space, electricity and even legal help, and volunteer mentors help get things going. Investing around 50,000-100,000 euros ($65,000-130,000) per startup, each bootcamp — some are state-backed, some not — typically takes a small stake in promising ventures and introduces newcomers to a network of support.
In one such bootcamp on an Amsterdam canal this year, a freshly graduated firm called 3D Hubs has assembled what its founders call the world's biggest network of 3D printers. The company doesn't own the more than 7,500 printers it connects – enough to collaboratively 3D print a life-size replica of the Statue of Liberty in less than a week – because they are owned by individuals and other businesses, mostly in the United States. 3D Hubs has simply created a network which others can tap into for a fee.
Here's how it works: If a designer in New York, say, urgently needs to deliver a prototype to Sydney, they send instructions to a 3D printer in Australia which creates the object on the spot. 3D Hubs charges a 15 percent commission on each print job; currently it handles around 10,000 prints per month for an average $10 per part.
Co-founder Brian Garret, whose first invention was a 3D-printed pair of headphones with the lyrics of a favorite song in relief across the headband, said the idea is that printing capacity can work like a real-time market: When demand is high, the cost will rise.
"We're really thinking big," said Garret, 29. "We want to offer people access to 3D printing and for that to be an alternative to mass production." The bottom line, according to Garret: "business can become local again."
Shapeways is another young Dutch 3D printing firm. It runs two factories, one in Eindhoven in the Netherlands and one in New York, that let anyone — from haute-couture designers to cat-lovers — print what they want. Jewellery, accessories for gadgets such as personalized iPhone cases, and homeware are most popular.
CEO Peter Weijmarshausen moved the firm's headquarters to New York in 2010 to be close to its main market and attract talent and investment. It now employs 150 people and hosts around 19,000 online shops opened by its customers to sell designs they have made. Like others, Weijmarshausen believes 3D printing will challenge mass production. As for many European startups, the biggest single obstacle is follow-on venture funding.
"I spoke to a lot of VCs in Europe, they all were like interested but they never really committed," said Weijmarshausen.
MIND THE GAP
To close the funding gap, governments are stepping in. Around 40 percent of all venture capital in Europe comes from governments, according to the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (EVCA). Public cash for innovation was squeezed by the financial crisis, though Europe is beginning to spend more again: Over the next seven years Brussels will devote at least 850 million euros of its 80 billion euro innovation budget to help new and growing small firms.

Why The Apple Watch Is A Gift To The Swiss Watch Industryreddit
The launch of the Apple Watch this week has raised questions about its impact on the Swiss watch industry. Contrary to Apple designer Jony Ive's remarks that the Swiss watch could be in trouble, there are several reasons why the Swiss have nothing to fear from Apple's success.
First, the Apple Watch makes wearing a watch relevant to a new generation of future watch collectors. I often ask other professors around the world how many of their students wear watches. The answer is always the same: "very few." For many young adults who have grown up using their cell phone to tell time, the idea of wearing a watch is the equivalent of sending a telegraph or storing data on a floppy disk.
The Apple Watch introduces the concept of wearing a watch to many of Apple's 18 to 35 target market. If it takes off, it is likely that these buyers will eventually consider purchasing other types of watches for events later in life. Talk to any Swiss watch executive today and they will tell you many of their best clients started out collecting Swatches in the 1980s, but eventually started purchasing more expensive brands such as Rolex, Blancpain, Breguet, or Audemars Piguet later in life. Like the Swatch, it is quite possible that the Apple Watch could spark a new generation of watch aficionados and collectors.
A similar phenomenon has recently occurred in the book industry. When Amazon introduced its Kindle eBook reader in 2007, many analysts predicted it marked the end of traditional bookselling. However, over the last five years independent bookstores have seen a resurgence in sales and in the number of stores, all the while selling traditional printed books. One of many reasons for this revival is that booksellers have benefited from continued demand for children's books, which remain near the top of the fastest growing segments in the publishing industry. When parents and grandparents buy books to read to children at bedtime, they introduce the printed book to a new generation of potential users. As these children have grown up, data show they have been less likely to abandon the printed book in favor of the Kindle. In fact, most readers are happy to read both.
Second, the Apple Watch is likely to be a complement rather than a competitor to the Swiss watch. The Apple Watch is chock full of technological wonders that would be the envy of Dick Tracy, while Swiss watches are primarily luxury goods and status symbols. Apple is confident it will be able to reinvent its core technology every 6 to 12 months before competitors like Samsung attempt to render it obsolete. Swiss watchmakers, on the other hand, see themselves as craftspeople producing wearable art meant to be passed down from generation to generation.
The Swiss stopped competing for technological watchmaking supremacy in the 1980s when Japanese watch manufacturers like Casio and Seiko began producing far cheaper and more accurate quartz watches compared to their handmade mechanical timepieces. Within a decade of inventing the first quartz watch, the Swiss saw their export volume decrease from 45% to 10% of watches produced globally. By 1983, two-thirds of all watch industry jobs in Switzerland had vanished and over half of all watchmaking companies in Switzerland had gone bankrupt.
Thanks to the efforts of individuals like former Swatch Group chairman Nicolas G. Hayek and LVMH watch president Jean-Claude Biver (who oversees Hublot, Tag Heuer and Zenith), the Swiss watch industry cleverly repositioned its mechanical wonders as luxury goods . Unlike the $350 price tag suggested for a new Apple Watch, most of the Swiss watch industry's meteoric growth over the last two decades has come from watches priced well over $10,000. The Swiss watch industry no longer competes on the same dimensions that will drive Apple Watch sales.
Third, Apple and Swiss watchmakers have this in common: they are deeply committed to connecting their product with the consumer on a personal level. During Tuesday's launch event, Apple CEO Tim Cook touted the Apple Watch as the "most personal device we've ever created." The beauty of the Apple Watch is that it can track people's micro-movements and provide instant data to help wearers make sense of how they engage with the world around them. Similarly, while conducting research on the re-emergence of the Swiss watch industry, I interviewed a prominent Swiss watch CEO who said, "Your watch is part of you. The watch is you. It shows the type of personality you have: Are you elegant?, unique?, rich?, arrogant?, sporty?... all these elements are transmitted through your watch."
The Swiss watch industry can be confident that a sufficient number of well-to-do and tech-savvy Apple Watch wearers will continue to pine for the highest end handmade timepieces.
The Apple Watch may keep perfect time, but it is not timeless.

Recall Dilemma: What to Do If Parts Aren t ReadyPakistan Earthquake Zone One Year Later
MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 6, 2006
By GRETCHEN PETERS
Share

Hanif Tanuli's home was destroyed in the massive earthquake that hit northern Pakistan one year ago. The earthquake killed more 73,000 people.
Now Tanuli has a sturdy new roof over his head that was built with American money. He laughingly says his house is "too warm," even though he knows he is one of the lucky ones. About 100,000 others face the coming Himalayan winter without a home.
Last year foreign governments pledged almost $7 billion to rebuild this shattered region. Long lines of people waited for hours for construction money. But bureaucratic delays, logistical challenges and the sheer number of needy people have impeded progress.
One year later, approximately 30,000 people still live in tent camps while another 70,000 face yet another Himalayan winter without permanent shelter.
The earthquake left 3 million people homeless a year ago, and the biggest challenge for aid groups trying to help people living at high altitudes has been getting the building materials up there.
Several months ago, USAid and other groups shifted their focus to opening the roads. Aid worker Mir Mohammed Mirzad recalls, "Everyone was saying please make access for us." Across a region the size of Maryland, thousands have been hired to dig out avalanches and shore up river banks.
Across Kashmir and northern Pakistan, children are back in school, but most of their classes are still held in tents. In a place where so many perished, memories of that terrible day continue to haunt them.
"One year later, I am reminded that I lost my mother. My sister and brother are still in a hospital far away from our village," said 8-year-old Safina.
Many public buildings, like the Doctors Without Borders hospital here, still operate from temporary shelters. There have been creative solutions, like this hospital, which was built from 70 merged truck containers.
Pakistan's government has asked for patience, saying it will take time to make sure new building is done well, and some people are satisfied with that.
Ibrar Ahmed an earthquake victim, says he is happy because the government is "building a new house, stronger than the one before."
For people like Ahmed, rebuilding is an essential part of the healing.

Whodunit: Removing HT market copies to win morning challengeComments
As the strongest and the largest read newspaper of Delhi NCR, Hindustan Times (HT) is used to facing challenges from various quarters. But, over the last few days, HT has been confronting a peculiar challenge: readers complaining about copies not reaching them.
“For the last couple of days we have not been receiving the HT,” said Kriti Prakash of east Delhi’s Jhilmil Colony.
Prakash isn’t alone.
Mohd Hafeez, another HT reader, had a similar complaint.
“For some reason, the HT has not been delivered to our home over the last few days,” said Hafeez, who stays in central Delhi’s Tilak Marg.
HT’s offices have also started receiving calls from readers from across the national capital region (NCR), complaining about not receiving HT copies suddenly.
The HT’s circulation department, which began a trail from the press to the reader, stumbled upon a startling fact: a group of people were descending upon various distribution centers early in the morning, and buying up thousands of copies of HT, sometimes at more than double the cover price.
The fact that complaints were pouring in from areas located more than 50 km apart only gave rise to suspicion that there was a seemingly organised attempt to keep HT copies from reaching its readers.
Quick estimates showed that more than 100,000 HT copies were removed from the market forcing an FIR at the Ranjit Nagar Police Station. Some of these copies were even whisked away to Mumbai.
In one instance, acting on a tip-off and alerted by complaints, the CRPF confiscated several cartons containing 20,000 copies of HT, which had gone missing from Delhi, shortly after they were unloaded from the Rajdhani Express onto a hand-pulled cart in Mumbai.
It still remains a mystery why someone would be removing, stealing or buying HT copies other than the sole reason to ensure that regular readers miss copies of their favourite newspaper.
Strangely, in the same weekend during which thousands of HT copies disappeared from the market, a competition newspaper launched a so-called ‘Morning Challenge’.
It is to be seen whether ‘Morning Challenge’ becomes a challenge for HT readers.
In order to fight against this sabotage, and ensure every reader receives their copy, we have set up a Consumer helpline. If you, or anyone you know, is missing a copy of the Hindustan Times, please give a missed call to 092271 92271, and we shall get back to you and take appropriate steps to make sure you continue to get Delhi NCR’s No 1 paper.

Sears Holdings Co. is getting a $400 million secured short-term loan from the hedge fund of its chief executive, Eddie Lampert, with real estate as collateral, the company said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The loan, half of which was funded Monday and the other half at the end of this month, will come due at the end of this year, though the maturity date can be extended to Feb. 28 as long as there is no event of default.

( Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz )
The loan, to be used for general corporate purposes, is guaranteed by a first priority lien on 25 Sears-owned properties.
The loan comes less than a week after Fitch Ratings downgraded Sears Holdings’ credit rating to CC status, meaning “default of some kind appears probable.”
The credit ratings agency cited mounting losses, continued revenue declines and worrisome cash burn as reasons for the downgrade, and doubted Sears could last beyond 2016.
Published reports earlier this year indicated Lampert’s hedge fund, ESL Investments, had ended some types of short-term lending to Sears Holdings.

People are auditioning for a new marijuana reality show. Its called The Marijuana ShowBy Elahe Izadi September 15 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Wild marijuana (AP Photo/South Bend Tribune, Robert Franklin)
Nearly every industry has a reality show dedicated to it.  Shipping stuff? Yes . Dog whispering? Check . Bounty hunters named Dog? Of course . Now, prospective legal marijuana tycoons can get in on the action.
As  Fox 31 Denver reported , 200 people showed up Saturday in Denver to audition for a new, Web-based marijuana reality show named “The Marijuana Show.” (No pot puns here, folks.)
Here’s how it works: People pitch their marijuana business ideas to investors, who will back projects by investing $25,000 to $1 million or more, co-creator Wendy Robbins told the Fox affiliate.
In their online pitch, show co-creators Karen Paull and Robbins  describe their project as “The Shark Tank” meets “The Apprentice,” but emphasize it’ll be more like a dolphin tank rather than shark tank. They also have a higher vision in mind: to combat negative connotations around marijuana use. “It’s really an important and potent herb and medicine and it needs to be legal,” Robbins told Fox 31. “That’s why we are doing this.”
“We’re the puff the magic dragon of reality pitch shows. Basically, we don’t wanna be rude,” Robbins told 303 Magazine . “It’s really about educating, and us getting educated too, the world about the whole industry.”
On Saturday, people pitched ideas to a panel, which will then choose six winners to head to a boot camp in New Mexico. From there, the contestants will prepare for October, when they will pitch investors back in Denver, the Fox affiliate reported. Audition pitches ranged from movie projects to a woman who wants to use cannabis in her flower shop designs, and the show will air online in November,  CNN reported .
Colorado voters approved recreational marijuana use in 2012, and since then, the legal marijuana industry across the country has been booming; as The New York Times pointed out , the legal industry is expected to grow to $2.6 billion this year, per marijuana research firm ArcView Group.

Advani comes out of the cold  named chairman of Lok Sabha ethics panelL K Advani
Written by Pradeep R Kaushal | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 3:46 am
After finding no place in the active decision-making process in the party or government, veteran BJP leader L K Advani finally has a new role — chairman of the Lok Sabha Committee on Ethics.
While Advani was not included in the new ruling dispensation, he was later divested of an active role in the party, as he was excluded from its vital organisational fora. He was made a part of the new advisory body called the Margdarshak Mandal.
Another former BJP chief, Murli Manohar Joshi, who was also included in the Margdarshak Mandal, was earlier appointed the chairman of the Estimates Committee of Parliament.
The Committee on Ethics is designed to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members of the Lok Sabha. It can suo motu take up for consideration and investigation matters in this regard. Following the same procedure as the Committee on Privileges for examining complaints pertaining to unethical conduct of members, it can make recommendations and frame rules, specifying acts which constitute unethical conduct.
The other members of the committee are: A Arunmozhithevan (AIADMK), Ninong Ering (Congress), Sher Singh Ghubaya (Akali Dal), Hemant Tukaram Godse (Shiv Sena), Kariya Munda, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Pralhad Joshi, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Jayashree Patel, Sumedhanand Saraswati and Bhola Singh (all BJP), Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) and Malla Reddy (Telugu Desam).
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has also constituted the Committee on Violation of Protocol Norms and Contemptuous Behaviour of Government Officers with Members of the Lok Sabha under the chairmanship of Rayapati Sambasiva Rao of the Telugu Desam. The committee will examine complaints relating to violation of protocol norms regarding officials’ dealings with MPs.
The Speaker has named M Thambidurai of the AIADMK chairman of the Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) of the Lok Sabha. The panel will periodically monitor and review the performance of the scheme and consider complaints of members.

India to import iron ore post mining curbsIndia to import iron ore, offer market to oversupplied global industry
Manolo Serapio Jr     Singapore   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 10:51 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
An oversupplied global iron ore market may find some relief from an unlikely source as the country, which was the third largest exporter of the metal, turns into a big importer due to a cutback in domestic production.
The country may ship in up to 45 million tonnes over the next three years as home-grown iron ore output falls short of domestic steel production needs, an executive at an influential industry group said.
India imported just 0.37 million tonnes of the steelmaking raw material in 2013/14, government data showed. But already JSW Steel, third-largest domestic maker of the alloy, has said it will import 6 million tonnes of iron ore in 2014/15 against zero a year earlier.
"There's no option but to import to meet the shortfall . We're looking at between 10 and 15 million tonnes every fiscal year over the next three years," Basant Poddar, vice president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the only industry group for mining firms in the country, told Reuters by phone.
"The mine closures all over India, starting from Karnataka, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand, have created a massive disruption to supply," Poddar said.
Mining in the key iron ore states of Karnataka and Goa was banned in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following a crackdown on illegal mining by the Supreme Court and the government. Several mines in top producing Odisha state and in Jharkhand too were closed this year following government-imposed restrictions on the renewal of mining licenses.
While the bans have since been lifted, delays in restarting mining operations in Goa and Karnataka and the latest mine closures in the other states have limited local iron ore supply.
The disruptions have cut India's iron ore production to 152 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, from about 218 million in 2009/10, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.
The prospect of higher demand from the domestic industry comes at an opportune time for global iron ore miners, whose margins have been shrunk by a 40 percent slump in iron ore prices this year.
Iron ore fell to $81.90 a tonne last week, its lowest since September 2009.
The bulk of India's imports may come from Australia and South Africa, said Poddar, and unlikely from Brazil where shipments are usually made in big vessels. "Indian ports are not geared to handle large vessels," he said.
But the potential import volume won't be enough to absorb the total projected global surfeit. Morgan Stanley, which sees a global surplus of 79 million tonnes this year doubling to 158 million tonnes in 2015, expects the price to drop to $70.
In addition, any relief from domestic demand may be temporary, as the shortage is due to  government policy measures that could eventually be reversed.
BUREAUCRATIC ROUTE
For the present, resuming operations has been slow due to the long bureaucratic route to renew mining leases, said Poddar.
Only 22 mines out of 122 that are eligible to restart in Karnataka have resumed operations, said Poddar who owns Mineral Enterprises, which has five mines in the state that have a combined capacity of 1.2 million tonnes but have remained shut. Mines in Goa have not reopened.
In Odisha, around a third of 56 iron ore mines are still closed and in Jharkhand, the third biggest producer in the past fiscal year, 12 out of 17 mines are shut.
India was the world's third-largest iron ore exporter until higher costs along with the mining bans slashed shipments by 85 percent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years.
Amid the shortage in local supply, iron ore prices in the country are defying the global weakness.
In Odisha, 63 per cent grade iron ore would cost about $105 a tonne, including taxes and the royalty, to export, way above the current global market price of $67-$68, said Dhruv Goel, managing partner at industry consultancy SteelMint.
But miners make a profit of $15-$20 a tonne selling the same grade to local steelmakers, said Goel.
"It is certainly profitable to sell in the domestic market."

Rupee up 11 paise against dollar in early tradeComments
Bucking a weak trend in stocks, the Indian rupee on Tuesday recovered from one-month lows to end with a modest gain of eight paise at 61.05 against the Greenback on fresh dollar selling by exporters.
Persistent capital inflows also aided the rupee rise while the dollar index was almost stable against a basket of six major currencies ahead of the outcome of two-day policy meeting by the US Federal Reserve starting on Tuesday.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced strong at 61.02 a dollar from previous close of 61.13, a one-month low.
It was later trapped in a narrow range of 61.01 and 61.1425 before settling at 61.05, a net rise of eight paise or 0.13%.
On Monday, it had plunged 48 paise, or 0.79%, its biggest fall in more than five weeks.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, after tumbling by 244.48 points or 0.90% on Monday, tanked 324.05 points or 1.21% on Tuesday to end at three-week lows.
FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth USD 79.57 million on Monday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Rupee appreciated on Tuesday even as local equities closed down by over one per cent. Rupee movement was aided by lower trade deficit in August. Dollar index rally slowed down on Tuesday, which further supported the rupee. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.50 to 61.50."

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could cut rates only in January-June period of the next year as inflation is still high, Kotak Mahindra Bank Vice Chairman and Managing Director Uday Kotak said on Tuesday.
"I am still of view that some time in the first half of the calender, we could see rate cut from the RBI," Kotak said at an event in the national capital.
"The weightage of oil and energy in CPI is much lower than WPI. With the crude oil coming down, it will have some impact on number of products... We are still very far away from 6 per cent CPI by January 2016," he added.
The August wholesale price inflation (WPI) declined sharply to a near five-year low of 3.74 per cent on declining prices of vegetables and other food articles from 5.19 per cent in July and 6.99 per cent in August 2013.
The central bank has been maintaining status quo for sometime now in its bid to rein in inflation. In its August policy review, RBI chose not to change rate as it perceived upside risks to inflation in view of uncertain monsoon and its impact on food production as also volatile international oil prices.
Accordingly, it maintained the repo rate at 8 per cent, the reverse repo at 7 per cent and the cash reserve ratio at 4 per cent.
On Monday, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said prices across the board have to come down to enable him to reduce key rates.
"Inflation is high not only in food, but also in non-food items and the best solution for the country is to bring it down. Then I can cut interest rates ," Rajan had said.
"I have no desire to keep interest rates high for even a second longer. I want to bring down interest rates when it is feasible and that would be when we have won the fight against inflation," he had said.
"There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation pick-up again," said the RBI Governor, adding that right now he thinks the central bank is continuing the way it proposed recently.

Hiring improves; e-commerce  realty lead th...Antal International
("Faster economic growth,…)
NEW DELHI: After almost two years, the Indian job market is showing signs of improvement as more than half of the companies surveyed said they are currently on a hiring mode, according to search and selection specialist Antal International.
There has been a significant upsurge in the hiring activities as 52 per cent of companies are recruiting new staff at the moment, while 60 per cent are looking to do so in the near future.
"Faster economic growth, investor-friendly and a more focused Government are seen as reasons behind this positive outcome," the report said.
The survey further noted that not only hiring but firing rates have also increased considerably during the last three months. The percentage of Indian businesses shedding managers is 22 per cent and is likely to stay the same in the coming quarter, the 16th Antal Global Snapshot report said.
"Compared to our last hiring survey and what is being seen, there has been an upsurge is hiring activity at the managerial levels," Antal International Network India Managing Director Joseph Devasia said.
There is a more measured approach to recruitment from Indian businesses, as organisations look to develop the managerial and professional talent, the report said.
Sectors like e-commerce, real estate, consumer goods have reported the highest percentage of current hiring as nearly all of those questioned reported they were currently taking on staff in these sectors. Demand in these areas is expected to increase in the next quarter.
Other sectors that are faring well in terms of current hiring include healthcare, chemical, IT -- software and packaging. retail, which is currently hiring at 48 per cent is expected to go up to 75 per cent in the next quarter.
Chemicals sector which is hiring at 58 per cent is expected to boost hiring at managerial level in the next three months (71 per cent). The manufacturing sector, which is facing a tough time at the moment also showed signs of improvement with 56 per cent companies likely to hire.
Consumer led sectors like ecommerce, FMCG , durables and related industries are buoyant. Some near sectors like logistics and packaging that support ecommerce are also seeing a huge spurt in growth. This does mean , talent shortage will be the big discussion point in board rooms, he added.

BJP repeats LS election success in Assembly bypollBJP activists dance in-front of their party office to celebrate their victory in Basirhat Dakshin Constituency in State Assembly by-election in Kolkata on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Subrata Nagchowdhury | Kolkata | Posted: September 16, 2014 5:11 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 9:47 pm
Facing setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, good news came for the BJP in West Bengal where the party won one of the two assembly seats where bypolls were held. The BJP’s victory in the Basirhat (South) seat came despite the might of the ruling Trinamol Congress and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s vow not to allow the BJP win a single seat in the state.
It was after a gap of 13 years that the BJP has found representation in the West Bengal assembly.  Shamik Bhattacharya, who won the seat with a margin of 1,586 votes, said, “The victory indicates the political trend in Bengal — the BJP is fast emerging as the main opposition political party. It now officially enters the precincts of the assembly and will make more inroads in 2016.” Incidentally, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had come first in 21 assembly seats and second in nearly 40 assembly segments.
The last time the BJP won an assembly seat was when its candidate Badal Bhattacharya won the bypoll from Ashoknagar in North 24 Parganas in 1999. He was the MLA till 2001 when fresh assembly polls were held.
The chief minister, having realised that Basirhat (south) was a tough contest for the party as the BJP had surged ahead in this assembly segment by over 30,000 votes in the last Lok Sabha polls, had pressed all her might to win the seat.  Top Trinamool Congress leaders who were given charge of the bypolls — almost half a dozen MPs, over 10 ministers and other top party functionaries — were crestfallen with the Basirhat (South) result. The leaders feared action from party chief Mamata Banerjee as she had repeatedly asked them to ensure that the BJP does not make a match out of this seat.
What went wrong will be analysed threadbare and action will be taken, said a top Trinamool leader who did not want to be named.  Trinamool general secretary leader Mukul Roy, however, tried to put up a brave face, saying that the party had gained in Basirhat (south). “The TMC managed to recover 28,000 votes out of a Lok Sabha deficit of 30,000 votes,” he said.
The Basirhat (south) seat had been a CPM stronghold since 1977 and was vacated recently following the death of party MLA Narayan Mukherjee.  The BJP victory is of much significance for more than one reason. First, this is the first time that the BJP has won as a single party. In 1999, when it won the Ashoknagar bypoll, the BJP had the Trinamool Congress as its ally.
The second important factor is a major shift of CPM support continued…

Xi Jinping to launch port city in Sri LankaUpdated: September 17, 2014 08:27 IST
‘Sri Lanka a pearl in the Indian Ocean’
Meera Srinivasan
Reuters Chinese President Xi Jinping waves next to Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa during an official welcoming ceremony at Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake on Tuesday.

Xi opposes interference in the country’s internal affairs
Sri Lanka and China on Tuesday agreed to deepen strategic and defence cooperation, following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential Secretariat here.
The countries would step up high-level exchanges, including those of defence authorities, with the aim of deepening the ‘China-Sri Lanka Strategic Cooperative Partnership,’ according to a joint statement released by President Rajapaksa’s office.
Sri Lanka signed nearly 30 agreements with China, including one launching negotiations on a free trade agreement. The leaders authorised the $1.4-billion port city development project, Beijing’s latest investment in Sri Lanka, and cleared the decks for several infrastructure projects besides launching the final phase of a power plant in Noracholai, located in Sri Lanka’s North Western Province.
Sri Lanka has had strong ties with China, which has consistently backed the country at the U.N. Human Rights Council where it faces a U.S.-backed resolution that calls for an international probe into its rights record. Reiterating China’s position, President Xi — in a letter published on the front page of Sri Lanka’s state-run Daily News on Tuesday — said that China “resolutely opposes any move by any country to interfere in Sri Lanka’s internal affairs under any excuse.”
Amid accusations of China developing ports — in what is often referred to as ‘string of pearls’ circle of influence — around India, the Chinese President said in his letter that Sri Lanka was a “pearl in the Indian ocean.”
President Rajapaksa recently assured cooperation to China’s 21st century Maritime Silk Road initiative, strengthening apprehension over the island “playing the China card” against India, where President Xi is headed on Wednesday.
Ever since Sri Lanka’s civil war ended in 2009, sections in New Delhi have been worried about the increasing influence China seems to have over the island nation. However, foreign policy analyst and Sri Lanka’s former Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Dayan Jayatilleke observed that Sri Lanka’s policy makers had a tendency to overplay the ‘China card.’
‘China card against India’
Sri Lanka’s defence bureaucracy, he said, seems sustained by a notion that China will function has a counterweight to India. “There is exaggeration in that understanding,” he said, adding that the ‘China card’ was drastically diminishing in size in the context of emerging Indo-China relations in the last few years, and particularly so after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed charge. The defence bureaucracy also had a “garrison state delusion’ that Sri Lanka could be another Pakistan or, they seemed to China as being to Sri Lanka what the US is to Israel.
Critics also point to the nature of assistance offered by China. Development economist and principal researcher at the Jaffna-based Point Pedro Institute of Development Muttukrishna Sarvananthan said he was pessimistic about Sri Lanka’s engagement with China as “political imperatives override economic imperatives”. Observing that much of the economic engagement was politicised, he said progress on Indian projects had slowed down since 2012, after India voted against Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council. “The housing project began in 2010, but the progress has been slow. Similarly, the government seems to be deliberately delaying completion of the northern railway line,” he said. In 2014, India abstained from voting on the resolution, pressing what analysts termed a “reset button” in Indo-Lanka diplomacy, however China's apparently growing influence remains a concern among many.
Economic engagement ought to be read carefully, Mr. Sarvananthan stressed, noting that Chinese commercial loans were rather expensive with high interest rates, while India’s assistance included a considerable grant component. “There are serious implications for our [Sri Lanka’s] growth and debt,” he said. In December 2013, Sri Lanka’s outstanding debt to China in disbursed loans was nearly Rs. 196 billion, according to The Sunday Times here.
On the overall engagement with China, Mr. Jayatilleke said it is time the more hawkish decision makers realised that Sri Lanka does not enjoy an open ended strategic commitment on the part of China. “Sri Lanka should also understand that neither India nor China is in the business of intruding into each other’s sphere of interest that would be in variance to their strategic core,” he said.

Congress blazes through bypolls without its top gunsThe Congress has scored big in the latest round of bypolls, crucially without its big guns, just four months after its worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections.
 
Tuesday’s results perhaps show that the Congress can afford to be less dependent on its ‘high command’ in poll campaigns if it can build a strong regional leadership.
 
Another possible takeaway for the grand old party is campaign formulas can also work well if they are not centrally dictated.
 
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had advocated this, albeit in a limited context of Dalit leadership, when he wanted to bring up 100 leaders every year.
 
The results will be heartening for the Congress, which also fared well in the last two bypolls after the national debacle despite a star-studded campaign that cost crores. 
 
The relatively low-key campaign in the bypolls, where none of the top leaders was visible, at least in the frontline, has delivered more than a face-saver for the party.
 
Yes, the Congress has not turned around its electoral fortunes in Uttar Pradesh, the state which matters the most in Indian politics, and cut a sorry figure in West Bengal, but there are big positives from Gujarat and Rajasthan.
 
The party’s morale will be up after wresting a total of six seats from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home turf Gujarat and Rajasthan — also BJP-ruled — and retaining one seat in Assam
 
This success comes ahead of the assembly polls in Haryana and Maharashtra.
 
In the last two rounds of bypolls, the Congress had managed to retain its seats and, with the help of allies, halt the BJP’s march in Bihar.
 
These victories give the Congress a chance to retain its relevance in the opposition space. The combined results of all three phases of bypolls, coming at a time when the party is struggling to be the leader in the opposition quarters, perhaps indicates that no anti-BJP alliance is complete without Congress.
 
But the limited victories also show the Congress that its UP organisation desperately needs to find its footing between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party.

(The stand-off in Demchok area…)
LEH/NEW DELHI: The stand-off in Demchok area of Ladakh continued for the 10th day today with Chinese nomads now reported to have erected tents with the help of Chinese Army inside Indian territory to protest against an ongoing irrigation canal work.
As the BJP MP from Ladakh Thupstan Chewang termed the action as a "mean move by the Chinese Army" ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India beginning tomorrow, the situation at the Demchok remained unchanged with Chinese civilians refusing to vacate the Indian territory until the work on construction of an irrigation canal was stopped.
"Now this is being mean. Chinese Army has pushed its civilians to force us to stop work on a canal which is being built well within our territory. This time the Chinese People's Liberation Army is sitting at back," Chewang told PTI.
According to sources, Chines 'Rebos'(nomads) have pitched tents inside the Indian territory in Demchok area, 300 kms from Leh, and are refusing to vacate the same till the work was stopped.
They had entered about 500 metres deep into Indian territory on the intervening night of September five and six this year.
Civilians from India also camped right at the spot and were refusing to allow the Chinese 'Rebos' to stop the work leading to a tense situation in the area with armies from both sides staging banner drills to protect their civilians, the sources said.
This area is en-route to Kailash Manasarovar in Tibet which India has been requesting Chinese authorities to open as the pilgrimage route from this area was not tedious or risky.
In the adjacent Chumar area, Chinese PLA cordoned a team of 100 Indian soldiers accusing them of having entered into their territory. However, the Chinese had to leave after more enforcements arrived in the area. The matter was also taken up during a routine Flag meeting held at Chushul.
The Chinese had pitched their tents last year in DBO area in Depsang plains and the stand-off continued for three weeks.
The BJP MP expressed surprise over the "fresh incursion" from the Chinese PLA this time and urged the Centre to take up the matter during upcoming visit of the Chinese President.
The boundary question is expected to be on the agenda of summit talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping .

Oil Ministry wants RIL to stop sale of KG-D6...Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd
(RIL, which sold MA crude…)
NEW DELHI: Petroleum Ministry has asked Reliance Industries to stop sale of crude oil from KG-D6 block to its affiliate Jamnagar refinery, saying it was not an arms- length sales.
The Ministry wants to deduct $ 115 million from sale proceeds of the crude oil to make up for the additional profit petroleum it believes is due after disallowance of $ 1.797 billion in cost for KG-D6 gas output falling short of target. It has asked RIL to sell oil to Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL) on an interim basis.
RIL transfers shipload of crude oil from the offshore MA oilfield in the predominately KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast, to user refinery once a month and the occasion for such a transfer hasn't arisen since the Ministry order.
A company spokesperson, however, said RIL has not received any letter from the Ministry. "There is no restriction under the Production Sharing contract (PSC) for sale to affiliates or self (other division of RIL) and the sale is in accordance with PSC provision."
RIL, which sold MA crude to CPCL during first five years of production on negotiated terms, earlier this year floated a tender for sale of 2.5 million barrels of oil in 2014-15.
Jamnagar refinery of RIL won the tender as CPCL offered a pricing formula that was about $ 4-5 per barrel less than the formulation quoted by the private sector refiner.
Sources said the Ministry, which could not recover the $ 115 million of additional profit petroleum because CPCL was no longer a buyer and did not owe any money to RIL, stated that oil sales is to be done on arms length basis and cannot be done to an affiliate.
Incidentally, RIL had sold condensate from the block for almost two years as well as test oil Cambay basin block to Jamnagar with full knowledge and approval of the Ministry. No issue of Jamnagar refinery being an affiliate was raised then.
The Ministry had disallowed $ 1.797 billion in cost for gas output from main fields in KG-D6 block falling short of target between 2010-11 and 2012-13. It calculated that the government should have got an additional profit share of $ 115.263 million.
To recover this, it wanted CPCL and gas utility GAIL India to deduct this amount due to RIL. GAIL has not bought any gas from KG-D6 since June 2013 and could not deduct any amount. CPCL too lost out the crude tender in May.
After including cost disallowance of $ 579 million for 2013-14, the total additional profit petroleum claimed from RIL comes to $ 195 million, sources said.
However, the cost disallowance issue is under arbitration and it is unclear how the Ministry wanted additional profit petroleum even before the issue is decided.
"KG-D6 crude oil is being stock transfered/sold to RIL Jamnagar refinery at price established through a transparent arm's length sales process.
"With all PSU and private refiners invited in the tender process, RIL Jamnagar refinery was the highest bidder, it was decided to sell KG crude to RIL Jamnagar during April 2014 to March 2015 in the interest of all the parties," the spokesperson said.

Jan Dhan visionary; execution a challenge: U...Jan dhan Yojana
(On the asset quality, he…)
NEW DELHI: A day after RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan cautioned banks against hunting for number of accounts, Kotak Mahindra Bank Vice Chairman and Managing Director Uday Kotak said 'Jan Dhan' scheme may be visionary but there is a challenge in execution.
"Of course the issue is that there is a big difference between vision and details...therefore, the difference between big picture and outcomes is execution and Jan Dhan may be visionary but challenge is in execution and what happens is vision is laid down and targets are put to banker," he said at an event here.
"It is back to same point their (bankers) focus on opening number of accounts not on the purpose of that which is to make a difference. So, we may get the targeted number but we may not get the real outcome," he said.
On the asset quality, he said the Indian banking system is probably going through the most challenging time on the whole non-performing asset side.
"The recorded gross NPA plus restructured assets is 10 per cent. I believe there is at least 4-5 per cent which is embedded which is still not out in the open," he said.
According to estimates, recast loans at about Rs 3.5 trillion (Rs 3.5 lakh crore) constitute nearly 6 per cent of the total banking system.
The gross NPA of the banking sector rose to Rs 2.40 lakh crore at the end of March 2014 from Rs 1.75 lakh crore at the end of previous fiscal.
"If 15 per cent of the loan book is under pressure it is going to create a challenges and then we have all the investigating agencies and 70 per cent of the Indian banking industry which is in the hands of state which obviously will create pressures," he said.
"We need to ensure that pressures on the financial system do not lead to slowdown in economy. That is a serious risk and challenge that we need to address," he added.
As banks rush to open accounts under the Centre's Jan Dhan scheme, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan yesterday cautioned them on the risks involved in just hunting for numbers, asking them not to compromise on core objectives of the programme.
"When we roll out the scheme, we have to make sure it does not go off the track. The target is universality, not just speed and numbers," Rajan had said.
The scheme can be a "waste" if it leads to duplication of accounts, if no transaction happens on the new accounts and if the new users get bad experiences, he had added.

Nothing personal against Singh: Ex-CAG Vinod...PM gets acclaim & blame; nothing personal against Manmohan Singh: Former CAG Vinod Rai

NEW DELHI: With his new book creating a major controversy, former CAG Vinod Rai today said he has nothing personal against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but all the "acclaim and the blame" has to be taken by the head of the government.
Rai's remarks about the alleged inaction of the former Prime Minister during various scams have generated sharp reactions from Congress party leaders, while other political parties have used his observations to hit back at the previous UPA regime.
The former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said that Singh should also get credit for taking prompt action with regard to ordering of coal block auction, after certain irregularities were brought to his notice.
"The Prime Minister is the head of the government and he may not have any role in the decisions which some of them, like Commonwealth Games he was not directly responsible for any thing.
"But ultimately the acclaim and the blame, both have to be taken by the head of the institution. In that respect, I have brought it out and nothing personal," Rai told PTI in an interview.
"It is certainly not to do with an individual," he said. Giving an example, the former CAG said, "Our Indian team went to England to play cricket and in all the Test matches we performed very poorly.
"Didn't the blame of it come to very large measure on the captain of the team? May be a large number of players did not function or play properly, but the blame had to be taken by the captain."
Rai further said: "If I am the CAG today and if something goes wrong in my organisation, even if I did not have a role to play in it, the responsibility revolves around me.
"I give you the classic example that six, eight months back, when Navy had some accidents, the chief resigned on moral responsibility but he did not have any role to play in those accidents but the responsibility revolved around him," he said.
Rai's new book, 'The Diary of the Nation's Conscience Keeper -- Not Just an Accountant', talks about various issues observed during his 2008-2013 tenure as CAG, including on Singh's role at times like 2G and coal block allocations.
Reacting to Rai's observations, Singh said on Sunday, "I, indeed, did my duty. Well, I do not want to comment on other people what they have written."
Asked for his comments on this, Rai told PTI, "That was his way of interpreting duty and it is perfectly fine because no two individuals would react similarly in a particular situation. If you were sitting on that seat, you would have had a different interpretation. That is perfectly natural."

Currently, over 90 per cent of the 35 million users are from India. The Hike founder added that similar markets like Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh might be looked at.
"The competition is pretty intense outside, so we will stick to markets that have similar characteristics like Africa, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, we are open to get into but would you see us in US and UK, probably not," Mittal said.
The company is also planning to double its staff strength next year and add new services to the platform. Hike has recently got USD 65 million funding from Tiger Global, a New York based investment firm.
"With the investment we plan to add new services to the platform and double our staff next year," he said.
The company also plans to monetise the platform once the 100 million customer mark is reached through paid stickers or games but is strictly against advertising.
Hike is available globally on platforms including iOS , Android and Blackberry.
It allows users to send free instant messages to friends or people in contacts list who are also using 'Hike' anywhere across the globe and share location, media such as photos and videos instantly.
The app also allows users to send free SMS, even to contacts who do not have 'hike' on their handsets.

Bypoll results: BJP loses to Samajwadi Party in UP  cedes ground in Rajasthan  GujaratComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered a major blow in a clutch of assembly by-elections on Tuesday, ceding ground even in its traditional strongholds barely four months after its spectacular Lok Sabha victory.

The loss piles pressure on the BJP brass and party president Amit Shah to deliver in crucial assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana next month. It also hands a stronger bargaining chip to its allies, especially the Shiv Sena which is eyeing a larger share of seats and the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra.
The results signal a waning of the BJP’s tide. And while it also confirms that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal may broadly hold nationally, some of his party’s controversial, divisive strategies like the so-called ‘love jihad’ campaign may have backfired, especially in Uttar Pradesh where the elections were fought in the backdrop of shrill right-wing rhetoric.
The BJP’s biggest humiliation came from UP, where it lost seven seats to the Samajwadi Party. It even failed to win the prestigious Rohaniya seat which falls under Modi’s constituency, Varanasi, for its ally Apna Dal.
 
The reverses overshadowed the entry of the BJP’s first member in the West Bengal assembly in 15 years.
“The Modi government’s honeymoon period is over,” Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said. “This is perhaps (the) first government whose anti-incumbency has begun within 100 days of coming to power. Alarm bells are ringing for the BJP. This is a good omen for secular forces that people have started rejecting them.”
The results help the Congress reinforce its position as a credible opposition. It breached the BJP strongholds without much help from its star campaigners, signalling that the party could do well if it groomed state leaders.
Hours after the results were out, Prime Minister Modi told a pre-scheduled party workers’ meeting, “The BJP’s specialty is the sincerity of its workers, their hard work and organisational strength.”
The BJP could retain just 13 of the 23 assembly seats it held earlier. The SP and Congress improved their tally by seven and five seats, respectively. In both Gujarat and Rajasthan, the BJP lost three assembly seats to the Congress. Mulayam Singh Yadav’s SP turned the tables on the BJP to win a surprising eight assembly seats in UP.
“The BJP leaders thought voters were in their pockets. This is an eye-opener for the BJP government,” said Congress’ Rajasthan unit chief Sachin Pilot.
In the BJP camp, there was a call for introspection. “State workers and leaders need to introspect on this,” said union minister Uma Bharti.
“The reasons behind the defeat will be reviewed. It has given us a lesson for the Vidhan Sabha polls,” said UP BJP president Laxmi Kant Bajpai.
By-elections were also held for three Lok Sabha seats — Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, Vadodara in Gujarat, which had been vacated by Modi, and Medak in Telangana.
 
The BJP won the Vadodara seat while the SP won in Mainpuri. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi won the Medak seat. In Vadodara, the winning margin slipped to 3.29 lakh votes from Modi’s 5.7 lakh votes.
The saffron brigade won one assembly seat in Assam. The CPI(M) lost one more seat in West Bengal but won a seat in Tripura.

Poll: Illinois voters back minimum wage hike71
Even a majority of voters who consider themselves either very or fairly conservative — 54 percent — backed a higher minimum wage in Illinois, compared with 41 percent who oppose it.
Poll respondent Elena Johnson, a full-time baby sitter for her grandchildren, said the minimum wage should be increased to fairly pay workers.
"Everything has gone up, and everything is still going up, and I think that people that work in the fast-food restaurants — they do have families and it's hard to manage paying bills and then buying food — food is expensive now," said Johnson, 49, of Chicago.
But Elizabeth McCormick, a poll respondent from Westchester, said increasing wages could lead to businesses closing their doors — and to layoffs.
"You raise the minimum wages, businesses close, people lose their jobs," said McCormick, 73, who is retired from work at a sporting goods company.
As was the case with minimum wage, Democrats who control the General Assembly also failed to act during the spring session on Madigan's proposed state constitutional amendment asking voters to impose a 3 percentage point "surcharge" on incomes of more than $1 million. The extra revenue would be distributed to schools on a per-student basis.
Because the Illinois Constitution requires a flat-rate income tax for all residents, Democrats would have needed to put the issue on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment. Since that requires a hefty majority of lawmakers to get on the ballot as a binding proposal, Madigan's Democrats opted instead to put the issue before voters as an advisory referendum.
The poll found 56 percent of voters approved of the so-called millionaire's tax compared with 36 percent who opposed it. Only 9 percent had no opinion.
The proposal had the backing of nearly 7 in 10 voters in Chicago and nearly 6 in 10 in suburban Cook County. But in the five collar counties, which have long trended Republican, the gap narrowed to 54 percent in favor and 40 percent opposed. Downstate, with more conservative voters, it narrowed further, to 49 percent support and 41 percent oppose.
"It's not productive," said poll respondent Steven Rains, 66, a retired auto sales industry worker from Granite City, near St. Louis. "Rich people are OK as long as they're helping out. But we've all gotten greedy. They'll look for (a) cheaper place and leave Illinois."
But Marcia Redmond, a poll respondent from Chicago, said millionaires should pay a little more in taxes given the many tax breaks for which they qualify.
"If we're supposed to be the United States — that's made for all Americans. I think those who make their fair share should pay what they need to pay," said Redmond, 70, a retired IRS employee.
While a majority of voters of all income ranges expressed support for the extra tax on millionaires, the question received its greatest support among people with household incomes of more than $100,000 — 61 percent in favor and 33 percent opposed.
The ballot issue, aside from potentially increasing Democratic turnout, also provides Democrats with another subtle reminder of Rauner's wealth in an election that has centered on their class warfare battle against the Republican governor candidate.
Among Rauner supporters, 58 percent oppose the millionaire's tax while 35 percent approve. Among Quinn backers, 73 percent are in favor of it while only 17 percent oppose it. And among undecided voters, 53 percent support the proposal while 35 percent oppose it.

Mondelez's green efforts largely on track.
Mondelez says it must do more to reduce energy use at its plants.
Mondelez hits packaging-reduction goal ahead of schedule.
Most of Mondelez International Inc.'s sustainability efforts are on track, but the maker of Oreo cookies said it must figure out better ways to reduce energy use at its plants.

On Tuesday, Mondelez plans to release a progress report on its sustainability push — on efforts that began in 2010 when it was part of Kraft Foods Inc. and on goals that Mondelez set in October 2012, when it separated from the Kraft North American grocery business now known as Kraft Foods Group Inc.
  Open link
Deerfield-based Mondelez, which makes snacks such as Chips Ahoy cookies and Trident gum, set a number of goals in areas such as the environment and sustainable sourcing that it hoped to hit by 2015. For example, it aimed to reduce the energy used in manufacturing by 15 percent by 2015, measured per ton of production. So far, it has achieved a 6 percent reduction.

When the company split and reorganized, it lost a little bit of the focus on the energy-use-reduction efforts, said Christine McGrath, vice president of external affairs and head of the company's global well-being platform. Now, Mondelez plans to "build new facilities to be environmentally better designed from the get-go," McGrath said.
Meanwhile, Mondelez said it has reached a packaging goal ahead of schedule.
In 2010, it set out to eliminate 35 million pounds of packaging by 2015, and it raised that target to 50 million pounds (or about 22,700 metric tons) in 2012. It achieved that reduction this year, after slimming down packaging for products such as Trident and making display cartons for retailers easier to open and use.
Some of the company's green efforts came as retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pushed manufacturers to be more environmentally conscious in areas such as production and packaging. McGrath noted a variety of industry connections to sustainability efforts. For example, she sits on The Consumer Goods Forum's sustainability steering committee with members from companies such as Wal-Mart, Nestle and Kroger.
One area where Mondelez said it is on track is in ensuring better cocoa sourcing. In 2012, the company launched Cocoa Life, a 10-year, $400 million cocoa sustainability program. It expects to have reached about 38,000 farmers in 500 communities by the end of the year, up from 500 farmers in 200 communities in 2012. Mondelez said that 10 percent of its cocoa is sustainably sourced.
The company's cocoa-sourcing efforts include measures from working with farmers on which fertilizers are the best to use to helping tackle issues such as access to water and electricity in Ghana and Ivory Coast, two major cocoa-growing countries, where "the infrastructure is so weak," McGrath said.
McGrath said that Mondelez plans to announce new goals in areas such as sustainability and well-being in 2015.

Awesomeness has a new name: iPhone 6Nidhi Singal      Follow @nidhisingal    Last Updated: September 10, 2014  | 11:08 IST

A 4.7-inch screen with 1334 X 750 pixel resolution display, encased in an all-aluminium 6.8-mm slim chassis with a powerful A8 64bit chipset of brain. With ion-strengthened glass front, the curvature design aesthetic follows to the aluminium back that sports a stainless steel Apple. This is the iPhone 6 for you.
The bigger sibling encases a 5.5-inch display and marks Apple's entry into the phablet space. The display has got a 1980 x 1080 pixel resolution in a 7.1-mm thick chassis. The back is made of anodized aluminium and has got the stainless steel frame too.
The awesomeness of dimensions is extended to the innards as well.
The all new A8 64-bit second generation chipset is accompanied by the M8 co-processor. Apple claims that A8, 64-bit chip is 25 per cent more powerful than its predecessor and offers 50 per cent faster graphics. The company promises that the A8 chipset would allow the device to run at full power without causing it to heat. Battery life is estimated at 15 hours of 3G talk time on the iPhone 6 and 24 hours of 3G talk time on the iPhone 6 Plus.
While the megapixel count remains the same, both the iPhones have a new iSight sensor. Both the cameras support faster auto focus. The iPhone 6 features digital image stabilisation while the iPhone 6 Plus has got optical image stabilisation. Apple also says it's now capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 or 60 frames-per-second, and Slo-Mo video at 240 frames-per-second. Panoramas have been increased to up to 43 megapixels.
In addition, the iPhones have got NFC chips for Apple Pay. This is the new payment service where payments can be made with the phone instead of the credit card at checkout counters. This makes the two iPhones unique. Of course, this service will first be available only in the US with no security threats as the credit card numbers are stored in the Passbook app. Neither Apple nor the retailer will have access to that information.
Irrespective of the bigger display, Apple has still made both the phones user-friendly by introducing a new gesture called "Reachability", to account for the increased screen size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
Double touching the home button will slide down the entire display, making the top software buttons accessible in whatever app you're in. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus also allow apps to show more information.
For instance, in landscape mode, the Mail app will show both a list view of messages on the left side and the content of the selected message to the right, similar to how it is displayed on Apple's iPad Air and iPad Mini.

Tie-up with Electrolux was a turning pointStory

SUNDEV APPLIANCES
Devanand  Balasubramanian, Managing Director, Sundev Appliances, says the tie-up in October last year with Sweden's Electrolux to distribute its Kelvinator brand of small kitchen and home appliances was a turning point for the Mumbai-based company.
The deal, he says, helped Sundev to expand its market reach. "Our salesmen go to distributors and retailers with the Kelvinator brand name and also offer them other brands such as Desire," he says.
Sundev, for instance, reached out to distributors who were not selling air coolers but still accepted the Kelvinator brand of air coolers . "After the sales team ensured the availability of the brand at retail points, customers started picking Kelvinator over other brands," he says. "The entire gamble worked out."
The tie-up led Sundev, named as a mix of his and his wife Sunanda's name, to increase its manpower by five times to more than 250 people. Sundev has also roped in actor Raveena Tandon for a nationwide launch of its Desire brand of products.
Sundev has 110 distributors that supply to more than 1010 retailers. The company also manages the entire sourcing, labelling and distribution of products for private labels such as Metro and Specers, while also having worked for Carrefour. The sourcing and distribution abilities help it to act as a carrying and forwarding agent for other products.
Balasubramanian says that, though Sundev faces logistical and financing challenges, yet it wants to distribute smaller brands rather than big ones. "For smaller companies, creating a delivery infrastructure is not easy. We help them deliver conveniently and quickly at a local level," he says. 

Restaurants tweak global dishes for Indian palateGoutam Das      Follow @Goutam20    Edition: Sept 28, 2014
Foodies paradise: The French-Italian restaurant Le Cirque at The Leela Palace, New Delhi.
Mickey Bhoite, a round-faced man with spiked hair and wearing rimless glasses, elegantly arranges what he calls Ravioli au Canard a l'Orange avec sauce soubise on a plate. It is an old school French dish but at the Le Cirque, the French-Italian restaurant at The Leela Palace, New Delhi, the chef conjured a name with a more Italian ring to it. Now Indians, more familiar with Italian cuisine than French, can get it: 'Honey and orange infused duck tortellini'.
VIDEO: The art of preparing duck tortellini
At 55 portions a week and costing Rs 1,750 a dish, this is one of Le Cirque's fastest-moving dishes. "You have to make your dish more acceptable to the guest," says Bhoite, with a distinctive Italian accent. "I can put hard names to make it more high-level gourmet, but that will not help me with my customers."
Corn-fed roasted spring chicken: At the Le Cirque, New Delhi, this pan-seared baby chicken dish was earlier called Poussin. It was renamed to make it easier for the Indians to understand.
That is a lesson Bhoite learnt about India. The Le Cirque chef was born in India, but lived in Italy since he was three months old. He is Sirio Maccioni's neighbour in the town of Montecatini, near Florence. Maccioni is the Founder of New York-based Maccioni Restaurant Group, which now has two outposts in India - Le Cirque in New Delhi and Mumbai. Bhoite worked with Maccioni's restaurants in New York and Las Vegas before jumping at the offer to launch Le Cirque, New Delhi in September 2011.
"We started [with] more French [items] in the initial menu but then we saw that French was not moving with Indians. French cuisine was not flexible," Bhoite says. Indians, he figured out, were more familiar with Italian ingredients such as macaroni and spaghetti. "I have now added Italian names and ingredients to French dishes so that Indian customers can understand them."
So a pan-seared baby chicken was called by its French name Poussin in the initial menu at Le Cirque in 2011. He sold less than 15 a week. The name gradually changed to 'Baby Chicken'. "But then there are animal lovers everywhere. So we established the name as 'Corn-fed roasted spring chicken' now. This works really fine," the chef says. At Rs 2,650 a plate, he sells between 40 and 50 a week now.
Changing nomenclatures is just one of the customisation international outposts of fine dining restaurants do. What is true of fast food, is strangely true of gourmet cuisine. Restaurants will never be profitable if they serve classics from New York or London. About 60 per cent of the menu at Le Cirque in Delhi is chef-driven, locally. While big international names draw in the consumer with deep pockets, what keeps him is twisted-in-India dishes.
Five-colour rice cracker roll: This was created for vegetarians by Indian chefs at Wasabi, Taj Mahal Hotel's Japanese restaurant.
Indian gastrocrats are flocking high-end fine dining places not necessarily because of an understanding of foreign flavours. It is also a statement of economical gradation in some ways. Restaurants often tailor the menu for the Indian vegetarian 'gastrocrat'. He could also refuse to eat anything that grows below the ground. Le Cirque Mumbai has 38 items on its menu, of which 32 are profitable.
Italian chef Matteo Boglione came to India from New York and in his lifetime as a chef, has served Leonardo DiCaprio, Sarah Jessica Parker, Woody Allen, David Bowie, and Gwyneth Paltrow. After digesting the fact that even egg can be considered non-vegetarian in Mumbai, he now customises cuisines for the Jain community that forms 10 per cent of his clientele.
"My menu is 50 per cent vegetarian. It was tough for me, coming from Europe and America. But Jain food was even more difficult because they cannot eat garlic and onion. In Italian cuisine, there is garlic and onion everywhere," Boglione says. So in making the Italian tomato sauce, which traditionally has garlic and onion, Boglione infuses a lot of herbs such as basil and oregano instead. "I pump up the flavour from another source. The garlic and onion is not missed. I make Italian-Jain," he says.
Honey and orange infused duck tortellini: At the Le Cirque, New Delhi, old school French dish Ravioli au Canard a l'Orange avec sauce soubise was given a name with an Italian ring to it.
Indian chefs, however, started tailoring for Indian tastes two decades ago. Hemant Oberoi, the legendary chef of the Taj chain of hotels, had created a vegetarian Caesar Salad.
Instead of using raw anchovies, a salt water fish which is a desirable ingredient in the dish, or prawns, he made a dressing of yoghurt and served the fare with paneer tikka. "You can make an Italian salad more interesting. You can still do it well even if it might not be their way," he says.
So at Taj Lands End's Maritime in Mumbai, the outpost of London-based upmarket restaurant San Lorenzo, a favourite of the late Lady Diana, the former Princess of Wales, there are many options to suit every taste. In dishes where there is beef ragu, one could choose lamb ragu instead. There are dishes with Arrabbiata sauce since it suits the Indian palate more. It is a spicy tomato-base sauce with red chili peppers. "Octopus is not liked by many people. So we avoid octopus. It is chewy and tougher," Oberoi says.
Quinoa salad with basil ricotta, asparagus and pomegranate: An ancient grain from South America. Italian restaurant Travertino at The Oberoi, New Delhi, created this dish for vegetarians and health freaks.
At Wasabi, well-known Japanese chef Masaharu Morimoto's outpost at The Taj Mahal hotel in New Delhi, the menu is now mostly created by Indians. "Twenty-five to 30 per cent of Delhi's customers are vegetarians. Every veg dish has been created by us," Oberoi says.
He recently completed an asparagus promotion at Wasabi where he made teriyakis of asparagus and an innovative 'asparagus ghost' that came for Rs 1,600 a plate - the asparagus was stir fried with lotus stem and topped with a candy floss. A hot sauce was then poured over it; the candy floss gradually disappeared. That's the ghost act. Wasabi, Oberoi says, is profitable but the restaurant will not make huge profits because he is importing many ingredients.
There are fine dining restaurants, of course, that say they wouldn't bend much and profile guests based on nationalities. A former Italian banker Oscar Balcom and his Indian wife Gurpinder opened Artusi Ristorante e Bar, a restaurant in Delhi's Greater Kailash Part 2, three months ago. It serves cuisine only from Italy's Emilia-Romagna region. "There are no twists, no fusion, and no shortcuts at Artusi" its website claims.
Travertino, the Italian restaurant at The Oberoi in New Delhi, which has a partnership with the iconic Hassler Roma Hotel, is another.
"The number of vegetarian dishes may be on the higher side compared to Italy. We will sell more chicken than we would in Europe. We are a carbohydrate-friendly nation so the number of people opting for pastas and risottos will be more," says Rohit Gambhir, Executive Chef at The Oberoi, New Delhi, while adjusting his flashy red frames. "However, our guests are all well-travelled. The distinction in preferences is getting blurred."
The difference, he adds, is mostly in things like the doneness of the steak. Most Europeans will have it medium or less than medium. In India, it would be the other way round - medium-well. Doneness determines the flavour and colour. A 'medium' done steak would be mostly pink when cut into while a 'well-done' one is brown. Chefs also cook the pasta longer in India, about 10 minutes versus seven minutes in Europe. A chewy pasta is perceived as "raw" by Indians.
Travertino, nevertheless, does get its share of the weird. A guest once asked for a pasta platter. Chefs at the restaurant went helter-skelter, not knowing how to parcel a penne, spaghetti and tortellini, all with different sauces, in one plate. Such requests are getting rare.

Already Stores Start Christmas Shopping Frenzy EarlyStores start Christmas shopping frenzy early
Ben Popken TODAY
Summer isn't even officially over, but stores have already started trotting out their Christmas displays and holiday promotions.
If you're looking for someone to blame, look in the mirror, and take off that Santa hat!
Stores say they're doing this in response to customer demand. According to the National Retail Federation, 20 percent of all Americans have already started their Christmas shopping. By Halloween, they expect that number to double.
Video: Retail stores are already trying to entice holiday shoppers, and holiday displays are going up in early September. NBC’s Kerry Sanders reports from Clearwater, Florida.
In a cheeky nod to to the season, Kmart rolled out a "not Christmas commercial" in order to prime customers to begin socking away goodies for the holidays. It touts the chain's new "no money down" layaway program that makes it even easier to start a layaway plan.
In some ways that's gentler on consumers' pocketbooks. But the change makes the layaway plan a little more like a different form of credit, and a little less like a tool for budgeting and saving.
That's potentially problematic as layaway is sometimes a  choice of last resort for consumers who have either rejected or are unable to use credit cards . This year Americans are carrying more debt on their cards than they have in 6 years, totaling about 28 billion dollars. For some, that means they have less available credit. For others, it means they're more willing to run up a bit of debt for a while. 
After a lackluster holiday shopping season last year and middling back-to-school results, retailers are looking for low-risk ways to get shoppers to open up their wallets. Other retailers launched their layaway programs this month with looser rules as well, with Toys R' Us getting rid of its $5 service fee and Wal-Mart also easing up on its requirements.
It may seem like Christmas gets earlier every year but Kmart actually started promoting its layaway program the same time last year. The new normal is that "'tis the season" simply has a much longer ramp-up time to cater to interested customers. The rest of us just have to get used to seeing wreathes and pine cones mixed among the pumpkins and black cats on the store shelves.

Takoma Park co-op manager disappointed at developer picksBy Jonathan O'Connell September 12 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
(Sarah L. Voisin/TWP)
Four real estate teams are vying to develop a lot in Takoma Park, a project that could lead to a major expansion of the Takoma Park Silver Spring Co-op, which is next door.
But not all of that sits well with the managers of the co-op.
The four teams being considered for the development aren’t the only ones that submitted proposals; the city received three other proposals that were not named finalists, including one from the co-op itself.
The co-op’s proposal is  posted on its Web site, suggested an expansion of the co-op on the municipal lot, plus space for small and up-and-coming retailers.
The co-op is currently in about 5,500 square feet but has excellent sales, of about $1,300 per square foot annually. It would like to expand into 12,500 square feet, enough space to add a deli, bakery and meeting space, as well as offer a wider assortment of grocery items.
“What we were gong to do was expand this building to twice its size by building out onto the lot and then we were going to build a few small buildings to be used by small businesses such as a credit union, a coffee shop. It could also be used as an incubator,” said Marilyn Berger, director of administration for the co-op, in an interview.
It should come as little surprise that the co-op’s proposal was not selected, for a number of reasons. For one, the co-op has no experience building anything, as Berger acknowledged, a basic prerequisite in competing for public-private real estate projects.
Secondly, the municipal lot is zoned for housing and residential uses, as outlined in the request for proposals . Few municipalities would go through a complex public-private development process to end up with just a tad more retail and a surface parking lot.
This is particularly true for a site less than a mile to a Metro station. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments lists Takoma Park as one of the region’s  activity centers , meaning it is an area that is able to accommodate more growth in the future in a way that encourages sustainability and walkability. New housing is needed to achieve that.
Here’s a look at the site plan the co-op submitted:
(Courtesy TPSS Co-op)
Expansion for the co-op is still very much on the table, and Berger has said she had spoken to at least two of the development teams at some point about the co-op’s interest in expanding. “I’d say I’m guardedly optimistic because I haven’t seen the proposals,” she said.
Nonetheless after the city made its picks Berger e-mailed co-op members to express her concerns. Here is Berger’s e-email:
The City of Takoma Park has announced the four finalists for the redevelopment of the City owned parking lot adjacent to TPSS. They are The Ability Project, Community 3 Development, LLC, Keystar LLC and Eco Housing, and Neighborhood Development Company. The Co-op’s proposal will not be forwarded by the City Manager Brian Kenner to the Council for consideration.
Our proposal called for the expansion of the store in order to offer a broader product mix with a wide variety of price points and provide new space that would allow us to sponsor regular community programs that would continue to foster a strong Co-op/community relationship. Our plans also included space for local businesses, such as a wine and beer shop, a coffee shop or café and a credit union, all in an area lush with gardens, trees, and lawns. You can see the TPSS proposal by visiting our website.
 We are disappointed that the City planners have decided not to share our proposal with the Council to show there is an alternative to building housing on the lot while revitalizing the Junction. Of utmost importance for the survival of the Co-op, no matter which developer is chosen are: (1) A guarantee of business continuity during construction (TPSS must remain open for business throughout, (2) Access to our loading dock for 18-wheel trucks five or six days a week during construction and after, and (3) Sufficient available parking.
The four finalists will make public presentations on Tuesday, September 23 at 7:00 p.m. in the Takoma Park Community Center Auditorium. Please share this with your listservs and tell your friends and neighbors to attend to give input to developers, City Council and City Staff. The City Council will also discuss the proposals on Monday, September 29. Please watch for the information we will be sending you, and please help us protect the future of the Co-op by using every opportunity to show your support.
Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions.

The Indian textile and apparel industry is at a crossroads. With a long history and an established presence globally, Indian players have the chance to cash in on emerging opportunities. Arvind is a recognized brand with a history stretching over eight decades. In a chat with The Hindu, Arvind’s Chairman and Managing Director, Sanjay Lalbhai spoke about the industry, its prospects, and plans for his company going forward. Edited excerpts:
What has been the impact of the slowdown, and what are the opportunities for the Indian textile and apparel industry given the signs of revival in the economy?
The export of Indian textiles as a value chain is doing very well. This is because China is becoming more expensive. Of the global textile trade of around $800 billion, China accounts for 35 per cent at around $270 billion. Their business is growing at 10-15 per cent but at three times India wages and costs. As they continue to be expensive, their government too is not so supportive any more. India has a $ 40billion industry and will benefit from this. I believe we should grow at 15 per cent per annum. But the domestic market has not been at its best as the economy was going through a tough phase but the down-cycle impact was less severe as China’s share was coming here.
Barring denims, the industry players have not done very well. What are issues confronting the industry and is it ripe for consolidation?
In the past, overleveraging and trying to grow too fast without having the relevant consumer base has led to problems. I think the industry has created the highest non-performing assets (NPAs) for banks. A huge amount of assets were created without the proper management back-up. These were created due to subvention on TUFs and benefits. State government and the Centre gave funds at nominal rates. But this is a tough business, and growing fast without systems, processes and consumer base in place because of easy money has been one of the major negatives. Regarding consolidation, once you have created assets indiscriminately, who will buy them? To restructure is both difficult and unwieldy. Bankers are happy to sell us some of the distressed businesses at very lucrative terms but we are not willing to manage that as it is not a viable option. Finally what will happen is difficult to say.
Is further government intervention and help desirable to aid the industry? From an industry perspective, what could the players do to move up to the next level?
The government has already done a lot. The earlier government removed excise duty from the value chain, and the new government is waiting to implement Goods & Services Tax (GST). We have duty drawbacks, state-level incentives on interest subvention, and labour policies are being liberalized. We cannot complain that we are not doing well due to government apathy. As an industry, we do not have scale. Without garmenting happening in-house, getting more market share from China will prove difficult. Companies approach China even though they are much more expensive because they are completely vertically integrated and have huge scale that they get from their dormitories. Although we have scale in fabric, we do not have it in garmenting. At Arvind, we are building a large dormitory near Ahmedabad to house 10,000 women. It can make 15 million garments. We have bought around 42 acres for the purpose but we are awaiting government approval. In the first phase, we will invest around Rs.130 crore to make 6 million jeans in the next few months. But this is not enough and will need to be replicated.
What is the money spinner for Arvind, and what about the business model being followed of getting licences to sell foreign brands here? How does it impact your own brands?
All our businesses are running in excess of 20 per cent Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) which is the cut-off for us. The new business of technical textiles -protective textiles, industrial textiles, composites and non-wovens - has reached this level, and others are in different stages. Our own businesses like garmenting, denims, voiles, shirtings, and knits are growing at 20-35 per cent ROCE. As far as laggards are concerned, we will not continue something, if it is not working out. It has to have a logical game-plan. If we do not see potential, we will cut it out with no emotions attached. Among brands, 4-5 established brands are at good ROCEs, while half-a-dozen are operating profit positive but still bleeding. Debenhams is not doing so well while Next and Nautica are doing very well. We will keep looking for iconic international brands as the slot here is available. We keep looking at international opportunities but also establishing our domestic business – Arvind, Mega Mart, Flying Machine, Creyate etc. We also have a plethora of private labels coming through our on-line platforms because that is the most cost-effective way of delivering on-line private labels.
Are you still open to brand acquisitions? What is the ticket size you are comfortable with?
With consolidation happening, domestic brands are available. I would buy a well established brand at the right price. As far as ticket price goes, we would not like to leverage our balance sheet but if it is an interesting proposition, I could consider private equity. Because if your objective is to create value and not ownership and control, then money is not a constraint as people are willing to write a cheque if I agree to get a piece of the pie. Ticket size is restricted by our free cash flows, which are around Rs.700 crore. I will borrow Rs.200-300 crore working capital, increasing it each year. I am looking at total debt to EBIDTA and that has to keep on improving. The financial boundaries are very clearly established by the board, and for anything beyond that, we will go for private equity.
What about the newer forays like real estate and recent e-commerce venture performing?
We have very ambitious plans for real estate. There are a lot of investors entering India and they are not mandated to invest in real estate businesses and prefer our brand, retail and textile businesses. So we decided to give the real estate business back to shareholders of Arvind. It is being spun off and will be subsequently listed. The business has done very well in a bad market. We have 11 ongoing projects in Ahmedabad and Bengaluru. Although Ahmedabad has slowed down, Bengaluru has the appetite for 4-5 more projects. We will increase geographies only gradually. All new projects have come in as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and we are not leveraging the balance sheet. As regards our e-commerce business, we know how to build a brand, know about apparels, have design capabilities and have the supply chain in place. We will marry the e-commerce with this, and go through the omni channel. The Bricks and clicks business will have to co-exist as you need bricks to return rejects and to experience the products. We are well poised to deliver a lot of concepts and some niche products too. E-commerce is a high risk business with a different calibre of people. If the venture needs lot of funding, we could go the private equity way. Listing it is also a possibility.
What are the plans for your mainstay – textiles and apparels? Are there plans for an overseas foray?
While brands, retail, real estate and technical textiles are all exciting areas, in the old textiles space, the question remains how to create scale in garmenting. Do we stay in India or go to Africa because I believe that in 10 years, textiles is going to be all about Africa and not India because Indian textiles will remain for this market but the global business will move. Africa is going to be more competitive on labour cost, and, as a continent, is going to emerge as a large domestic play. They have bilateral treaties with Europe and the U.S. We are looking to set up manufacturing facilities in Ethiopia because of the excellent governance and the earlier mentioned advantages. We will start small to understand the geography, logistics and politics. Initially, we will start with exports to Europe and the U.S. The fabrics will go from here, and the initial investment will be in garmenting facilities which do not entail heavy capital expenditure. It is a measured initiative, and we will start very soon.

Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said recently that the automaker’s stock is ‘kinda high’
When Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk suggested recently that the electric car maker’s stock might be overvalued, some were listening. And Tesla shares are taking a big dip today.
Shares ended down 9.1% to $253.86 Monday after analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised questions about whether Tesla may have come too far, too fast. He still thinks it has room to grow, but at a more reasonable pace.
Apparently, Tesla’s CEO agrees with him. Musk recently said he thinks Tesla shares are “kinda high,” which knocked the shares down a little, but nothing like the whopping drop on Monday.

The man who has a Rs 2.5-crore bounty on his headEYE BROWSE
This Maoist leader has a Rs 2.5 crore bounty on his head
Maoist leader Ganapathy carries the largest bounty on his head, worth 10 ten times more than that offered for 'India's Most Wanted' Dawood Ibrahim.
Mail Today –  Tue 16 Sep, 2014
Print
(Photo: India Today Group)NEW DELHI: Dawood who? Top Maoist leader Mupalla Lakshman Rao also known as Ganapathy carries the largest bounty on his head, worth 10 ten times more than that offered for 'India's Most Wanted' fugitive and Mumbai blasts accused Dawood Ibrahim.
The rewards offered for Ganapathy total a whopping rupees 2.52 crore. The bounty has gone up from the Rs.49 lakh total after the governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh offered Rs.1 crore each to anybody who provides information leading to the Naxal leader's arrest.
Apart from these two states, Andhra Pradesh has announced a reward of rupees 25 lakh, Jharkhand Rs.12 lakh, and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Rs.15 lakh.
Ganapathy is the general secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The 65-year-old is considered the top leader of the armed rebel group whose professed aim is the violent overthrow of the Indian government. Intelligence inputs indicate the Andhra Pradeshborn rebel is now hiding in the thick forests of the Abujmarh region, a Maoist bastion in Chhattisgarh considered the headquarters of the rebels.
Reward
The bounty for Ganapathy is higher even than what has been offered for Indian Mujahideen members like Iqbal Bhatkal, Riyaz Bhatkal and Amir Reza Khan. A bounty of only Rs.25 lakh has been offered for the founding members of the terror group responsible for a series of attacks across the country, and who are now believed to be in hiding in Pakistan. While Delhi Police has offered Rs.15 lakh, NIA's cash reward for the trio is Rs.10 lakh.
Interestingly, the reward offered for India's most wanted terrorist, Dawood Ibrahim, is only rupees 25 lakh and this has not been revised for years. The rewards were announced by the CBI and Maharashtra government after the 1993 bomb attacks in Mumbai, following which Ibrahim fled to Dubai and finally to Pakistan. Despite the US announcing a bounty of $10 million for Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed, there is no reward offered by India for the alleged mastermind of the 26/11 attacks.
Besides Ganapathy, other senior Maoist leaders too have attracted large rewards. Sources said, all 21 members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India-Maoist carry a bounty of over rupees 1 crore each as some states have hiked the rewards on offer. Sources said till now the total amount offered for any information on the top leadership used to be between rupees 15 lakh and rupees 20 lakh each. The total amount on offer for information on the top leadership of the Maoist movement is nearly rupees 25 crore now.
With the Centre encouraging Maoist leaders to surrender, the increase in rewards is also part of a strategy to give an added incentive to them to quit the movement. "If they surrender, they will get the entire amount that has been announced for their arrest. In addition to this, they will get the amount that is given according to the surrender policy," said a home ministry official.
While every state has different economic incentives, the Centre last year put in place a policy giving enhanced packages to surrendered Maoists in addition to what states have to offer. The Centre increased the amount given to a surrendered Maoist from the range of Rs.10,000 - Rs.20,000 to up to Rs.1.5 lakh - Rs.2.5 lakh along with a bonus of up to Rs.25,000 for handing in sophisticated weapons. In addition to this, a monthly stipend of Rs.4,000 is on offer for a period of three years.
The number of surrenders has gone up this year, matching last year's figure of 283 till the end of August.

YO-Kai Watch: A legion of new cutesy Japanese monsters are set to break out all over the world2
0
Tokyo: Move over Pokemon, a legion of new cutesy monsters is haunting Japan and set to break out all over the world after trampling the competition at home.
"YO-Kai Watch" is a nexus of manga comics, anime cartoons and computer games that revolve around the life of a school boy and the monsters - "Yokai" - that he summons with his wrist strap.
While the name is unfamiliar in the West, it's already very big business in Japan.
"YO-Kai Watch" is a nexus of manga comics, anime cartoons and computer games that revolve around the life of a school boy and the monsters.
#japan #yo kai watch #manga #anime
"We bought a lot - about 20 items - as we can rarely buy them," Shoji Takayama said as he came out of a store with his wife, two children and a big plastic bag full of toys.
The family spent about 30,000 yen ($280) at YO-Kai Watch Town, a temporary shop on "First Avenue Tokyo Station", a street inside the Japanese capital's main train station.
"It's fun to catch Yokai and become friends," nine-year-old Naoya said of the video games. "The characters are cute," added his sister, Sae, 11.
Such is the demand that tickets to get into the store were distributed in online lotteries, allowing up to 432 people to visit every day.
The first group of customers included an eight-year-old boy who got an early Shinkansen bullet train with his mother from neighbouring Shizuoka prefecture and a middle-aged man with a handheld console in his back pocket.
Yuuichi Ishii, who runs the Toy Cats toy store in Tokyo, said the demographic spread of fans is indicative of how popular the monster-collecting phenomenon has become.
The secret to its success, he says, is its cute characters and the non-violent way the main character interacts with monsters - defeated ones aren't killed, but become friends.
"It's becoming like a second Pokemon," he said.
Folklore
Matt Alt, a pop culture commentator who co-authored "Yokai Attack!" a book detailing the monsters and spooks of Japanese popular culture, says the series draws heavily on folklore archetypes.
"These have been around for hundreds of years as folktales. And now this series has woven them together to make a new sort of content out of them," Alt told AFP.
Protagonist Keita Amano is an "average" fifth-grader (around 10 years old) who happens to get a watch that can summon monsters.
With the assistance of a "butler" monster and friends, he fights beings that trouble humans, beats them and befriends them.
YO-Kai Watch shares with its predecessor Pokemon "a very similar sort of collecting mechanism" said Alt, where the main character battles monsters and then owns them.
"The big difference between YO-Kai Watch and Pokemon, however, is that Pokemon is set in a pure fantasy world... whereas YO-Kai Watch is definitely set in at least a version of Japan," he said.
Events take place in Japanese streets, with children living in Japanese houses and eating Japanese food, he said.
"I think that's one of the reasons it's so popular with kids here, because it makes you feel like these monsters could be just around the corner," he said.
And that appeal is certainly paying off for the manufacturers.
Replica versions of the watch worn by little Keita - which allow the wearer to insert different medals to produce different sound effects - are in such short supply that their price has rocketed on online auction sites.
Bandai Namco Holdings said it would produce two million units this year, along with around 100 million medals, contributing to the eye-popping 10 billion yen ($93 million) worth of YO-Kai Watch toys they have sold in the six months from April.
And that's not including software sales.
YO-Kai Watch 2, developed by Level-5 for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console and released in July, saw its sales exceed 2.3 million units by early September, on top of over 1.2 million copies of the first version, released last year.
Financial data for the sales were not readily available, but the company confirmed plans to release products in foreign markets.
Level-5 president Akihiro Hino will be at the Tokyo Game Show when it starts on Thursday, just outside the Japanese capital.
Alt said he expected YO-Kai Watch would make the jump abroad, where Japanese companies are formidable because of the tight interweaving of their product lines.
"They all work together in what's called the media mix where the video game, the comic book, the animation, the toys all support each other," he said.
"Japanese toy companies have figured out a system for strengthening and cross-promoting their products that is unrivalled anywhere else in the world."

Shillong, Sept 16:  
The Meghalaya government today sought guidance from the Kolkata-based Indian Institute of Packaging to improve packaging of locally available agri-horticultural produce which are on high demand in the market.
“We need your guidance in packaging technology,” state’s Planning Principal Secretary, R M Mishra said while addressing a one day national workshop on packaging of fresh and processed food.
“Our farmers’ agri-horticultural produce are of high demand in the market, both domestic and international,” he said, seeking linkages which the institute could facilitate for the entrepreneurs here.
Mishra also sought advices on pricing and content of such packaging which he said would be helpful for the serious farmers.
According to the official, the state government is not only ‘serious’ with the job of empowering local entrepreneurs but also working overtime to see that value chains are created for their produce.
Citing example of local honey which are being sold in a whiskey bottle at Sohra (Cherrapunjee), Mishra, who also is the CEO Meghalaya Basin Authority, said the institute could help farmers identify better packaging solutions.
Over 220 entrepreneurs and farmers attended the one day workshop.

Tyre industry growth to touch Rs 493 b in FY 15: ICRAHome News Markets Companies Tech Economy Opinion Features Portfolio Catalyst BL Ink Multimedia Blogs

Tyre industry growth to touch Rs 493 b in FY 15: ICRA
Our Bureau
Tweet
Pune, Sept 16:  
Ratings agency ICRA expects the domestic tyre industry to grow by approximately 8% to Rs 493 billion during the current fiscal and achieve CAGR of 11%-12% during the next three years to touch Rs 623 billion by 2016-17.
The growth will be supported by around 6% domestic volume growth even as falling raw material prices will pressure tyre companies to pass these benefits to consumers in the replacement segment, it said in a statement.
According to ICRA, while lower natural rubber (NR) and crude oil prices could provide headroom for passing on benefits to the consumers, inflationary pressure on advertising, employees and some other consumables has increased significantly for several players in the industry over the past two years.
Despite the pressure on realisations, for 2014-15, ICRA expects the significantly softer NR prices to trickle down into margins, leading to stable and high operating margins of 13%-14%.
Subrata Ray, Sr. VP, Co-head, Corporate Sector ratings, ICRA Ltd, said, “Industry wide revenues for ICRA sample set comprising of nine major players grew by 5.6% during 2013-14 while operating and net margin expansion was higher by around 100 bps at 13.8% and 6.5% respectively.”
While the industry has continued to invest during the past several years, especially towards radial capacities, significant capital expenditure is expected between 2015-17, with investments for enhancing capacities-both green field and brown field in India and new capacities in other countries like Hungary and Bangladesh.
During 20143-14, tyre demand is estimated to have grown by a muted 1%, largely aided by two-wheelers and tractors, even as demand from LCV and PV segments fell. This follows a 2% de-growth witnessed by the industry during 2012-13 due to contraction in the high volume two wheeler and tractor segments.
Higher demand for tyres during 2014-15 is expected to be driven largely by Truck and Bus (T&B), PV and scooter segments. Replacement demand for T&B is also expected to grow as the economic activity in the country revives, thus leading to increased goods movement.

Drinking milk may keep your heart healthyDrinking milk may keep your heart healthy

London, Sept 16:  
Drinking milk and dairy consumption may lower your risk of high blood pressure, scientists say.
Based on nine studies with 57,256 individuals and 15,367 cases of hypertension, researchers found that as total dairy, low-fat dairy and milk (just over two cups a day) consumption increased, the risk for high blood pressure decreased.
“These meta-analyses indicate that there is a link between increasing the number of glasses of milk a day and a lower incidence of hypertension,” said Dr Sabita S Soedamah-Muthu from Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
Milk intake was not statistically significantly associated with risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and total mortality, researchers said.
In addition to reviewing the role of dairy and heart health, international experts at the 12th Euro Fed Lipid Congress in Montpellier, France presented data evaluating the effects of dairy products and dairy fat on chronic disease risk factors, such as cholesterol biomarkers, body fat accumulation and weight gain.
New research about milk fat and associated fat-soluble nutrients in infant formula to benefit brain development and to enhance elderly nutrition suggest an untapped nutritional value of dairy food components.

Decide maintenance plea afresh: sessions court to trial court in Delhi3

New Delhi: A sessions court has directed a trial court to decide afresh a maintenance case in which it had awarded Rs 1,600 per month to a woman in a domestic violence case, saying the order was passed on the basis of "presumption of the income" of the husband.
Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala set aside the magisterial court's order saying "it was expected that the trial court would have asked both the parties to file their respective affidavit and supporting materials. However, it did not do so.
"There is no limit of raising any presumption regarding the income of a person. Presumption in itself is not a very good criteria to assess the financial capacity of any party. To be nearer to the realistic figure, it is required that even presumptions are raised on the basis of some concrete
The judge noted that the trial court had presumed the man's income as Rs 8,000 per month, on the basis of prescribed wages under Minimum Wages Act for skilled labour.

PM Modi reaches Ahmedabad ahead of Xi Jinping s visit to the cityPM Modi reaches Ahmedabad ahead of Xi Jinping s visit to the city
FTIL opposes NSEL s amalgamation with itFTIL opposes any move for NSEL amalgamation
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM IST
Financial Technologies India (FTIL) has opposed the proposal of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) in which the commodity derivatives market regulator proposed a merger of the former with its offspring, the scam-hit National Spot Exchange (NSEL).
FMC, in its latest fortnightly report, said it had on August 18 asked the Union ministry of corporate affairs to consider the proposal, so that the resources of FTIL were also directed towards facilitating speedy recovery of dues from the defaulters on NSEL.
Countering this view, FTIL said the merger would directly affect the interests of FTIL and its 60,000 shareholders, 1,000-plus employees, lenders and other stakeholders.
“Under the Companies Act, the government can merge two companies only if this is ‘essential in the public interest’. The interest of the 13,000 clients of the brokers who traded on the NSEL platform for higher returns (trading clients) cannot be termed as ‘public interest’ when 66 per cent of the entire amount due is being claimed by just six per cent of the trading clients (i.e. only 781 persons). Further, the high court of Bombay in its August 22 order has questioned whether these trading clients were ‘genuine investors’,” FTIL said.
If the dues of the trading clients are considered ‘public interest’, then the interests of the 60,000-odd public shareholders of FTIL are equally the ‘public interest’. Should these shareholders of FTIL suffer a liability of Rs 5,500 crore (the extent of NSEL default) by the device of a forced merger, asks FTIL, when the very existence of any legal liability of NSEL and consequently of FTIL as its holding company, is before the high court?
FTIL notes the HC has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of a former judge to ascertain the liability of each of the 24 defaulting members of the exchange who traded on the NSEL platform and failed to honour their pay-in obligations.
FTIL has, without prejudice to the legal rights, supported NSEL in its recovery efforts and also extended a Rs 179 crore loan to alleviate the suffering of all the 6,600 small investors by paying 50 per cent of the dues. In addition, NSEL has recovered Rs 360 crore from defaulters and proportionately distributed this among trading clients, it argued. It has also, with support from FTIL, been making all efforts for recovery of the money.
There is no trail of the missing money leading to NSEL, FTIL or their managements, it further argues, citing the finding of the police and the observations in this regard by the HC.
In addition to properties worth Rs 200 crore attached by the enforcement directorate, the city police's economic offences wing (EOW) has attached properties worth Rs 4,900 crore and their liquidation process was underway. Further, EOW has identified 200 properties of the defaulters for attachment.
“While investigations and various legal proceedings are pending where actual facts are yet to be established, any action based on FMC’s recommendations towards merging NSEL with FTIL will irreparably prejudice and harm FTIL and its shareholders, employees, lenders and other stakeholders. Instead, the real solution lies in trading clients, the brokers and the government agencies joining forces with NSEL to ensure recovery of the money from defaulters, especially when 85 per cent of the money lies with only seven defaulters,” said FTIL.

KIOCL bags its first O&M contract from NMDCKIOCL bags its first O&M contract from NMDC
Mahesh Kulkarni | Bangalore Sep 16, 2014 05:46 PM IST
State-owned KIOCL Limited, a steel ministry undertaking and 100% export oriented unit, has bagged an operation & maintenance (O&M) contract from another State-owned mining major NMDC Limited. Under the three-year deal, KIOCL will operate and maintain the pellet plant set up by NMDC at Donimalai in Bellary district.
NMDC has set up Beneficiation Plant with capacity of 1.89 million tonnes per annum and 1.2 million tonne per annum Pellet Plant at an investment of Rs 650 crore. Both these plants are likely to be commissioned during the third quarter of current fiscal.
"Board of directors of both NMDC and KIOCL have approved the proposed O&M contract and the final agreement will be signed very soon," sources close to the deal told Business Standard.
This is a first such deal bagged by KIOCL Limited, which recently set up a new operation and maintenance business vertical.
The company, which shut down its own 7.5 million tonne per annum beneficiation plant at Kudremukh amidst eco-sensitive Western Ghats in Chikmagalur district, possesses expertise in operating and maintaining beneficiation and pellet plants.
KIOCL also operates 3.5 million tonne per annum pellet plant at Mangalore and sources iron ore from NMDC?s Bacheli and Bailadila mines in Chhattisgarh through sea and rail route.
Pellets are value-added products made out of low-grade iron ore or waste ore and are used as feedstock in steel making.
KIOCL?s engineers are trained in operating a pellet plant with either hematite ore or magnetite ore. When the company?s mines were closed in 2006, following a Supreme Court order, KIOCL engineers developed an in-house technology and converted their machinery to make use of hematite iron ore from magnetite ore used earlier, the sources said.
NMDC proposes to utilise the unused slime material from their tailing dam and convert them into Pellets. It also operates mines in Donimalai and Kumaraswamy hill ranges in Bellary district.
O&M contract will help KIOCL to gainfully utilise its experienced manpower. The company will deploy 45 engineers and another 140 other technicians and officials headed by a general manager at NMDC's plant at Donimali to operate and maintain the plant.
Under the deal, KIOCL will get an annual commission of Rs 31 crore from NMDC, which will be utilised to pay the salaries and overhead costs of the staff deployed at the pellet plant, the sources said.
NMDC intends to use a mixture of both fines and slimes, with Fe content of 55-58% as feedstock at its beneficiation plant, which will be upgraded to 64-65% Fe, The entire production will be sold to domestic steel mills, sources said.
It is also setting up a 2 million tonne per annum pellet plant in Chhattisgarh.

Didi called me  said bigger challenge lies ahead: Trinamools Biswas after defeat inbypollsPrint
Written by Shamik Chakrabarty | Kolkata | Posted: September 16, 2014 6:22 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 6:29 pm
In 2005-06, while playing for Mahindra United, Dipendu Biswas was diagnosed with a congenital heart problem. He was asked to quit football by the club doctors but Biswas put his foot down, consulted Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta and decided to continue.
Biswas hates to throw in the towel, be it sports or politics. A narrow loss to BJP’s Shamik Bhattacharya hasn’t subdued him. “I don’t consider this a setback. I think I’ve done well on my (political) debut. I had a big lead (about 17,000 votes) in the panchayat areas of my constituency (Basirhat South). I’m a little clueless about why we failed to keep the momentum going in Basirhat Town and Taki. Maybe it was our fault… We couldn’t convince the people about our mode of development. Overall, however, we’ve reduced the margin from 32,000 in the last Assembly elections to 1586 this term,” Biswas told The Indian Express.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called him after the result was declared. “Didi called me and exhorted me to get ready for the bigger challenges that lie ahead. (Trinamool Congress general secretary) Mukul Roy called me to inform that I would be their candidate in the 2016 polls as well.”
Ahead of the by-polls, Biswas, a local boy, had exuded confidence. “I’m like a brother to these people and they will vote for me. They will support me because I’m very serious about improving their living conditions. Drinking water and drainage are problem areas which need to be rectified,” he had said.
Now he says his defeat might prove to be a lost opportunity for the locals. “The Chief Minister is from our party. We’ve a sitting MP here. My victory would have accelerated the development process as far as infrastructure and facilities are concerned. Now we’ve to start afresh.”
For a sportsman, winning and losing are two sides of the same coin. Biswas had learnt this very early in career, when he was at the Tata Football Academy. He can take the rough with the smooth.
Biswas had burst onto the scene in 1996-97 and was immediately tipped as the next big thing in Bengal football. By then, he already had led the country at Under-19 level and the fans here embraced the teenager who revelled in goal-poaching.
In 1998-99, he became one of the top earners in the Kolkata maidan when Mohun Bagan gave him a Rs 12 lakh contract. It was the brighter phase of his career.
Then came a period of uncertainty following the heart problem. Biswas hung on gamely but had lost his mojo a wee bit as a footballer. Tenacity, however, has never been in short supply. Biswas already has an eye on 2016.
We couldn't convince the people about our mode of development. Overall, however, we've reduced the margin from 32,000 in the last Assembly elections to 1586 this term.

Pakistan heading towards civil war: Imran KhanChief Justice
(Imran Khan warned that…)
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan Monday appealed to Pakistan's Chief Justice Nasirul Mulk to save the country from anarchy, as he feels the country is heading towards a civil war.
Addressing the participants of his sit-in, the cricketer-turned-politician also warned that a bloody revolution would take place in case the peaceful protest was hindered, Geo News reported.
Imran Khan, who said 30,000 policemen have been deployed at the protest site, alleged that just as the sit-in concludes every night, the policemen start detaining innocent people, snatch their wallets and mobile phones.
He appealed to the Supreme Court to play its role in stopping police brutality in Islamabad where protestors are staging sit-ins against the government.
Highlighting the sacrifices rendered by people for the supremacy of the judiciary, Imran Khan said it was the responsibility of the Supreme Court to fulfil its constitutional role to safeguard democracy, Dawn online reported.
Imran Khan was engaged in a war of words with former chief justice Ifitkhar Muhammad Chaudhry after he accused the former judge of alleged involvement in rigging in the 2013 elections but expressed confidence in Chief Justice Nasirul Mulk.
Imran Khan warned that he would remove the containers himself and in case police stopped the protestors, it would result in clashes. He also announced he would hold a historic gathering at D-Chowk Friday.
The protests led by PTI chief and Pakistan Awami Tehreek's (PAT) Tahir-ul Qadri began Aug 15 in an attempt to overthrow Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , whom they have accused of rigging the 2013 general elections.

The 33 Assembly and 3 Lok Sabha seats bypoll results have surely come as a big shocker for the ruling BJP at the Centre. After a resounding victory in the Lok Sabha elections in May, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led BJP has tasted its first major defeat. The biggest shock for the BJP has come from Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.
In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP that almost swept the Lok Sabha polls has managed to win just 2 out of total 11 assembly seats that went to by-polls. The ruling Samajwadi Party has managed to stage a comeback by winning 9 assembly seats.
It has also retained Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat vacated by the SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. Since Mayawati led BSP did not contest in these elections, the BJP was hoping for a clean sweep eyeing the large chunk of Dalit votes. But, the results have proved the BJP calculations wrong. All 11 seats were earlier held by the BJP and its allies.
The BJP which was hoping to repeat its spectacular Lok Sabha performance in the state assembly elections due in March 2017 has been jolted by these results. A beaming chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said that the results had proved that Modi wave was waning in the country.
Shockingly, the BJP has lost 3 seats to the Congress in Modi's home state of Gujarat. Out of total 9 seats that went by-polls, the BJP has won just 6 seats. The BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat in May. It has retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat vacated by Prime Minister Modi.
In Rajasthan, the BJP has suffered a humiliating defeat. It has managed to win just one seat, out of the total four seats. The Congress has surprised everybody by winning 3 seats. An elated state Congress chief Sachin Pilot has described it as a victory of the workers of the Congress. He has also dubbed it as a vote against both the chief minister Vasundhara Raje and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Some good news for the BJP has come from West Bengal. It has won Basirath Dakshin seat and came second in the second seat Chowrangee. For the first time, the BJP has won a seat on its own in West Bengal. In Assam, the AUDF, Congress and BJP have won one seat each.
In Andhra Pradesh, the ruling TDP has won the lone Nandigama assembly seat. In Telangana, the ruling TRS has won Medak Lok Sabha seat by a huge margin. The Congress came second the BJP came third.
Independent candidate Rup Narayan Chamling Tuesday won the assembly by-poll from Rangang-Yangang assembly constituency in Sikkim. "He (Chamling) won the by-poll by a margin of 706 votes," said an election officer of Sikkim. The bypoll was necessitated after Chief Minister Pawan Chamling resigned from the seat and retained Namchi-Singhithang after the April assembly elections.
Rup Narayan Chamling defeated Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) candidate Kumari Manger, Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Bikash Basnet, and the Congress's Bishnu Prasad Adhikari.
The Sikkim Krantikari Morcha opted out of the fray this time. R.N. Chamling is brother of Chief Minister Pawan Chamling. Counting of the lone assembly seat in Chhattisgarh that went to polls will be on September 20.
According to political analysts, whatever may be the defence of the BJP, the fact of the matter is that it has lost a lot of seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, which it swept just four months ago.
Since the BJP is attributing everything to the leadership of Modi, naturally the questions are being asked or raised about the 'Modi' factor.
The spokespersons of the BJP are trying their best to disassociate Modi from today's results. However, buoyed by the victory, the opposition parties led by the Congress have started attacking the Modi led BJP government at the Centre.
Local factors usually play a big role in the by-poll results. Since it has suffered a big jolt in both Rajasthan and Gujarat, the BJP can't attribute the SP victory in UP to state government in power. Some analysts claim that the communal polarisation of voters has backfired in UP.
Amit Shah, who has just taken charge the national president of the BJP, has a lot to answer for.
Results:
BJP 1, SP 1 and TRS 1
Assembly - 33 seats (Votes of 1 seat in Chhattisgarh will take place on September 20)
BJP – 11

Jammu-Srinagar National Highway reopens for trafficflood
BRO and Army engineers restored the vital road link that remained closed for 13 days due to landslides triggered by incessant rains.
In a boost to relief efforts in the flood-ravaged Kashmir Valley, the Jammu—Sringar National Highway reopened for traffic on Tuesday after remaining closed for 13 days due to landslides triggered by incessant rains.
Engineers of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and Army restored the vital road link.
“After sustained effort by the BRO and Army Engineers, the Jammu—Srinagar National Highway has been opened today,” a Defence spokesman said.
He said multiple landslides were cleared with simultaneous deployment of engineers and specialist equipment coordinated by the Chief Engineer of Northern Command Headquarters of the Army based at Udhampur to restore this vital road.
“The Highway was reopened for vehicular traffic after remaining closed due to landslide and washing of a portion of Highway in Ramban district,” a police officer said.
On the intervening night of September 2 and 3, a five—km road patch was washed way in flash floods besides multiple landslides, sinking of road and flooding at various places in Ramban district.
“The Highway was reopened for only Light Motor Vehicles (LMVs)”, he said.
Over 3000 to 4000 vehicles, particularly trucks carrying supplies had been stranded on the Highway.
Earlier, the Military Engineers had restored the land link to flood—hit Kashmir Valley from Ladakh side on September 9 and cleared Sinthan Pass route via Kishtwar on September 13.

Modi govt created favourable atmosphere for India: PranabMukherjeePrint
Press Trust of India | Ho Chi Minh City | Posted: September 16, 2014 6:48 pm
On Tuesday President Pranab Mukherjee had some words of praise for the new Indian government as he credited it for not only initiating steps to bring the economy on a better path but also for creating a “favourable” atmosphere for India across the globe.
The president, who abandoned his written speech for an extempore talk during the Indian community reception in this historic city of Vietnam, also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for accomplishing a wonderful trip to Japan from where, he said, hopes of substantial Foreign Direct Investment are expected to be ploughed into India in the future.
“After the new government (led by Modi) came out with a massive mandate they also worked out…of course, it is too early to formulate cogent policies for the full five years and get it reflected in the plan document and other documents but the first budget presented by the new government outlines some of the crucial policies and there is substantially continuity and there is change (in policy) where it has been found necessary to do it.”
“One very positive aspect is that there is possibility of substantial FDI which was an important outcome of the Prime Minister’s visit to Japan. And it is expected that in the next five years, investment from Japan would be around USD 25-35 billion.
“Also, we had a very good interaction with the Australian Prime Minister during his visit to India in the last week. Our Prime Minister is expected to have detailed interactions with US President Barack Obama and therefore the international atmosphere is favourable and I am (also) visiting Vietnam at this juncture when two fastest growing economies – India and Vietnam – are also engaged in having cooperation and interaction,” he said.
The president also praised Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, the lone representative of the Modi cabinet on this four-day state visit, for taking steps for bringing down the prices of crude oil.
“I can congratulate Mr Dharmedra Pradhan because after assuming the office of the Petroleum Ministry, he has brought good luck to the petroleum (sector) in the sense that now the petroleum prices have come down to USD 93 per barrel and the prediction is that it will go further down. Unfortunately, when I was the Finance Minister, I did not have that privilege of buying petroleum less than USD 112-115 per barrel,” he said evoking a thunderous applause from the audience.

Bypolls: BJP wins one seat in Assam  increasesvote-sharePrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: September 16, 2014 6:35 pm
Contrary to trends in other states of the country, the BJP has not only registered significant vote-share gain in the assembly by-elections in Assam, but also added one seat to its kitty, taking the saffron party’s strength in the state assembly up to six at the expense of the Congress.
Election was held for three assembly segments – Silchar, Lakhipur and Jamunamukh – with the final results showing that the Congress, BJP and AIUDF winning one seat each. Of these, while BJP wrested Silchar from the Congress, the AIUDF and Congress retained Jamunamukh and Lakhipur respectively.
Pointing out the BJP’s gain, state party spokesman Adip Kumar Phukan said, “While we (BJP) wrested Silchar from the Congress, we also increased our vote share there by over 14,000 in comparison to the Lok Sabha election of May. The BJP vote-share has also increased marginally in Lakhipur.” While Silchar fell vacant after sitting Congress MLA Sushmita Dev was elected to Lok Sabha, election was held in Lakhipur due to death of Congress’s DP Goala.
The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) of Mumbai-based perfume tycoon and Dhubri (Assam) MP Badruddin Ajmal on the other hand not only retained Jamunamukh but further increased its vote share. Ajmal’s second son Abdul Rahim Ajmal won the seat. The Jamunamukh assembly segment fell vacant after sitting MLA and Badruddin’s brother Sirajuddin Ajmal was elected to Lok Sabha from Barpeta.
In Jamunamukh however the BJP’s vote share slid down from about 17,000 in the May LS elections to 13,868. In contrast, the Congress vote-share has jumped in Jamunamukh by about 17,000 in comparison to the May Lok Sabha polls.

In Sikkim, the ruling SDF lost the Rangang-Yangang assembly constituency to Independent candidate Rup Narayan Chamling despite the fact that the seat was won by none other than SDF supremo and chief minister PK Chamling winning it along with Namchi-Singhithang in the April assembly elections. Rup Narayan Chamling, who defeated SDF candidate Kumari Manger by a margin of 708 votes, incidentally is an younger brother of the chief minister.

Didi called me  said bigger challenge lies ahead: Trinamool s Biswas after defeat in bypollsPrint
Written by Shamik Chakrabarty | Kolkata | Posted: September 16, 2014 6:22 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 6:29 pm
In 2005-06, while playing for Mahindra United, Dipendu Biswas was diagnosed with a congenital heart problem. He was asked to quit football by the club doctors but Biswas put his foot down, consulted Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta and decided to continue.
Biswas hates to throw in the towel, be it sports or politics. A narrow loss to BJP’s Shamik Bhattacharya hasn’t subdued him. “I don’t consider this a setback. I think I’ve done well on my (political) debut. I had a big lead (about 17,000 votes) in the panchayat areas of my constituency (Basirhat South). I’m a little clueless about why we failed to keep the momentum going in Basirhat Town and Taki. Maybe it was our fault… We couldn’t convince the people about our mode of development. Overall, however, we’ve reduced the margin from 32,000 in the last Assembly elections to 1586 this term,” Biswas told The Indian Express.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called him after the result was declared. “Didi called me and exhorted me to get ready for the bigger challenges that lie ahead. (Trinamool Congress general secretary) Mukul Roy called me to inform that I would be their candidate in the 2016 polls as well.”
Ahead of the by-polls, Biswas, a local boy, had exuded confidence. “I’m like a brother to these people and they will vote for me. They will support me because I’m very serious about improving their living conditions. Drinking water and drainage are problem areas which need to be rectified,” he had said.
Now he says his defeat might prove to be a lost opportunity for the locals. “The Chief Minister is from our party. We’ve a sitting MP here. My victory would have accelerated the development process as far as infrastructure and facilities are concerned. Now we’ve to start afresh.”
For a sportsman, winning and losing are two sides of the same coin. Biswas had learnt this very early in career, when he was at the Tata Football Academy. He can take the rough with the smooth.
Biswas had burst onto the scene in 1996-97 and was immediately tipped as the next big thing in Bengal football. By then, he already had led the country at Under-19 level and the fans here embraced the teenager who revelled in goal-poaching.
In 1998-99, he became one of the top earners in the Kolkata maidan when Mohun Bagan gave him a Rs 12 lakh contract. It was the brighter phase of his career.
Then came a period of uncertainty following the heart problem. Biswas hung on gamely but had lost his mojo a wee bit as a footballer. Tenacity, however, has never been in short supply. Biswas already has an eye on 2016.
We couldn't convince the people about our mode of development. Overall, however, we've reduced the margin from 32,000 in the last Assembly elections to 1586 this term.

The women are also likely to be honoured by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
Continuing with a cherished homecoming tradition, Vrindavan widows will travel to Kolkata to celebrate Durga Puja on the invitation of various puja committees later this month. Over 50 women, widowed and shunned by their families in West Bengal, will participate in the festivities in the City of Joy for a week from September 25.
The women are also likely to be honoured by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other important State personalities. Delhi-based NGO Sulabh International, which takes care of all the needs of the over 1,000 widows in Vrindavan besides providing a monthly stipend, has made all travel and other arrangements for them.
“It is a novel idea for these widows, who now live a lonely life, totally cut off from society… They will get a break from their monotonous lives in the ashrams. Their trip to Kolkata is an effort to bring some joy into their lives and sense of belongingness. It is not just a Puja tour for them; they are going back to the land of their ancestors, back to their roots. It is a journey down memory lane for them… It is like a homecoming,” said SI founder and head Bindeshwar Pathak.
SI has drawn elaborate plans for their stay in Kolkata. Apart from participating in Durja Puja celebrations, they will enjoy rides on the historic tram, the Metro and ferry across the Hooghly. They will also get to visit the famous Kali Bari, Victoria Memorial and Chowringhee.

‘Fatty’ Arbuckle was the first comic star to emerge from the famous Keystone Kops. The writer traces his career
The biggest contribution of Mack Sennett, the father of silent film comedy, was the creation of Keystone Kops, the band of bungling comedians who were popular not only in the U.S. but also across the world. They have inspired many comedians in India such as Mehmood, Johnny Walker and Vadivelu.
The Keystone Kops were fictional, incompetent policemen who featured in silent film comedies in the early 20th century. The movies were produced by Mack Sennett by his Keystone Film Company between 1912 and 1917. Their first film was Hoffmeyer's Legacy (1912), but their popularity grew with the 1913 short film, The Bangville Police, starring the lovely Mabel Normand.
The expression ‘Keystone Kops’ became so famous that it found mention in many classic dictionaries of the English language. The celebrated Oxford Dictionary carries an entry that reads, ‘Keystone Kops: bumbling police characters in films made by Keystone, a US film company formed in 1912, remembered for its silent slapstick comedy films.’
The Encyclopaedia Britannica too carries an entry about the famous band of bunglers. “Keystone Kops, in silent-film comedies, insanely incompetent police force, dressed in ill-fitting, unkempt uniforms that appeared regularly in Mack Sennett’s comedy movies.”
The famous actors who appeared as the bungling band of baton-waving cops included Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, Al St. John, James Finlayson, Ford Sterling, Buster Keaton, Chester Conklin, Edgar Kennedy, and Charlie Chaplin.
Roscoe Arbuckle, popularly known as ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle (he weighed 12 pounds when he was born), was the first star to emerge from the famous Keystone Kops band. In spite of his increasing bulk, he was exceptionally agile with his body and hands. Sample this: He acts as a waiter in one film. He has his back to the customers and faces a shelf with plates and dishes. He throws a sandwich at a rich lady’s plate without looking at it and it lands right in the middle of the plate much to the lady’s astonishment.
He was the first comedian who introduced the now clichéd comedy business of cream-pie throwing, which at one time was a ‘must’ in any American slapstick. Arbuckle was an expert at pie-throwing. Many movies made during Hollywood’s Golden Era had pie-throwing as their theme, including the legendary Laurel and Hardy’s full-length film The Battle of the Century. (For some reason, pie-throwing did not find favour in Indian cinema. A noted director tried it in a Tamil film, making the actors throw rava uppuma at one another. It did not go down well with either audience or critics. No one tried it after that.)
Arbuckle was born on March 24, 1887 in Smith Center, Kansas, and passed away when he was only 46 in New York from a heart attack. The reason for his early death was the two trials for alleged murder and the consequent destruction of his career and life.
At the pinnacle of his fame, Arbuckle regretfully got involved in a sex scandal that rocked Hollywood, completely smashing his life and career. He was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe in a hotel room. He was found not guilty, but the damage was done and the prudish social boycott against him began. Hollywood companies paying a fortune for his films withdrew them from circulation, killing his career. Many books have been written about the trials and how he was crucified by the American public of that prudish era. To make a living, he began to direct cheap comedies under the name ‘Will B. Good’.
Fatty Arbuckle is still remembered by moviegoers in the U.S. and the Western world as one of the greatest masters of raising laughter without uttering a single word.

Government to soon double banks' commission for DBT scheme to 2 pc

Mumbai: Finance Ministry is in the process of finalising the commission to banks at 2 per cent of the quantum of funds they transfer to individual beneficiaries under the government's direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme.
"The issue of commission is in the final stages and the order will be issued for paying 2 per cent commission to banks shortly," Anurag Jain, joint secretary (financial inclusion and chief vigilance officer) in Finance Ministry said at a Ficci-organised banking summit through video conferencing on Monday.
The present rate of commission is 1 per cent. The government transfers money to the bank account of consumers of kerosene, LPG, among others, through its direct benefit transfer scheme to plug loopholes and ensure corruption free delivery.
"The issue of commission is in the final stages and the order will be issued for paying 2 per cent commission to banks shortly," Anurag Jain, joint secretary in Finance Ministry said.

Many analysts have been calling for limiting the subsidy deliveries, including PDS food grains, through the Aadhaar-linked bank accounts to curb corruption and ensure better delivery.
While speaking to reporters later, Indian Bank Association chief executive MV Tanksale said, "For all accounts whether under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana or otherwise, if subsidy is routed through the DBT scheme, 2 per cent of the total amount will be given to banks as administration cost."
This money will not be deducted from the consumers account but the government will spend additional 2 per cent. For instance, if a bank transfers Rs 100 crore a year as DBT payments, government will transfer Rs 102 crore to that bank. He said that the government has already approved 1 per cent commission for banks for every transaction under the DBT.
"We said our cost is 3 per cent (for every transaction under DBT) and they have agreed on 2 per cent," Tanksale said. Earlier in the day, addressing the same event, the Reserve Bank Governor Raguram Rajan had laid emphasis upon the need for banks to make all social sector mandates, given by the government, financially sustainable.

Jet packs for U.S. soldiers Yes  it could happenBy Dan Lamothe September 15 Follow @danlamothe
The U.S. military hasn’t been shy about its desire to use technology to develop a new generation of super soldiers. But here’s one effort that is sure to raise eyebrows: jet packs to make combat troops faster on foot.
The equipment is worn like a backpack as part of Arizona State University’s “4MM” project, according to a new video released by the school. That stands for “four-minute mile,” which researchers want all U.S. service members to be able to do while wearing the jet pack.
“In a warfare-type arena, this could be potentially the difference between life and death,” Jason Kerestes, a research on the project, says in the video. “If you think of a Navy SEAL or an Army soldier that has to get in somewhere quick and do whatever they’ve go to do, but maybe get out of there just as quickly … these devices can really help soldiers to not only accomplish their goals and succeed in their missions, but potentially save human lives as well.”
The video shows test subjects wearing the pack on treadmills, on a running track and on a city street. In some cases, they wear what looks like a motorcycle helmet while doing so.
The project is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Department agency that specializes in futuristic concepts, including sniper bullets that turn in mid-flight, vehicles that can dodge explosions and robots that can fix space satellites .

While it may be harder for investors to find high returns in this market, many good opportunities still exist with the right names, Pimco's Mark Kiesel told CNBC Monday.
The best investments can be found in industries with superior growth, both near-term cyclical growth as well as long-term secular growth, and are in industries with pricing power, he noted.
"Above all, we're looking for high barriers to entry. These are companies that have unique licenses, spectrum, permits or real estate that make them very good long-term investments," said Kiesel, the firm's deputy chief investment officer and managing director, in an interview with "Street Signs."
Here are his plays.
Energy
Cheniere Energy is a great play on the exporting of natural gas, which is expected to begin in two or three years, Kiesel said. He expects Cheniere to be exporting approximately 5 percent of the gas supply in the U.S. in about four or five years.

Targa Resources, which is involved in gathering, processing and fracking oil and natural gas, is benefiting from the boom in North America's Bakken region, he said. "This is a company that's growing at 20 to 30 percent a year. It's unbelievable."
Wireless
Verizon has 105 million subscribers, a growing average revenue of 5 percent, and $17 billion of free cash flow, Kiesel said.
"This is a company where the bond holders win and the equity holders win because of significant free cash flow," he added.
Lodging
For a "pure play on luxury," Kiesel likes Starwood.
"The business traveler is back. The consumer is finally travelling again."

Starwood North America's RevPar (revenue per available room) is up over 6 percent, occupancy is up 3 percent and the company is raising rates about 3.5 percent, he noted.
Wynn Resorts is Kiesel's play on Las Vegas. RevPar is up over 8 percent in the city and Wynn's occupancy is near 95 percent, he said.

On top of that, 73 percent of its future growth will come from Asia, where the company is spending $4 billion to build the most expensive casino in history, Kiesel said. He believes that will propel EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciate and amortization) growth 20 percent going forward.

India s infra market to reach $6.6 trillion by 2025: ReportIndia's infra market to reach $6.6 trillion by 2025, says PwC report

India's infrastructure market is expected to touch $6.6 trillion by 2025, which will be nearly 12.5 per cent of the Asia-Pacific, says a report. According to consultancy firm PwC, the Asia Pacific infrastructure market is expected to grow by 7-8 per cent a year over the next decade to over $53.6 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60 per cent of the world total.
The increase in infrastructure spends in the country is likely to be driven by sectors like housing , telecom, healthcare, education, transportation, among others, it said.
Overall, India's share of the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to continue to grow, reaching around 12.5 per cent or $ 6.6 trillion by 2025, PwC said in its report.
According to the report, transportation and utilities investments are expected to triple over the coming decade as income and travel demand will rise and the country's population will increasingly congregate in urbancentres.
The ongoing development of technology services sector, as well as demand from households, is likely to drive investment in telecommunications infrastructure.
The population is expected to grow much faster than other countries in the region, which will further boost demand for infrastructure sectors serving households, the report said.
While annual healthcare investment is forecast to grow around $37 billion by 2025, education infrastructure spending will likely to reach $18.9 billion. The huge growth in infrastructure spending will be driven by key factors such as Asia's economic growing prominence, trade competitiveness, and the current widely recognised infrastructure deficit across the emerging markets of this region.
Asia is now the world's primary growth engine, with China, India and Southeast Asia offering a very large consumer base and low-cost workforce, with high levels of natural resources, PwC India Leader Capital Projects and Infrastructure Manish Agarwal said.

Pakistan warplanes kill 20 militants in northwestPress Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: September 16, 2014 12:57 pm
Pakistan’s military says its warplanes have targeted three militant hideouts in a Taliban stronghold near the Afghan border, killing at least 20 insurgents.
An army statement says Tuesday morning’s “precise” air strikes also destroyed two ammunition depots of militants in the Khyber tribal region in the country’s northwest.
The identity of the dead was not immediately known and the military gave no further details. Pakistani tribal areas are off limits to journalists.
Pakistan is a key ally of the United States. The latest airstrikes come at a time when the country’s security forces are carrying out a major offensive against Pakistani Taliban and foreign militants in the troubled North Waziristan tribal region.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen attends a Board of Governors meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington on Sept. 3.  (Susan Walsh, AP)
Sometimes it’s what’s missing or been edited out of a document that provides the best information. That could be the case Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve ends its two-day meeting and releases its latest policy statement.
Fed watchers will be scouring the document to see if the phrase “considerable time” is still included. If not, it likely means the first interest rate hike from the Fed will come sooner than expected next year. That change in timing could cause a fresh bout of market volatility.
Low rates have been a key driver of the bull market in stocks. Wall Street doesn’t expect the Fed to raise short-term rates, now pegged near 0%, until mid-2015. But that forecast is likely to be pushed forward if the Fed deletes its “considerable time” terminology. It has pledged to keep rates low for a “considerable time” — or roughly six months, says Fed chair Janet Yellen — after the end of its bond-buying program, which could come as early as October.
“Some (investors) are interpreting this prospective change as indicating that the (Fed) will start raising rates in March,” says Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA.
He disagrees. The Fed is “likely to move cautiously considering the surging dollar, weakness in Europe and fear of repeating (last year’s) ‘taper tantrum’ sell-off,” he says. Also, “The removal of the words ‘considerable time’ would be accompanied by language emphasizing that future rate (moves) are data dependent.”
For now, Grigoli says he’s not changing his “positive approach” to the market.

Two-buck stocks: 66 fall to $2 or lessTwo-buck stocks: 66 fall to $2 or less

Got a buck? That’s basically enough to buy up a piece of some companies you probably remember fondly.
There are 66 companies – worth more than $90 million – that trade primarily on a major U.S. exchange for $2 a share or less. Some of these companies are fallen heroes of days gone by, including gadget seller Radio Shack (RSH) , surfwear maker Quiksilver (ZQK) and teen retailer Pacific Sunwear (PSUN) .
Falling under the two-buck barrier is clearly not where companies want to be. They face trouble raising money – or worse yet – possibly getting booted from the exchange. Some of the sub-$2 companies are big hits of days gone by.
Remember when you needed a cord for your Betamax? Your first stop was Radio Shack. Now, you can buy a share of the company for less than what you spent on the cord.  A buck and six cents. Some investors think the stock might be in play – as a real-estate grab by an online retailer. But as time wears on, RadioShack’s LED clock radio gets dimmer.
Chart source: MSN Money
Surf’s up – for most stocks – but not Quiksilver. The surfwear company that made tubular threads in the 90s – is struggling mightily. It’s expected to lose money until 2016. Seems like the whole surf look is wiping out. Ah …  Pacific Sunwear. You probably bought your first Ocean Pacific shirt there in the 80s. Or, you don’t know what an O.P. shirt is. Now the stock is trading for less than the price of a nylon and Velcro wallet.  A buck — 97 cents.
Chart source: MSN Money
When stocks get this low, investors know it’s not sustainable. Radio Shack said it’s looking for options. But the longer it takes for a stock to get above $2, the fewer of those options that exist.
Below are five of the stocks listed on major U.S. exchanges, worth $90 million or more, that trade for $2 or less:

Paul was appointed to take additional gubernatorial charge of Mizoram and Manipur as the resignation of Manipur governor Vinod Kumar Duggal, who was holding additional charge of Mizoram, was accepted by the President on Thursday last.
Duggal had submitted his resignation on August 27. Student organisations in Mizoram have been protesting against the Centre saying that the gubernatorial post of Mizoram has been made like a musical chair.
Mizoram Governor Vakkom Purushothaman was transferred from Mizoram to Nagaland by the NDA government on July six, but he refused to occupy the Kohima Raj Bhavan and submitted his resignation on July 11.
Gujarat Governor Kamla Beniwal took over as the Mizoram Governor on July nine, but was sacked exactly a month after she was appointed as the state governor. Governor of neighbouring Manipur Vinod Kumar Duggal, was appointed as the Mizoram governor on the day Beniwal received the marching orders.
Maharashtra Governor Kateekal Sankaranarayanan was transferred to Mizoram on August 23 to replace Duggal. However, Sankaranarayanan refused to be transferred to Mizoram and resigned on August 24.

Melbourne, Sept 16:  
Australian vets have successfully removed a life-threatening tumour from the brain of a goldfish in a 45-minute-long ‘high-risk’ operation. The 10-year-old fish, called George, is now expected to live for another 20 years.
“George had a quite large tumour on the top of his head that was growing slowly, and it was beginning to affect his quality of life,” said Dr Tristan Rich, from the Lort Smith Animal Hospital, who carried out the operation.
George’s owner, from Melbourne, was given the choice between an operation or having the fish put to sleep. She decided to have the pet operated upon.
The fish was put under general anaesthetic for the $200 procedure, according to ‘BBC News’. The fish was kept alive by pumping oxygenated pond water through its gills and Rich described the operation as “fiddly”.
Rich told Melbourne’s 3AW radio station that the fish was now “up and about and swimming around”.

"The centre currently employs 60 people, with the aim of expanding this to approximately 300 in the first year. AstraZeneca has committed itself to the development of the region by employing locally and will outsource IT services only by exception," Smoley said.
The company is also looking to develop additional technology centres with a second GTC planned for San Francisco in 2015.

BJP loses 13 of the 24 seats held by it, cedes ground to SP in U.P., and Congress in Rajasthan and Gujarat
The BJP on Tuesday suffered a major blow in the Assembly by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the States it had swept in the Lok Sabha polls four months ago, losing 13 of the 24 seats held by it.
The BJP has suffered electoral reverses in all the three rounds of by-elections held after it swept the Lok Sabha polls four months ago.
The saffron party, which got majority on its own in the Lok Sabha riding a “Modi wave”, has got a rude shock in the third round of by-elections, losing ground in key states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home State of Gujarat.
Out of the 32 Assembly seats across nine States for which counting of votes was taken up on Tuesday, BJP won 10, Congress seven and Samajwadi Party seven while the TDP, the Trinamool Congress, the AIUDF and the CPI(M) bagged one each. One seat in Sikkim was won by an Independent. In three seats in UP where results were awaited, the BJP was leading in two and Samajwadi Party in one.
It was Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was on a high after a near-total sweep of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, that delivered a humiliating blow to the saffron party as it lost seven of the 11 seats held by it, including one held by its ally Apna Dal.
The BSP’s absence in the by-elections had made it a virtual straight fight between the SP and the BJP in the politically crucial State.
Equally crushing was the defeat in Rajasthan where BJP conceded three of the four seats to the Congress, which also managed to wrest three of the nine seats in Gujarat, where the elections were held for the first time in 12 years with Mr. Modi at the helm.
All the seats in Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9) and Rajasthan (4) were held by the BJP and the bypolls were necessitated after the MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha.
The first bypolls were held in Congress-ruled Uttarakhand close on the heels of the May 16 Lok Sabha verdict. The outcome had shocked the BJP as the Congress had won all the three Assembly seats including two seats which were held by former BJP Chief Ministers who were elected to Lok Sabha by comfortable margins.
The second round saw the party losing six out of the 10 seats in Bihar, despite a formidable show in the Lok Sabha polls.
Seat adjustments among arch rivals — JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar and RJD’s Lalu Prasad besides the Congress — forced the BJP to beat a retreat as the three parties together won six seats.
As the BJP again suffered reverses in the Assembly bypolls, the Opposition said that the results should ring alarm bells for the BJP and the Modi government.
This meant that an anti-incumbency factor has set in within 100 days of the Narendra Modi government coming to power, Congress General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed said.
“If you look at these results, these bypolls have proved to be bye-bye polls for the BJP,” NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi remarked.
The bypoll results have come as a shot in the arm for the Congress as it gained three seats each in Gujarat and Rajasthan after drawing a blank in Lok Sabha polls.
Gloating over the BJP’s reverses, the Congress and the SP called it as a defeat of the communal forces. They said people had rejected the Modi government and the BJP’s “politics of polarisation”.
The BJP, which is hoping to do well in the coming Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, conceded that the bypoll results were not up to its expectations and said that people had voted on local issues.

Chinas strength in hardware and Indias in software can be mutually beneficial: Narendra Modi to ChinesemediaPrime Minister Narendra Modi addresses people on Tuesday. (Source: PTI Photo)
Express News Service | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:08 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 7:12 pm
Here is the full transcript of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with Chinese media organisations ahead of Xi Jinping’s visit.
Prime Minister: Good Morning to everybody. Shall we start? I am going to Ahmedabad today. After becoming Prime Minister, this would be my first meeting in Gujarat. The Honorable President of China is reaching there tomorrow. It is a great thing for us to be able to welcome the Honorable Chinese President in Gujarat. I think it is good that the Chinese President has decided to include Gujarat in his itinerary, during his visit to India- not just because Gujarat is the home state of Prime Minister Modi; but it also has enormous historical and cultural relevance for India-China relations and also Gujarat-China relations. The state in China from where the Honorable Chinese President comes from, there is a small town in that state and with that town, the people of Gujarat have had old relations. They were one of the first ones to go and set-up business in that town. The monk Xuan Zang, who came to India from China in 600 AD, went to Gujarat and stayed in the village where I come from. Through the medium of Buddhism, India and China, especially China and Gujarat have developed very close relations. From this perspective also, his coming to Gujarat reminds us of a relationship that is of special historic and cultural significance.
Question: China regards India as a natural co-operative partner. The Chinese government views China-India relations as one of its diplomatic priorities. Hon’ble Prime Minister, I would like to hear from you, in the future, what can the two countries do to make the relationship an even closer one?
Prime Minister: Thank You very much for that question. I think that the special and unique nature of India-China relations rests in the fact that India and China are bound by history and connected by culture. India and China both have rich traditions. India and China today constitute almost 35% of the world’s population. From a purely arithmetic point of view, the betterment of 35% of the world’s population and eradication of poverty; that they decide to work together will open big gates for progress and development in the world. It will not take long for the rest 65% to rise as well. Arithmetically, if 35% of the world’s population was to work together and to improve the economic conditions of its people through poverty alleviation method; then not only will 35% of the world’s population grow enormously, but this will also lift very speedily the rest 65% of the world’s population. If you go back 300 years into history, the largest GDP contribution in the world used to come from India and China, who together contributed more than half of the world’s GDP. Not only from the perspective of arithmetic, India and China also have common chemistry. Whenever India and China have worked and grown together, this has also led to the development and economic prosperity of the world. You would have heard that in India, we call sugar in Hindi as ‘cheeni’. It is not known as ‘cheeni’ for nothing. It is because of the Chinese technology that we were able to refine the sugar and make it pure and hence the people of India, started calling sugar as ‘cheeni’. There is a history of deep ties between our people and between our countries. The arithmetic and chemistry of our relations convinced me that together we can script history and create a better tomorrow for all of mankind.
Question: China has launched new Silk Route initiative in recent years. Will the New Silk Route be an opportunity or threat to India in future?
Prime Minister: The ancient trade routes in Asia included the Silk Route, the Spice Route and many other such routes. These were the channels of vibrant trade in the region and beyond and anchor of Asia prosperity. As important, these routes promoted the exchange of ideas, cultures, art, religion and spiritualism. India, which was at the centre of several of these trade routes, shared its age-old wisdom with societies along these routes. You are very well aware of the spread of message of peace of Lord Buddha through the ancient Silk Route. It left a lasting impression on the Chinese civilisation. India also benefited from Chinese technology such as sugar refining. It is for this reason that sugar in India is called Cheeni. Successful revival of the ancient trade routes require not only physical connectivity and requisite infrastructure, but even more important, a climate of peace, stability, mutual trust and respect, support for mutual prosperity and free flow of commerce and ideas. I believe that the re-emergence of the natural trading routes would make a major contribution to building a prosperous Asia in this century.
Question: What do you think China and India can do together to promote peace and development in Asia and the world as a whole?
Prime Minister: India and China are two ancient civilisations that have contributed much to this world through the ages. Today, we are the world’s two most populous countries and its two largest emerging economies. The simultaneous transformation of our two countries, on a scale and at a speed that probably is unprecedented in history, provides enormous opportunities for our two countries to reinforce each other’s growth and, at the same time, sustain Asia’s economic resurgence and advance prosperity in the region. We can do this by further strengthening our strategic communication; enhancing mutual trust and confidence; showing sensitivity to each other’s concerns and interests; continuing to maintain a climate of peace, stability and tranquillity in our relations; and, seizing the opportunities for bilateral cooperation and international partnership.
Question: Mr. Prime Minister, Now the whole world recognizes you as a strong, practical, and decisive leader of India. China has high expectations of improvement in relations with India since you took office in May. Your government also attaches high importance to dealing with neighbouring countries.
How would you re-define the Indo-China relations in the 21st century, especially in current world situation? What’s your blueprint or road map to develop the bilateral relations in your 5 years term? In the election campaign, you have blamed the previous government for lacking the capacity to implement various promises; such as those on foreign policy. How do you propose to make a difference on upgrading India-China relations to a higher plane?
Prime Minister: You have raised several important questions.
My government also attaches high priority to relations with China. China is our largest neighbour. Relations between neighbours are always of special importance to each country, because their destinies are inter-linked. That is why I have also placed special emphasis on India’s neighbourhood. But, I don’t see our relations with China only as a neighbour, with which we have had millennia old contacts. China is important for the future of this region and the world.
There is a consensus that 21st century is Asia’s century. If we look back in history, India and China had accounted for over 50% of global GDP about 300 years ago. We were the main sources of technology and ideas in the world. Our two civilisations have shown tremendous resilience and are now once again important centres of economic growth and innovation. The centre of economic gravity is shifting towards Asia. As I said, the transformation of the lives of 2.5 billion people is a phenomenon of great significance for the region and the world. Besides, in our inter-connected and inter-dependent world, all countries stand to benefit through enhanced cooperation.
We seek a closer developmental partnership. India can benefit from China’s strength in hardware such as creation of infrastructure and development of our manufacturing sector. These are the areas where India wants to make rapid progress. On the other hand, India’s strength in software can help Chinese companies to become more efficient and competitive. It offers opportunity for Indian companies to export services to China. With joint efforts, we can strengthen our economic partnership. Enhanced tourism between us would help to increase people-to-people understanding. We can both benefit from a stronger regional and international partnership between our two countries.
I am also committed to realising India’s full potential as also the promise of our international partnerships through appropriate policies and timely implementation of our national and international commitments. I want to create an enabling environment in India that unleashes the enterprise and energy of our people and fully harnesses the benefits of international partnerships.
For enhancing and further strengthening bilateral relations, we should show mutual sensitivity to each other’s concerns and aspirations, follow the principle of mutual and equal security, seek closer developmental partnership and enhance people-to-people exchanges to create better understanding. I am looking forward to deepening our engagement across the full spectrum of our bilateral relations, but also seeking progress on issues of concern, because resolution of these issues will transform the atmosphere in our relations and allow us to realise the full potential of our relations.
Question: In the formal invitation presented to Chinese President Xi Jinping by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, you invited Mr. Xi to visit Gujarat. The one reason we know is that Gujarat is your home state. Are there other special reasons or meanings for visiting there?
Prime Minister: It is my effort that when foreign leaders visit India, they should also have opportunity to see places other than New Delhi. It will give them a fuller idea of India and its diversity. Relations between nations, especially large ones like India and China, should not be placed in the narrow confines of capital cities and major metropolitan centres. China’s connection with Gujarat is very old. In ancient days, there were vibrant trade relations between Gujarat and China. Chinese Monk Xuan Zang had spent a long time in Gujarat. In present day, many Chinese businesses have established manufacturing units in Gujarat and vice-versa. Chinese leaders have expressed interest in visiting Gujarat as they wish to understand the “Gujarat Model” of economic and social development.
I just wanted to say one final thing. I would like to give a new terminology to my tomorrow’s meeting with the Chinese President. I call it “Inch towards Miles”. INCH that is “India-China”; towards MILES that is- “Millennium of Exceptional Synergy”. I believe that tomorrow’s meeting will mark a happy beginning towards this goal of “Inch towards Miles”.

Will make green norms for industries more stringent: JavadekarWill make green norms for industries more stringent, says Prakash Javadekar
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 19:55 IST
The government will make environment norms for industries more stringent, but at the same time these will be practical, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Tuesday.
The minister also emphasised balancing economy with growth, and said poverty is the "biggest polluter".
"A few days back we made environment norms for cement industry more stringent. We want to do the same for all other industries," Javadekar said, addressing a conference organised by industry lobby CII.
"However, the norms must be practical. If the industry wants three, it must be five, not ten... But whatever the norms are, compliance must be 100 percent," Javadekar said.
The minister added all stakeholders would be consulted in the process to ensure complete compliance once the norms are laid down.
Javadekar said untreated discharge in rivers is a major concern, specially in the Ganga, which the government has promised to clean.
"When we studied Ganga from source to where it merges in the sea, we found one-third of industrial waste and two-thirds of agricultural waste... and one-third of domestic waste was being discharged into the river untreated," he said.
The minister said that at least 40 industries along the Ganga have been closed down recently for non-compliance of environment norms. Another 146 industries have been given notice to comply with the norms by March 2015, he added.
He stressed on balancing growth with environment protection.
"Poverty is the biggest polluter. We cannot have sustainable development without eradicating poverty," said Javadekar.
Speaking earlier at Global Biodiversity Information Facility Governing Board's conference, Javadekar said India stood committed to developing "biodiversity informatics" as an essential element of India's economic, environment and social well-being.
"India is in the process of building a comprehensive and decentralized biodiversity information infrastructure to serve the national interests and to provide inter-operability with regional and global initiatives," said Javadekar.
The minister on Tuesday also met school children to mark International Ozone Day.

New Delhi: Development agencies in their layout plans of plots measuring more than 3000 sqm have to contruct underground water storage tank and roof-top water harvesting system as per the draft regulations for "green" buildings, as proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021.
Also all hospitals, commercial, industrial, hotels, restaurants and auto workshops will have to make arrangements for primary effluent treatment within the plot. "Delhi Lt Governor Najeeb Jung has directed Delhi Development Authority to finalise the draft regulations for approval by the Central Government," said a LG house official.
As per the draft regulations, developmental agencies have to also make arrangements for recycling of treated waste water with separate lines for potable water and recycled water and recharge ground water through rain water harvesting.
Also all hospitals, commercial, industrial, hotels, restaurants and auto workshops will have to make arrangements for primary effluent treatment within the plot.

Further, treated sewage effluent should be recycled for non-potable uses like gardening, washing of vehicles and cooling towers. "These are to be implemented by all the concerned local bodies as part of processing of building permits within their respective jurisdiction," said the official.
The MPD-2021, as a part of mid-term review, was amended vide Gazette Notification dated September 23 last year to incorporate green building concepts. Lt governor also reviewed the operationalization of incentives for 'green' buildings following which TERI made a presentation highlighting provisions related to Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) rating, policies adopted by other state governments and local bodies.
"The proposal relates to providing incentives with respect to enhanced FAR, ground coverage, and property tax rebate etc. "Further, the monitoring system to ensure continuous on site compliance and performance and disincentives for non-compliance were also discussed," the official added.

Infrastructure  construction sector growth may remain stressed in FY15Sep 16, 2014 at 06:24pm IST
Infrastructure, construction sector growth may remain stressed in FY15

Mumbai: Growth of infrastructure and construction as well as metals and mining sectors is likely to remain stressed in FY15 as high leverage levels may constrain the ability of some corporates to access credit, India Ratings and Research, a Fitch Group company, said in a report on Tuesday.
Sectors such an infrastructure and construction as well as metals and mining may remain stressed in FY15. Only substantial improvements at the operational level would cause a meaningful improvement in their credit profile, given the high leverage levels and negligible cash generation ability of corporates in these sectors.
The high leverage levels may constrain the ability of some corporates to access credit, it said. This could prevent some of these corporates from tapping growth opportunities that a domestic economic revival may present. These sectors may require significant equity capital infusions or large-scale asset sales to pursue growth, India Ratings said.
Sectors such an infrastructure and construction as well as metals and mining may remain stressed in FY15.
#infrastructure #fy15 #construction #fitch group
Sectors like construction and infrastructure, as well as metals and mining, besides power have also been forced to tighten their working capital management, since the availability of credit has been constrained by the weak investor sentiment associated with these sectors, it said.
However, it said that a number of financial indicators suggest a bottoming out of the credit profile of BSE 500 corporates. FY14 was the first year since FY11 when the corporates' (excluding banking and financial services) y-o-y growth rate of aggregated EBITDA (14.1 per cent) and funds from operation (FFO; 18.4 per cent) exceeded the growth rate of balance sheet debt (13.8 per cent) and interest expense (10.2 per cent), the report said.
As such, the number of sectors (nine) showing directional deterioration in operating performance as well as credit metrics is lower than in 2013, the report said.

SABMiller guns for hold in the premium strong beer market with Miller ACESABMiller guns for hold in the premium strong beer market with Miller ACE
BS Reporter | Bangalore Sep 16, 2014 07:04 PM IST
SABMiller India, the second largest beer player in India, is attempting to shore up its share in the strong beer segment through a new launch. The company which has close to around 25% of the Indian beer market dominated by United Breweries with a good 50% share primarily with its Kingfisher beer, has announced the launch of Miller ACE, in the premium strong beer segment, which is among the fast growing segments in India.
SABMiller best known for Haywards 5000, Knock Out, Foster Gold, has debuted Miller ACE positioning it as American style premium beer, brewed with imported barley and which is part of SABMiller's Global Premium brand portfolio.
Darioush Afzali, Marketing Director of SABMiller India, said: "With the rising of disposable income levels and aspirations of consumers in India there is a growing need for premiumization across categories including the demand for premium beer brands with an ABV between 5% and 8%. We would like to offer consumers of spirit brands an opportunity to switch to a premium beer in certain occasions."
The premium beer segment has been growing faster than the overall beer industry and grew at a rate of almost 40% CAGR over the past two years. SABMiller is launching this product as an extension of its Miller brand in India, which saw Miller High Life premium lager debut earlier.
SABMiller's attempts to have one more product in the strong beer market comes even as Kingfisher Strong which has a strong presence at as much as 85 million cases sold during last year. The strong beer market accounts for a good 80 per cent of the overall beer market in India.

Mining glitches for HindalcoMining glitches for Hindalco
Ujjval Jauhari | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 09:35 PM IST
The concerns on copper and aluminium major Hindalco’s domestic operations continue to increase. Even while analysts were contemplating the likely impact of the Supreme Court’s decision on coal mine allocations, the bauxite mining bans in Jharkhand has raised fresh concerns. Five of its bauxite mines in Jharkhand have been closed by the state government. Various analysts estimate about 35-45 per cent of Hindalco’s captive requirement being met by these impacted mines. Thus, any prolonged disruption (or closure) of mining activity will adversely affect Hindalco’s profitability. Factoring the cost differential between captive and imported bauxite, Espirito Santo’s analysts see an adverse impact of Rs 7.1 a share on their current fair value of Rs 155 for Hindalco.
The good part, say analysts, it that unlike the coal block issue which is to be decided by the court, the bauxite mining issue can be resolved faster by the company and the government. In this backdrop, the stock closed about two per cent lower on Tuesday, versus Sensex’s 1.2 per cent fall.
However, the market remains more concerned on the fate of coal blocks that are important to Hindalco’s profitability and earnings in the long run. While analyst have not factored its impact on Hindalco’s earnings till FY17, the market is a bit nervous which reflects in the 10 per cent decline in the stock from Rs 182 levels in August-end to Rs 160 now.
Among coal blocks under question, while Hindalco’s Talabira-I mine supplies 2.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of coal to meet one-third of its requirement, Talibra-II and Mahan are essential for fuel security of its Aditya Aluminium project and 359,000 tpa greenfield smelter at Mahan, respectively, say analysts. The Mahan block’s inland location makes imported coal an unviable option due to inland freight costs, whereas the reducing e-auction coal volumes from Coal India on the back of fuel supply agreements would impact availability and costs of coal for the facility, estimates analysts.
This increased uncertainty on both coal and iron-ore mining seems to have taken a toll on the company’s plans for raising funds also. Hindalco, which had plans to raise Rs 5,000 crore through qualified institutional placement, has reportedly postponed it for now. The fund raising was being looked at in positive light as it would have helped reduce Hindalco’s debt which has increased from about Rs 24,000 crore in FY10 to Rs 64,000 crore in FY14 due to on-going expansions.
These mining issues are also casting a shadow on the likely gains in the business. Though LME aluminium prices are down five per cent from its recent peak, it is still about $100 a tonne higher on sequential as well as year-on-year basis. Likewise, copper treatment and refining charges and prospects for Novelis remain healthy. Clarity on the mining issues should provide direction to the stock.

First comet landing site to be revealedUpdated: September 15, 2014 10:47 IST
First comet landing site to be revealed
IANS
Reuters An artist's impression handout image by the European Space Agency shows the Rosetta orbiter deploying the Philae lander to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.
TOPICS
science and technology
The European Space Agency (ESA) has planned to reveal the site selected for the first landing of a comet this week.
Philae, a landing module weighing about 100 kg that is part of Rosetta (robotic space probe), will probably touch down on Nov 11 on the surface of Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which the unmanned spacecraft has been orbiting and observing from a distance of less than 100 km since Aug 6.
The ESA announced Aug 25 the five possible landing sites, photos of which scientists were examining in detail for three weeks to work out the operating and orbital strategies needed to get the probe to each one.
To do that, Rosetta approached to about 50 km from the comet, which allowed scientists to “gather more detailed information about each site”, in particular high-definition photos of the comet’s rocky, dusty and uneven surface, temperature readings and pressure measurements of the density of the gas surrounding the nucleus.
The ESA on Monday will announce the prime landing site and a backup site, and discuss what the specific challenges are with each one, and also other scientific results acquired so far.
Authorities have warned that the landing manoeuvre will be “complicated” and could last several hours because of the relatively small mass — and corresponding very light gravity — of the comet, which looks something like a potato the size of a mountain.
Once the probe has landed and attached itself to the surface, it is expected that Philae will be able to deliver valuable information to scientists for a period of about four months.
The orbiting module will continue observing the evolution of the comet’s activity through the end of 2015.
Rosetta was launched in 2004, and, over the past 10 years, has travelled almost 6.4 billion km on its odyssey to try and obtain data relating to the solar system’s origin.

Bypoll results: BJP faces setback in UP  RajasthanBJP suffers reverses in by-polls
BS Reporter | New Delhi Sep 17, 2014 12:57 AM IST
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), after a resounding performance in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections earlier, has suffered serious reverses in by-elections held on Saturday, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where it had won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats. In what might suggest new communal polarisation across the country, the results to by-polls on 36 seats (three Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly) show BJP has lost many of the seats it previously held and yielded space to the parties it had vowed to dislodge — the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Badruddin Ajmal’s All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF).
Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party has won eight of the 11 Uttar Pradesh Assembly seats that went to polls — either because the candidate had died or had resigned to contest the Lok Sabha elections.
BJP’s principal face in the state for the by-polls was Yogi Adityanath, who has been served a notice by the Election Commission for making communally provocative speeches.

SP’s Tej Pratap Singh trounced BJP by more than 100,000 votes in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat vacated by his granduncle and party chief, Yadav. This seems to suggest that BJP President Amit Shah’s remark — that only members of Mulayam Singh Yadav’s family won the Lok Sabha elections — did little to turn the tide.
Significantly, 10 of the Assembly seats that went to polls in the state were previously held by BJP and were vacated by legislators who became members of the Lok Sabha. The party managed to retain only three of these, including Noida (formally known as Gautam Budh Nagar), which saw only 33 per cent voter turnout. The party lost Rohaniya, on the outskirts of Varanasi, where Modi addressed a mammoth gathering only a few months ago. The seat was vacated by the Apna Dal’s Anupriya Patel, who had joined BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
In Gujarat, the nine Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat were seen as a litmus test for the new chief minister, Anandiben Patel. Here, the Congress made inroads into the BJP bastions: While BJP won six of the Assembly seats, it was beaten by the Congress on three — Deesa, Mangrol and Khambaliya — considered BJP strongholds. The party retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after also winning from Varanasi. But BJP candidate Ranjanaben Bhatt’s margin of victory on this seat came down. She defeated her Congress rival Narendra Rawat by around 329,000 votes, compared with Modi’s victory by 570,000 votes.
The Rajasthan by-poll result was clearly in the Congress’ favour, indicating anti-incumbency had set in early. Of the four seats, the Congress won three — Weir, Surajgarh and Nasirabad — and the ruling BJP bagged Kota. This was no surprise, given that Kota, an urban constituency, was under Modi’s spell since the Lok Sabha polls.
BJP, however, made a handsome gain in West Bengal, where it won its first seat since starting to contest Assembly elections 15 years ago. It bagged the Basirhat Dakshin seat, defeating the Trinamool Congress. The net loser in the state was the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which came third. The Trinamool Congress also won the Chowringhee seat. BJP also got a major shot in the arm in Assam, where it won the Silchar Assembly constituency. The CPI(M) managed to win a seat in Tripura.
In Andhra Pradesh, where BJP had posted gains earlier, did not do very well this time. The lone Assembly seat that went to polls was won by the Telugu Desam Party, while the Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana was retained by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi.

Drug firm Zydus Cadila has received a tentative nod from the health regulator USFDA to market Glipizide tablets, used for treatment of diabetes, in America.
"Zydus Cadila has received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to market Glipizide extended release tablets in the strengths of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg," Zydus group's listed entity, Cadila Healthcare , said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
According to IT company IMS health, the estimated sales in 2014 for Glipizide ER tablets is US $90.1 million, it added.
"The group now has 97 approvals and has so far filed 249 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) since the commencement of the filing process in 2003-2004," Cadila Healthcare said.
Shares of Cadila Healthcare were trading at Rs 1,291.20 per scrip, up points (or 0.30 per cent) in the afternoon on the BSE.

State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, on Tuesday cut its interest rate offering for medium-term deposits by 0.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent, citing slower-than-expected pick up in advances.
However, the public sector bank increased rates for shorter tenor deposits of 180-210 days by 0.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent per annum.
"In view of abundant liquidity coupled with slower-than-anticipated credit pick up, State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to cut the deposit rates by 0.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent," the PSU lender said in a statement.
The downward revision of rates, which is applicable from September 18, is for deposits between one and three years, SBI said .
The PSU lender added that with the inflation trending down - consumer price inflation for August eased to 7.80 per cent - the rate adjustment will continue to ensure that the depositors are compensated "adequately with a positive real rate on their deposits."
It can be noted that banks have been complaining about issues in credit offtake, even as the sentiment has improved following the formation of a stable government at the Centre.
The system's year-on-year increase in credit stood at 10.94 per cent for the fortnight ended August 22, which is almost at par with the 10.61 per cent observed in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Jayalalithaa assets case: verdict postponed to Sept. 27heads of state
The Special court will shift to a temporary location for pronoucing the verdict.
The Special Court in Bangalore will pronounce verdict on the disproportionate assets case against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on September 27.
Also, the court will shift to a temporary location on that day in view of security to be provided to Ms. Jayalalithaa for her personal appearance.
The court postponed the date for pronoucement of verdict to September 27 from earlier fixed date of September 20 to enable the city poice to make security arrangements at Gandhi Bhavan, near Prappana Agrahara central prison, where the court will prononuce its verdict.
Gandhi Bhavan is the same location where the court had recorded Ms. Jayalalithaa's statements in 2011 by temporarily shifting to this location in view of security to be provided to her.
Ms Jayalalithaa had, on Monday, requested the court to shift to a safe place in view of her security.

Kurds in Europe take up arms against IS groupThere are no exact numbers on how many people have left Europe to fight the Islamic State group.
Associated Press | Koege | Posted: September 16, 2014 4:26 pm
Shaho Pirani says he’s just a phone call away from leaving his quiet life in Denmark and joining Kurdish forces battling against Islamic State militants in Iraq.
The 30-year-old Kurd, who fled from Iran with his older brother in 1991, says he feels a moral duty to help the Peshmerga, the armed forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government, to fight the “psychopaths” of the Islamic State group.
“I feel so helpless,” Pirani said in an interview in his home in Koege, a tranquil Copenhagen suburb with neatly trimmed lawns and hedges. “I am ready to die for the Kurdish cause.”
While more than 2,000 Europeans are believed to have joined the Islamic State organization and other jihadist groups as foreign fighters, a smaller number has left Europe in recent months to fight against the Islamic militants, primarily with Peshmerga forces in Iraq’s Kurdish north, Kurdish Diaspora leaders and security officials say.
Unlike with Islamic State fighters, however, European governments don’t show any intention to stop the Kurdish volunteers from getting involved in the conflict. Though they, too, stand to get weapons training and combat experience and could return traumatized by the horrors of war, the Kurdish fighters are not seen as a threat to the West.
“Our focus as a security service will be more on groups like IS and not people going to defend areas against the IS,” said Trond Hugubakken, spokesman for the Norway’s PST security service.
Traveling to participate in an armed conflict is rarely a crime in itself, so European security officials say they act only if they suspect a fighter has committed war crimes or might engage in terrorist activities after returning.
There are no exact numbers on how many people have left Europe to fight the Islamic State group. But Mehmet Tanriverdi, deputy chairman of the Kurdish Community in Germany, said he knew of “dozens” of Kurds who had traveled from Germany and other European countries to join the Peshmerga.
Shwan Zulal, an associate fellow at King’s College and the director of London-based Carduchi Consulting, said the stream of Kurdish fighters from Britain was “nowhere near the number of people that have gone and joined ISIS.”
British authorities might be “somewhat worried” about Britons volunteering to join Kurdish forces, Zulal said. But he could not imagine anyone being prosecuted for “fighting the United Kingdom’s enemies.”
Britain, Germany, the U.S. and other countries are sending light weapons and ammunition to the Peshmerga. Aided by American airstrikes, the Kurdish forces have recovered some territory seized by Islamic State militants in recent months.
Edmond Messchaert, spokesman for the Dutch Justice Ministry on counter terrorism, said Dutch Kurds are not being blocked from joining the Peshmerga and would not be prosecuted on return unless they committed war crimes.
It is not as clear-cut when continued…

Government likely to stick to budgeted borrowing planGovt likely to stick to budgeted borrowing plan in second half of fiscal

The government is likely to stick to its scheduled borrowing programme of Rs 2.3 lakh crore for the second half of the fiscal.
The borrowing programme for the second half of the fiscal (October-March), according to sources, will be decided at a meeting between the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India on September 26.
"Government borrowing is expected to be in line with the budget announcement. Second half borrowing is likely to be unchanged," sources said.
The government borrows from the market through issue of T-bills and dated securities to meet the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit for the 2014-15 financial year has been pegged at 4.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
"The fiscal deficit target is ambitious, so increasing borrowing now can put the government in a precarious position," sources said.
The government, however, could tinker with its borrowing programme towards the close of 2014 in view of the performance of the economy.
The gross market borrowing through issue of dated securities in current fiscal has been pegged at Rs 5.97 lakh crore, Rs 34,000 crore higher than 2013-14 fiscal.
During the fist half, the government has pruned the borrowing programme by Rs 16,000 crore to Rs 3.52 lakh crore, with the objective to provide more liquidity in the system.
Besides other things, the realisation through disinvestment will have a bearing on the market borrowing programme of the government.
The government has already laid down the roadmap for stake sale in four major public sector undertakings (PSUs) - SAIL, ONGC, Coal India, NHPC - which could fetch the exchequer Rs 46,000 crore, more than the budgeted target of Rs 43,425 crore.
Also the government's tax revenues look optimistic as the indirect tax collection rose 4.6 per cent in April-August period to over Rs 1.94 lakh crore.

From E. coli to Ebola: A device that can filter deadly pathogens out of the bodyBy Abby Phillip September 16 Follow @abbydphillip
(Wyss Institute)
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has claimed at least 2,500 lives, and a treatment or vaccine is still at least months or years away. But what if deadly viruses like Ebola can be effectively treated without the need for a vaccine?
Researchers at Harvard University, led by bio-engineer Donald E. Ingber, are in the process of developing a medical device that is optimized to fight a wide range of diseases by simply mimicking and enhancing the blood-cleansing properties of the human spleen.
In the seemingly never-ending battle to catch up with nature's killers, Ingber's work is a promising and potentially game-changing development: a device that filters deadly pathogens out of the blood and allows the body's immune system to catch up. And it is effective against at least 90 ailments, including Ebola, E. coli and HIV.
In a paper published in the journal Nature Medicine on Sunday, Ingber's team found that of a group of rats that were infected with deadly levels of E. coli or staphylococcus, 89 percent of the ones whose blood had been filtered by the device survived, compared to 14 percent who survived with no blood filter.
The device itself functions like a dialysis machine. It removes blood from the body, filters it, then returns it to the body. The key innovation, however, lies in a single protein that naturally occurs in the human body that was genetically modified to maximize its pathogen-fighting abilities with the fewest side effects.
In a healthy immune system, the protein, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), naturally attaches to carbohydrate molecules found on bacteria, viruses and fungi, and it helps trigger the immune system response that allows the body to destroy those invaders.
This process works fine for most people. But when infections turn deadly, it typically is because the virus has overwhelmed the body's natural ability to fight it.
Sepsis , the result of a toxic buildup in the blood of dead pathogens that result from the body's immune system response to invasion, is the dark side of this process. It can can lead to fever and low blood pressure and eventually lead to multiple organ failure.
In Ebola patients, for example, with no cure or therapy, while the virus attacks the immune system, doctors can only try to support patients' bodily functions with rehydration and fluid replacement so they can live long enough for their immune systems to fight the virus.  Researchers believe there may be similarities between septic shock and how the Ebola virus eventually kills its human host.
Addressing the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organization’s director general didn't mince words, saying, "Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, this health crisis we face is unparalleled in modern times." (Reuters)
"Infection is a battle," said Ingber, who is also the founding director of Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. "And you basically hit a tipping point where the invader is overcoming your ability to fight them."
At that point, a few things happen. When the immune system kills pathogens, it leaves behind fragments of the bugs that are toxic. A build up of these dead pathogens "triggers a cascade to inflammation that can lead to multiple organ failure," Ingber said.
The naturally-occurring form of MBL also causes another adverse effect: excessive blood coagulation.
To create this device, Ingber's team genetically modified MBL to keep the best parts -- its ability to identify and bind with a wide variety of pathogens -- while getting rid of the worst features -- its role in activating inflammation in the body and causing blood coagulation that both lead to septic shock.
Magnetic nano-sized microbeads are then coated with the genetically modified proteins. When the blood goes through the device, the MBL proteins bind to it, then are pulled out of the blood -- toxins attached -- through magnetic forces.
(Wyss Institute)
"Clean" blood then reenters the body, which allows the immune system to regroup and catch up with its invader.
The next phase of his team's work will involve more animal trials on a more simplified device. And team members are also working on using a magnetic particle that they can be more certain completely leaves human blood before it goes back into the body. (There are several particles FDA approved to cleanse blood already in use in other devices, for example.)
The potential implications are as big as they are widespread. While it isn't a cure for the viruses and infections that ail us, the device could provide life-saving support to an immune system under siege by deadly invader, without the use of antibiotic drugs that increase the population of drug-resistant bacteria.
"There’s a huge need for treatment of patients with sepsis, especially because it increases antibiotic resistance," Ingber said.

People power prevails as irate Pakistani passengers offload Rehman MalikPeople power prevails as irate Pakistani passengers offload Rehman Malik
BS Web Team |  Sep 16, 2014 05:26 PM IST
Politicians have often been accused of misusing the power given to them to reap the benefits of VIP treatment. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Rehman Malik’s arrogance  received a rude shock from co-passengers, who were allegedly kept waiting for two and a half hours, aboard PIA's flight PK-370 when they barred him from boarding the flight.
Adding to his embarrassment, a video shot by a passenger captured the whole drama where irate passengers accused Malik and another politician Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwan of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz, for the delay went viral on the internet today.
PIA passengers throw Rehman Malik off the flight. by aeronuaut
Passengers could be seen shouting at the former minister on his arrival.
“We have taken it for too long... 68 years... are we going to take it for another 68 years?", one passenger can be heard saying.
Another passenger shouted, "Malik sahab, You should go back. You should apologise to these passengers. You should be ashamed of yourself... 250 passengers have suffered because of you."
The flight was scheduled to depart from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport at 7 PM but it was reportedly delayed by two and a half hours.
Malik in his defense, tweeted the following:
I hv right to defend myself agst the allegation.PK370 /1900hr was delayed b/c tech reasons/was expected to leave at 2030. So no delay for me
— Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik) September 16, 2014
He also added that it was the airline’s fault and not his as the delay was due to a technical reason.
am now leaving by pk 300 and now in the plane.50 minutes delay has been announced who shd be blamed for this delay.PIA or me?Obviously PIA
— Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik) September 16, 2014
Anger against the former interior minister quickly poured on to the popular micro-blogging website, Twitter. The incident sparked a debate regarding the misuse of VIP treatment given to politicians leading to  blatant disregard for public.

Mahindra in talks to buy Peugeot s scooter unit: ReportSave precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: After a choppy start in the two-wheeler space, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), India's largest utility vehicle maker, is in talks with European automobile major — PSA Peugeot Citroen, for a tie-up in the scooter space, three people close to the development told ET.
M&M has been engaged in a discussion with Peugeot for several months. The discussions revolve around sharing technology and a distribution tie-up across geographies, both in Europe and India and other emerging markets.
"M&M's keen interest lies in vehicle platform, hybrid and electric technology and for Peugeot it may be to get a toe-hold into India through two wheelers at a relatively lower cost and expand later into the car segment. There is a growing market for premium twowheelers in the country and Peugeot scooters could be ideal fit for present and for the future," said one of the three people in the know of development requesting anonymity.
When contacted, M&M's spokesperson said, "As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation." The French car maker in an official response to ET said, "PSA has no comment."
The French automobile company last April, in a presentation unveiled 'Back in the Race', a plan that aims to accelerate the recovery of the group. "This roadmap clearly includes Peugeot Scooters. The specific activity plan will be presented in the coming weeks," the spokesperson for the group told ET.
According to a newswire agency the scooter business of PSA has been loss making for over a decade. In 2013, it sold 79,000 vehicles which was a gain of 8.2%. The unit employs nearly 500 people in France and 300 people at a joint venture in China.
Back in Europe, Peugeot has been facing stiff competition from the European scooter leader Piaggio. At the end of 2012, PSA closed an engine plant for the scooter business concentrating production at a factory in Mandeure in eastern France.
Part of its turnaround plan was the three-wheeled Metropolis, which was introduced last year. The original target of making 7,000 units a year has been scaled back to 4,000, reported the newswire.
The agency added, Carlos Tavares, CEO of PSA Peugeot Citroen said on French radio RTL on September 14 that the scooters business was a drag on the group and a solution to end the burden was in the works.
Another person in the know of the development said "there is a small chance of Peugeot wanting to sell off the scooter business. Instead, they want to improve their business and make it sustainable. A tie-up with M&M may be one of the options. Both Goenka and Tavares already share a very good working relationship (thanks to the past Mahindra Renault tie-up). Both of them have had a several rounds of discussion already."
In a recent interaction with ET, Pawan Goenka, ED, Mahindra & Mahindra, said, M&M is always interested and is open for M&A opportunities in the automotive space.

PM gets acclaim & blame;nothing personal against Singh: RaiPM gets acclaim & blame;nothing personal against Singh: Rai
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 04:55 PM IST
With his new book creating a major controversy, former CAG Vinod Rai today said he has nothing personal against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but all the "acclaim and the blame" has to be taken by the head of the government.
Rai's remarks about the alleged inaction of the former Prime Minister during various scams have generated sharp reactions from Congress party leaders, while other political parties have used his observations to hit back at the previous UPA regime.
The former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said that Singh should also get credit for taking prompt action with regard to ordering of coal block auction, after certain irregularities were brought to his notice.
"The Prime Minister is the head of the government and he may not have any role in the decisions which some of them, like Commonwealth Games he was not directly responsible for any thing.
"But ultimately the acclaim and the blame, both have to be taken by the head of the institution. In that respect, I have brought it out and nothing personal," Rai told PTI in an interview.
"It is certainly not to do with an individual," he said.
Giving an example, the former CAG said, "Our Indian team went to England to play cricket and in all the Test matches we performed very poorly.
"Didn't the blame of it come to very large measure on the captain of the team? May be a large number of players did not function or play properly, but the blame had to be taken by the captain."
Rai further said: "If I am the CAG today and if something goes wrong in my organisation, even if I did not have a role to play in it, the responsibility revolves around me.
"I give you the classic example that six, eight months back, when Navy had some accidents, the chief resigned on moral responsibility but he did not have any role to play in those accidents but the responsibility revolved around him," he said.
Rai's new book, 'The Diary of the Nation's Conscience Keeper -- Not Just an Accountant', talks about various issues observed during his 2008-2013 tenure as CAG, including on Singh's role at times like 2G and coal block allocations.
Reacting to Rai's observations, Singh said on Sunday, "I, indeed, did my duty. Well, I do not want to comment on other people what they have written."
Asked for his comments on this, Rai told PTI, "That was his way of interpreting duty and it is perfectly fine because no two individuals would react similarly in a particular situation. If you were sitting on that seat, you would have had a different interpretation. That is perfectly natural.

Islamic State shoots down Syrian war planeIslamic State shoots down Syrian war plane

Islamic State fighters shot down a Syrian war plane using anti-aircraft guns on Tuesday, the first time the group has downed a military jet since declaring its cross-border caliphate in June, a group monitoring the civil war said.
The plane came down outside Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa city, 400 km (250 miles) northeast of Damascus, during air strikes on territory controlled by the group, a resident said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group which gathers information from a network of activists on the ground, reported five air raids on Raqqa on Tuesday. Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the organisation, cited sources close to Islamic State as saying the plane had been shot down.
US President Barack Obama last week authorised air strikes against Islamic State in Syria, potentially widening action against a group already being targeted by US air strikes in Iraq.
The Syrian air force has been bombing Islamic State-controlled territory in the provinces of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor on a near-daily basis since the group seized the Iraqi city of Mosul in June.    
Syria has offered to join a coalition the United States is assembling to fight Islamic State, but Western governments see President Bashar al-Assad as part of the problem and have ruled out the idea of such cooperation.

SC raps Centre for being sloppy in checking femalefoeticidePress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:13 pm
On Tuesday the Supreme Court rapped the Centre for being “sloppy” in checking female foeticide in the country, saying laws are not being implemented and everything is being left to fate.
A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra directed the Centre and all state governments to give details of what action they have taken to implement Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act that prohibits pre-natal sex determination.
“What are you(Centre) doing? You make law but don’t do anything to implement it and leave it to the fate,” the bench said.
“You are becoming sloppy on the issue and appropriate authorities are not taking any action at all,” it said.
It directed that Centre to file affidavit through Additional Secretary of Health and or any other concerned Additional Secretary which shall clearly indicate what steps have been taken and what results have been achieved to stop female foeticide.
The bench also directed that Health Secretaries of the state to file affidavit within four weeks. It, however, granted six weeks time to Jammu and Kashmir to file the response in view of state being devastated by recent floods.
“We may hasten to add that the affidavits shall be comprehensive and must reflect sincerity and responsibility. It should not be an affidavit in formality,” it said.
The apex court had on March 4 last year directed the Centre and state governments to take quick and tough action against people indulging in female foeticide and had passed a slew of directions for effective implementation of PNDT Act.
It had directed the governments to map all ultra- sonography clinics within three months and asked the lower courts to dispose all cases for violation of the Act within a period of six months to bring the accused to book.
It had also said that special cell be constituted by the state governments and the Union Territories to monitor the progress of various cases pending in the courts under the Act and take steps for their early disposal.
The court passed the order on a PIL by NGO Voluntary Health Association of Punjab urging it to intervene in the matter in view of decreasing number of girls boys ratio in the country.
The average count of girl child (0-6 years) in the country has dropped to 914 per 1000 boys as per the Census 2011 which was earlier 927 in the 2001 Census.

No Garba-crashing in Madhya Pradesh say BJP legislatorsKeep Muslims out of Garba, say BJP MLAs
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Bhopal, September 16, 2014
First Published: 18:49 IST(16/9/2014) | Last Updated: 15:32 IST(17/9/2014)
After Indore, now it’s Bhopal. For youths who want to ‘Garba-crash’ it is strict no-no.
 
Close on the heels of the co-called ‘love jihad’ controversy in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh,  ‘no-entry’ curbs issued by two BJP legislators from Madhya Pradesh against Muslim men from gate-crashing Garba festivities—  Gujarati dance festival held during then Navratri— has further stoked campaign against alleged conspiracy.
 
Love jihad is a term for what the saffron party considers is an Islamist strategy to convert Hindu women.
 
Last week,  a BJP lawmaker from Indore  Usha Thakur had directed  Garba organisers in the city to ensure men who wanted to take part in night-long dance should only be allowed entry after proving their credentials.
 
Thakur had said she wanted Muslims barred from Garba venues.
 
The BJP legislator has written to Garba organisers, asking them to stop Muslim men from entering the dance venues and seducing women. 
 
She had asked festival organizers to check IDs at the gates.
 
“Men should only be allowed into the venue after seeing their I-cards, for even Muslims entered these venues in the garb of Hindus by sporting tilak on their foreheads,” Thakur had said.
 
Now, the BJP MLA from Huzur constituency in Bhopal Rameshwar Sharma spoken on similar lines.
 
Speaking to the media, Sharma, too, stressed on checking IDs at the festivities.
 
Though Sharma didn’t use the word ‘Muslims’, he dropped enough hints who he wanted not to allow to the Garba venues.
 
“I am not opposed to Muslims or for that matter any member’s entry to Garba venues,” Sharma told HT.
 
“But if somebody wanted to take part in such festivities, he must come with a sense of faith in our religion.”
 
The BJP leader said the move was to check entry of  anti-social elements gate-crashing the festivities.
 
The BJP leader, however, said  members of other faith were welcome, if they came accompanied a woman member of their family.
 
“Muslims or member of any community who wants to take part in Garba  must come with his wife, sister or mother,” he said adding, “ Nobody should be allowed to enter such venues for the sake of fun or entertainment.”
 
Though the BJP has distanced itself from its legislators’ move, it did not see anything objectionable in their strictures.
 
“If they wanted to keep sanctity of the festival intact by keeping the anti-social elements from such venues what was the harm in it?” said BJP state president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan.

UN says USD 1.0 billion needed to fightEbolaPrint
Agence-France Presse | Geneva | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:44 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 7:49 pm
Nearly USD 1.0 billion dollars is needed to fight the Ebola outbreak raging in west Africa, the United Nations said today, more than doubling the estimate it made less than a month ago.
UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told reporters in Geneva there was a “huge funding challenge”, warning that “if not dealt with effectively now, Ebola could become a major humanitarian crisis in countries currently affected.”
The response to the crisis will require USD 987.8 million (763 million euros), with about half needed for the worst-hit country, Liberia, the UN said in its response plan.
It stressed there were some 22 million people living in the three countries most affected by the outbreak.
The UN announcement came as the death toll from the worst-ever Ebola epidemic rose to 2,461, out of 4,985 cases in the three west African countries that have borne the brunt of the disease, according to fresh figures from the World Health Organization.
The UN document estimates that some 20,000 people could be infected with Ebola by the end of the year, with Guinea accounting for 16 percent of infections, Sierra Leone 34 percent and Liberia a full 40 percent.
If the international community and affected countries respond swiftly and energetically, transmission should begin to slow by the end of the year and end by mid-2015, the document said.
“This health crisis we face is unparallelled in modern times,” WHO’s emergency chief Bruce Aylward said at a joint press conference.
“We don’t know where the numbers are going,” he said, pointing out that two weeks ago when WHO said it needed the capacity to manage 20,000 cases, “that seemed like a lot.”
“That does not seem like a lot today,” Aylward said.
While it was difficult to estimate accurately how many people might become infected and die going forward, Aylward said WHO believed “the numbers can be kept in the tens of thousands, but that is going to require a much faster escalation of the response if we’re to beat the escalation of the virus.”

Defamation complaint: Ali seeks written apology from Mukhtar AbbasNaqviPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:39 pm
Former JD(U) leader Sabir Ali on Tuesday sought before a Delhi court a “written apology” from BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, against whom he has filed a criminal defamation complaint for allegedly linking him with arrested Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal.
Ali was asked by Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain on whether he wants to proceed with his complaint against Naqvi.
“I need an apology in writing and only then I will compromise,” he told the court. However, Naqvi, who had marked his presence before the court at 10 AM, was not present when the court asked Ali for any possibility of compromise in the matter.
The matter initially came up for hearing at around 10.20 AM but at that time Ali was not present in the court due to which the case was deferred till 11.30 AM. Naqvi told the magistrate that he had to attend a meeting at 11.30 AM after which the court allowed him to leave.
When the matter again came up for hearing, Ali appeared before the court and said that he wants an apology in writing from Naqvi. The lawyers appearing for both the parties urged the court that they be given some time to discuss the issue of settling the case, if possible, after which the magistrate fixed the matter for hearing on November 15.
The court on July 9 had granted bail to Naqvi. It had earlier summoned Naqvi as accused, saying “prima facie” there was evidence and sufficient ground to proceed against him for the alleged offence of defaming Ali.
Ali, in his complaint, had alleged that Naqvi had termed him as a friend of suspected terrorist Bhatkal in March and the story was circulated and telecast in India as well as abroad through social media as well as various newspapers and channels.
The former JD(U) leader had said that after he made a statement appreciating Narendra Modi, who was then the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate, in March this year, he was removed from JD(U). After having deliberations with some senior BJP members, it was decided by then BJP President Rajnath Singh that he should join them, he had said.
Ali had alleged that three-four hours after joining BJP, he started getting phone calls from his relatives, friends and media persons that Naqvi had allegedly tweeted against him on the social networking website Twitter.
BJP had on March 29 cancelled Ali’s membership after the controversy erupted following the tweet by Naqvi. Ali, in his statement before the court, had deposed that the tweet made by Naqvi on his account has tarnished and maligned his reputation in the eyes of society, causing great mental suffering to him and his family.

New Governor Paul takes charge inMizoramPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizwal | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:33 pm
Meghalaya governor K K Paul took additional charge of Mizoram on Tuesday afternoon, becoming the fifth incumbent of the Raj Bhavan at Aizawl in just two-and-a-half months.
Paul was administered the oath of office at 4 pm by Guwahati High Court Judge L S Jamir. He had taken additional charge of Manipur on Monday.
Paul’s predecessor V K Duggal, who as Manipur Governor had taken additional charge of Mizoram, had quit earlier this month.
Duggal was preceded by former Maharashtra Governor K Sankaranarayanan, who refused to take charge of Mizoram and quit soon after his transfer from Maharashtra on August 24.
Sankaranarayanan was preceded by former Gujarat Governor Kamla, who was sacked by Rashtrapati Bhavan just a month after she was transferred from Gujarat to Mizoram and who took charge on July 6.
Kamla was preceded by Vakkom B Purushothaman, who was removed as Mizoram Governor a month earlier and transferred to Nagaland but who also quit in protest.
The quick succession of changes in the constitutional post has prompted many Mizos, including politicians cutting across party lines, to protest against the state being used as a “dumping ground” of UPA-appointed Governors who refused to quit after the Modi-led government came to power at the Centre.

FTIL opposes merger of NSEL with itself
In a letter to BSE and NSE, FTIL said its Board is opposed to FMC's recommendations that NSEL be merged with FTIL and the government should take over management of FTIL.

FTIL today opposed the merger of scam-hit NSEL with itself as proposed by regulator FMC for speedy recovery of dues, saying that such a move would affect the Jignesh Shah-led company and 60,000 shareholders.
Instead,  Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) has suggested that government agencies, brokers and trading clients should "join forces" with National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) to ensure recovery of Rs 5,300 crore from 24 defaulters.
"...while investigations and various legal proceedings are pending, where the actual facts are yet to be established, any action based on FMC's recommendations towards merging NSEL with the FTIL will irreparably prejudice and harm FTIL and its over 60,000 shareholders, 1000 plus employees, lenders and other stakeholders," FTIL said in a statement.
FTIL group is in big trouble after over Rs 5,500 crore payment crisis surfaced at its subsidiary NSEL last year. After FMC declared FTIL as 'unfit' to run any bourses, the company had to exit from its commodity exchange MCX and lose management control in the stock exchange, MCX-SX.
In a letter to BSE and NSE, FTIL said its Board is opposed to FMC's recommendations that NSEL be merged with FTIL and the government should take over management of FTIL.
"Should more than 60,000 public shareholders of FTIL suffer a non-existent liability of Rs 5,500 crore by the device of a forced merger when the very existence of any legal liability of NSEL and consequently of FTIL as its holding company, is sub judice before the Bombay High Court," it said.
Stating that the government can merge two companies in public interest, FTIL said that interest of 13,000 clients of the brokers who traded on NSEL platform for higher return cannot be "termed as public interest".
The company said about 66 per cent of the entire outstanding amount is due to 781 persons. Asserting that it has fully supported NSEL in recovery process, FTIL said it has given a loan of Rs 179 crore to the spot exchange to make part payment of dues to 6,600 small investors.
It also informed that NSEL has recovered more than Rs 360 crore from 24 defaulters and same has been distributed proportionately amongst the investors.
"NSEL with support from FTIL and under guidance from FMC has been making all efforts for recovery of the money from the defaulters including but not limited to filing various recovery suits and criminal complaints for dishonour of cheques against defaulters," it said.
FTIL said it has also supported NSEL in meeting administrative and legal expenses.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Multiple rerating triggers for UPLMany rerating cues for UPL
Ram Prasad Sahu | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 10:47 PM IST
Agri-chemicals major UPL, earlier United Phosphorus, hit its 52-week high last week on easing of rainfall deficit fears and increased sowing in India, its largest single market accounting for 21 per cent of FY14 sales. Rainfall deficit is down from 16 per cent earlier this month to about 11 per cent now and should improve demand for agri-chemicals, helping UPL. Sowing has also now improved to 95 per cent of the national cultivable area, which is just under the 98 per cent coverage of last year. While the management has forecast for an overall revenue growth of 12-15 per cent for FY15 in July, growth could be higher, given the contribution from India operations. The other key market for UPL is Latin America (including Brazil), which accounted for 26 per cent of its revenues. Analysts expect this geography to grow at 10-12 per cent annually over two-three years.
The company is now focusing on differentiated formulations and will launch nine products over three years. UPL is looking to replicate the success of its insecticide, Ulala, and will leverage its tie-up with Ishihara of Japan to launch more such products. Ulala, launched in FY13, generated revenues of Rs 68 crore in the first year. Further, in line with its focus on branded products, the company plans to launch five mega brands. Another growth area could be the $3 billion worth of products going off patent starting FY14.
To maintain its above-sector growth performance and consolidate its market share, the company is looking at tripling product launches from 27 in FY14 to 75-80 in FY15. UPL, which has a 13 per cent market share in the Indian crop protection market, has increased its global share from 2.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent in FY14 and grew at double the global sector growth rate of 8.5 per cent for the financial year. The company said the South American and Indian markets are expected to grow faster than the global average.
Thus, the company is changing focus from largely an off-patent product portfolio to differentiated value-added niche products and is focusing on the organic route (as against the earlier acquisition strategy) to improve its growth metrics and profits.
While the stock has rerated after the March quarter on good Q4FY14 results and strong forecast, analysts at HSBC believe there are multiple rerating triggers. These include strong earnings growth (average of 20 per cent), reduction in debt and stable cash flow leading to higher return on equity. Higher cash flow and lack of acquisitions should lead to further reduction of debt. As a result, UPL’s debt to equity ratio is expected to fall from the current 0.5 times to 0.2 times.  
Despite being one of the largest global companies in the space with a low-cost production base, presence across countries which de-risks its revenue streams and a large product portfolio, the stock (at Rs 353) is still available at an attractive 10 times its FY16 earnings, said an analyst at a domestic brokerage.
One issue that had held back investors was the poor utilisation of excess cash parked in current accounts. Analysts at Kotak Securities said Rs 850 crore of debt repayment in FY14 out of the surplus cash partly addressed investor concerns on the suboptimal structure of the balance sheet, leading to the re-rating of valuation multiples.
In the light of the company’s plans, analysts believe that UPL will post an average growth of 20-21 per cent in net profit over FY14-16. The Bloomberg consensus one-year forward target price is pegged at Rs 374, a six per cent upside from current levels. Given the prospects and reasonable valuations, investors can pick the stock at dips.

Can look at Apr 1  2016 for GST rollout: Sitharaman06:00 pm
The Centre is looking at April 1, 2016 as a possible time line for implementing Goods and Service Tax (GST). Speaking to CNBC-TV18, minister of state finance Nirmala Sitharaman said the 2016 timeline seems feasible as the process and systems for a smooth roll out of GST should be in place by then.
This comes just a day after a high level meeting on GST chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So this is not a sense of directive from any quarter that needs to be emphasised. This is basically an internal view of the central government.
A constitutional bill, which is in the works, will be tabled in the Winter Session of Parliament. That will also be followed by Central GST Act and State GST Act. So there is a lot of work still remaining on this front, but April 1, 2016 is an internal timeline at the Centre’s level.

Male Mahadeshwara Hills Authority also approved
Bangalore, September 16:  
Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has given assent to the recently amended Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act and for the constitution of Sri Male Mahadeswaraswamy Kshethra Development Authority.
The Act proposes to form an expert committee (Sugarcane Control Board) for calculation of actual realisation in sugar factory and also to advise the government.
Transparency
“The government can now make the process of purchase and supply of sugarcane more transparent,” HS Mahadev Prasad, Minister for Cooperation and Sugar, said in the State Secretariat.
“We have also commenced an exercise to nominate sugarcane growers and factory owners to the Sugarcane Control Board. The reconstituted board will give equal representation to sugarcane growers and sugar factory owners representing all revenue divisions in the state,” he added.
For price realisation, the experts committee or board will look into local factors such as actual recovery of sugarcane, realisation of sugar and its by-products such as bagasse, press mud and molasses and ethanol or other productions directly produced from sugarcane juice without producing sugar for deciding additional sugarcane price.
The amended act also defines ‘year’ as the year commences on July 1 and ending on June 30.
Prasad said the cooperation department has facilitated procurement of sugar for public distribution system by helping the food and civil supplies department to buy entire 30,000 tonnes produced by Mysugar Company, Mandya. Food and civil supplies department has given an advance of Rs 10 crore.
Hills Authority
Prasad said the Governor had also given his assent to the formation of Male Mahadeshwara Hills Authority at Mahadeswara Hills in Kollegal taluk, Chamarajanagar district.
Sri Male Mahadeswaraswamy temple with annual revenue of Rs 18 crore is the second richest after Sri Kukke Subramanya in Puttur, taluk of Dakshina Kannada.
The Authority is expected to develop and maintain Sri Male Mahadeswaraswamy temple and also provide all amenities to the pilgrims visiting the hill shrine, protect its culture and to promote it as a tourist centre.
The ruling Congress government had introduced and passed the Sri Male Mahadeswaraswamy Kshethra Development Authority Act, 2013 and now the act has come into effect.
Prasad said now the work to constitute an authority under the Chairmanship of the chief minister and district in charge minister is in progress.
The authority will also include Members of Parliament, legislators, non-officials and officials as members. A Karnataka Administrative Service (KAS) officer and Muzarai department thalsidar will function as deputy secretary of the authority.
“A master plan for Sri Male Mahadeswaraswamy Kshethra is being prepared by the authority and its maintenance will be taken up after the first meeting which will be held in October,” said Prasad.

Officials from 19 member-countries of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to brainstorm over three days.
A meeting of Customs administration officials from the 19 member-countries of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) on trade facilitation got under way in Bangalore on Monday morning.
Describing it as a unique gathering, a senior official of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) said this was the second IORA Trade Facilitation Forum. “We have participants from 19 countries… they are all Customs experts and going to talk on important topics like trade facilitation,” according to Sandeep Bhatnagar, Joint Secretary (Customs), CBEC.
The discussions over the next three days, he explained, are significant in the backdrop of the agreement on trade facilitation at the Bali Ministerial Conference of World Trade Organisation in December last. “Even otherwise, every Customs administration is interested in facilitating genuine trade,” he said, adding authorised economic cooperative programme to ensure supply chain security is also to be deliberated.
Such forums, Mr.Bhatnagar pointed, will help in bringing together countries in the Indian Ocean region since they already have lot of commonalities.
CBEC Member (Customs) Mala Srivastava inaugurated the three day workshop, which is being organised by the Board in association with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Force under the aegis of IORA for Regional Cooperation.
According to Ms.Srivastava, there was need for the Customs administration to set new standards of excellence and work together for global prosperity. Strong conclusions on enhancing trade and facilitation measures, she said, would ultimately lead to poverty alleviation and economic development. She also highlighted the need for measures that result in reducing the cost of compliance.
An official release said the IORA seeks to build and expand understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation between the member countries through a consensus based, evolutionary and non-intrusive approach. National Director of Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Jeff Buckpitt, Chief Commissioner of Customs, Bangalore, R.P.Raheja and Commissioner of Customs Sandeep Prakash participated in the inaugural session.

Is rising income inequality inevitableIs rising income inequality inevitable?
CP CHANDRASEKHAR
Tweet
REUTERS Share it The recent fall in inequality in Latin America shows local policies can make an effect
Rising inequality is often regarded as an inexorable outcome of globalisation and technological change. That is not necessarily true
September 15, 2014:  
Rising inequality is now a concern on everyone’s minds, even amongst the rich. Unequal societies are actually more unpleasant and dangerous for everyone, not just for those deprived by the system.
High and rising inequality can be dysfunctional for the economy: for example, many now argue that growing inequality and the suppression of wage incomes combined with the effects of financial deregulation to generate the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and that the subsequent poor performance of most economies is related to the slow and limited recovery of labour incomes.
Policy makers seem to recognise that addressing inequalities is important not only for justice and social cohesion, but also for continued material progress.
This may partly explain the recent proliferation of academic studies on global and national inequalities, as well as the numerous reports on the subject that have come from UN organisations and other multilateral organisations.
The huge media attention devoted to one academic study — Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century — is a sign of the times. The spotlight that is shone on the rising share of incomes of the rich and the substantial empirical data that have been brought to bear on establishing this are indeed welcome.
But that book, like many other recent analyses of inequality, tends to ascribe some sort of inevitability to the process, as the result of the working of some inexorable economic forces.
Piketty, for example, argues that there is a general tendency for wealth and income inequalities to increase because the rate of return on capital tends to exceed the rate of growth of the economy.
There are various analytical concerns with this formulation, which relies on assumptions of full employment over the process of economic expansion and returns to factors such as capital being determined by their marginal productivity (itself a problematic concept that is also impossible to measure).
Falling wages
The general increase in inequality in most countries over the past two decades — as indicated in Chart 1 that covers both developed and developing countries — can clearly be related to declining shares of wages in national income. (The data for the charts and table are taken from the UNDP Report “Humanity Divided: Confronting inequality in developing countries, UN New York 2014.)
Various analysts have attributed this trend of falling wage shares to the impact of labour-saving technological change, as well as the globalisation of trade and production, both of which have dramatically reduced the bargaining power of labour relative to capital.
Technological change has also increased wage dispersion in many instances, thereby generating more wage inequalities as well.
Some observers have pointed to the effects of financialisation in increasing the share of rentier incomes and enabling policies that serve financial interests rather than those of society at large.
However, these shifts cannot be ascribed purely to economic forces, since domestic social and political forces and policies also play important roles.
Indeed, the last point highlights the important role of policy and the political economy that determines policies that affect income and asset distribution.
In the developed countries, the declining emphasis on welfare states has been associated with the weakening of institutions and regulations that could protect workers and therefore the labour share of incomes.
In developing countries, the perceived need to provide incentives to large private capital for generating investment and thereby growth, as well as drives for fiscal stabilization, have also operated in the same way.
Uneven terrains
But the important point is that not all countries show the same trends and not all governments have behaved the same way. Chart 2 shows that the aggregate measure of inequality the Gini index (a measure of income inequality) has moved in different ways in the various major regions of the developing world.
In two major regions — Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean — the recent period has in fact witnessed a significant decline in inequality, though it is to be noted that these were already the regions with higher inequality to start with.
By contrast, there have been very significant increases in inequality in the transition economies of Europe as well as in Asia.
Even looking at regions is obviously too broad given the huge diversity within these large geographical spaces.
Table 1 provides a further disaggregation, indicating the number of countries where inequality has increased or decreased and the average rate of change across these. It is evident that Latin America particularly stands out in terms of number of countries experiencing significant reduction of inequality.
Some of the policies followed in countries of Latin America (and now some in Africa as well) are therefore worth noting.
Fiscal policies operated to reduce inequality through progressive income taxation and highly redistributive social transfers targeting education and health spending as well as public child and old-age benefits.
Wage gaps
There were increases in formal employment, led by significant increases in public employment, through the expansion of and improvement of quality in public services in areas such as health and education, as well as through “in-sourcing” activities that were earlier outsourced to private companies by governments.
Wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers were reduced by increases in educational access and enrolment, and this contributed to the recent drop in income inequality. Legal minimum wages rose through most of the 2000s, and in some countries like Brazil they more than doubled in real terms.
Incidentally this also reduced gender wage gaps, since women workers tend to be clustered in the lower end of the wage distribution, at and around the minimum wage.
Reviving institutions and regulations such as labour unions, employment protection, minimum wages, unemployment benefits and regulation with respect to firing played an important role in moderating wage inequalities and improving wage shares of national income.
So even in heavily “globalised” economies operating broadly within market capitalism, domestic policies can still be effective in shaping patterns of inequality and causing some declines.
Rising inequality is therefore not inevitable — it is a political choice.

Waiting for recoveryTweet
July’s industrial output data show that the economy remains locked in a phase of continuing slowdown
The surge of hope generated by the first quarter growth numbers (5.7 per cent) has ebbed somewhat. Industrial production data for July recorded an annual growth of a measly 0.5 per cent. Worse, output of capital goods fell year-on-year by 3.8 per cent while consumer durables registered minus 20.9 per cent. While there are indications that overall business sentiment is looking up, we are still some distance away from a recovery and urgent steps need to be taken to revive investment appetite. The new government at the Centre has demonstrated little appetite for big bang reforms, which are necessary to convince investors, both domestic and foreign, to take up greenfield projects. One waits to see whether the conclusion of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana next month will spur it into action.
The Centre cannot expect much help from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in helping to reverse the slowdown, which is more than three years old. An interest rate cut can be virtually ruled out in the next monetary policy review on September 30 with retail inflation at 7.8 per cent in August, still well above the comfort zone. Of course, inflation principally arising out of supply bottlenecks rather than excess demand cannot be tamed by raising interest rates. In this case, high interest rates may have reinforced inflationary pressures by raising costs for industry — this seems to be the experience of the last three years. The RBI faces another constraint: if India is to remain an attractive destination for debt flows, it needs to keep its rates attractive, notwithstanding the rate cut by the European Central Bank. Add to this the threat of the reversal of the US’ easy money policies and it is apparent that the RBI cannot realistically be expected to go in the opposite direction — unless, of course, the current account deficit narrows dramatically, which is not going to happen suddenly.
The Government, therefore, is in an unenviable situation of having to revive industry without lowering the cost of domestic credit. Concern over deficit levels means there is no leeway for fiscal stimulus either. But this is no cause for despondency. The Government can still do a lot in the form of supply-side reforms — from rationalisation of subsidies to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. While our flexibility on the fiscal and monetary fronts is cramped, quick decisions that display a firm resolve for reform can go a long way towards improving business sentiment. This could well provide a more powerful stimulus to the economy than conventional fiscal and monetary instruments.

The Indo-Pak war were losingThe Indo-Pak war we’re losing
RASHEEDA BHAGAT
Caricatures al l Indian soaps are replete with banal stereotypes
Pakistani serials score over Hindi fare on our television channels. When will Indian producers get real?
Remember the good old days of Doordarshan when we were treated to serials such as Hum Log and Buniyaad, before being swept off our feet by the telecast of Ramayan and Mahabharat? We watched the last two in rapt attention and reverence, even though they dragged on and on, really trying our patience. But they did grip the imagination of a generation gone by and anyway, what other choice did we have?
The weekly or bi-weekly telecasting of a bouquet of films, songs and programmes such as NDTV’s The World this Week, was also awaited eagerly and lapped up. Slowly, painfully slowly, our television programming improved and gave us a wider choice.
Then sometime in the late 80s and early 90s, when some friends and relatives returned from Pakistan and raved about the serials telecast there, I found video cassettes of a couple of the popular ones — Tanhaiyaan and Dhoop Kinare — in the neighbourhood lending library and watched them. The quality and content were surprisingly good.
These were being aired on PTV in Pakistan and the high quality of the script, characterisation, and subdued, understated acting was really impressive. I got hooked to Dhoop Kinare based on the lives of doctors and loved the portrayal of Dr Ahmer Ansari (Rahat Kazmi) and Dr Zoya Ali Khan (Marina Khan) so much that on a trip to Pakistan to cover the 1993 election, I brought home all the four bulky video cassettes.
Over the years so many video and audio cassettes have been thrown out during spring cleaning, but these cassettes have remained, awaiting conversion to digital format.
But I didn’t move beyond these two , and revisiting Indian Hindi soaps after a decade found them crass and melodramatic and far, far removed from reality. On a visit to Pakistan about five years ago, I was totally surprised to find housewives and older women hooked to Indian soaps of the saas-bahu variety. I even know an elderly lady who lived alone in a huge house in Lahore who’d watch the repeat telecasts of Indian soaps , with strict instructions to her domestic help not to disturb her!
But recently a Pakistani friend bitterly complained about our Hindi soaps. “Your advertisements during breaks are much better!” she said. One could only blame Ekta Kapoor for painting such a horrendous portrait of the Indian woman — a sati Savitri or a total demon, always decked up in layers of gold and thick pancake make-up, both of which never came off even in bed!
A revisit
Having stayed away from Indian or Pakistani soaps for a decade, recent rave reviews of Pakistani serials now being telecast on Zee TV’s Zindagi channel, triggered a revisit.
Though some were passable and some rather superficial in their treatment of both plot and layering of characters, they had remarkable and refreshingly different features vis-à-vis Hindi serials. The most refreshing difference is that women in Pakistani serials dress like ordinary middle- and upper middle-class women, even though the serials tend to concentrate on stories woven around rich families.
The young women mostly wear salwar-kameez and jeans and tops and use light make-up; chunky gold and flashy diamond jewellery are missing, unless wedding scenes are involved.
More important, the serials show educated girls from both rich and poor families focusing on a career and there is great emphasis on girls’ education.
The acting may not be brilliant but melodrama and yelling, hysterical women are kept to a minimum, as are lectures/homilies on the perfect woman. The sets are simple and elegant, not flashy or garish. While the first two serials I watched — Maat and Mere Qatil Mere Dildaar — were a tad disappointing, even though good enough to merit recording and watching, the two that followed last month, Zindagi Gulzar Hai and Kahi Unkahi, were surprisingly good.
The half-a-dozen serials I’ve watched till now focus on the class struggle and the huge rich-poor divide. But the underlying current, and surprisingly so in a country like Pakistan that is battling with its own Taliban, is invariably gender justice.
Strong gender themes
Zindagi is a lovely story of how a man abandons his wife because all their three children are girls and marries another woman, leaving his first wife, a teacher, to fend for herself and the girls.
The eldest, Kashyap, a brilliant student of management, grows up hating not only men but the institution of marriage itself. She is wooed by Zaroon from a rich family and even though she finally marries him, her very strong instinct to retain her independence, both financial and otherwise, lands the marriage in trouble.
The mother’s role is brilliantly written and executed, the script/language, centred around how daughters should be greatly valued, brought up and educated just like sons, is not hyperbolic or bombastic. The acting has no melodrama. Kashyap looks like the girl next door, dresses simply, wears hardly any make-up, and the evolution of her character, from a headstrong but deeply caring woman to one who slowly accepts that not all men are selfish and stupid like her father, is laudable.
Kahi Unkahi doesn’t have the same class, but the central character Zoya, a driver’s daughter, proves she is far superior in heart, thought and intellect to Anam, the totally spoilt rich woman, who cannot accept defeat from Zoya either in school or in winning the affections of their common heartthrob.
Appeal of Urdu
Apart from the strong gender themes, the depiction of class prejudices, the contempt of the rich for the poor, the poetry-like cadence of the Urdu language, which is mercifully simple (the channel sensibly runs a translation of difficult Urdu words), another winner is the short life-span. Most of the serials are around 20-25 episodes.
Those who watch Indian Hindi serials tell me that even in these the gender theme is now gaining importance but the handling is all wrong. The result is characters being reduced to caricatures.
The worst part, one hears, is that the characters wear designer clothes — including sarees — and jewellery because there is a whole army of women out there who are waiting to copy these designs. If this is true, nothing can be more pathetic.

Systems failure in Air IndiaSystems failure in Air India
Ashwini Phadnis
That’s what causes it to take arbitrary decisions
September 15, 2014:  
What do some senior bureaucrats do when they hang up their boots? Like Vinod Rai, former Comptroller and Auditor General, they assign to themselves the task of pointing out the warts in a system they lived with for decades. (Whether they should have done so earlier, or rather, been permitted by the system to do so while in service, is a moot point.)
In his book, Not Just An Accountant, he talks about how one-time aviation minister Praful Patel “nudged” Air India to take a decision to acquire aircraft.
Rai is certainly not the first to point to shenanigans in the workings of this airline. Jitendra Bhargava, who spent close to 30 years in Air India, has also alluded to interference by various government functionaries in the Maharaja’s functioning.
Rai talks about a board meeting called in Mumbai early in 2004 to take a decision on Air India acquiring aircraft, something the airline had not done in more than two decades. As the board members walked in they were handed additional agenda items, including one which said that the number of aircraft Air India wished to acquire was to be increased from under 30 to 58.
Some members protested, saying they were not against ordering more aircraft but wanted an analysis of the airline’s financial capacity to bear the same. They were, however, told to clear the proposal without expressing doubts. The meeting was adjourned without a decision.
The next board meeting was some months later after shunting out the members, raising awkward questions. The proposal to acquire 58 aircraft was cleared. Bureaucrats felt aggrieved that political interference had shut out their concerns.
There should be clear and transparent systems in place so that it is easier to pin the blame where it belongs. It is virtually impossible to blame Patel for the aircraft acquisition, since the decision to acquire the aircraft was cleared by a board that was supposedly ‘independent’ of political interference.
Related to this is the need to take considered decisions, where all the points of view are given equal weightage. Getting a clear cost benefit analysis done which is available for review is an option.

Non-basmati rice exporters keen to scale Chinese wallNon-basmati rice exporters keen to scale Chinese wall
Vishwanath Kulkarni
Absence of phyto norms hitherto have hindered shipments
Bangalore September 15:  
Indian rice exporters keen to tap the Chinese market want the Union Government to take up the issue of non-tariff barriers with visiting President Xi Jinping this week.
China, which began importing rice for the past four years, has not granted access to the Indian non-basmati rice in absence of any defined phytosanitary norms between the two neighbouring countries. However, China has been sourcing its requirement from countries such as Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand.
Though China opened up its market for Indian basmati in 2012, the non-basmati varieties cannot be exported because of a lack of a phyto protocol.
“Without the phyto protocols in place, we cannot initiate our exports to China. The Government should take up this issue so that our exports are facilitated,” said B Krishna Rao, representing the Agri Exporters Association. Any increase in exports will eventually benefit the growers, considering that the Government has decided to cut down the levy rice procurement from the 2014-15 kharif marketing season. Trade sources feel that Indian non-basmati rice was denied access to Chinese market for political reasons.
“If they can buy from Pakistan, they can buy better quality Indian rice as well,” said Tejinder Narang, a grains trade analyst. “Chinese rice imports are rising every year as they are moving away from water-intensive crops and India should not be ignored in this regard,” he added.
China’s rice imports were close to around 5 million tonnes last year and the steady increase in its purchases have kept the Vietnamese prices firm.
India has emerged as the biggest rice exporter in the recent years with annual shipments hovering or exceeding 10 million tonnes on firm demand for its cereal mainly from African countries and renewed interest from Russia and Ukraine. The exporters here are keen to gain access to the Chinese market considering that India can offer better quality and price and a wider variety.
“If Russia, which is the most stringent in quality norms, is accepting the Indian rice without any hitch, China should ideally not have any issues. India, as a supplier, ideally suits China in terms of dependability,” said an official at a large commodity exporting firm.

Dipping commodity prices bring inflation down in AugustDipping commodity prices bring inflation down in August
K.R.Srivats
The wholesale price index for August has come in at a five-year low of 3.74 per cent.
Cooling fuel prices too help
New Delhi, Sept 15:  
A sharp fall in global commodity prices had a salutary impact on wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation in August, which hit a five-year low at 3.74 per cent.
Falling food articles inflation — which too hit a five-year low at 5.15 per cent — besides the substantial impact of softening fuel prices bolstered the downward trend.
The WPI of 3.74 per cent for August was lower than 5.19 per cent in July and 6.99 per cent in August last year, official data released on Monday showed.
“International commodity and crude prices have corrected to multi-year lows. The softening in global crude prices is playing out. As much as two-thirds of global prices have an impact on WPI,” Saumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor, State Bank of India Group, told BusinessLine.
Given that core inflation had trended down, one can expect the whole year average for WPI to be around 4-4.5 per cent, Ghosh said. He expects the consumer price index (CPI) for 2014-15 to be around 7.5-7.7 per cent. This average is lower than the 8 per cent target set by the Reserve Bank of India for January 2015.
The declining trajectory in WPI and the CPI-based inflation notwithstanding, the RBI will keep policy rates unchanged on September 30, say economy watchers.
Confederation of Indian Industry Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said “coming shortly before the Monetary Policy, this (falling inflation) should provide the necessary manoeuvring space to the RBI”. FICCI President Sidharth Birla said “This is definitely a good sign”. But prices of food items at the retail end continue to be a cause for concern, he added.
Despite WPI inflation cooling off, the benchmark equity indices were not enthused and plunged 1 per cent on Monday due to disappointing industrial production data and weak global cues.

Old climate change formula no longer exists, say scientists

Reuters In this December 17, 2009 photo, people pass by globes in Copenhagen. The old formula that dry gets drier and wet gets wetter (DDWW) is less universally valid than previously assumed, stressed a team of climate researchers.

climate change
The traditional formula on climate change that says that regions that have a moist climate will experience additional rainfall is no longer valid, scientists say.
The old formula that dry gets drier and wet gets wetter (DDWW) is less universally valid than previously assumed, stressed a team of climate researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ) in Zurich.
“Our results emphasise how we should not overly rely on simplifying principles to asses past developments in dryness and humidity. This can be misleading, as it cannot do justice to the complexity of the underlying systems,” said Peter Greve from ETHZ and the lead author of the study.
Traditional analyses using metrics could describe climate characteristics above the ocean, but not over land.
In their new study, ETHZ researchers led by co-author Sonia Seneviratne, a professor for land-climate dynamics, took into account the specific climatic properties of land surfaces where the amount of available water is limited compared with the ocean.
For the study, they compared data from between 1948 and 1968 and 1984 to 2004 which allowed them to extract trends in terms of a region’s humidity and dryness.
They found that there was no obvious trend towards a drier or wetter climate across three-quarters of the land and only half of this surface area follows the DDWW principle.
Some regions which should have become wetter according to the simple DDWW formula have actually become drier in the past — this includes parts of the Amazon, Central America, tropical Africa and Asia, found the team.
However, the DDWW principle does still apply to the oceans, concluded the study that appeared in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Typhoon Kalmaegi sends in ripples to revive monsoon in BayTyphoon Kalmaegi breaks opens new monsoon front
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Sept 16:  
Western and southern parts of flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir could witness rain or thundershowers during the next week or even longer, though not strictly monsoon-related.
Impromptu rain
For instance, there were two cyclonic circulations doing the rounds over Punjab and Haryana-west Uttar Pradesh which are capable of setting of impromptu rain from residual moisture available in the air.
Only exception
This was the only exception to an otherwise pattern of what looks like the withdrawal of the monsoon from the rest of north-west and western parts.
But towards the south and east, the Bay of Bengal has tossed up the latest in the series of low-pressure areas under a gentle but unmistakable nudge from the South China Sea to its east.
It may be recalled that an upper-level atmospheric wave that oversaw the vigorous monsoon over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal had transited last week to the South China Sea/West Pacific.
What it managed to come up with from the West Pacific was a ‘low’-turned-depression-turned typhoon Kalmaegi that has hit Hong Kong already and is heading towards the southwest coast of China.
The west-southwest track of Kalmaegi sent in a pulse into the Bay of Bengal that ultimately concentrated into a low-pressure area on Tuesday.
‘Low’ in bay
The run-up to the initiation of the ‘low’ saw the East Coast from Odisha to Tamil Nadu being lashed by thundershowers over the past 24 hours.
According to the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction, the eastern coast and adjoining peninsular India may witness thundershowers over the next three to four days.
Hit-or-miss thunderstorms are also expected to line up to the rest of adjoining central India right up to west Madhya Pradesh, interior Maharashtra and Karnataka.
But the south Andhra Pradesh coast and adjoining north Tamil Nadu coast (including Chennai) might witness enhanced activity over the next couple of days.
Parts of the North-eastern States may also see scaling up of rainfall as Typhoon Kalmaegi makes a landfall over southwest China, not far from the rugged terrain from the international border.

Lupin inks pact with Merck Serono  eyes expansionLupin inks pact with Merck Serono, eyes expansion in emerging markets
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 16, 2014  | 16:54 IST

Drug firm Lupin has entered into long-term partnership with Merck Serono, the biopharmaceutical division of Merck, for expansion in emerging markets.
As part of the agreement, Lupin will support Merck Serono in the implementation of its general medicines portfolio expansion initiative in emerging markets, the domestic drug maker said in a statement.
Mumbai-based Lupin will develop products, provide product dossiers and supply finished items to Merck Serono while the German firm will be the marketing authorisation holder for the products, and will leverage its strong commercial and medical teams in emerging markets to bring new medicines in its portfolio to customers, it added.
The drug major will receive upfront and milestone-based licensing fee as part of the agreement, it said.
"We look forward to working with Merck Serono leveraging our established world-class formulation development, manufacturing, supply chain and regulatory capabilities to produce a range of medications that meet local needs," Lupin Group President, Asia Pacific, Africa, Middle East & Latin America (AAMLA), Vinod Dhawan said.
This strategic partnership builds on the existing close collaboration between the two companies and adds up to 20 new products to the current portfolio , with the first launches expected in 2016, the company said.
As per the tie-up, Merck Serono will expand its overall portfolio in core therapeutic areas of general medicine and endocrinology franchise in selected countries in Latin America, Asia, Central Eastern Europe, and Africa.
"The collaboration will significantly strengthen our portfolio and Merck Serono's position as one of the major players in emerging markets, aiming to provide patients in these regions with better access to health," Merck Serono Head of Global Commercial Elcin Ergun said.
Sales in the emerging market regions are one of the key growth drivers for Darmstadt-based Merck Serono, amounting to close to 1.8 billion euro in 2013.
The partnership would cover major markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Philippines alongside several countries in Africa and Central Eastern Europe as well as other countries in emerging markets, focusing on cardiovascular and diabetes diseases .
Shares of Lupin closed 3.88 per cent down at Rs 1,359.85 apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

Investigation into F-35 fighter jet fire close to completeBy Christian Davenport September 16 Follow @_chrisdavenport

Officials investigating the F-35 fire that temporarily caused the fleet of fighter planes to be grounded this summer should determine the “root cause” by the end of the month and should have a fix for the planes by the end of the year, officials said Monday.
Since the fire on June 23, investigators have determined that there was excessive rubbing between a seal that’s part of an engine rotor and a piece of hard plastic designed to absorb the contact. Because the engine expands when it gets hot and shifts during flights — especially during severe maneuvers — some rubbing between the parts is expected.
But speaking to reporters at the annual Air Force Association Conference at National Harbor, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan said, referring to the amount of rubbing: “Quite frankly it was underestimated. It’s as simple as that.”
The rubbing caused the temperature of the metal to rise to 1,900 degrees, Bogdan said, well above the normal 1,000 degrees. That caused micro-cracking in the engine, which eventually grew.
In the weeks before the fire , the F-35 had been through a series of maneuvers that were aggressive but all within the plane’s capability, he said.
“That’s why we’re worried,” Bogdan said. “If it were outside the envelope we’d say just don’t fly there but it was inside the envelope, so that’s why we have to fix it.”
Still, he said, the incident shouldn’t cause any significant delays to the project. The F-35 is made by Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin.
The cost of fixing and retrofitting any other planes would be paid for by the engine’s manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney. Bennett Croswell, Pratt & Whitney’s president of military engines, said that it would “not require a significant teardown of the engine,” and that it “would not be hugely expensive.”
A fix could be in place by the end of the year, he said.
“While we don’t like to have these events, they do happen in a program like this,” he said.
The fire occurred during a training mission at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida when a pilot was beginning to take off. He quickly aborted the flight and got out safely. But Bogdan said Monday that the incident could have been much worse had the fire broken out just a little while later.
Still, he said that officials were committed to fixing the problem and that it was not emblematic of the cost overruns and delays that have plagued the program in the past. The program has largely gotten back on track since he took over two years ago, officials have said.
Speaking at the conference Monday, he had sharp words for those who wanted to continue to cite the problems of the past: “Get over it.”

BJP eyes 2016 West Bengal Assembly polls after winning Basirhat South

Kolkata: Buoyed by its performance in the Assembly bye-elections where the party has secured a win from the Basirhat Dakshin seat, the BJP central leadership is now eyeing the Kolkata civic elections slated for next year and the 2016 Assembly elections to make West Bengal TMC free.
BJP National Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh, the main architect of the party's rise in Bengal, said the BJP would now eye next year's Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections and the 2016 Assembly polls in the state.
"We thank our workers who have been with us in our hardships and all those who have supported us. We will now prepare ourselves for next year's KMC polls and 2016 Assembly polls in order to make West Bengal free from the misrule of Trinamool Congress," Singh said.
BJP state president Rahul Sinha said that the party would also have won the Chowringhee seat had the TMC not played the communal card.
#west bengal #west bengal assembly elections 2016 #bypolls #rahul sinha
"The results prove that only we can fight the misrule of the Trinamool in Bengal and people have restored faith in us," he said. The BJP on Tuesday managed to win a seat in the West Bengal Assembly after 15 years while the state's ruling Trinamool Congress retained the Chowringhee seat in the city.
BJP's state General Secretary Shamik Bhattacharya won the Basirhat Dakshin seat and TMC's Nayana Bandyopadhyay won the Chowringhee seat.
BJP state president Rahul Sinha said that the party would also have won the Chowringhee seat had the TMC not played the communal card. "We would have also won the Chowringhee seat had the Trinamool not played the communal card with the minorities of the area. They tried very hard to stop our victory in Basirhat Dakshin seat too, but they failed. The results have proved that people are with us," said Sinha.
Dismissing opposition claims that though BJP president Amit Shah had campaigned in Chowringhee, yet the party failed to secure a win from there, Singh said "One thing we all have to understand is, in Chowringhee we never got 10,000 votes and this time we have emerged as the second. And Amitji had addressed the rally for the people of Bengal and for both the seats. Moreover, the rally was held there as the party's state committee meeting was going on nearby."

Inks pact for projects worth Rs 80,000 cr
Hyderabad, Sept. 16:  
The Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal today said that the country’s first ultra mega solar power park with a capacity of 2500 MW will come up in Andhra Pradesh.
He announced this after nine memoranda of understanding were inked today, majority of them in the power sector, coinciding with the 100 days rule of N. Chandrababu Naidu as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
The Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Andhra Pradesh Government and the Solar Energy Corporation of India, AP Genco and New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh entered into agreements to develop ultra mega solar park in the State.
The Power Minister said that the State Chief Minister has been pursuing with the Centre relentlessly over the last 50 days and this has resulted in the signing of memoranda in the power sector.
“If the AP Government’s and Naidu’s plans go through as planned, the State would have an installed capacity of 27,000 MW up from 9,000 MW thereby tripling the current capacity by 2019,” he said.
The State also signed an agreement on Power for All scheme which aims to provide round the clock power to all sections of power consumers and another agreement for energy conservation.
He lauded the efforts of the State to reduce the transmission and distribution losses from the current 14.5 per cent to 9 per cent within couple of years as against the Central Government’s target of bringing down the losses to 12 per cent.
During the meeting, several other agreements were signed, including allotment of 1103 acres of land for DRDO in Chinnatayyur and Kokkiralankonda in Chittoor district and 13 acres of land for Society for Applied Microwave Electromagnetic Engineering & Research (SAMEER), Government of India.
Naidu said that the MOUs signed with NTPC, Hero MotoCorp and other entail a total investment of about Rs 80,000 crore into the State.

Croma
(Both brands would also be…)
NEW DELHI: Electronics retail chain Croma and e-commerce portal Snapdeal.com have entered into a strategic partnership to sell electronics products online, the retail chain said Tuesday.
Croma is run by Infiniti Retail Limited, a 100 percent subsidiary of Tata Sons .
As part of this tie-up in the initial phase, Croma and Snapdeal.com would jointly work towards market development initiatives, establishment of joint collaboration on customer and vendor outreach programmes and category development.
Both brands would also be looking at exclusive launches of products and brands belonging to the select categories, a company statement here said.
"This is a big moment for us, where Croma and Snapdeal.com will now leverage their offline and online presence respectively and work jointly to offer a more holistic shopping experience to consumers across the country.
"Further at Snapdeal.com, we have always focused on getting the best brands at affordable prices. With this partnership, we will now be able to expand our electronics products' portfolio like never before.

Vodafone,government agree to extend date for selection of 3rd arbitrator in tax dispute case

Arbitrator
(Recently, government has…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian government and Vodafone have mutually agreed to extend the deadline for appointment of the third arbitrator to resolve the Rs 20,000- crore tax dispute case with UK telecom major Vodafone.
"Our arbitrator and Vodafone have mutually agreed to extend deadline for appointment of third arbitrator," a top government official said.
The last date for finalising the name of third arbitrator in the Vodafone case dispute is September 17.
Following arbitration notice by Vodafone in the Rs 20,000 crore tax case, the government had appointed former Chief Justice of India R C Lahoti as its arbitrator. Vodafone's arbitrator is Canadian lawyer Yves Fortier.
Recently, the government has appointed New York-based law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle as its counsel in the Vodafone tax arbitration case.
Vodafone International Holdings B V in April had served arbitration notice under the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (BIPA) between India and the Netherlands for resolving the dispute.
The case pertains to capital gains tax dispute related to the acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's stake in Hutchison Essar by British telecom giant Vodafone in 2007.
Although the Vodafone won the tax case in the Supreme Court, the then UPA government amended the tax laws with retrospective effect to recover the dues.
While the basic tax demand was Rs 7,990 crore, the total outstanding, including interest and penalty, is estimated to have risen to Rs 20,000 crore.

Modi govt created favourable atmosphere for ...atmosphere
("One very positive aspect…)
HO CHI MINH CITY: President Pranab Mukherjee today had some words of praise for the new Indian government as he credited it for not only initiating steps to bring the economy on a better path but also for creating a "favourable" atmosphere for India across the globe.
The president, who abandoned his written speech for an extempore talk during the Indian community reception in this historic city of Vietnam, also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for accomplishing a wonderful trip to Japan from where, he said, hopes of substantial Foreign Direct Investment are expected to be ploughed into India in the future.
"After the new government (led by Modi) came out with a massive mandate they also worked out...of course, it is too early to formulate cogent policies for the full five years and get it reflected in the plan document and other documents but the first budget presented by the new government outlines some of the crucial policies and there is substantially continuity and there is change (in policy) where it has been found necessary to do it.
"One very positive aspect is that there is possibility of substantial FDI which was an important outcome of the Prime Minister's visit to Japan. And it is expected that in the next five years, investment from Japan would be around USD 25-35 billion."
"Also, we had a very good interaction with the Australian Prime Minister during his visit to India in the last week. Our Prime Minister is expected to have detailed interactions with US President Barack Obama and therefore the international atmosphere is favourable and I am (also) visiting Vietnam at this juncture when two fastest growing economies - India and Vietnam - are also engaged in having cooperation and interaction," he said.
The president also praised Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, the lone representative of the Modi cabinet on this four-day state visit, for taking steps for bringing down the prices of crude oil.
"I can congratulate Mr Dharmedra Pradhan because after assuming the office of the Petroleum Ministry, he has brought good luck to the petroleum (sector) in the sense that now the petroleum prices have come down to USD 93 per barrel and the prediction is that it will go further down. Unfortunately, when I was the Finance Minister, I did not have that privilege of buying petroleum less than USD 112-115 per barrel," he said evoking a thunderous applause from the audience.

Former Pak minister Rehman Malik expelled from PIA flight overdelayThe clip, which has gone viral online, showed passengers booing and ridiculing the lawmakers as the crew also joined them. Source: PTI photo
PTI | Karachi | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:46 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 7:56 pm
Angry passengers on board a PIA flight stopped former interior minister Rehman Malik and a Hindu lawmaker of the ruling PML-N from boarding the plane, accusing them of causing over two hours of delay.
The Islamabad-bound Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-370 from Karachi was delayed by two and a half hours yesterday as it kept waiting for the arrival of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) senator Malik and National Assembly member Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani.
When they finally came, the passengers stopped them from boarding the aircraft.
According to a video clip repeatedly shown by the local media, passengers were shouting at Malik who was ilmed going back hurriedly when confronted by the passengers.
Watch video here:
“Malik sahab, sorry. You should go back. You should apologise to these passengers. You should be ashamed of
yourself…250 passengers have suffered because of you. It is your fault, sir,” a passenger was heard saying in the clip.
“Malik sahab, you are not a minister any more. And even if you are, we don’t care…anymore,” he said.
The clip, which has gone viral online, showed passengers booing and ridiculing the lawmakers as the crew also joined them.
Kumar was not shown in the video but Dawn reported that he was also not allowed to board the plane. PIA spokesperson Mashood Tajwar speaking to Dawn said that the delay in the flight was due to a technical issue and not because of Malik.
“PIA does not promote VIP culture…but this flight was delayed an hour and 30 minutes due to a technical reason,” Tajwar said.
“The delay had been conveyed to passengers via SMS. Some passengers who had given the contact details of their travel agent may not have been conveyed the message by their agents,” Tajwar said. He said the plane took off at 8:55 pm last night.
“The flight was not delayed because of Rehman Malik. We are looking into what actually happened but after the delay, the flight departed when it was meant to,” he added.

Alibaba IPO Poised to Make HistoryAlibaba IPO Poised to Make History
 
Morning Money Memo:
Alibaba’s first public stock sale hasn’t happened yet, but already it’s a big deal for global financial markets. The hugely successful Chinese e-commerce company now plans to raise as much as $25 billion in its stock offering later this week, making it the biggest IPO in history. Alibaba has been meeting with potential investors in the past week, and demand led to an increase in the planned stock price.
Alibaba says it plans to sell about 368 million shares at $66 to $68 apiece, according to a regulatory filing. It had previously set the range for $60 to $66 apiece. Already, say analysts, there has been spillover effect. Because investors need to free up money to participate in the IPO, they may be selling shares of U.S. e-commerce companies. Amazon’s share price has dropped 5 percent in past week. “EBay’s share price also is under pressure of late,” the website qz.com says.
One congressman is fighting to protect Yelpers when it does negative reviews. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., is proposing legislation that would protect amateur reviewers nationwide from legal or financial retaliation.
Swalwell’s bill was inspired by what happened to a couple in Utah after they posted a bad review, according to The National Journal. They were said to have been fined $3,500 for “unwittingly violating a retailer’s terms-of-sale contract.” The bill is similar to a new Yelp law in California that fines restaurants and other businesses that write “disparagement clauses” into their terms of service contracts, allowing them to charge reviewers with fees. “It’s un-American for any consumer to be penalized for writing an honest review,” Swalwell says.
Until now the Federal Reserve has reassured stock market investors, saying it will keep official short-term interest rates near zero for a “considerable time.” But those two words might be dropped from the next Fed statement Wednesday. Policymakers begin a two-day meeting this morning. Markets are on edge. The Fed begins a two-day meeting today. Stock futures are down this morning. The averages closed mixed Monday.
Russia’s currency has dropped to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar as it continues to suffer from the fallout of economic sanctions. The United States and the European Union last week imposed a new round of sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine despite the ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels. The ruble has lost over 2.7 percent in just two days.
Believe it or not, there’s a magazine for dog haters! OK, it’s in German, but Kot and Koter (“Poops and Pooches” in English) sold out after its first print run. What began as a joke by several journalists now has a following. “The lead story is a satirical look at how to “Pimp Up Your Pooch,” The Wall Street Journal reports. “Another article is about kitschy dog cemeteries.” Germany has 80 million people and about 5 million dogs. The magazine’s editor tells the Journal that there are two kinds of people in Germany: “One type loves dogs. Another type doesn’t. These are my readers.”

Orthodox rabbis on gunsBy Eugene Volokh September 16 Follow @volokhc
The Rabbinical Council of America released this resolution two months ago:
In response to the terrible proliferation of fatal shootings in the United States that result in part from Americans’ easy access to lethal weapons, a brief yet comprehensive 2014 resolution of the 1000+ members of Rabbinical Council of America addresses gun usage and ownership in the United States from personal, legal, cultural, and religious perspectives. Asserting the Torah’s perspective that war, weaponry, and violence are “necessary evils in our unredeemed world” as well as the Torah’s view that, contrary to some strains of American culture, such matters must be approached with appropriate gravitas even when warranted, the RCA favors restricting Americans’ easy access to weapons and ammunition and encourages all to desist from recreational activities that desensitize participants to killing, weaponry, and violence.
Formally adopted by a direct vote of the RCA membership, the full text of “2014 Resolution: Gun Violence in America” states:
WHEREAS War, killing, physical violence, and weaponry are necessary evils in our unredeemed world; and,
WHEREAS Engagement with these matters ought at all times to be conducted with gravitas commensurate with their destructive nature; and,
WHEREAS Jewish law adopts the opinion of the Sages (Mishna Shabbat 6:4) that weapons ought never be glorified or viewed as adornments even when their possession is justified, in contradistinction to certain strains of American culture; and,
WHEREAS The Rabbinical Council of America has noted with anguish and alarm some of the recent shooting deaths in schools and elsewhere in the United States (here, here, and here); and,
WHEREAS The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America expressed support for federal legislation to prevent gun violence in 2013 and as early as 1968
Therefore, the Rabbinical Council of America
Condones, when permitted by local ordinance, private American citizens owning or learning how to use weapons or to engage in violent acts for justified purposes such as self-­defense, when undertaken with appropriate gravitas; and
Favors restricting American citizens’ easy and unregulated access to weapons and ammunition; and
Urges all to desist from and discourage recreational activities that desensitize participants to, make light of, or glorify war, killing, physical violence, and weapons; and
Anxiously seeks the fulfillment of the prophetic vision, “They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4).
A source whom I trust, though, reports that, in the “direct vote of the RCA membership,” of the 1000+ RCA members, only 90 voted for the resolution, 62 voted against, and the other 850+ did not vote. (Apparently the resolution was sent out by e-mail for people to vote on, so that likely led to a very low turnout.)
In any event, a dozen Orthodox rabbis — including three members of the same Rabbinical Council of America’s National Executive Committee, six more RCA members, and three non-members — just responded with this counter-statement :
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE GOLANI RIFLE & PISTOL CLUB, RABBI STEVEN PRUZANSKY, RABBI DAVID BENDORY, AND OTHER RABBIS IN SUPPORT OF JEWISH LAW, JEWISH LIFE, AND JEWISH SELF-DEFENSE
September 15, 2014.
We the undersigned declare our support for Jewish Law, Jewish life, and Jewish self-defense, and therefore our opposition to the recent, bewildering statement by the Rabbinical Council of America (“RCA”) that promotes arbitrary gun control measures (see “2014 Resolution: Gun Violence in America, issued August 13, 2014, at http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105804) and explicitly endorses a similar statement by the Union of Orthodox Congregations of America (“OU”) (see “OU Supports Federal Legislation to Prevent Gun Violence,” issued April 9, 2013, at http://www.ou.org/news/ou_supports_federal_legislation_to_prevent_gun_violence/).
The RCA’s statement, like that of the OU, is rife with platitudes, ignores basic facts, and fails to recognize Judaism’s strong support for the value and practice of armed self-defense. Although the RCA reluctantly condones legal gun ownership, their statement evinces an overall hostility to gun possession and self-defense, and completely fails to address the limitations on the self-defense rights of the law-abiding public, who live under threat from violent criminals (including Jew-haters). When a premier rabbinical body of modern orthodoxy takes a public position on an issue as critical to the Jewish people as gun regulation, it is incumbent on them first to contemplate all relevant considerations, not least of which is the well-publicized and increasing violence against Jews worldwide. This the RCA and OU have failed to do.
In response, we present below many of the reasons why these two organizations should reconsider their prior positions, and instead encourage Jews to remain ready, vigilant, and armed. The RCA and OU should promote legislation that offers law-abiding citizens full protection of their right to self-defense, both inside and outside the home, especially in the most restrictive states, which contain large Jewish population centers. All Jews, like all Americans, should be able to exercise, in a sober and prudent manner, their fundamental right and halachic obligation to defend themselves, their families, and communities, whenever the need arises.
* * * * * *
• There are already strict measures in place to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. The RCA’s and OU’s support for “restricting American citizens’ easy and unregulated access to weapons and ammunitions” does not take into account the regulations that already exist nationwide, including exceptionally stringent regulations in the tri-state area around New York City that effectively ban carrying guns outside the home and subject peaceful citizens to prosecution merely for being ready to defend themselves. Access to firearms by violent criminals is already illegal, and access by the mentally ill is already restricted. It is grossly misleading to suggest that the current, complex legal regime at the federal, state, and local levels does not exist. Furthermore, the RCA and OU fail to explain why imposing additional draconian restrictions and penalties on peaceful citizens will stop criminals from obtaining guns. In fact, adding to the burdens on the law-abiding will only render them more helpless if they are assaulted – especially in places (such as synagogues) which are likely targets of nefarious people who disobey the law and commit their crimes while heavily armed. The approach taken by the RCA and OU leave their Jewish constituents virtually defenseless in the face of deadly threats.
• To stop crime, stop criminals. Everyone recognizes that a tool is not responsible for the action of the person who holds it. For instance, we do not speak of the annual murders committed with baseball bats as “bat violence.” Yet we are told that guns, unlike any other tools, actually cause crime. The real causes of crime, of course, are more complex and more difficult to address. It is much easier to talk about guns than to consider issues like family breakdown and educational decline. But focusing on guns is no more effective than focusing on any other implement used by criminals. We might as well try to regulate criminals’ shoes, gloves, masks, or cars.
• Gun control has proven ineffective at stopping crime. The RCA and OU have ignored many key facts, among which are the following:
1) Violent crime, including crime involving guns, has been declining steadily over the last two decades, at the same time as the majority of states have been lifting restrictions on the right to self-defense;
2) Spree shootings in schools or on government property are very rare events, representing a tiny fraction of annual homicides;
3) Such shootings have most often occurred in locations that have been declared officially “gun free,” which gives notice to criminals that they will be able to commit their crimes without immediate challenge;
4) The vast majority of gun homicides are committed by a relatively small population of hardened, recidivist criminals who are not deterred by laws restricting gun purchases;
5) The rates of violent crime tend to be higher in areas with the most restrictive gun laws.
• Gun owners stop criminals and save lives every day. The RCA and OU fail to recognize that ordinary citizens use guns to protect themselves and others every single day. Across the country, mothers, fathers, and even children successfully protect their families against home invaders and carjackers. Women protect themselves against rapists. Business owners and store clerks protect themselves against armed robbers. Whether by brandishing a gun, pointing it, or shooting it, gun owners are able to fend off criminals and, often, to hold them until police arrive, saving not only their own lives but the lives of future victims. While many of these incidents go unreported (and somehow none of them ever seem to make the pages of the New York Times), they happen nonetheless. For a small selection of relevant news stories, the RCA and OU might consult the Guns Save Lives blog at www.gunssavelives.net. For further relevant facts and analysis, they might examine the “Facts about Guns” section of The Truth About Guns blog at http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/gun-facts/.
• Peaceful gun ownership promotes equality. The statements by the RCA and OU do not consider the inevitable and unequal consequences of disarmament. Guns are “equalizers.” They empower citizens of any size or capability to withstand attack from vicious criminals. To deny this tool to peaceful citizens is to put them at the mercy of those who are stronger or more numerous. And those who are physically weakest will be most vulnerable. We prefer to read stories about grandmothers who made burglars turn tail and flee, teenagers who drove off home invaders, and wheelchair-bound men who stopped robbers, rather than obituaries about their unjust demise.
• Jewish history supports self-defense. It is remarkable that the RCA and OU have ignored the long Jewish history of persecution. The Jewish people have been murdered and persecuted in nearly every era and place on the globe. From the Crusades to the Chmielnicki massacres to the Holocaust, we have lost millions of lives to those who took advantage of our inability to defend ourselves. Even now — in this season, this week, indeed, this very day — we are being attacked in Europe and in Israel by enemies who without shame call in public for our deaths. Nor are we completely safe in the U.S., where terrorists have conspired against synagogues and individual Jews have been attacked. It should be clear that the threats against Jews in the U.S. and abroad are serious and increasing. It should be just as clear to the RCA and OU that further limiting our ability to defend ourselves at such a time is the very last thing Jewish leaders should be demanding.
• Self-defense does not equate to vigilantism. It is important to note in passing that, contrary to what is commonly alleged, possessing the tools and obtaining the training to defend oneself does not turn one into a vigilante. Many thousands of Jews are already gun owners, and yet they have not engaged in any rash of crimes. Jews as a people understand all too well how precious life is and how important it is to preserve it. However, we cannot and must not ignore the maxim of Chazal: “Haba lehargecha hashkem lehargo.” (“If one comes to kill you, kill him first.”)
• We have a duty of self-defense under Jewish Law. Our mitzvot oblige us to preserve and defend Jewish lives. This obligation is all the more important while we are in Exile and therefore at greater risk. Rendering Jews less capable of self-defense and more dependent upon others runs counter to our halachic duty, endangers all Jewry and emboldens our enemies. (Also, others are more likely to help defend us if we show that we are willing to defend ourselves.)
• The Torah praises self-defense. The Torah recognizes armed self-defense as a requirement for a free people. As Exodus 13:18 states, “The children of Israel went up out of Egypt armed.” The Israelites were no longer slaves; they were armed. Indeed, from its early chapters, the Torah teaches that readiness for armed conflict is a moral duty and necessary for Jewish survival. When Lot was kidnapped, Avraham led 318 armed men to battle in order to save him. The Torah does not say that the men had to train for battle; they were already trained. Jewry today should likewise engage in training and stand ready to defend themselves.
• The Tanach praises self-defense. The Tanach is replete with accounts of the heroic wars of Israel, from Joshua to Gideon, from David to Josiah. As in the instance of Avraham above, the Jews were able to fight because they were armed and trained. None of these leaders would have been able to go into battle if the Jews had not already readied themselves.
• Channukah celebrates self-defense. Every year on Channukah, Jews celebrate and praise the Maccabees for their armed defense of the Torah and Jewish life. Should Jews today not emulate the Maccabees’ bravery and skill?
* * * * * *
Like the RCA, we look forward to a day of universal peace, when “the law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the L-rd from Jerusalem,” when G-d “will judge between the nations,” and weapons will no longer be required to defend ourselves against our enemies. But we pray for such a future with open eyes, conscious of centuries of Jewish helplessness and of the growing number of attacks on Jews today. The assumption that an era of peace and brotherhood will dawn if we disarm ourselves, limit our access to firearms, or vitiate our right of self-defense, has no support in Jewish history, the teachings of the Torah, or present reality. Plowshares and pruning hooks will not defend Jews against enemies equipped with swords, spears, and deadlier weapons. Pretending otherwise will only undermine the preservation of the Jewish people — and the security of all Americans.

Big Data enables us to reach the bottom of the pyramid: TTSLCIOPrint
Tata Teleservices Ltd CIO Ashish Pachory explains the need for big data and how his company has been using it across several aspects of its functioning.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:54 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 8:14 pm
Tata Teleservices has become one of the first companies in India to harness big data to bolster its legal and regulatory operational requirements. In an email interaction with Nandagopal Rajan, Tata Teleservices Ltd CIO Ashish Pachory explains the need for big data and how his company has been using it across several aspects of its functioning.
How synced in are Indian companies about the opportunities of big data?
Indian companies are gradually coming into sync with their global counterparts in tapping the true potential of big data. Desktop analytic tools are no longer sufficient as the volume, velocity and variety of data are growing exponentially. Advanced analytics are key to providing companies with the ability to conduct analysis and simulations of all business transactions, while presenting a model which is concise, relevant and accurate.
How big is the market?
International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that the global market for big data will reach $16.1 billion in 2014, achieving growth six times faster than the overall IT market. With the anticipated surge in data consumption and generation, growth of the big data market is inevitable. In addition, security programmes associated with the technology will see increased prominence across sectors such as retail, IT, e-commerce, health, aviation and telecom.
Are we seeing smaller companies tap into big data?
SMEs are gradually opening up to the idea of effectively using big data analytics and are following the lead of larger enterprises. It is critical for smaller companies to understand and adopt big data solutions, which also tend to be cost-effective, in helping their business function more efficiently under the aegis of hard-core insights.
Are most big data solutions beyond small and medium companies?
Smaller companies are generating data in proportion to their size. With big data analytics, it becomes easier and more economical to manage huge chunks of data that can be used for various kinds of analysis ranging from customer behaviour to purchasing trends. Small businesses using data intelligently can equip themselves with opportunities to streamline processes and customise product and service offerings. Thus, we are now also seeing a lot of smaller e-commerce platforms leveraging big data to their benefit.
Is the problem also of companies not knowing how to use their data effectively?
Awareness about big data and its impact on businesses has just started seeping into the fundamental workings of companies. Enterprises are still working on creating an approach that works best for them in terms of business and customer impact. We are, however, seeing an increased uptake of big data analysis to proactively push for solutions that help organisations at a broader level.
How is TTSL using big data?
Tata Teleservices Limited (TTSL) has been making use of big data solutions for quite some time now. There is a strong emphasis on end-to-end customer experience management. Big Data enables us to reach the bottom of the pyramid and define systems to measure stage-wise experience parameters for a given customer and correlate them for personalised delivery. We also have elegant predictive tools and robust data warehousing in place. While these solutions enable us to leverage structured data, we are also looking at available options for effective mining of unstructured data. Using the Hadoop framework we have leveraged Big Data for more effective Vigilance Tracking and Monitoring.
Big data also plays a crucial role in addressing legal and regulatory requirements which are mandated for longer retention periods. Given the growing volume of data and the time sensitivity attached to such requirements, organisations usually look to procure additional storage and servers incurring high expenditure. As an alternative, we deployed big data solutions which were very cost effective and also provided timely information. Other business functions that benefit from these tools include marketing campaigns, customer service and network management. We expect to see a spiralling trend in the deployment and adoption of big data analytics, especially in customer experience management.
Are you helping other companies tap big data too?
TTSL has a strong and growing base of enterprise customers. Amongst these we see a healthy adoption of Big Data and other trends. It is TTSL’s mission to simplify and enrich people’s lives. With Big Data, as with Mobility and Cloud, a strong communication backbone is a key success factor. To that extent we are already an enabler of Big Data for our customers. Further, we see lot of potential for adding greater value to other companies through Big Data solutions as a one-stop service provider. There is a growing emphasis within the Tata group companies as well to adopt Big Data as a lever to enhance the customers’ experience across the value chain and TTSL is an active player in this initiative. We expect that TTSL’s participation and contribution in this sphere will grow over time as we establish ourselves as thought leaders in this domain.
How big is the big data opportunity in India?
A joint study by NASSCOM and CRISIL Global Research & Analytics estimates that the Indian big data industry will grow from USD 200 million in 2012 to $1 billion in 2015, at a CAGR in excess of 83 percent. To further put things in perspective, according to an IDC Data Survey, around 36 per cent of the information from India would be valuable only if it were to be analysed. Given the immense potential of the technology in terms of driving business impact and efficiency, the need of the hour is to encourage talent that is able to effectively plan and manage the mining of big data elements and drive awareness amongst stakeholders to utilise the insights derived from these analytics.

PMJDY: Existing account holders can claim b...account holders
(The benefits would include…)
NEW DELHI: Government has decided that benefits under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) would be extended to existing bank account holders provided they apply for it.
The benefits would include issuance of RuPay Debit card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh, official statement said today.
Besides, there would be an issuance of an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000 after satisfactory operations in the account for some time.
The Government has asked banks to extend overdraft facility to only one member, preferably lady of a household, it said.
"The plan (PMJDY) inter-alia, envisages universal access to banking facilities under which all the six lakh villages across the entire country would be mapped, organised into Sub Service Areas ( SSAs ) of 1000-1500 households and allocated to the Banks to provide at least one fixed point banking outlet in form of either a branch or a Business Correspondent (who is named as Bank Mitra)," it said.
The other components of the plan are providing at least one Basic Banking Account to each household with RuPay Debit card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh; an overdraft facility of Rs 5000 after satisfactory operations in the account for six months, it said.
Further, an additional life insurance cover of Rs 30,000 is also available to accounts opened up to January 26, 2015, for which detailed modalities are being worked-out, it added.

Arunachal Pradesh: Kiwi s wine launched4

Itanagar: A high quality wine produced from kiwi fruits of Arunachal Pradesh has been formally launched. The wine being sold in the brand name of 'Arun Kiwi' was produced as a result of an MoU signed between Arunachal Pradesh Horticultural Produce Marketing & Processing Board (APHPM&PB) and Pune-based Hill Crest Foods & Beverages Pvt Ltd in December last year.
The brand name bears the name of Arunachal Pradesh, the largest kiwi fruit producing state in the country, APHPM&PB Managing Director Tage Tatung said in a release on Tuesday.
Kiwi fruits cultivated in Arunachal Pradesh are of high aroma and flavour, thus producing a very crisp and fresh kiwi wine. The MoU was signed with Hill Crest Foods & Beverages considering the huge surplus and value added for the fruit processing, he said adding kiwi wine is produced in a few countries like New Zealand in the world.
The brand name bears the name of Arunachal Pradesh, the largest kiwi fruit producing state in the country, APHPM&PB Managing Director Tage Tatung said.
#arunachal pradesh #arun kiwi #wine #kiwi
"After a few years we should be in a position to exporting Arun Kiwi," Tatung said. In the initial stage, the price of the wine has been kept low for promotion. To promote kiwi fruit farming and helping farmers by such value addition, Arunachal Pradesh government was not making any profit rather incurring some losses, he said.
Tatung appealed to all kiwi fruit traders to come to Arunachal Pradesh instead of importing from other countries as the state government is eager to support, promote and welcome such ventures.
'Arun Kiwi' was launched in Pune on Friday. Rhythm Winery, a part of the Hill Crest Foods & Beverages Pvt Ltd, is sourcing over 2.5 tonnes of kiwi fruits from Arunachal for brewing the wine. According to the MoU, the revenues from this business will go to the APHPM&PB while Rhythm Winery is only a service
provider working on project basis.
"We will finance the full cost of the project amounting to Rs 18,84,000 as per project proposal submitted by Hill Crest," Tatung said.

(Besides, about 16 documents…)
NEW DELHI: China is expected to commit investments worth $6.5 billion to set up industrial parks in India and sign purchase agreements of over $3 billion with domestic companies during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping beginning tomorrow.
Besides, about 16 documents are likely to be signed in areas such as trade and economic development, drug administration and cooperation, an official said.
The Chinese President visit would start his three-day official visit from Ahmedabad tomorrow.
China has proposed to set up an automobile industrial park in Maharashtra and a power transmission park in Gujarat. The Chinese companies are expected to invest about $6.5 billion for development of these parks, the official said.
During the visit, about two dozen Chinese companies are likely to sign purchasing agreements with Indian firms to buy products such as copper cathode, sea food, cotton yarn, industrial salt and polypropylene.
These investments and purchase agreements will help India in narrowing the ballooning trade deficit with China which has reached about $35 billion in 2013-14.
Further in railways sector, the Chinese companies may also ink pacts in development of 650 km rail track for high speed train in Karnataka.
The bilateral trade between the countries stood at $65.85 billion in 2013-14. China has invested only $410 million during April 2000 and June 2014.

(The Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj…)
HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is proposing to set up two more aerospace parks involving 1,000 acres each, leveraging on the large defence and aerospace investments it attracted from several domestic and global giants like Tatas, Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin.
The Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj minister Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao, who is also the son of chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, said Tuesday the proposed aerospace parks will come up near Hyderabad.
Addressing a conference of the Aeronautical Society of India in Hyderabad, he said the state government was preparing a strategy to make Hyderabad a defence and aerospace hub in India. While one of the new parks will be located near the existing aerospace park at Adibatla on the South of Hyderabad, the other park will come up on the Northern side of the capital city.
Tata Advanced Systems is currently setting up three facilities in the 250-acre special economic zone at Adibatla in alliance with Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin for manufacturing helicopter cabins, aircraft components and aircrafts.
Speaking on the occasion, chairman of infrastructure conglomerate GMR group, GM Rao, said India was poised to emerge as the third largest aviation market by 2020. "With rising passenger traffic and increasing military and defence expenditures, the demand for aircraft is expected to increase significantly in the next few years. The industry forecasts a demand of approximately $100 billion for commercial aircraft in next two decades."
GMR group has an aerospace and multi product SEZ at Shamshabad, adjacent to the Hyderabad International Airport where it also has an aircraft MRO facility . The group is also planning to set up an aerospace training institute in Hyderabad with the support of French firm Safran .

By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Walking the talk: Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS Summit in July (file photo) PTI
Key investments to be announced during President Xi Jinping visit this week
New Delhi, September 14:  
By warming up to Japan to meet India’s infrastructure needs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have put several Western politicians — who shunned him post 2002 Gujarat riots — on notice.
However, Modi’s strong engagement with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month is expected to propel the Chinese to further expand its economic ties with India.
The emergence of Asian axis could impact the US influence on moulding the balance of power within Asia, say economy watchers.
China now sees the Indo-Japanese industrial collaboration as more “strategic”.
Modi’s coziness with Japanese leader Abe has clearly led to some eye-catching deals this month — assurance of $35 billion Japanese foreign direct investment into India over next five years, more Japanese soft loans besides collaboration in defence industry and rare earth exploration.
Japan will also play a strong role in the development of industrial corridors and may nudge its automakers and electronics companies to expand their Indian operations.
Japan, formerly a big donor for China, now counts India as its largest aid recipient.
Modi’s visit to Japan has certainly put India on a strong diplomatic wicket, raising its bargaining power with China (during the forthcoming visit of President Xi Jinping to India) and also the US (when Modi embarks on an official visit this month-end).
China is now clearly looking to match the investments promised by Japan into India.
After dilly-dallying for a long time, China has suddenly started walking the talk on its intention of pumping money into India. A team of Chinese officials has already identified two locations — one in Gujarat and the other in Maharashtra — to set up industrial parks with Chinese investments.
The country is also set to pledge its investments into railway infrastructure. Related MoUs will be signed during the Chinese President’s visit this week. China is already a large lender when it came to commercial loans, especially for the power sector.
India’s power sector has had the largest share of Chinese loans.
Look beyond Japan: UK
The United Kingdom, which is seeing the changing dynamics amongst the Asian biggies, does not seem all that happy with the growing India-Japanese collaboration on the industrial front.
UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in a meeting with representatives of think tanks and the Indian industry, during his recent India visit, indicated that India needed to think beyond Japan when inviting foreign investments.
“Since all countries are not able to invest by giving soft loans like Japan, the UK wants India to keep in mind the terms and conditions under which other countries can invest,” said a person who attended the meeting.

BEAT TREAT Ganesh Kumar with the kanjira
TOPICS
music festival
Ganesh Kumar talks about performing at the Frame Drum Festival in Germany and the kanjira’s power play
“My life revolves within the six-inch diameter of the kanjira,” declares Ganesh Kumar, fresh from the experience of allowing the instrument mingle with members of its ilk from across the globe at the ‘Tamburi Mundi’ (Frame Drum Festival) at Freiburg in Germany. “There was the bodhran from Ireland, tamburello from Italy, tar from America, doyra from Uzbekistan and bendir from Brazil. But it was delightful to hear the kanjira and its distinctive tonal spectrum, loud and clear, amidst the thuds and echoes of percussive ensembles,” says the excited artiste, who performed with the acclaimed drummer Glen Velez at the festival and conducted workshops too.
“The give-and-take exercise is as enjoyable as it is educative. It brings to the fore the improvisational quality, traditional flavour and depth of Carnatic music. You need to constantly push yourself to re-energise your artistry,” says Ganesh, who cherishes his association with jazz greats such as Bela Fleck, Steve Smith, Victor Wooten, John Wubbenhorst and George Brooks.
He has delved deep into these experiments and the influential characteristics of the kanjira in his forthcoming book Kanjira: A Guide to South Indian Frame Drumming (with western percussive notations). His two-part instructional DVD is an add-on to the many Skype lessons he conducts for rhythm-enthusiasts around the world.
“These rendezvous have brought me closer to diverse sounds and cultures,” says Ganesh, now working on an album with a flamenco guitarist. “The most thrilling aspect is the constant search for a meeting ground and laying a new path for a compatible musical journey,” he adds.
In fact the thesis of his Fulbright Fellowship that he pursued at Queens College in New York was on ‘Application of Indian Hand Drumming in Jazz music.’ He then worked along with the U.S.-based Cooperman Drum Company to design synthetic kanjiras that were launched under their Artist Innovation series. “I found these kanjiras made of maple wood and mylor to be a good substitute to the original made from the skin of the endangered monitor lizard.”
With the obliterating borders of the beatdom, the kanjira, once a mere upa-pakka-vadhyam in Carnatic cutcheris, is on a roll. The past decade has been the most happening period in the life of its not-so-celebrated practitioners as the instrument seems to have found its groove in the international soundscape. “The increasing cross-genre interactions and the growing awareness about the kanjira have given a new meaning to our creative commitment,” says Ganesh. A student of kanjira exponent T.H. Subash Chandran, Ganesh was initially trained by the inimitable Hari Hara Sharma (father of ghatam maestro Vikku Vinayakaram).
“For over 30 years, popularising the kanjira has been my one-point agenda. I want the world to experience the divinity in its rhythm. But of late, I have been trying to tap into its healing power. I want to use konnakol (syllables) to reach out to children with autism. The recitation of these rhythm patterns might help develop their cognitive skills,” explains Ganesh.
Bob Dylan’s ‘Tambourine’ song is one of Ganesh’s favourite. “I know it sounds funny, but it feels like an ode to the kanjira.” And he hums ‘Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me…’

A very bad time to break up BritainThis is a very bad time to break up Britain
By Gideon Rachman
Scottish nationalists could soon find there are worse people in the world than London’s ‘Tory toffs’
Until recently, I thought I did not much care if Scotland voted for independence. But, now, as the prospect becomes very real, I am surprised by how upset I feel. I follow the polls obsessively. I fume at the incompetence of the No campaign and the insularity of the Yes . And my sense of foreboding grows as the day grows closer.
Why should that be? The answer is that the Scottish referendum has made me realise how much my own sense of identity, and personal security, is tied up with my British nationality. Meanwhile my job – covering world affairs – tells me that the world is in a more dangerous state than for decades. That makes it a terrible time to break up Britain.
More
Cracks appear in Brics
As the child of immigrants, I always feel a sense of gratitude and pleasure when I write on a customs form: born London, nationality British. My forebears were not so lucky. My grandparents were Jews from different parts of eastern Europe who emigrated to South Africa in the years before the Holocaust. My parents emigrated again, not wanting to live or bring up children in apartheid South Africa. It feels like a personal triumph that my own children were born in the same country as me.
My ingrained sense that Britain represents stability is reinforced by my travels – often to more troubled parts of the world. I spent last week in Ukraine and felt lucky, as ever, to be able to return to my own safe corner of the world.
Britain’s political stability is what set this nation apart from the rest of Europe in the 20th century. All the other big nations experienced dictatorship or defeat or civil war or tyranny. Britain remained free, stable, democratic and apparently immune to fanaticism.
If the United Kingdom breaks up, that deep stability will be shaken. It is not that I expect civil war to break out. But I do not think a divorce between Scotland and England will be easy or friendly. There will be arguments about the currency, about the debt, about oil. Above all, there will be bruised and bitter feelings on both sides. On a personal level, I feel affronted to hear Scottish nationalists accuse the English of not caring about social justice, or of being narrow-minded and warmongering. That is not my experience, or the experience of millions of other immigrant families that were welcomed into England. Indeed, while the rhetoric of Scottish nationalism sometimes attacks the English for their alleged chauvinism, it is noticeable that England is a much more racially diverse country than Scotland.
Anybody who suggests the security situation in Europe might be relevant to Scotland’s referendum campaign is shouted down for scaremongering
I suspect that my own irritation with the rhetoric of Scottish nationalism is widely shared in England. That will mean that, at least for a while, that the English are unlikely to adopt a magnanimous attitude in any negotiations on independence. This could turn nasty quite quickly. In fact, even a narrow No vote could leave a legacy of frustration and resentment on both sides of the border.
Even in good times, I would worry about the implications of the break-up of the UK. But the current international environment is grimmer than for decades. An angry Russia has just annexed part of a neighbouring country. President Vladimir Putin boasts of his country’s nuclear arms and his ability to over-run Ukraine in two weeks. The EU he faces is weak and divided. The US is more detached than it has been for years. A far-right candidate has just topped an opinion poll for the next French presidential race. Meanwhile in the Middle East, a jihadist death cult has seized control of large parts of Iraq and a murderous civil war is raging in Syria. Hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees will wash up on the shores of Europe this year.
These troubles are lapping at the borders of the United Kingdom. Anybody who has witnessed the thousands of would-be migrants desperately trying to make it across to the Channel to England (before doubtless realising their mistake and heading for socially just Scotland) will have seen a vivid illustration of how global security issues affect everyday life.
More video
Yet the Scottish referendum campaign has been conducted as if the rest of the world stops at London. There has been almost no discussion of foreign affairs – apart from the nationalists’ inane refrain that a morally superior Scotland will not have to join in “illegal wars”. The nationalists also insist that an independent Scotland will get rid of nuclear weapons. (Ukraine did just that, when it became independent, and now bitterly regrets it.)
Anybody who suggests the security situation in Europe might be relevant to Scotland’s referendum campaign is shouted down for scaremongering. Alex Salmond, the leader of the Yes campaign, has even talked of his admiration for the way Mr Putin has restored Russian pride – remarks that were made as Russian troops were moving into Crimea.
If the world keeps going bad, the Scottish nationalists could soon discover that there are many worse and more dangerous people in the world than the hated “Tory toffs” in London. By then, however, it could be too late. If the vote goes the wrong way on Thursday, the UK will break up. George Robertson , a proud Scot and a former head of Nato, was not exaggerating when he said that the “forces of darkness” in the world would love that.

A united kingdom requires more than gifted amateurismSeptember 15, 2014 3:52 pm
Gifted amateurism is no foundation for a united kingdom
By Janan Ganesh
©AFP
Britons will feel a peculiar sensation on Friday morning. The union will be saved – or so the polls suggest – yet seem frailer than it ever has been. Perhaps 45 per cent of Scots or more are going to vote for secession in Thursday’s referendum , a number that outstrips all but the most grandiose expectations at the start of the campaign. Many of those voting the other way will do so out of risk-aversion rather than any emotional fealty. Had it not been for the euro crisis, which deprived nationalists of a neat answer as to which currency an independent Scotland would use, the United Kingdom would be done for.
Even the unionist side has accepted the reality of Scottish otherness. David Cameron has absented himself for most of the campaign because he has the wrong accent (English) and belongs to the wrong party (Conservative). This is simultaneously shrewd judgment by the prime minister and the ultimate proof of what a brittle thing the UK really is.
More
UK voters and the economy
The problem is about to get worse. Not only has the union been tugged loose by this referendum, it will keep loosening the day after. All the main parties in Westminster have promised to divest more powers to Edinburgh, starting almost immediately. With all the authority of a man who scraped 29 per cent of the vote at the last general election, Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron’s predecessor, has promised “nothing less than a modern form of Scottish home rule”. The fact that he is in no official position to offer anything of the sort, and that neither the English nor the Welsh nor the Northern Irish nor parliament itself have been consulted, seems just a rumple to be ironed out in good time.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless. Irreversible promises to do with the governing arrangements of the UK are being thrown around as campaign bait by desperate men in the last ditch.
Their punishment will be the ordeal of having to honour them. On top of everything it already runs, Scotland is being offered the chance to vary tax rates and welfare benefits. This is not quite devolution-max – generally taken to mean autonomy over everything other than foreign affairs and defence – but then it is only a starting bid. Alex Salmond , Scotland’s nationalist first minister, will ask for more and, with the vote-share he is about to achieve, he is entitled to. The two capitals will haggle their way to devo-max or some approximation of it.
We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless
At that point, MPs representing Scottish seats in Westminster, who are overwhelmingly Labour, will be voting on legislation that scarcely affects their constituents. Anybody who thinks this will be allowed to stand does not talk to enough Tory MPs, many of whose private views on Scottish independence already range from insouciance to glee.
In short, Scottish home rule means English home rule, which in turn means a separate constitutional wrangle about what shape this should take. There may be a federal UK, as Mr Brown suggests, but England’s preponderance would leave it looking freakishly askew. The alternative is to break up England itself into self-governing regions, an old idea that usually runs into a wall of local intransigence. The northeast voted against the creation of its own assembly 10 years ago by a crushing margin. City mayors were rejected in most of the big cities outside London in 2011.
The point is not that greater devolution to Scotland is a bad idea. It is right and unavoidable. The point is that it opens vast and nearly unanswerable questions about the governance of the rest of the kingdom that politicians, in their desperation to scrape over the line on Thursday, have not thought through. The time to ponder a new settlement was the confirmation of the referendum two years ago, when devo-max could have been added as a third option on the ballot. Debate would have swirled around the meaning and implications of that middle way.
Now, it is hard to avoid the image of Mr Cameron and his peers scrawling a new constitution on the back of a panini wrapper as their trains hurtle north for a jaunty last-minute campaign stop they never expected to have to make. There must be a point at which the British traditions of amateurism and muddling through become indistinguishable from the chaotic caprice of a banana republic.
A question nags: how unionist is unionism really? When even supporters of the UK envisage gradual divergence between Edinburgh and Westminster – ever-looser union, to invert the founding text of the EU – then Mr Salmond’s point is largely made for him. Unionism used to suffer from absolutism; many of its adherents resisted the creation of a Scottish parliament long after it had become irresistible. Now it suffers from the opposite problem. It craves the legal fact of the union without any of the content. For all the fervour on both sides, the difference between nationalism and unionism is fading to vanishing point.

Vegoil imports at a record high on Malaysian duty-free exportsVegoil imports at a record high on Malaysian duty-free exports
Our Bureau

Mumbai, September 15:  
Vegetable oil imports increased 75 per cent in August to touch a record high of 1,333,480 tonnes (757,830 tonnes).
The shipments were the highest ever since imports were allowed in India under open general licence in 1994. The previous highest level was at 11.6 lakh tonnes recorded in January last year, according to the Solvent Extractors’ Association.
Import boost
The import of vegetable oil into the country was boosted by scrapping of duty by Malaysia, one of the largest exporters of edible oil. Saddled by huge inventory, the exporting countries have decided to do away with the export duty on palm products.
Malaysia has allowed duty-free export of palm products since September from $35 a tonne in August, while Indonesia, which charges nine per cent or $66 on exports, is expected to follow suit in October, said the Association.
Domestic edible oil prices may come under pressure, with the exporting countries largesse and sharp fall in international prices to 2008-levels. The expected fall in prices may cast a gloom on farmers growing oilseeds as they will harvest their kharif crop in the next five to six weeks.
There is an urgent need to support farmers by increasing import duty on crude vegetable oils to 10 per cent from 2.5 per cent and refined vegetable oils to 25 per cent from 10 per cent, said the Association.
Inventory pile up
Import of soya oil in August jumped to a record level of 350,373 tonnes in August breaching the previous high of 306,068 tonnes logged in the preceding month. India imported 1,321,345 tonnes of edible oils and 12,135 tonnes of non-edible oils.
However, import of non-edible oils in August more than halved to 12,135 tonnes (28,794 tonnes). The overall import of non-edible oils in the past ten months was down 37 per cent at 155,926 tonnes. Major non-edible oils that were shipped in include palm fatty acid distillate and crude palm kernel oil.
As on September 1, edible oil stock at various ports is estimated at 860,000 tonnes, up by about 50 per cent from previous month and about 960,000 tonnes is in the pipeline.
Inventory at ports includes 360,000 tonnes of crude palm oil, 105,000 tonnes of refined palmolein, 250,000 tonnes of degummed soybean oil, 140,000 tonnes of crude sunflower oil and 5,000 tonnes of rapeseed (Canola Oil). Total stock, both at ports and in pipelines, increased to 1,820,000 tonnes from 1,590,000 tonnes in August.

Kashmir floods - Army gains where media failsAjai Shukla: Kashmir floods - Army gains where media fails
Ajai Shukla |  Sep 15, 2014 09:44 PM IST
If perspectives of this month's flood disaster in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), especially the New Orleans-like inundation of Srinagar, were shaped only by national television, this would be a simple story of how the Indian Army again pulled the chestnuts out of the fire. Day after day, this monochromatic narrative played out with minor variations, like the suggestion that Kashmiris should thank the army for saving their undeserving hides.
The insensitivity even took the form of taunting questions to Kashmiris about whether they should now learn to love the army that they criticised so much. Had TV channel editors warned off their half-baked correspondents, the army might have benefited enormously from public gratitude for its selfless work. Instead, there was seething anger on the streets of Srinagar at this crass and tactless milking of nationalism.
The stage on which this disaster played out is littered with protagonists, most of whom did not receive the attention they deserve. First amongst them is the Aam Kashmiri. The national media failed dismally in highlighting the local response, and the rescue effort that locals mounted when their government proved unable to. While the state government has been rightly castigated for evaporating when it was most required, there has been insufficient examination of the pretenders - the separatist leaders who usually waste no time shoving their way into the limelight. The central government has reaped the benefits of the army's good work, but has questions to answer about why its other agencies failed to function, such as the National Disaster Management Agency.
Let us publicly acknowledge the common Kashmiri - an inappropriate term because Srinagar's inhabitants demonstrated in the face of calamity that they are uncommon folk. From Day One of the crisis, even before the army could swing into action, students, mohalla leaders and common folk began moving the marooned to safer locations, using makeshift methods. Initial army efforts benefited from these splendid youngsters, since government servants had simply abandoned their responsibilities. Then, with families separated and people missing, these techno-savvy youngsters used social media to bridge the communication gap. Others established relief camps to receive emergency supplies that began flowing into the valley as the country rallied behind Kashmir.
The local media, even with its publication equipment knocked out by the flood, comprehensively outdid the national media. Taking quickly to social media, local reports provided the first insights into the bravery of locals.
Notwithstanding this grass-roots solidarity, the disaster revealed a traumatised, fractured and leaderless society. Of Kashmir's many internal fault lines, none has emerged as starkly as the abyss between the people and their leaders. This mirrors the street violence of 2008, 2009 and 2010, when leadership slipped into the hands of the people and previously unknown luminaries like Masarat Alam. This month again, the Kashmiri leadership - both elected and separatist - vanished, reappearing much later as a speck in the rear-view mirror, scrambling to invent a rationale for itself.
Not even a disaster so immense should sweep away an entire government structure. If, as Chief Minister Omar Abdullah dramatically declares, Kashmir's police, civil servants and even ministers were themselves struggling to survive, why did they not reappear later, in whatever battered form, for rescue work? When students and local community members could organise rescue work, what reason was there for governance to evaporate? The bleak conclusion is that the J&K government has become a securitised structure, focused only on the physical protection of its leaders and functionaries. Will the J&K government call its absconding functionaries to account? Unlikely, given that the absentees include top bureaucrats and ministers.
In another environment, fundamentalist, even jihadi, elements might have garnered credibility by coming forward when government leadership collapses. This happened during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, when Jamat ud Dawa (the Lashkar-e-Toiba front) was prominent in organising rescue and relief, just as it had done after the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir. Fortunately, the separatist leadership in Kashmir is less dynamic. Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who could have opportunistically gained brownie points, only discredited himself by accusing the army of "staging rescues" for TV cameras. Mr Geelani grossly underestimates the Kashmiri people.
It is hard to dispute that the army has emerged from this disaster with its image enhanced. Yet it is the nature of day-to-day politics in Kashmir that this is only a transient gain. A single fake encounter, a single allegation of rape or molestation and the public dialogue will revert to the injustice of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the alleged brutality of "India's army of occupation". New Delhi must realise that the military's good work in the floods is a mere opportunity for a political outreach to Kashmir. If the moment is not grasped, it will quickly pass.
The most impressive dimension of the army's rescue work was not the 226,000 people rescued; the infant handed out swaddled in a blanket; the grandmother hauled out of swirling waters; or the chopper landing on the roof of a house to convey the frantic inhabitants to safety. The army does those things all year round. Instead, an unusually impressive performance has come from the army's media organisation, the Army Liaison Cell (ALC). Under an imaginative commander, Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan, the ALC transformed its Facebook page and Twitter feed into an information exchange, in which distressed enquiries from across the country were forwarded through a closed WhatsApp group to Srinagar, providing inputs into decisions about where to send rescue parties. Similarly, details of people rescued flowed back from Srinagar, with the ALC disseminating the good news to the world. The army's long-standing weakness has been its public interface. This could be changing.

Maharashtra polls: Shiv Sena rejects BJPs demand for 135 seats; parleys continueAmid negotiations Uddhav Thackeray
Mumbai, September 15:  
The 25-year-old alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena could be facing turbulent weather with the latter taking an adamant position on seat sharing equation. Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that he had rejected BJP’s demand of contesting 135 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections in Maharashtra.
Thackeray said that his party continues to hold talks with its old ally but also hinted it could fight elections on its own, adding, “everything has an alternative”. Top leaders in BJP have been told that it would not be possible to spare more seats, he said at the launch of a fresh instalment of the party’s vision document for Maharashtra.
In 2009, Assembly elections, Shiv Sena had fought 169 seats and BJP in 119 seats. But, due to a drastic change in the country’s political scenario in the last five years, BJP has demanded more seats, which its ally is in mood to give.
A top BJP leader on the condition of anonymity said that after the thumping victory in Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena thinks that it can win the Assembly elections on its own. Unfortunately, some BJP leaders are also thinking on the same lines. “It is just a manifestation of inflamed and raging ambition,” the leader said.
BJP is also missing deceased leaders such as Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Mundhe, whose negotiation and team building skills were legendary, the leader said.
The Shiv Sena supremo added that the party is making all efforts to ensure that the alliance between the Sena and the BJP does not end. Excessive wrangling over seat sharing is not in the interest of both parties and the alliance should not miss the opportunity to remove the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government from Maharashtra.
BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy had on Sunday said that his party had proposed that both BJP and Shiv Sena could contest 135 seats each and the remaining seats should be shared between Republican Party of India (Athavale), Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana of Raju Shetty, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (‘National Social Party’) of Mahadev Jankar.

Venus Remedies slips over 16% post Crisil downgrade

Analyst Recommendation
(Venus Remedies is undertaking…)
MUMBAI: Shares of Venus Remedies tanked over 16 per cent intraday after ratings agency Crisil downgraded the company's the bank facilities to D from BB+.
"The rating downgrade reflects delays in repayment of term loan by the company driven by a stretched liquidity. VRL's stretched liquidity is on account of the significant increase in total cost of the large debt-funded capital expenditure over the past one year and high working capital requirements," Crisil note said.
Venus Remedies is undertaking capex towards setting up marketing office. The total cost of this capex is estimated to have increased by about Rs 100 to 150 million.
In addition to the above company's liquidity has also deteriorated on account of the high working capital requirements reflected by inventory of about 131 days as on March 31, 2014.
"The ratings continue to reflect VRL's comfortable financial risk profile, marked by a healthy net worth and strong debt protection metrics. The ratings also factor in the company's strong presence in the high-value critical care segment and the healthy growth in its domestic and export sales," the report added.
At 11:30 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 326.75, down 13.67 per cent, on the BSE. It plunged 16.51 per cent to touch intraday low of Rs 316.

Credit growth to take off08:00 am
With  State Bank of India cutting deposit rates for 1-3 years to 8.75 percent from 9 percent , could other banks soon follow suit? Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of  HDFC sees more banks cutting deposit rates in the next two months. He believes SBI decided to cut rates on the back of lower-than-expected credit offtake.
According to him, in another quarter or two, credit growth will take off. He says traditionally, credit offtake is highest in the fourth quarter. "I would be surprised to see sub-15 percent credit growth by FY15 end," Mistry told CNBC-TV18.
According to him, if deposit rate across the system is lowered, then HDFC too will have to lower it. However, he was unable to give a timeline for a cut in deposit rates.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Keki Mistry's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We got early morning news from State Bank of India (SBI) that they have dropped their big bucket of deposit their one-three year deposit rates by a quarter percentage point, is this the first sign that rates are headed lower?
A: Inflation numbers clearly have come down. So with inflation numbers coming down and the credit off take probably not being as quick as or as fast as expected, they have cut down deposit rates. So yes, I think the expectation would be fair that over the next month or two we could see a few more rate cuts in the system on deposits. However, it’s too premature to say that this a long-term thing because my sense is that as the sentiments in India had got so much better in the last four or five months, it is only going to be a matter of time may be a quarter or two quarters before we see credit off take begin. When credit off take picks up, maybe some of these banks may again need to look at revising the rates upwards a little bit.
Latha: As a veteran money man how would a banker think? As soon as they cut rates, they usually pass it as lower loan rates as well, lending rates as well?
A: Not necessarily because again when you cut the rate it is only incremental deposits which come in at that lower rate. The existing loan rates don’t get revised downwards till the cycle plays out. So it may not translate into an immediate cut in anyway but over a period of time, if these rates were to prevail and the credit offtake was not to be very sharp then yes, it would translate into cuts in lending rates also.
Sonia: Over a period of time, how much do you think credit growth could pick up to? A banker was telling us earlier that credit growth is extremely sluggish about not even 10-13 percent. How much do you think it could pick up to?
A: I would be surprised if credit growth is lower than 15-16 percent for this year and my sense would be that real offtake in credit tends to pick up in Q4 of the financial year, which is January to March. Historically, if you take the last ten years, most of these ten years will find credit offtake in rupee terms is highest in Q4.
I would think that you will see a similar kind of thing emerging this year. So I would say, the reduction in interest rates on the lending side, one may have to wait a little bit till we get a more clear sense on how much further liquidity RBI is going to inject if any and how the credit offtake pays off in the system.
Latha: Once banks start their rate cutting cycle, do you think they are in a better place than finance companies, which depend on wholesale deposits because wholesale market money is not moving down so much, so do they steal a march over you when this cycle starts?
A: We have also deposits - many of the finance companies also have deposits.
Latha: You will drop the rates there?
A: Obviously, if the deposit rates overall in the banking system are lower, of course we will lower our deposit rates. May not be right away.
Latha: Should we hear from you before the month is out?
A: I don’t know about the month in particular. This is something which we review on a regular basis. So once we feel that there is enough room and that money will be available even at slightly lower rates, we can look at that. I cannot give you a time limit for that.
Sonia: What is the situation on the ground as far as liquidity is concerned? Has liquidity improved considerably such that the banks don’t want to pay higher deposit rates?
A: I would say that banks are sitting on surplus cash because credit offtake is lower, then what is the point of paying higher rates and deposits and continuing to sit on more surplus cash. That is perhaps the reason why the deposit rate cut has been in place. But if credit offtake picks up, which also can happen in the January to March quarter then banks will have to look at the liquidity position and see whether they can continue to get liquidity at those low rates that we are offering in deposits.

Street Signs
Public sector lender  Bank of Baroda is not looking to cut deposit rates anytime soon. After India’s largest public sector lender  State Bank of India cut deposit rates on Tuesday, there are expectations that others may follow suit.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Ranjan Dhawan, ED, Bank of Baroda (BoB) said that there is no knee-jerk reaction to SBI's rate cut because the bank had already cut its bulk deposit rates substantially in the last one year. But clearly rates are headed down in the system and one can expect softening of interest rates by the end of the year, he added.
Further, Dhawan said credit growth for the banking industry is likely to be at 11-11.5 percent and for BoB hopes to clocks nearly one percent more.
Below is the transcript of Ranjan Dhawan's interview with CNBC-TV18’s Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra
Ekta: First your preliminary reaction to State Bank of India (SBI) cutting rates on deposits for the tenure of one-three years by 25 bps and will Bank of Baroda (BoB) follow suit?
A: The main reason why it appears to be that SBI has cut deposit rates is that credit offtake for the last several months has been very weak and on the back of this, we don’t require that volume of deposits. Therefore, probably this is the reason that SBI has cut deposit rates. As far as BoB is concerned, our bulk deposit rates for deposits above Rs 1 crore were already at 8.75. That is number one.
Secondly, we have stopped taking bulk deposits a long time back. We were not offering any substantial increases in deposit rates for bulk deposits. We had substantially cut down our bulk deposits over the last one year. Therefore, at the moment, we are quite comfortable with our deposit rates. We are not having any knee-jerk reaction to SBI’s action. We will wait and watch for a few more days and see what is the market reaction to it and the asset-liability committee (ALCO) will decide accordingly perhaps in 10-15 days time.
Anuj: Do you get a sense that rates are headed further down in the system from this point on?
A: I would expect so and the reason I would expect so is that with the revival of a monsoon, I think that inflation should gradually come under control towards the end of the year and a revival in the monsoon at a late period also indicates to me that perhaps the rabi crop should be better. If that is so, I do see at the end of the year, inflation coming down. If inflation comes down towards the end of the year, rates should also definitely comes down. But we would not like to have an immediate reaction to the SBI Act.
Also, we see that credit pick up will also take some time to come in. There is no doubt that there is momentum, there is movement in the market particularly we have information that foreign players are planning to put money into ventures into India. So we do feel that investment will pick up, it will not happen anytime very soon but in the long run it should pick up. Therefore, there is an expectation that interest rate should soften towards the end of the year.
Ekta: Can you give us some statistics in terms of credit offtake for BoB itself as well as what you are assuming for the industry?
A: The industry is pretty clear - 10.9 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has come out at the year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth is 10.9. I would assume that 11-12 percent is what the industry will grow come September 30. I imagine that BoB would be in that region also maybe a percentage of a point or two more but normally the guidance that we give the industry is that we are up 1-2 percent above the industry level but in general, we see that credit growth is quite muted.
Ekta: 13-14 percent would be credit growth that you would assume only till September or which would be the end of the quarter or would you assume that or extrapolated for FY15 as well?
A: No, I am not saying that we would be 13-14 percent. I said that we would be 1-2 percent perhaps a percentage point or two above the industry level. I assume that the industry level will be somewhere about 11-11.5 percent. So we would be a percentage point or two above that.
Going forward, I do feel that the government has cleared 170 stalled projects. I do expect if projects starts coming onstream, a lot of power is available from these new projects. So in the last quarter of the financial year, I do expect a pick up.
Bank of Baroda stock price
On November 21, 2014, Bank Of Baroda closed at Rs 1038.85, up Rs 13.30, or 1.30 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1067.50 and the 52-week low was Rs 509.00.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  Marico hit a new high of Rs 300 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday after Credit Suisse increased target price and earnings forecast. The stock gained as much as 4 percent intraday.
The brokerage maintains outperform rating on the stock saying it is the top pick among FMCG midcaps. It raised target price to Rs 350 apiece and earnings estimates by 2-3 percent.
"The near-term trigger for earnings upgrades will be a correction in copra prices over the next 6-12 months. The company is also structurally shifting its portfolio towards value-added products," it reasoned.
Copra prices have moved up sharply by 150 percent over the past 18 months. Credit Suisse expects copra prices to correct from February 2015, and Marico to witness strong gross margin tailwinds in April-September period of FY16 which is not built in its estimates.
The brokerage said Marico is consciously focusing on shifting its portfolio towards value-added oils, youth products and foods which should see growth ahead of coconut oils and also structural expansion in margins.
According to the report, the international business is poised to grow organically at over 15 percent with the cross pollination of products and an entry into adjacent markets. Margins are also likely to sustain or improve as the Middle East business moves towards normal profitability, it added.
 
At 14:28 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 290, up Rs 1.75, or 0.61 percent on the BSE.

SBI could be the first-mover in lowering deposit ratesSBI could be the first mover in lowering deposit rates
Radhika Merwin
While banks may have enough leeway now to tweak deposit rates, most may wait until the RBI’s policy announcement due by the month-end to tweak rates.
September 16, 2014:  
Deposit rates that have been ruling high for the last year or so may finally start heading down. Or so it seems after India’s largest bank — SBI — revised its rates down by 25 basis points for deposits in the one-three-year category effective September 18. Deposits for this tenure will now fetch 8.75 per cent — most banks on an average offer 9 per cent for similar deposits.
Heading down?
So, with the largest bank cutting its deposit rates, are other banks likely to follow suit as well? Many feel that an easier liquidity situation coupled with slowing credit growth may see others cut rates too.
On an average, deposit rates have been increased by 30 basis points across all tenures by all banks in the last one year. The Reserve Bank of India increased the key repo rate by 75 basis points between May 2013 and now. Banks have thus kept both lending as well deposit rates up in the last one year.
Deposit rates are a function of a bank’s cost of funds, liquidity situation and lending opportunities. If a bank has ample liquidity it may have enough headroom to bring down cost of funds by lowering deposit rates. Credit growth too, matters when deciding rates. If a bank has enough lending opportunities to deploy its funds, it may be able to pay better rates for its deposits. On the other hand, in a slowing credit growth scenario, banks would prefer to shed high cost deposits, to keep margins intact.
Credit growth in the banking system has fallen to 10.9 per cent recently, the lowest in a long time. Over the last two years of prolonged slowdown, credit growth for banks has slipped substantially. In 2012-13 and 2013-14 credit growth dipped to 13-14 per cent from 17-20 per cent in earlier years.
Banks have, hence, found it difficult to sustain margins. For one, they have not been able to pass on rate hikes by the RBI to customers in the form of higher lending rates. The average base rate (to which all lending rates are linked) for banks has only gone up by 5 basis points in 2013-14. However, given the tight liquidity scenario last year, banks kept deposit rates high to prevent flight of deposits. Average deposit rates went up by 30 basis points during the same period.
Given that now the liquidity situation for banks has improved substantially over the last year and credit growth is still languishing, banks may finally start to cut rates on deposits.
“Liquidity has been reasonably good for our bank for sometime now and corporate credit has not picked up in a big way. There is no point paying for deposits which cannot be deployed in profitable lending activities,” says K R Kamath, Chairman and Managing Director of Punjab National Bank.
While banks may have enough leeway now to tweak deposit rates, most may wait until the RBI’s policy announcement due by the month-end to tweak rates.
“We will hold rates maybe till policy and then take a call. For now, we are doing away with our bulk deposit rates for one year, which was marginally (5 basis points) higher,” adds Kamath.
Mixed signals
But there are others who believe that it may be early days yet to expect a widespread rate cut and that it would depend on individual banks’ asset liability situation (ALM).
“While SBI has cut rates for 1-3 year deposits, it has also raised its deposit rate for the 180 days to 210 days' bucket. The signal is quite mixed and one should not read too much from this action,” says Dr Rupa Rege Nitsure, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda.
“The intent could be to pave the way for concessions on retail loans in the upcoming festive season. So far as Bank of Baroda is concerned, we do not have pressure of excess liquidity as we have consciously and in significant manner reduced our dependence on high cost, preferential rate deposits since the beginning of the current financial year. Hence, we intend to maintain ‘status quo’ on interest rates.”

Final norms for on tap bank licences this fiscal: RBIFinal norms for on tap bank licences this fiscal: RBI
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 02:10 PM IST
Final guidelines for on tap universal banking licences will be issued in the current fiscal, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor R Gandhi said here today.
"We are working towards issuing guidelines for full service banks on tap. I cannot give you a timeline, but it will be in this financial year," Gandhi told reporters on the sidelines of an annual banking event organised by FICCI and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) here.
The Reserve Bank had earlier issued draft guidelines for payment and small banks and is in the process of finalising the final norms.
"Now the public comments (on small and payment banks) have been received and we are factoring in them. Soon we will come out with the final guidelines on these two," Gandhi said.
On corporate governance reforms in the public sector banks, he said the central bank has already recommended certain suggestions to the government.
"Based on various committees, including the P J Nayak Committee recommendations, we have made certain suggestions to the government such as segregation of chairman and managing director posts and a separate committee for appointment of directors on board of PSU banks, and they are taking up the final decision," Gandhi said.
Replying to a query on lowering government's holding in public sector banks below 50% as recommended by P J Nayak committee report, Gandhi said the government has to take a view on how much they want to invest in these banks.
On the liquidity coverage ratio norms which RBI announced in June this year, he said the banks as of now are in compliance with the norms and will be able to achieve the target.
"Banks are compliant as of now on LCR norms till 60% as they hold excess government securities. They are comfortable in reaching the target," he said.
The RBI had said the LCR will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with a minimum requirement of 60% from January 1, 2015 and reaching minimum 100% on January 1, 2019.

Sensex tanks 324 points as investors remain wary ahead of Fed policy meetSensex tanks 324 points as investors remain wary ahead of Fed policy meet
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Sept 16:  
The Sensex and the Nifty plunged nearly 1.4 per cent at the closing session as investors turned wary ahead of the Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting.
Investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve's policy stance in the lead-up to the US central bank's two-day policy meeting later in the day.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex plunged 324.05 points to end at 26,492.51 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty fell 109.10 points to close at 7,932.90.
Among BSE sectoral indices, realty, power, PSU and infrastructure indices fell the most by 3.42 per cent, 3.26 per cent, 3.12 per cent and 3.05 per cent, respectively.
Dr Reddy's, HUL, ITC, Infosys and Sun Pharma were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Tata Power, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, ONGC and L&T.
European markets
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.5 per cent to 342.23 at 11.15 a.m. in London. The equity gauge has fallen 1.9 per cent since reaching a two-month high on September 4 amid investor concern over the Scottish referendum and central-bank stimulus policies.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures lost 0.1 per cent, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 per cent.
Investors were reluctant to dip back into the market ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, due to start today, and a referendum on independence for Scotland from the United Kingdom on Thursday.
Asian shares touch 10-week lows
Asian shares fell to 10-week lows on Tuesday as investors braced for a possible hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve's policy stance in the lead-up to the US central bank's two-day policy meeting later in the day.
Fed policy meet
Speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and faster than previously expected has rattled many share markets around the globe and supported the US dollar.
The Fed's Open Market Committee will begin its regular two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and investors will be scanning the outcome for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years.
US central bank policymakers will also release fresh economic and interest-rate projections, extending their forecast horizon through 2017.

Sensex sees worst plunge since Aug 1; but over 400 stocks hit 52-week high on BSEAlembic Ltd
(Bucking the overall markets…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex plunged over 300 points in trade on Tuesday, but that didn't bother traders to cherry pick quality stocks at lower levels in the small and midcap space.
Bucking the overall markets trend, the real action was seen in small and midcap space wherein as much as 448 stocks managed to hit their fresh 52-week high on the Bombay Stock Exchange .
Stock which rose to their fresh 52-week high on the BSE include names like Alembic Ltd , JBF Industries, JK Tyre & Industries, Kalyani Forge Ltd, Mastek Ltd , etc.
The BSE Sensex finally closed 324.05 points lower or 1.21 per cent at 26,492.51. It hit a low of 26,464.03 and a high of 26861.29. Despite weak trend, four stocks managed to hit their 52-week high on Sensex which include names like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd , Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Cipla , and Bharti Airtel .
Analysts are not debating on the fact that Indian markets are in a multi-year bull market , but considering the fact we are trading near the higher end of the range, some bit of consolidations cannot be ruled out.
Selection of right kind of stocks can actually make base for higher returns in the foreseeable future, say analysts.
"Who invest in the market, they certainly look at the index for direction purpose but more importantly, you do not buy the index per se. What you buy is individual stocks," said Deven Choksey , MD, KR Choksey Securities.
"What I am trying to put across the point is that individual stocks during the course of the rally in the market, may face some amount of resistance, but these stocks should be bought into the portfolio," he added.
BSE Midcap index closed 3.4 per cent lower at 9659.31 but as much as 24 stocks hit their fresh 52-week high which include names like MRF, Natco Pharma, PVR, Supreme Industries, Emami, Finolex Industries, Eid Parry India Ltd etc.
BSE Small cap index closed 3.99 per cent lower at 10,796.31 but as much as 66 stocks rose to their fresh 52-week high which include names like Welspun India, Wyeth , V-Guard Industries, PC Jeweller, Relaxo Footwear, Raymond, Ricoh India Ltd, PTC India Financial Services etc.

Final norms for on tap bank licence this fiscal: RBIOn-tap licences: RBI says final norms in FY15
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 17, 2014 12:49 AM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would come out with guidelines for differentiated, on-tap bank licences (licences on a continuous basis) this financial year, R Gandhi, the central bank’s deputy governor, said on Tuesday.
“We are working towards issuing guidelines for full-service banks on-tap. I cannot give you a timeline, but it will be this financial year,” he said.
So far, bank licences have been given only during a particular timeframe, as specified by RBI. For instance, after the final norms on bank licences were released last year, it was said applications had to be filed within three months.
Gandhi said RBI had received comments on the draft guidelines on small and payment banks, which it had issued in July. “We are factoring those in and soon, we will come out with the final guidelines,” he added.
On corporate governance in public sector banks, he said, “Based on the recommendations of various committees, including the Nayak committee, we have made certain suggestions to the government. These include the positions of chairman and managing director be segregated; also, we should have a separate committee to appoint various directors on the boards of public sector banks. We have forwarded such suggestions to the government for discussion, and it will take the final decision.”
A report by the P J Nayak committee, set up to recommend steps to reform governance in public sector banks, had come up with several suggestions on the issue. These included reviewing the regulatory compliance requirements of boards, as well as regulatory guidelines on bank ownership. It had also recommended an examination of the norms on compensation to board members.

Salmond brushes aside the foreign policy factsAlex Salmond brushes aside the foreign policy facts for Scotland

Scotland will renounce weapons of mass destruction and then saunter into the Nato nuclear alliance. So eager will be the EU to fling open its doors that it will skip the formalities, and Edinburgh will pick and choose among the terms of membership. The world, in other words, cannot wait to welcome an independent Scotland into its warm embrace. So says Alex Salmond , leader of the Scottish National party, as the nation prepares to vote on separation.
Things are not quite like that, of course. Many European governments fear that a vote for Scottish independence will give succour to separatist movements across the continent. They have little interest in making life easy for a new breakaway state.

Foreign policy in Germany
The US has made no secret about its fears of what the break-up of Britain will mean for the cohesion of the western alliance . Nuclear deterrence is at the heart of the organisation’s strategic concept. As Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the outgoing secretary-general, observed this week, each of the 28 existing member states would have to sign up to the admission of an anti-nuclear Scotland.
For Mr Salmond’s nationalists, these are inconvenient facts to be brushed aside, like the many outstanding economic questions, as English scaremongering. All those other states – in the EU and Nato – could be relied upon to discard their prejudices and interests in celebration of Scottish independence. Mr Rasmussen, José Manuel Barroso at the European Commission, the White House and anyone else you can think of will play a different tune after Thursday’s vote.
Beyond insisting that Scotland will banish the Trident nuclear missile system from the Clyde and that it will not be drawn into conflicts in the Middle East, Mr Salmond does not have a foreign policy for his new state. And on this last issue – the reach beyond the Middle East of Islamist extremism – the murder this week of Scottish aid worker David Haines has raised the question as to whether Scotland could so easily inoculate itself against the harsh realities of the wider world.
There is nothing to say that either European neighbours or the US would seek to isolate a Scotland that decided to strike out on its own. Over time it is entirely plausible to imagine it being welcomed into both the EU and Nato. The deception in the nationalist campaign lies in the assertion that everyone else would bend to Edinburgh’s will and allow Mr Salmond to dictate his own terms.

GMR to set up aerospace training hub at Hyderabad airportGMR to set up aerospace training hub at Hyderabad airport
Prashanth Chintala | Hyderabad Sep 16, 2014 08:35 PM IST
GMR group is planning to establish an aerospace training hub at its international airport premises here. The facility, aimed at making Hyderabad an aerospace hub, will cater to the evolving aerospace training requirements of all levels of workforce in the industry, according to the group chairman, G M Rao.
Rao said, the company's team, with the help of a French multinational Safran, had visited the aerospace training centre located in Morocco. The team studied in detail as how the institute, established with the support of the Moroccan government, had made the country the destination of choice for aerospace companies.
“We have a same vision for the Hyderabad and this state. In fact, we have developed relationship with the Safran team in Morocco, and they are ready to guide us in creating the aerospace training institute in Hyderabad. I humbly request the present state government to support us in setting up the aerospace training in Hyderabad and thus making it the destination of aerospace companies from across the globe,” he said.
Addressing the annual general meeting (AGM) of the Aeronautical Society of India (AeSI), Rao, who is also the president of the society, said that India was poised to become the third largest aviation market in the world by 2020. The total spending in the next two decades was expected to be $25 billion for commercial aircraft and $100 billion as defence expenditure.
He, however, said that the biggest challenge to meet the enormous growth potential of aerospace and defence sector would be skilled workforce. Though India has ample technically trained manpower, “there is dearth of personal with specialised skills, particularly in the sphere of aerospace”, he added.
Chairman of the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and AeSI president-elect, R K Tyagi, requested the Centre to set up a National Aeronautics Commission on the line of National Space and National Atomic Energy commissions.
Telangana minister for panchayat raj and information technology, K T Rama Rao, who also addressed the inaugural session of  the AGM, requested the state chief secretary to extend the necessary help to GMR in this regard. He said that the state government had not only earmarked an additional 1,000 acres near the existing aerospace park but was also considering to set up another park on the northern side of the city.
National aviation policy:
Speaking to media on the sidelines of the event, Union minister for civil aviation, P Ashok Gajapathi Raju, said the Centre was formulating a new national aviation policy. He, however, said there was no time-frame fixed in this regard.
With regard Air India,  he said that a turnaround plan was in place and "it is for them to perform".
Some states, including Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, had so far responded favourably to the Centre's request to reduce tax on aviation turbine fuel.
The states where aviation activity was low responded positively as they want more activity. The states where activity was high were dragging their feet, Raju said in response to a query.

S Muhnot, chairman & managing director of the bank, said instead of taking further equity right now, the bank would rather raise capital. He added the bank’s capital adequacy ratio is around 11 per cent.
According to reports, lenders such as IDBI and Andhra Bank were also mulling to raise money via similar bonds.

Modi to receive Xi  showcase Indias economic potentialModi to receive Xi, showcase India’s economic potential
Virendra Pandit
Reuters Police personnel patrol on their horses past a boarding with images of (L-R) India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, China's President Xi Jinping and Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister of Gujarat, ahead of Xi's arrival in Ahmedabad September 16, 2014.
Ahmedabad, Sept 16:  
A red carpet welcome and Gujarati culture and cuisines await Chinese President Xi Jinping who will arrive here on Wednesday on a six-hour visit to the state as part of his India visit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to showcase the country’s economic potential and investment opportunities.
The Chinese President’s Gujarat visit is being viewed as rare event as Heads of State and Government normally begin their tour of India from New Delhi or the metros. However, major diplomatic and economic engagements between the two countries will take place in the national capital on Thursday.
Modi, who arrived here on Tuesday, will receive Jinping at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport here at around 2.30 pm, on Wednesday. Also present on the occasion will be Gujarat Governor Om Prakash Kohli and Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, among others.
From the airport, the Chinese President will drive down to Hotel Hyatt next to the Vastrapur Lake where about 50 industrialists from Gujarat will interact with their Chinese counterparts. Some MoUs will also be signed on the occasion.
According to Nitin Patel and Saurabh Patel, Gujarat Cabinet ministers and government spokespersons, the State will sign an agreement with China’s Guangdong province, followed by another between Ahmedabad and Guangzhou cities for improvement of civic services.
In addition, an agreement will also be signed by China Development Bank with the Gujarat Government’s industrial promotion body, iNDEXTb (Industrial Extension Bureau), for the setting up of a Chinese industrial park at Karjan near Vadodara. The agreement aims at promotion of trade and industries mainly in the fields of electrical equipment manufacturing and electronics.
In the evening, Jinping will also pay a visit to the Gandhi Ashram on the banks of Sabarmati River to pay tributes to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. He will then head towards the Sabarmati Riverfront Park where Jinping and Modi, accompanied with their delegations, will join a dinner hosted by the Gujarat Government.
The Jinping-Modi meeting at the Riverfront Park is being viewed with interest abroad. Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner and senior IAS officer Guru Prasad Mohapatra, who is currently in the USA, told Business Line that he had distributed photographs of this venue as many people had evinced interest in it.
Nitin Patel informed that the Chinese President and his delegation will be catered “cent per cent Gujarati authentic cuisines”, all vegetarian.
After this early dinner, Jinping and Modi will depart for New Delhi from the airport.

Rupee gains ahead of Fed meetRupee gains ahead of Fed meet
Reuters | Mumbai Sep 16, 2014 05:09 PM IST
The rupee recovered on Tuesday from a one-month low hit in the previous session on bargain-hunting, but sentiment was broadly cautious a day before the outcome of the Federal Reserve's meeting.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, and investors will parse the central bank's words closely for any clues on the timing of the first U.S. rate hike in more than eight years.
Emerging market assets are increasingly pricing in the prospect of reduced global liquidity, as seen by the biggest single-day decline of the rupee in nearly one-and-a-half months on Monday.
But traders say the rupee could avoid any major shocks, with the Reserve Bank of India having built hefty foreign exchange reserves and on inflows of longer-term money from overseas into domestic markets.
"The fund flows in the market have been good and hence there is not much panic expected this time around despite the uncertainty about Fed meet," said Unnati Parekh, head of currency derivatives at Kanji Forex, a debt brokerage in Mumbai.
"Any fall in the local unit, will be gradual."
The partially convertible rupee ended at 61.0550/0650 per dollar, compared to its close of 61.13/14 on Monday.
The narrowing of the trade deficit also aided the rupee, with the August number shrinking to $10.84 billion last month from a 12-month high of $12.23 billion in July.
But in the near-term most traders expect the local unit to continue to struggle against the dollar, with some pointing out that the rupee may slide to 61.70-62.00 levels if the key 61.35 level is breached.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.43 while the three-month contract was at 62.04.

Foreign cos are not bound to do CSR in India, says legal expert Shardul Shroff

Inconsistency between rules and the actual Company Law
New Delhi, Sept 16:  
Foreign companies’ are not bound to undertake corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity in India, Shardul Shroff, Managing Partner, Amarchand & Mangaldas, a leading law firm, has said.
This is even as the rules framed under the new company law extended the CSR provisions to foreign companies, Shroff said at an event on Companies Act, organised by KPMG in association with Indo-Canada Business Chamber here on Tuesday.
There is inconsistency between the rules and the main statute (Companies Act), which has mandated CSR spend by certain companies, Shroff noted.
India is the only country in the world that has legislated CSR and required CSR spend equivalent to 2 percent of net profit for certain companies. But there is no penalty if the provisions were not complied with.
Shroff highlighted that Section 135—the provision in the new company law that deals with CSR—applies CSR only to domestic companies.
Although the rules had extended it to foreign companies, this was prone to challenge as the main Act sought to cover only domestic companies.
“All the changes that are coming through the rules, which may affect the definition in some sense, are not lawful. If ever challenged by a foreign company in court, then the Court would tend to uphold the challenge”, Shroff said.
Rakesh Nangia, Managing Partner, Nangia & Co, a firm of chartered accountants, said the main Companies Act talks only about Indian companies when it came to CSR.
On whether a branch office or a project office of a foreign company is authorised to do CSR, Nangia said it doesn’t look likely and they will have to get Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval on this count
Nangia also said the wholly-owned subsidiaries of foreign companies can give money for charitable activities to only those companies that are Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) compliant.
“We are advising our clients (foreign companies) to approach Home Ministry and get clearance or seek clarifications. They should ensure that the entities to which they donate funds are FCRA compliant”

Defamation complaint: Ali seeks written apology from Mukhtar Abbas NaqviPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 16, 2014 7:39 pm
Former JD(U) leader Sabir Ali on Tuesday sought before a Delhi court a “written apology” from BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, against whom he has filed a criminal defamation complaint for allegedly linking him with arrested Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal.
Ali was asked by Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain on whether he wants to proceed with his complaint against Naqvi.
“I need an apology in writing and only then I will compromise,” he told the court. However, Naqvi, who had marked his presence before the court at 10 AM, was not present when the court asked Ali for any possibility of compromise in the matter.
The matter initially came up for hearing at around 10.20 AM but at that time Ali was not present in the court due to which the case was deferred till 11.30 AM. Naqvi told the magistrate that he had to attend a meeting at 11.30 AM after which the court allowed him to leave.
When the matter again came up for hearing, Ali appeared before the court and said that he wants an apology in writing from Naqvi. The lawyers appearing for both the parties urged the court that they be given some time to discuss the issue of settling the case, if possible, after which the magistrate fixed the matter for hearing on November 15.
The court on July 9 had granted bail to Naqvi. It had earlier summoned Naqvi as accused, saying “prima facie” there was evidence and sufficient ground to proceed against him for the alleged offence of defaming Ali.
Ali, in his complaint, had alleged that Naqvi had termed him as a friend of suspected terrorist Bhatkal in March and the story was circulated and telecast in India as well as abroad through social media as well as various newspapers and channels.
The former JD(U) leader had said that after he made a statement appreciating Narendra Modi, who was then the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate, in March this year, he was removed from JD(U). After having deliberations with some senior BJP members, it was decided by then BJP President Rajnath Singh that he should join them, he had said.
Ali had alleged that three-four hours after joining BJP, he started getting phone calls from his relatives, friends and media persons that Naqvi had allegedly tweeted against him on the social networking website Twitter.
BJP had on March 29 cancelled Ali’s membership after the controversy erupted following the tweet by Naqvi. Ali, in his statement before the court, had deposed that the tweet made by Naqvi on his account has tarnished and maligned his reputation in the eyes of society, causing great mental suffering to him and his family.

Prime Minister confident of a major boost to bilateral ties
Ahmedabad, Sept 16:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday exuded confidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit here on Wednesday would benefit both Gujarat and India.
Experience recalled
Responding to a public reception at the airport, the Prime Minister said the Chinese President’s visit was one reason why he (Modi) was visiting Gujarat this time. He described Xi’s visit as “very important” and said his aim was to make India and Gujarat develop further.
Recalling his years as Gujarat Chief Minister, Modi said his experience in the State had stood him in good stead in New Delhi as well. “I am satisfied with what I have done. It is due to the experience I gained as Chief Minister in Gujarat that I have been successfully running the Government in Delhi.”
The Prime Miniser, who arrived at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport here this afternoon, was accorded a tumultuous reception by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the State Government, led by Governor OP Kohli, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, BJP’s National President Amit Shah and Ahmedabad Mayor Minakshiben Patel.
First visit as PM
This is Modi’s first visit of Gujarat after taking oath as the Prime Minister on May 26.
After installing Anandiben as his successor, Modi, who served Gujarat as Chief Minister for 13 years, left for New Delhi on May 22.
The Prime Minister is scheduled to stay at the Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar tonight.
Modi, who celebrates his 65th birthday on Wednesday, will also call on his mother Hiraben and other family members.
Launch programmes
On Wednesday, he will launch a series of programmes of the State Government at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar and receive the Chinese President at the airport in the afternoon.

Gujarat by-poll: Congress wrests 3 assembly seats from BJPGujarat by-poll: Congress wrests 3 assembly seats from BJP
Our Bureau
Tweet
Ahmedabad, Sept 16:  
When Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel appealed to the people last week to “gift all nine Vidhan Sabha and one Lok Sabha seats”, that went to by-elections on September 13, as a birthday gift to the Prime Minister, she would have scarcely known that Narendra Modi would not, perhaps, like it.
 
Modi, who will celebrate his 65th birthday on Wednesday, is arriving in Gujarat for the first time after taking oath as PM on May 26. The BJP had made unprecedented preparations to accord a red-carpet welcome to Modi who, accompanied by BJP President Amit Shah, was scheduled to attend a reception on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.
 
However, by-election results, announced on Tuesday, clearly disheartened many BJP leaders and workers. For, even an unprepared Congress was able to wrest three Assembly seats from the BJP—Khambalia, Mangrol and Deesa—while the ruling BJP managed to retain six seats. A loss of a third of Assembly seats that went to by-lections was, indeed, a shocker for a party that has, for long, viewed Gujarat as its “laboratory”.
 
However, the BJP managed to win both the Vadodara Lok Sabha and Maninagar Vidhan Sabha seats, vacated by Modi in May. But the margins were lower from what was seen in the Lok Sabha elections. Against the record margin of over 5.7-lakh vote victory registered by Modi from Vadodara constituency, the BJP candidate Ranjanben Bhatt could manage margin of 3.29 lakh votes over Congress candidate Narendra Rawat in the by-polls.
 
Voter turnout remained a concern in the by-polls across the state, where only 50.95 per cent of the voters turned out against 63.33 per cent in General Elections 2014. Voter turnout in Vadodara was at 45.39 per cent against 70.57 per cent registered in Lok Sabha polls in May.
 
In Maninagar, from where Modi had won thrice with thumping majority, voting was lukewarm at about 36 per cent. This was reflected in the reduction in winning margin for the BJP candidate from Maninagar Suresh Patel, who won with a margin of 49,652 votes in the by-polls against Modi’s 86,373-vote victory in 2012.
 
Amid reduced voter turnout, what came as a shocker for the state BJP was a loss on three assembly seats, which they had won with handsome margins in assembly elections in 2012.
 
Adding to the concern was the winning margin with which the Congress candidates made their way to victory. At Deesa, where the BJP candidate had got 18,000-vote victory in 2012 assembly polls, in the by-polls Congress candidate won with a margin of 10,394 votes. The winning margin for Congress was as low as 1208 votes on Khambhalia seat in Dev Bhumi Dwarka district. Giving a strong dent to the BJP in Saurashtra, Congress also snatched away Mangrol seat in Junagadh district with a winning margin of 22,682 votes.

In July 2013, the country had received FDI worth $1.65 billion.
During April-July this fiscal, the foreign inflows grew by 52 per cent to $10.73 billion as compared to $7.05 billion in the same period last year.

India requires around $1 trillion in the next five years to overhaul its infrastructure sector, including ports, airports and highways to boost growth.
The government is taking more steps to boost FDI in the country. It has raised the foreign investment limit to 49 per cent in defence manufacturing and relaxed the policy in construction sector. The government has also proposed to increase the FDI cap in insurance to 49 per cent.

RPI seeks more seats from BJP-Sena allianceRPI seeks more seats from BJP-Sena alliance
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, September 16:  
The Republican Party of India (Athavale) has demanded more than nine seats from the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance for the Assembly elections, which would be held on October 15 in Maharashtra.
President of the party, Ramdas Athavale, briefing media-persons after meeting the Shiv Sena chief, said the party is keen to fight more seats and, therefore, “the Shiv Sena should spare at least five or six seats from its quota. A similar number of seats should be spared by the BJP,” he said.
“Our party will not take any extreme stand but the number of seats allocated to us in the election should be in double digits,” Athavale said.
The BJP and Shiv Sena are major partners in the Mahyuti alliance, while the RPI (Athavale), Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana of Raju Shetty and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (National Social Party) of Mahadev Jankar are its minor partners.
The Mahyuti alliance was set up before the Lok Sabha election to fight the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine.
Athavale added that in spite of the tussle between the BJP and the Shiv Sena over seat-sharing, his party has no plans to break away from the Mahayuti alliance. Out of political compulsions, if the BJP and Shiv Sena cannot spare more seats, then at least the positions of members of the Legislative Council and the chairmanship of development boards should be given to the party members, he said.

Amidst critical review of his government’s 100-day performance and reverses in by-polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at his detractors saying they will take time to understand his work and his style of functioning.
Amidst critical review of his government’s 100-day performance and reverses in by-polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at his detractors saying they will take time to understand his work and his style of functioning.
“Certain things had not been seen in the past. It would be a new and unique thing for some people. They will take bit of time to understand this new thing. They could not understand this during the last 12 years in Gujarat,” Modi said at a felicitation organised by BJP workers here.
“Still they cannot understand it. But I have adopted the mantra `Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay’ (for welfare of all, for happiness of all). And I am sure this will work.”
On the criticism that his government lacks vision, Modi said, “Many times there is debate on the vision….Big vision… grand vision… etc. Whatever it is… I am a very small man… and I live for the small people of this country.
“I can think small and by thinking small things, I can make people big from these small people. And when all these
small people become big, then India will develop beyond limits,” Modi said.
“We have introduced Jan Dhan Yojana. Businessmen of this country have to stand humbly in front of bank managers to get loans. But now a bank manager has to go to the house of poor people and open accounts for them. This is called vision.
Banking system existed earlier also but nobody thought of using it to save the poor from money-lenders,” Modi said.
“I thought of it. To understand a change, you have to change yourself.
“Natural calamities come and nobody can stop them. But you have to show dedication to sacrifice yourself during such natural calamities. You have to sacrifice yourself for the victims. I have visited Kashmir more often during this short period than our previous Prime Minister had visited in his entire tenure,” he said.
While speaking about his government’s initiative to improve the ties with neighbouring countries, Modi criticised previous Prime Ministers for not visiting Nepal for 17 years.
“It does not take more than one hour and fifteen minutes to reach Nepal by flight. But our previous Prime inisters had not visited Nepal for 17 years. What they could not do in 17 years, I did in one hour and fifteen minutes,” Modi said, adding, “they could not see Nepal but I have seen it”.

Ukraine parliament ratifies EUpactUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko shows the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement to lawmakers after its signing in parliament in Kiev. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Kiev | Posted: September 16, 2014 8:14 pm | Updated: September 16, 2014 8:24 pm
Ukraine’s parliament ratified an agreement to deepen economic and political ties with the European Union on Tuesday, and passed legislation to grant autonomy to the rebellious east as part of a peace deal.
The ratification vote, synchronized with the European parliament by video chat, draws a line under the issue that last year sparked Ukraine’s crisis, which resulted in the ousting of the president, the annexation of Crimea by Russia and a war with the Russia-backed separatists that has killed more than 3,000 people.
The ratification vote in Kiev was met with a standing ovation, and members of parliament leapt to their feet to sing the Ukrainian national anthem. In a speech to legislators, President Petro Poroshenko called the vote a “first but very decisive step” toward bringing Ukraine fully into the European Union.
Poroshenko also said that those who died during the protests and during fighting in the east “gave up their lives so that we could take a dignified place among the European family.”
“Since World War II, not a single nation has paid such a high price for their right to be European,” he said.
In stark contrast to that fanfare, parliament went behind closed doors earlier in the day to approve two bills granting greater autonomy to rebellious regions in the east, as well as amnesty for many of those involved in the fighting. The bills are part of a tenuous peace process that saw a cease-fire called on Sept. 5, which has been repeatedly violated and criticized by many in Ukraine.
On Tuesday, the city council in Donetsk said three people and five wounded in shelling overnight. Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s national security council, said three Ukrainian servicemen were killed over the past day. Clashes continue in the area around the airport in Donetsk, the largest city under rebel control.
The legislation on autonomy falls short of the eastern rebels’ aim for complete independence, but rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko told Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency that the rebel leadership would study the measures.
The EU association agreement was long sought by Ukrainians who want their country to turn westward and out of Russia’s sphere of influence. After then-President Viktor Yanukovych shelved the deal last year, protests broke out that eventually spiraled into violence and led to Yanukovych fleeing the country.
In the wake of that, Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and a pro-Russia rebellion broke out in eastern Ukraine.
Ukrainian forces in April launched a military operation to put down the rebellion, which it claims gets substantial support including troops and equipment from Russia.
Russia strongly opposed Ukraine’s tilt toward the EU, hoping to bring the country into a Moscow-led trade bloc that would balance or compete with the EU. Ukrainians who sought closer ties with the Western bloc denounced the Russia-led trade bloc as an attempt to reconstitute the Soviet Union.
Moscow also feared that closer ties with the EU and the reduction of tariffs on Western goods would undermine Ukraine’s demand for Russian goods and could allow the re-export to Russia of EU goods at lower prices.
In a significant concession to Russia, Ukraine and the EU agreed last week to delay the reduced-tariff regime that is part of the agreement until at least 2016.

States pitch for separate FCI to ensure fodder securityStates pitch for separate FCI to ensure fodder security
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 06:56 PM IST
In order to improve availability of fodder in the country, several state governments today suggested setting up of a Fodder Corporation of India (FCI), ban on export of oilseed cake and disallowing harvesting of wheat and other fodder crop using combine harvestor.
Some states also demanded that the Centre should treat animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries at par with the agriculture sector and ensure benefits such crop loans at lower interest rate and Kisan Credit Cards facilities are passed on to people engaged in allied agriculture activities.
Flagging concerns of the allied farm sector at a national conference here, the state ministers handling this sector told Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh to address these issues at the earliest to achieve the next level of growth.
Inviting suggestions from the states on various issues, Singh said the state governments should implement the ongoing schemes related to this sector in its true spirit.
"A sub-mission on fodder under the National Livestock Mission will try to address the problems of scarcity of animal feed resources in the country," he said and added that large-scale prevalence of animal disease is also the biggest hurdles to growth of dairy and livestock productivity.
Among various recommendations made to the Centre, Gujarat Animal Husbandry, Cow Care and Fisheries Minister Babhubhai Bokhiriya suggested establishment of a 'Fodder Corporation of India' on the lines of 'Food Corporation of India'.
"Food Corporation of India was set up with a motto that no citizen should remain hungry. Unfortunately for animals, there is no food resource management system in the country. We need to establish a nationwide store and distribution network for fodder across the country," he said.
To improve fodder supply, Madhya Pradesh Minister for Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Kusum Singh Mehdele recommended ban on harvesting of wheat and other fodder crops through the combine harvestor without attachment of straw ripper, so that wheat straw can be produced in adequate quantity.
"Government should seriously plan to impose restriction of industrial utilisation of wheat straw," he said.
Stating that shortage of feed and fodder is posing a major challenge, Karnataka Animal Husbandry Minister T B Jayachandra suggested supply of maize, feed crop, directly from the state-run Food Corporation of India for preparation of compounded feed.
"Feed ingredients like maize should be made available directly to the poultry farmers from FCI (Food Corporation of India) through poultry federations to prepare the compounded feed themselves to reduce the cost of feed and make the enterprise profitable."
He also demanded setting up of more feed manufacturing plants and central funds for growing fodder trees along with grasses in the state.
Haryana Agriculture Minister Paramvir Singh said that 70% of the total cost of dairy units is due to feed and fodder. "Apart from promoting feed and fodder production, we should also take immediate steps to put a ban on export of oilseed cakes to check the prices of animal feed in the domestic market," he said.
Seeking fresh initiatives for improving fodder supply, the state governments have also suggested several measures for boosting dairy and fishery sectors.

Rajan cautions on capital flowsRajan cautions against reliance on foreign capital
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 17, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Flagging the risks of relying too much on foreign capital flows, Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  would continue to limit dependence on foreign debt to finance the country’s current account deficit (CAD).
LOOK FOR COVER
RBI will continue to limit dependence on foreign debt
A lot of cash flow into India has been due to easy money policy in the West
Foreign capital can exit emerging markets for better use in home countries
Foreign inflows have helped bridge CAD, but we cannot take these for granted
Foreign flows cannot always finance deficits
Global flows into the Indian market at $32 bn so far in 2014
“We are limiting our reliance on foreign debt. It is important that we keep it like this and manage the economy in a way that is careful and circumspect. That is the only way we can continue to do the work we need to,” Rajan said during his address at the 55th foundation day celebrations of Somaiya Vidyavihar here.
The governor said: “With easy monetary policies across the world, we had a lot more money coming into our economies. India has benefitted from the inflows because of easy policies, especially in the industrialised West. We have to be careful about this money.”
ALSO READ:  SBI cuts medium-term deposit rate by 25 bps
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India data, global investors have infused $3,278 billion into the country’s capital market so far this calendar year, to reap the benefit of relatively attractive returns here.
Rajan said India’s CAD had narrowed significantly with foreign cash flows but this money could not be taken for granted. “At some point, these investors will find better use of their money back home and want to go out. We will have a financial difficulty when the money goes out.”
The governor also had a word of caution on the nature of spending, especially that financed out of foreign resources. “We have to be careful about spending because financial conditions will change. We have managed to bring down current account deficit substantially,” he said, adding: “We have to watch the trade deficit data closely.”
The country’s exports during the first five months of this financial year rose 7.31 per cent to $134.79 billion, compared with $12.56 billion in the year-ago period. Imports fell 2.69 per cent from $196.22 billion to $190.94 billion. As a result, the trade deficit for the April-August period narrowed to $56.15 billion from $70.6 billion a year ago.
India’s CAD for the quarter ended June narrowed sharply to $7.8 billion, or 1.7 per cent of gross domestic product, from $21.8 billion (4.8 per cent of GDP) in the same quarter of the previous year.
The decline in CAD was aided by a contraction in trade deficit.
Besides an improvement on the current account front, the balance of payments situation also improved in the June quarter. There was accretion of $11.2 billion to foreign exchange reserves in the quarter, against a drawdown of $300 million in the same quarter last year.
Referring to policies adopted by the developed countries, which are facing an economic slowdown, Rajan said the industrial West had been following easy monetary policy and used fiscal stimulus to push economic growth. They needed to undertake structural reforms, too.
They can't rely only on stimulus. Unfortunately stimulus is easier and consequences of that kind of stimulus come into our countries, he added.

For high-speed corridor  railways to dodge Land Acquisition ActFor high-speed corridor, railways to dodge Land Acquisition Act
Anusha Soni | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 06:46 PM IST
For its high-speed corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, Indian Railways is planning to acquire land under the Railways Act, 1989, dodging the stringent provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Senior railway officials say this way, several bottlenecks posed by the latest land acquisition legislation will be avoided.
In 2008, the Railways Act was amended by inserting a new chapter, IV-A, specifying a provision to acquire land for special railway projects. Land acquisition for key projects such as the eastern and western arms of the dedicated freight corridor project, too, was carried out under this special provision.
Though the Land Acquisition Act made an exception for land to be acquired for railway and highway projects by doing away with the 10 per cent cap on non-irrigated multi-cropped land, officials said the Railways Act was preferred, as under this, there was little possibility of litigation.
Vishwas Udgirkar, senior director, Deloitte India, said, "Under the land acquisition Act of 2013, there are stringent conditions for local consent to be secured. However, under the Railways Act, 1989, you can only challenge the quantum of the compensation, not the acquisition per se. Also, the compensation is much higher under the 2013 Act."
Senior railway officials say about 400 km of the project land is in Gujarat and passes through various tribal belts. They add the good pace of land acquisition for the dedicated freight corridor, as well as the fact that only a few cases of litigation were involved in the project, shows this process is faster and multiple levels of grievance redressal ensure locals are provided adequate compensation.
"JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) monitored the land acquisition process closely and those affected got compensation from the state concerned, as well as from Railways," said a senior official.
The high-speed rail corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, India's first such corridor, will be 546-km long and is expected to involve a cost of about Rs 100 crore a km. Currently, JICA is carrying out feasibility studies for the project and it is expected these will be completed by the end of this financial year.
On this corridor, trains are expected to run at up to 350 km an hour.

Pact signed for electronic toll collection on highwaysPact signed for electronic toll collection on highways
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 06:35 PM IST
NHAI-promoted Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL) has inked a pact with Axis Bank for services related electronic toll collection, which the government plans to introduce pan-India.
Considering the complexities and geographical spread, the nationwide electronic toll collection (ETC) would be first of its kind in the whole world.
"IHMCL, a NHAI promoted company and Axis Bank has signed an agreement for provision of Central Clearing House (CCH) services and sale of FASTag, for Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) at the Toll Plazas on the National Highways," an official statement said today.
It said ETC system on Delhi - Mumbai stretch of the national highways will be made operational by the end of this month and a nationwide rollout will be carried out by the end of year.
Earlier this year, IHMCL had signed agreement with ICICI Bank also and it has two banks now to perform clearing and settlement of electronic toll transaction, which is a key requirement for electronic toll collection.
This is subsequent to the initiative taken by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, NHAI and IHMCL for implementation of unified Electronic Toll Collection on Indian national highways.
Electronic Toll Collection enables road users to pay highway tolls electronically without stopping at the toll plazas.
"The unique number of the RFID FASTag affixed on the wind shield of the vehicle will be read by the readers fitted in the dedicated 'ETC' lanes of plazas and the toll will be deducted automatically," the statement said adding this will help in reducing congestion at the toll plazas and enable seamless movement of vehicles on the national highways.
The Ministry has decided to roll out ETC programme in the country under the brand name "FASTag".
The dedicated ETC lanes will have colour coding for distinct identity recognised as "FASTag lanes".
ICICI Bank and Axis bank, engaged for providing CCH services, would distribute RFID based "FASTag" through their franchises/agents and at points of sales near the toll plazas.
Road users can enrol and get "FASTag" affixed on their vehicles at designated toll plaza locations or Point of Sale (POS) stations of Axis bank and ICICI bank.
Such type of highway tag brands are common in developed countries and are known by different names like "Eazee Pass", "SunPass" in the US, "e-Pass" in Australia, "Salik" in Dubai etc.

Our focus this year will be on developing enterprise-based applications: Annie MathewOur focus this year will be on developing enterprise-based applications: Annie Mathew
Abhik Sen | New Delhi Sep 16, 2014 08:28 PM IST
BlackBerry has made a renewed push for the enterprise sector, which has traditionally been its strength. After last year's thrust on consumer-centric apps, the company's focus this year is on apps for the enterprise, says Annie Mathew, Director, Alliances and Business Development, BlackBerry, India, in an email interaction with Abhik Sen. Edited excerpts:
 
Where do apps fit into BlackBerry’s overall strategy?
Mobile applications are an important ingredient to BlackBerry’s core strategy as it is becoming a key driver to increase consumer engagement in and out of the enterprise. Today, consumers are dependent on applications as a way of life and with the adoption of smartphones at a fast pace, enterprises see an opportunity to increase collaboration and productivity via mobile apps; we see that the application ecosystem is going to get further evolved.
From BlackBerry’s perspective, we are focusing on increasing our user engagement and provide the best experience to our consumers. Thus, with the launch of BlackBerry 10.2.1 OS, customers could side-load Android apps on BlackBerry 10 devices.
Additionally, we recently announced the availability of Amazon Appstore with the launch of the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system this Fall. With more than 240,000 Android applications in the Amazon Appstore worldwide, BlackBerry 10 device customers will have access to popular apps such as Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and Minecraft.
What’s in it for developers?
From a developer ecosystem perspective, BlackBerry and Amazon will be working with the BlackBerry application developer community to help them migrate their apps to the Amazon Appstore in preparation for the 10.3 launch. The developers will benefit from the store’s powerful promotional tools that enable maximum discoverability and profitability. This will include Appstore Developer Select, which provides enhanced merchandising, as well as Amazon Coins incentives, the Developer Promotions Console, which enables real-time pricing adjustments and specials, and the popular Free App of the Day program.
 
How many apps are available in BlackBerry World? What are the popular categories among consumers?
At present, we have a total  of over  2,50,000 applications globally on BlackBerry World and one of the largest developer bases in India with over 43,000 developers as we continue to strengthen our application ecosystem. Some of the popular free apps are BBM, connect to Dropbox, Picmix for BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry news stand and popular paid apps are Angry Birds Star Wars, the Froggie games, faceflow video chat, star tracker,  Beweather 10 pro, money plus, color ID.
Productivity and games are the most popular category of apps in India and it amply states the convergence of the work life and personal life on a BlackBerry.
How important are apps to capture the evolving consumer base defined by smartphone devices? What are the measures BlackBerry is undertaking to target these consumers?
In an ever-changing world of technology, smartphone manufacturers are constantly trying to get the edge over one another. The number of apps available on a mobile platform plays a huge factor when potential consumers are selecting their perfect device, but equally important is the ability to switch between work and fun in a seamless manner at the same time ensuring data security. Over the years, the demand and popularity of mobile apps have risen dramatically and on the basis of this rise in consumer preference, we introduced iOS and Android apps on BlackBerry in Jan 2014. This strategic move has helped us reach out to a large consumer base. BBM has been one of our strongest instant messaging applications which has been successful across platform. BBM has an audience of over 80 million monthly active users that continues to grow. BlackBerry Balance provides an enterprise with the ability to partition the device into work space and personal space thereby allowing seamless switch between work apps and fun apps.
As I mentioned, our focus this year will be on developing enterprise-based applications. Last year there were a lot of consumer apps coming out. You will see a huge focus on enterprise application and focus on different verticals such as health care, manufacturing, education, logistics & retails.
What are the app categories that are expected to rise to the forefront in 2014?
We are seeing a momentum in enterprise-based applications and are anticipating huge growth in that segment. Having said that, the consumer applications will continue to grow.

(The Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj…)
HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is proposing to set up two more aerospace parks involving 1,000 acres each, leveraging on the large defence and aerospace investments it attracted from several domestic and global giants like Tatas, Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin.
The Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj minister Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao, who is also the son of chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, said Tuesday the proposed aerospace parks will come up near Hyderabad.
Addressing a conference of the Aeronautical Society of India in Hyderabad, he said the state government was preparing a strategy to make Hyderabad a defence and aerospace hub in India. While one of the new parks will be located near the existing aerospace park at Adibatla on the South of Hyderabad, the other park will come up on the Northern side of the capital city.
Tata Advanced Systems is currently setting up three facilities in the 250-acre special economic zone at Adibatla in alliance with Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin for manufacturing helicopter cabins, aircraft components and aircrafts.
Speaking on the occasion, chairman of infrastructure conglomerate GMR group, GM Rao, said India was poised to emerge as the third largest aviation market by 2020. "With rising passenger traffic and increasing military and defence expenditures, the demand for aircraft is expected to increase significantly in the next few years. The industry forecasts a demand of approximately $100 billion for commercial aircraft in next two decades."
GMR group has an aerospace and multi product SEZ at Shamshabad, adjacent to the Hyderabad International Airport where it also has an aircraft MRO facility . The group is also planning to set up an aerospace training institute in Hyderabad with the support of French firm Safran .

By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Stop the scaremongering  Scotland can prosper  Yes or NoStop the scaremongering – Scotland can prosper, Yes or No
By John Kay
©Getty
Last week, financial markets began to take seriously the possibility that Scotland might vote Yes to independence. A constitutional change would raise the possibility of three types of market risk: currency risk, government credit risk and the credit risk associated with financial institutions.
The position on currency is today a stand-off. The Scottish government has said it will negotiate a currency union and the Westminster government has said it will not enter such negotiation. But Edinburgh cannot unilaterally establish a currency union and the Westminster government cannot unilaterally determine Scotland’s currency. Plainly there must be agreement. However, might this agreement leave people who had made deposits or loans in sterling at risk of being repaid in Scots bawbees of doubtful value?
More
Mob justice is a dangerous trend
As the eurozone discovered, establishing a currency union is easy, operating one is hard and unwinding one is hard. You can pass legislation saying all contracts made in drachmas are now payable in euros; but legislation saying contracts made in euros are now payable in drachmas is another matter. To which contracts does the latter apply? However the question is resolved, the answer will hurt many businesses and individuals, and occupy the courts.
But there is a simple answer in the Scottish case, which is that whatever happens after a new currency is adopted, existing contracts in sterling remain in sterling. This means there is no currency risk ahead of a change. The same answer is not possible for Greece because the point of a Grexit would be to enable the country to default on its debts and effect a large devaluation, a course unnecessary and unwise for Scotland.
British government stocks tumbled last week when opinion polls showed the campaigns neck and neck – perhaps because markets did not know what to make of the news, perhaps because of the Scottish government’s threat to renege on its share of UK debt. But, even if the Scots did so, this would add less than 10 per cent to the debt servicing cost of the rest of the UK – which, at about 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product, is hardly unaffordable.
There is little justification for believing a Scottish exit, on whatever terms, should affect the credit rating of the remaining UK: what repudiation would do to Scotland’s credit rating is a different matter. It is one thing to start life as a new country debt free, another to do so because you have just reneged on a pro rata share of UK debt of £100bn.
The third risk associated with independence is a change in the credit risk attached to financial institutions. Banks and other companies can operate in the EU through branches of their home business, or by establishing local subsidiaries in other member states. Sweden’s Handelsbanken uses branches; the Spanish Santander takes deposits in Scotland into its English subsidiary. If a bank fails, the saver has a claim on the appropriate deposit protection scheme – that of the country in which the regulated entity is located. As in Santander’s case, that might be neither the country where you made the deposit nor the one where the bank’s head office is located.

The “lender of last resort” facility provides liquidity support if there is a run on a bank. Last week’s interrogation of Mark Carney , governor of the Bank of England, at Westminster’s Treasury select committee confused that issue with a quite separate one: the reserves needed to sustain a currency peg; and the resources needed to provide liquidity support to the banking system. The scale of modern speculative capital flows is such that there is probably no currency reserve large enough to sustain the price of a clearly overvalued currency. Meanwhile, the availability of liquidity support to solvent institutions depends not on the reserves available but on the credit rating of the provider of such support – whether another bank, a government or a central bank.

Profits soar yet stocks fall at 11 companiesProfits soar yet stocks fall at 11 companies

Investors have no trouble understanding when stocks get slammed if they don’t deliver earnings growth. But what about stocks that get hammered even when the companies are putting up better-than-average profit growth and are expected to be profit machines?
It’s not common, but it’s happening. There are 11 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including Cabot Oil (COG) , GameStop (GME) and Fossil Group (FOSL) that are down 10% or more this year despite the companies expected to post 10% or stronger adjusted earnings growth this calendar year, according to a USA TODAY review of stocks from S&P Capital IQ.
These stocks are fighting an uphill battle with investor perception as they’re expected to deliver profit growth, but not getting any credit for it. It’s a harsh reality are today’s markets where company’s fundamentals may meet or even beat those of the broad market, but sometimes the stock doesn’t keep up because investors fear some external shock.
The 10% or better earnings growth expected from these companies this year well outstrips the 7.9% earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 as a whole this year, says S&P Capital IQ. And yet, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% this year, while these stocks are down more than 10%.
Many of these stocks that are down despite expected higher earnings expectations are getting hit by the perception there could be trouble ahead. Perhaps the best example is Fossil, which makes accessories including watches. Shares of the stock are underpressure, falling more than 14%, even though analysts see earnings growing 10% this year. Among the risk factors: The fear that smartwatches might eat into Fossil’s once-lucrative watch franchise. The company has yet to make any motions to partner with a technology company to offer a smartwatch of its own. It’s hard to say if the fear is real — but investors often trade on perception, not immediate facts.

Similarly, shares of GameStop have fallen 11.5% this year, despite analysts predicting nearly 23% earnings growth in calendar 214. Again, investors have been bearish on the stock on the idea that low-cost smartphone games would eat into GameStop’s business. And the rise of downloadable games, too, is a long term risk. But the company appears to be finding ways to keep earnings growing.
Chart source: MSN Money
Clearly, the analysts are perhaps being overly optimistic. All but one of the stocks, Transocean (RIG) are rated “outperform” or “buy.” And if analysts are being too postiive, maybe investors are wise to severely discount these stocks as they’re doing. But then again, maybe investors should be less worried about what could happen, and focus on what’s likely to happen.
Below are the 11 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 with stocks down 10% or more than year despite being expected to post 10% or greater adjusted earnings growth this year:

Apples 4 million iPhone 6 pre-orders in contextApple says it set a new record.(AP Photo/John Minchillo)

September 15, 2014
Apple sold 4 million of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in 24 hours—a record, according to the Wall Street Journal (paywall). How does that compare to other iPhone launches—and its normal sales rate?
Over the past year, through the company’s June quarter, Apple sold 163.7 million iPhones. That’s about 449,000 per day.
The Christmas period, Apple’s December quarter, is typically the busiest. Last year, Apple sold 51 million iPhones in 91 days. That’s about 560,000 per day.
Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C models on opening weekend last year, including pre-orders. Previous opening weekends:  5 million  for the iPhone 5 (including 2 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours);  4 million  for the iPhone 4S;  1.7 million for the iPhone 4; “ over 1 million ” for the iPhone 3GS; and 1 million for the iPhone 3G.
Apple sold 270,000 original iPhones during the first 30 hours of sales in June 2007.

How will this year’s opening weekend sales tally up? They actually may be smaller than last year’s for two reasons. First, supply—Apple quickly sold out of its first wave of iPhone 6 pre-orders. It’s not known how many units are being saved for walk-up customers, but it would be surprising if it was enough for the company to get close to last year’s opening weekend sales tally. And second, it’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison—the iPhone lineup is broader and priced differently this year.
Still, compared to other phone launches, and launches of consumer electronics in general, 4 million in 24 hours is pretty impressive. For example, Microsoft boasted last year that its Xbox One set a new record by selling more than 1 million units in its first 24 hours.

Boutique hotel  data center pitched for South LoopHotel, data center pitched for disputed land
McHugh hotel plan

Renderings of new hotel, data center in South Loop released
Final piece of the McCormick Place redevelopment plans revealed
A Chicago developer is moving forward to put a boutique hotel, data center and retail in the South Loop, the final piece of a massive redevelopment in the next few years.
James McHugh Construction officials are hoping the new plan will resolve a year-old lawsuit seeking to force the firm to sell the land to the city. Work could begin in the next few months, officials said.

Originally, the city and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, a state-city agency known as McPier, wanted to build a 1,200-room hotel on the property as part of a proposed $600 million redevelopment of the surrounding Motor Row district into an entertainment destination. But when the contested land became tangled in litigation, McPier opted to build a Marriott Marquis a few blocks east at Cermak and Prairie Avenue. Agency officials said they hoped to find a private developer for a boutique hotel on the contested land once the lawsuit was resolved.
The caveat was that the boutique hotel would have to be privately developed for the McCormick Place redevelopment project to stay on budget.
McHugh's new offer to add a 28-story, 500-room hotel on the disputed land at Cermak and Indiana, in addition to a long-planned data center, could satisfy the city's goals, while still securing the data center McHugh has been planning.
"When the headquarters hotel moved, we saw an opportunity that we could work out a scenario where everybody wins," said Michael Meagher, McHugh Construction senior vice president. He said the firm has an agreement with the city that the lawsuit will "go away" if the city approves the project. McHugh officals are scheduled to go before the Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday, and if their plans are approved, they could present their plans to the Chicago City Council in early October.
Sounds like a good compromise to me.

Tina Feldstein, president of the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, a local residents group, said many of those she's talked to feel good about the proposal.
"It made perfect sense that (McHugh) would strike a deal with the city to build the hotel and also find a way to get his data center," Feldstein said. "So this hot debate between the city and McHugh turned into a deal."
A spokesperson for the city could not be reached for comment.
McHugh Construction called architect Joe Antunovich, president of Antunovich Associates, about four months ago to start working on a design, Antunovich said. Keeping the city's wishes in mind, he designed a boutique hotel, adding to the large number of hotels already planned for the city, including the 1,200-room Marriott just two blocks east.
Antunovich said his hotel would offer extended stay options and that it would be similar to a Hilton Garden Inn.
The six-story data center McHugh has been planning would be pushed south to mid-block on Indiana, with its entrance in the adjacent historic Rambler building, which would be renovated. The Rambler building would be used for parking for the data center and hotel, he said, adding concrete and ramps indoors, as well as an elevator.
Artwork, retail and restaurants would wrap around the corner from Indiana to Cermak, Antunovich said.
"We're really trying very hard to activate that corner," Antunovich said, "and activate a new gateway to this historic district that's had trouble getting on its feet."
Antunovich said the plan is to break ground on the data center by mid-November and to begin construction of the hotel sometime mid-2015. The data center would be finished in January 2016 and the hotel would be ready for guests by mid-2017.
A collaboration between the city, DePaul University and McPier aims to redevelop the historic Motor Row district into an entertainment destination. The project has been approved and will include a new 10,000-seat basketball arena for DePaul, the 1,200-room Marriott Marquis hotel at Cermak and Prairie Avenue, the rehabilitation of the American Book Co. building into meeting rooms and retail, and an additional data center.
The city gave $55 million in tax increment financing to McPier for the project. McPier, which will pay for the majority of the $600 million project, plans to finance it mostly with bonds backed by hotel revenues. McPier officials have said they hope to break ground on the two-year project early next year.

Who won New York Fashion Week (according to Twitter)Fashion
September 15, 2014
Last week, a colleague asked me facetiously, in regards to New York Fashion Week: “So who won?” It’s a question that could be answered many ways, of course. Marc Jacobs always wins. Opening Ceremony got coolest show. Hood by Air is the label to know. Thom Browne takes best use of hats . Eckhaus Latta, weirdest shoes . And so on. But according to Twitter metrics and The New York Times , there was one winner and his name is Michael Kors.

The Times reports that between the official dates of New York Fashion Week, September 4-11, Kors’ name and/or Twitter handle was shared about 113,000 times. But does that really mean he won?

In Kors’ case, it very well might. With a business expanding in Asia  and a near 50% jump in net sales last quarter, the designer has many reasons to be optimistic. His sunny, crisp collection reflected that.
Once upon a time, Fashion Week was a mere trade show for a relatively short list of editors and buyers. Today, designers grapple with a global audience that’s exploding via social media, to varying results. Runway shows are giving way to performance art and all-out spectacle, which often is rewarded by the Twitter-sphere.
While the clothes were important, Kors’ popularity on Twitter last week probably had as much to do with the celebrity presence at his show—Jessica Chastain, Jada Pinkett Smith, Olivia Munn, and Mary J. Blige were all in attendance —and a social media-friendly livestream complete with #Korslive hashtag. It also couldn’t have hurt that Kors gave fashion bloggers front-row treatment .

They’re smiling. But are they tweeting?(Reuters/Brendan McDermid)
But at least we saw the clothes. The same could not be said of Ralph Lauren’s “4-D” runway show for Polo: a video projected onto the mist of a fountain in the middle of Central Park. If the goal of the spectacle was to be shared via social media, it worked. But I gave up on Instagram that night, when feeds were clogged with blurry photos of the video projection, captured in the dark. Perhaps in-person it was magical, but the photos left something to be desired. In any case, topped off with Julianne Moore and a much-photographed shirtdress at Lauren’s eponymous runway show the following morning, it earned the designer the number two spot on the Twitter list.
Miley Cyrus undoubtedly gave Alexander Wang a bump when she wore pasties  to his after-party, and reveled for the many, many cellphone cameras in attendance. She walked the runway at Jeremy Scott’s show, too, which may be the only thing a lot of people could tell you about it.
I didn’t attend Marc Jacobs’ show , but from the comfort of my desk I did watch the live-stream, accompanied by a #MarcJacobsLIVE hashtag on Twitter. Attendees were provided with headphones through which a sensory audio soundtrack was streamed. The same was provided online, so I put in my earbuds and heard a cacophony of sound effects and a narrator who recalled the computer-generated voice of Stephen Hawking, while models strode down a hot pink shag carpet, around a matching house.

At the end of the show, the narrator left us—I felt included in the audience, even at my computer—with a parting thought, excerpted from the 1976 short film “The Girl Chewing Gum,” before the models made a final exit to silence and nature sounds: “There’s been too much going on. Can we move the house to a place where nothing ever happens and things are slower? I’ll be happy there.”
Perhaps we tweeted slightly less about Jacobs’ show because we were consumed by the experience—and that may have been part of the message.

Could IUDs Be the Next Great Weapon in the Battle Against PovertyThis little piece of plastic could reduce single motherhood.
Shutterstock
There aren’t any simple solutions to poverty. But of the tools we have, making effective birth control cheap and easily available for low-income women is pretty much a no-brainer. Growing contraception use has already helped bring down America’s teen pregnancy rate to its lowest levels in more than half a century. And in a New York Times op-ed published this weekend , Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution makes a compelling case that the humble IUD could help halt the ongoing rise of single mothers, who are disproportionately impoverished.
Jordan Weissmann
Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.
Here’s Sawhill’s argument, slightly condensed. “Marriage is disappearing,” she writes, and out-of-wedlock childbirth is becoming the norm, with more than 40 percent of new mothers unmarried. Some conservatives say the government should respond by working harder to promote matrimony—but they have little idea of how to do it . Some liberals (including yours truly ) say we need to accept widespread single motherhood as a fact of American life and expand the safety net to accommodate them—but that will, admittedly, cost money.

Sawhill believes we should split the difference. “What we need instead is a new ethic of responsible parenthood,” she writes. That starts with making sure women don’t get pregnant before they’re ready, since almost 70 percent of out-of-wedlock pregnancies are unplanned. How? In part by raising awareness about the challenges of single motherhood, and in part by promoting IUDs and other long-acting reversible contraceptives that are inserted in a woman’s body and must be removed by a doctor.
Many women, Sawhill reasons, end up pregnant because they misuse their birth control (the pill doesn’t work if you forget to take it). But IUDs and implants are basically foolproof—according to one major study, they are 22 times less likely to fail than the pill—because they don't require effort to use once implanted. Although the devices have had a troubled reputation due to health scares they caused in the 1970s and 80s , today’s models are safe. And while price turns some women off from them—an IUD can cost $1,000 upfront—Obamacare now requires health plans to cover the whole cost of the devices, just like other contraceptives. Medicaid also pays for them in states that have expanded the program under health reform. But Sawhill thinks we should do even more to make long-acting contraceptives widely available, for instance by educating doctors who aren't up to speed on their benefits.
“If these or other new forms of contraception were more accessible and less costly, and if more people understood how effective and convenient they are, unplanned pregnancies would decline,” she writes.
The nice thing about Sawhill’s argument is that, even if she frames it as a third path between conservative and liberal approaches to fighting poverty, it can complement either nicely—unless social attitudes get in the way. You won’t find many progressives who are opposed to the idea of making effective contraceptives available on the cheap to every poor woman in America. Fiscal conservatives could get on board, too, since helping low-income women avoid unintended pregnancy prevents the government from having to make welfare program payments when the child is born. According to Brookings’ calculations , preventing an unplanned pregnancy saves Washington at least five times what it costs. You’re most likely to find opposition from the religious traditionalists, like the groups that have challenged Obamacare's contraception mandate in court, who just can’t abide the idea of subsidizing birth control on principle. But good policy ideas are always going to make somebody unhappy.

As a conservative I have never understood why my fellow conservatives would object to this. More women who are unable to properly care for children not having them. It looks like a win for everyone to me.   More...

We shouldn't expect better birth control availability to work miracles. Researchers have found that around 40 percent of accidental pregnancies result from the misuse of contraceptives. On the one hand, that demonstrates just how much of a difference fail-safe options like IUDs can make. On the other, it shows that getting many couples to use contraceptives at all is still a formidable challenge. A giant educational campaign might help raise awareness, but Brookings’ own projections suggest that such a push would only reduce the number of children born to unmarried parents by just a few percentage points . That would be wonderful progress, but it wouldn’t be the end of single motherhood. Even if change came faster, there would still be millions and millions of one-parent families in need of a stronger safety net in the U.S..
But in the end, that simply means nobody should fixate on better birth control as a silver bullet for poverty (Sawhill, to her credit, doesn’t). There’s no good argument against promoting effective contraceptives. Like I said, it’s a no-brainer.

Expect change in interest rate stance by H12015: Uday KotakChallenges in the banking sector are related to infrastructure
Uday Kotak
Executive Vice-Chairman & MD
Kotak Mahindra Bank
Uday Kotak, Executive Vice Chairman & MD, Kotak Mahindra Bank expects the central bank to change its stance on interest rate by first half of 2015. In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18’s Malvika Jain, he said that the Reserve Bank (RBI) will have to put some weightage on wholesale price index (WPI) inflation data as well.
Inflation data based on WPI for August hit a five year low at 3.74 percent courtesy declining vegetable prices and other food articles. Despite this steep fall, experts feel that it is unlikely for Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates since it closely monitors CPI inflation than WPI when deciding on rates.
Below is the transcript of Uday Kotak’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Malvika Jain
Q: Is the time right for a rate cut?
A: My view is that there is a fair possibility of an interest rate change in the first half of calendar 2015 and whether it is February, April or June, but I expect some interest rate change in that window of the first half. There is a challenge between consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI), the weightage of energy is pretty low in CPI and the weightage of food is extremely high in CPI. Therefore while CPI may be the major anchor, the state of WPI is also something I am sure Reserve Bank of India will be factoring in to its calculations.
Q: If you look at the other macro economic indicators such as the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) which continues to be sluggish, do you really see that the government’s policies are yielding any sort of result or there are certain big ticket agenda items which the government must consider at this stage. It has been in power for over 100 days now. What should it be looking at?
A: The government is playing a Marathon and not a sprint, so give them time. The government has done a brilliant job on foreign policy and is using foreign policy as an effective tool for economic policy as well because we are going to see a lot of interest from global companies and investors to make in India. So I am quite optimistic about economic policy also, but it is a more steady development and not a quick fix.
Q: You did mention about the manner in which the government should be looking at subsidy. As far as the power sector is concerned do you think the time has now come for the government to overhaul its subsidy mechanism for ensuring that power supply in the country doesn’t remain a challenge because that is having a direct impact on industrial production.
A: I am a believer that whatever subsidies you want to give, give it directly and therefore if you want to benefit a particular category of consumers or users, give it directly at that level. Doing it at different parts of the system by subsidising coal or subsidising PPAs is not a good way of subsidy management, clean the entire vertical and if subsidies need to be given, give it directly at the point of use.
Q: As far as the pressures on the banking sector are concerned which are the key areas that you would like to identify for the government to look at and is there any sort of policy intervention that you feel is desirable at this stage?
A: Biggest challenges for the banking sector are clearly the whole infrastructure and related sectors and those are challenges from our past which need to be fixed. And I would say that the core two economic growth is going to be the ability of the banking sector to have capacity to support economic growth.
Infrastructure is the biggest issue, also construction, steel and we are seeing some pressure even in SMEs. So these are the sectors which need attention. My view is that ultimately there has to be a solution and somebody has got to take the pain but recognise responsibility for the pain, take it and we have to unclock the system.

2 million Android One smartphones to be sold in India in 2014: Chip maker MediaTek39

New Delhi: Buoyed by the initial response to Android One smartphones, chip maker MediaTek said it expects as many as two million handsets to be sold this year in India, the world's second largest market for mobile phones.
The Taiwan-headquartered company has partnered with US-based tech giant Google on Android One, an initiative to provide a family of high-quality, yet affordable Android devices for consumers in emerging markets like India.
On Monday, Google launched three devices in partnership with Micromax, Karbonn and Spice under the Android One initiative. India is the first country to have the Android One handets, priced at Rs 6,399 onwards.

"We expect 1.5 to 2 million Android One handsets to be sold this year in India," MediTek VP (US Business Development) Mohit Bhushan told PTI when asked about the his expectations on the sale of the handsets.

With prices starting at Rs 6,399, the hardware and software being provided on Android One will give users an amazing experience, he added.
The first set of Android One devices feature MediaTek's MT6582 mobile System-on-Chip (SoC), which is based on quad ARM CortexTM A7 processors.

The processors deliver superior multi-tasking performance and excellent sustained performance-per-watt for a premium mobile experience.
When asked about the impact on Android One on the smartphone market, Bhushan said: "In the short term, there can be disruptions. But, this will eventually lead to handset makers not part of Android One to invest on innovating the mobile experience."
He added that companies will have to realise that Android One will give users an unmatched device experience at affordable prices and for them to match it, they will have to follow suit.
With Android One, Google aims to win customers in the world's fastest growing smartphone market with low prices and better quality software.
Currently, many affordable smartphones in India already offer customised versions of the Android operating system.
In case of Android One, the eventual software upgrades on the Android One phones would come directly from Google. This would give Google better control of the operating system and ensure users get a consistent service.
Reports suggest, an initial lot of Micromax Canvas A1 handsets, that were put up for sale on Amazon, were sold out.
PwC India Leader (Telecom) Mohammad Chowdhury said: "The festive season regularly sees an uptick in handset sales and we should expect this in the next few months. In particular there is hot competition in the segment priced from Rs 7,000 upwards."

Electronic toll collection on highways: NHAI signs pactAxis Bank
(NHAI has inked pact with…)
NEW DELHI: NHAI-promoted Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL) has inked a pact with Axis Bank for services related electronic toll collection, which the government plans to introduce pan-India.
Considering the complexities and geographical spread, the nationwide electronic toll collection (ETC) would be first of its kind in the whole world.
"IHMCL, a NHAI promoted company and Axis Bank has signed an agreement for provision of Central Clearing House (CCH) services and sale of FASTag, for Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) at the Toll Plazas on the National Highways," an official statement said today.
It said ETC system on Delhi - Mumbai stretch of the national highways will be made operational by the end of this month and a nationwide rollout will be carried out by the end of year.
Earlier this year, IHMCL had signed agreement with ICICI Bank also and it has two banks now to perform clearing and settlement of electronic toll transaction, which is a key requirement for electronic toll collection.
This is subsequent to the initiative taken by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, NHAI and IHMCL for implementation of unified Electronic Toll Collection on Indian national highways.
Electronic Toll Collection enables road users to pay highway tolls electronically without stopping at the toll plazas.
"The unique number of the RFID FASTag affixed on the wind shield of the vehicle will be read by the readers fitted in the dedicated 'ETC' lanes of plazas and the toll will be deducted automatically," the statement said adding this will help in reducing congestion at the toll plazas and enable seamless movement of vehicles on the national highways.
The Ministry has decided to roll out ETC programme in the country under the brand name "FASTag".
The dedicated ETC lanes will have colour coding for distinct identity recognised as "FASTag lanes".
ICICI Bank and Axis bank, engaged for providing CCH services, would distribute RFID based "FASTag" through their franchises/agents and at points of sales near the toll plazas.
Road users can enrol and get "FASTag" affixed on their vehicles at designated toll plaza locations or Point of Sale (POS) stations of Axis bank and ICICI bank.
Such type of highway tag brands are common in developed countries and are known by different names like "Eazee Pass", "SunPass" in the US, "e-Pass" in Australia, "Salik" in Dubai etc.

Poll: Illinois voters back referendum issues71
Even a majority of voters who consider themselves either very or fairly conservative — 54 percent — backed a higher minimum wage in Illinois, compared with 41 percent who oppose it.
Poll respondent Elena Johnson, a full-time baby sitter for her grandchildren, said the minimum wage should be increased to fairly pay workers.
"Everything has gone up, and everything is still going up, and I think that people that work in the fast-food restaurants — they do have families and it's hard to manage paying bills and then buying food — food is expensive now," said Johnson, 49, of Chicago.
But Elizabeth McCormick, a poll respondent from Westchester, said increasing wages could lead to businesses closing their doors — and to layoffs.
"You raise the minimum wages, businesses close, people lose their jobs," said McCormick, 73, who is retired from work at a sporting goods company.
As was the case with minimum wage, Democrats who control the General Assembly also failed to act during the spring session on Madigan's proposed state constitutional amendment asking voters to impose a 3 percentage point "surcharge" on incomes of more than $1 million. The extra revenue would be distributed to schools on a per-student basis.
Because the Illinois Constitution requires a flat-rate income tax for all residents, Democrats would have needed to put the issue on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment. Since that requires a hefty majority of lawmakers to get on the ballot as a binding proposal, Madigan's Democrats opted instead to put the issue before voters as an advisory referendum.
The poll found 56 percent of voters approved of the so-called millionaire's tax compared with 36 percent who opposed it. Only 9 percent had no opinion.
The proposal had the backing of nearly 7 in 10 voters in Chicago and nearly 6 in 10 in suburban Cook County. But in the five collar counties, which have long trended Republican, the gap narrowed to 54 percent in favor and 40 percent opposed. Downstate, with more conservative voters, it narrowed further, to 49 percent support and 41 percent oppose.
"It's not productive," said poll respondent Steven Rains, 66, a retired auto sales industry worker from Granite City, near St. Louis. "Rich people are OK as long as they're helping out. But we've all gotten greedy. They'll look for (a) cheaper place and leave Illinois."
But Marcia Redmond, a poll respondent from Chicago, said millionaires should pay a little more in taxes given the many tax breaks for which they qualify.
"If we're supposed to be the United States — that's made for all Americans. I think those who make their fair share should pay what they need to pay," said Redmond, 70, a retired IRS employee.
While a majority of voters of all income ranges expressed support for the extra tax on millionaires, the question received its greatest support among people with household incomes of more than $100,000 — 61 percent in favor and 33 percent opposed.
The ballot issue, aside from potentially increasing Democratic turnout, also provides Democrats with another subtle reminder of Rauner's wealth in an election that has centered on their class warfare battle against the Republican governor candidate.
Among Rauner supporters, 58 percent oppose the millionaire's tax while 35 percent approve. Among Quinn backers, 73 percent are in favor of it while only 17 percent oppose it. And among undecided voters, 53 percent support the proposal while 35 percent oppose it.

Modi government s honeymoon period over: Congress on bypoll results4
0
New Delhi: Congress on Tuesday termed the results of Assembly bypolls, in which BJP suffered major reverses, as "good omen" for the secular forces and said it should ring alarm bells in the saffron party as people have rejected the "politics of polarisation".
Saying that "Modi government's honeymoon period with the people was over", party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed sought to portray the verdict in Uttar Pradesh, where BJP could win only three of 11 assembly seats while rest going to SP, as "the vote against BJP more than in favour of any party". He, at the same time, acknowledged that Congress could not perform as per its expectations in the Hindi state by not winning a single seat, but reminded that in the Lok Sabha elections too, it had won only in two of the 80 Parliamentary constituencies.
Ahmed claimed that anti-incumbency factor has set in within 100 days of Modi government coming to power. "People did not like the attitude of BJP and Modi government. While the Prime Minister himself kept silent, BJP leaders and ministers in the Modi government played the politics of polarisation with their statements.
Congress sought to portray the verdict in UP as "the vote against BJP more than in favour of any party.
#congress #assembly polls #bjp #bypolls
People of Uttar Pradesh have rejected BJP's politics of hate mongering. "This is perhaps first government, whose anti-incumbency had begun within 100 days of coming to power. Alarm bells are ringing for the BJP. This is a good omen for secular forces that people have started rejecting them," Ahmed said.
He, however, noted that Congress' gains in Gujarat and Rajasthan were significant as in the Lok Sabha polls it had drawn a blank in both states. Terming the results as a "morale booster" for Congress, Ahmed, who is AICC general secretary in-charge for poll bound Haryana said, "Now we will try to improve our performance".
Turning to Uttar Pradesh, the Congress spokesman alleged that "full authority" had been given to people who were responsible for inciting riots in the state. "Leave aside caste, creed and religion, these communal forces were acting as triggers to incite fight between husband and wife," he said, in an obvious reference to BJP raking up the issue of 'Love Jihad', the alleged forcible conversion of Hindu girls through marriage.

WHO: $1 billion needed to keep Ebola infections within the tens of thousandsBy Abby Phillip and Abby Ohlheiser September 16 Follow @abbydphillip Follow @abbyohlheiser
Addressing the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organization’s director general didn't mince words, saying, "Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, this health crisis we face is unparalleled in modern times." (Reuters)
The World Health Organization is pleading for a global investment of nearly $1 billion to fight the spread of Ebola, warning that the amount is merely the minimum needed to keep infections of the deadly virus "within the tens of thousands."
The organization has long warned that Ebola's toll — which stands at at least 2,461 dead and 4,985 infected as of Sept. 13, according to the WHO  — vastly underestimates the crisis. But now it appears that the epidemic is spreading at such a rapid pace that tens of thousands more infections and thousands more deaths are expected, even with a dramatically scaled-up response.
The toll has doubled in the past month, the WHO's Assistant Director General Bruce Aylward said Tuesday at a news conference in Geneva, according to Reuters .
The WHO warned that the number of cases could start doubling every three weeks, the Associated Press reported .
"Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, this health crisis we're facing is unparalleled in modern times," Aylward said. "We don't know where the numbers are going on this."
The epidemic sweeping across five West African countries — and most severe in Sierra Leone, Guinea and, especially, Liberia — has likely claimed many more lives than the official numbers confirmed by the WHO.
That's due in part to the limited resources in place to fight and document outbreaks of the disease, which has devastated the infrastructure of already strained health-care facilities in the affected countries. In Liberia, transmission rates are increasing exponentially, and health-care facilities are filled to capacity and are turning away many new patients .
The global response to help those countries fight the outbreak has been chaotic, as The Post recently reported . Many global health groups capable of providing assistance to the region underestimated how severe it would be in the outbreak's early days, and have scrambled to catch up to the needs of those working to fight it. And with the outbreak becoming a full-fledged epidemic, Ebola aid workers are now overwhelmed and exhausted .
On Thursday, the U.N. will announce a global response coalition against Ebola. Valerie Amos, under secretary general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency, said that international groups will need to "prevent the collapse of the health systems in the affected countries" and contend with a shaky "food security situation" in many regions affected by the epidemic.
On Tuesday, the United States will announce its own plan to aid in the fight, led by the U.S. military. The operation, which President Obama will announce at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection in Atlanta, will involve 3,000 troops and could cost as much as $750 million over a six-month period. Operation United Assistance, as it's called, will be headquartered in the Liberian city of Monrovia.
In the rapidly escalating war against what Liberia's finance minister recently described as " an enemy we don't see ," the U.S. military will set up 17 treatment centers in Liberia. The United States is also planning on training hundreds of health-care workers to help in the fight against Ebola.
"Our collective response to date has not been sufficient," Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday of the global response . "The situation on the ground is dire and is growing worse by the day."

Amritsar: Union Minister Smriti Irani on Tuesday stressed on the need to create safe a atmosphere for women in the society. "There is a need to create safe atmosphere for women so that they can move freely and fearlessly in our society," she said, adding it would be possible only when we respect
women.
People have double standards towards women due to which women suffer in their own houses, she said addressing students at a local college. On education, Irani said the need of the hour was to raise the standard of education in the country and announced that from the next year, a new education policy will be introduced in the country.

High-end condos point to rebounding marketChicago's downtown condo market rebounding
Apartment construction still hot in Chicago, but high-end units could spark condo revival
Most condo projects aimed at affluent consumers
Tuesday's ceremonial groundbreaking for a condominium building in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood was a long-awaited sight and sign, even if the project will have just 35 units.
The $80 million project, named 4 East Elm, is the first high-rise condo building to start marketing units on the city's Near North Side since 2007. What's more, just under half of the building, where the prices for half-floor and full-floor units range from $2.1 million to $7 million, is under contract.
Other developments are moving into the marketing phase as well: midsize, high-end projects north of the Chicago River and in the West Loop. A more affordably priced condo tower also is underway in the city's South Loop neighborhood.
  Open link
Their starts are encouraging signs that the downtown condo market is rebounding after several years in which developers focused on apartment buildings.
But make no mistake, the return of for-sale development is baby step by baby step, and most of the projects cater to the less-risky, affluent consumer. Industry watchers predict it will be at least another three to four years before condo projects aimed at entry-level and midmarket buyers gain in popularity with developers and their lenders.
Apartment construction remains hot, although worries are starting to creep in that a bubble is forming. In the past four years, apartment developers have added more than 1,700 units to an area roughly bordered by North Avenue, Cermak Road, parts of the Chicago River and Ashland Avenue, and Lake Michigan, according Appraisal Research Counselors. That compares with 133 condo units in the same time.

Some downtown rental towers have seen exceptional demand, despite dizzyingly rents. Most of the units are aimed at young professionals who can't or don't want to buy but can afford rents that start at about $2,000 for small units and plush amenities.
On the opposite end of the building spectrum are some of the latest crop of condos, large lavishly appointed units with high price tags. They're catering to older, more established consumers who can pay cash or qualify for a mortgage, and are looking to move out of smaller downtown condos or are downsizing from the suburbs and want something new.
"There's always been demand for high-end, luxury units," said Jim Letchinger, president of JDL Development Corp., which next week will begin taking reservations for a 70-unit project planned for 21 W. Walton St. where prices will run from just under $2 million to more than $10 million. "It did get quiet because people weren't interested in spending money. Now the demand has come back but there's no product."
In fact, developers are finding they can't build product fast enough.
Belgravia Group Ltd., which took over unfinished West Loop projects before starting its own, has found success with larger, three-bedroom units. Despite raising its prices, its most recent project was sold out shortly after its groundbreaking.
Now Belgravia is trying to acquire a site in the city's River North neighborhood that could become home to 50 condos in a 12- to 14-story building.
"We keep getting calls all the time," said Alan Lev, Belgravia's president and CEO. "Something less than 50 units appears to be the sweet spot."

DRW Real Estate Holdings' Convexity Properties, which is developing 4 East Elm, was nervous about putting no more than two units on a floor. But marketing partner @properties pushed for larger, more luxurious units, according to @properties co-founder Michael Golden. Originally, prices ran from $500 to $1,000 a square foot. Based on buyer interest, they now range from more than $700 to $1,200 a square foot.
A price tag hovering around $1 million is popular. Related Realty will soon start marketing a 28-unit condo project at 100 W. Huron St. where the smallest, 1,700-square-foot units will start at just under $1 million, according to Related Realty president David Wolf.
Eventually, once the apartment boom runs its course, some apartment towers possibly convert to condos, and there are enough entry-level buyers to satisfy lenders' pre-sale requirements for construction financing, lower-priced condo projects will start taking shape.
"It's a gradual process," said Gail Lissner, a vice president at Appraisal Research. "It reminds me of the '90s. Developers are testing the waters and it's very logical. You don't start out with 500 units."
For current condo owners, the market's dynamics represent a conundrum. If owners bought during the market's run-up, they may be underwater on their mortgage and unable to sell but easily able to exit their unit by turning it into a rental. If owners bought a dozen years ago or more ago, their units look dated.
"Right now, unless you have some vision and some work, (buyers) have to catch it right when it comes on the market," said Joanne Nemerovski, an agent with Berkshire HathawayHomeServices KoenigRubloff. "There's almost nothing on the market for buyers."
That lack of supply is helping push up existing condo prices. For example, during the first seven months of the year, condo sales on the city's Near West Side were down 5.2 percent from a year ago, but the median price rose 8.3 percent, according to Midwest Real Estate Data, the local multiple listing provider
"For the most part, it's a good thing that we haven't been bloated with new construction in the condo market because it has allowed for (price) stabilization," noted Matthew Farrell, managing partner of Urban Real Estate.
When like-new units do come on the market, they don't last long.
Coldwell Banker agent Samuel Ciochon on Wednesday listed a two-bedroom, two-bath condo in a 15-year-old building on Chicago's Near North Side, a unit in which the owner just completed a complete rehab. Listed for $600,000, Ciochon conducted an open house for the unit Sunday, even though the property received an offer Saturday that is now being negotiated.
"I knew it was going to sell really quickly," he said. "It'll set a new price point for the building."

RBI says no immediate plans to raise FIIs' debt limit
It may be noted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in July increased the investment cap for FIIs in government securities by USD 5 billion to USD 25 billion, within the total limit of USD 30 billion.

RBI says no immediate plans to raise FIIs' debt limit
It may be noted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in July increased the investment cap for FIIs in government securities by USD 5 billion to USD 25 billion, within the total limit of USD 30 billion.
Post your opinion here
 
The Reserve Bank today ruled out any immediate plan to increase the investment limit for overseas investors in government securities from the current USD 30 billion. "As of now there is no such (raising FII debt limit) proposal, but we will see," RBI Deputy Governor HR Khan told reporters on the sidelines of an annual banking event, organised by Ficci and IBA.
It may be noted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in July increased the investment cap for FIIs in government securities by USD 5 billion to USD 25 billion, within the total limit of USD 30 billion.
The limit was enhanced by reducing the investment limit for long-term investors from USD 10 billion to USD 5 billion.
The government has budgeted Gilt buyback worth Rs 50,000 crore for this year. And the first tranche of Rs 20,000 crore was auctioned today, but the RBI accepted bids worth only Rs 12,761.46 crore.
When asked when would RBI buy back the rest of government securities which was announced during the Budget, Khan said a decision on this will be taken later. "We have done (repurchase of government securities) worth Rs 20,000 but the entire amount was not accepted. This tranche may again repeat depending on how things move," Khan said.
He also said the central bank is in dialogue with the government on auctioning of cash balances and it would happen soon.
Whether the RBI is concerned over more and more domestic companies borrowing money from abroad, Khan answered in the negative, saying the country is not at risk as  RBI has issued enough safeguards to avoid any major risks emanating from unhedged forex exposure.
"Due to controlled regime for borrowing abroad such as ceiling on limit, we are not at risk as other countries are.
But still there are quite a few corporates who are exposed to foreign currency volatility and that is the reason we are making all the efforts to encourage companies to hedge their exposure," he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Association has right to enter unit to check for water leak0
Water infiltration through the common elements into other units is a necessary, emergency repair. Sections 9.1(a) and 9.2 hold that a unit owner is responsible for the costs of inspection and repairs relating to a water leak emanating from his or her unit.
Q: I am a board member of a community association subject to the Illinois Common Interest Community Association Act. Because of the emerald ash borer, our association had to remove more than 40 ash trees and replace them with non-ash varieties.
A special assessment was required to fund replacement of the trees. Because the trees are a different species, is the replacement of the trees considered an alteration to the common area pursuant to Section 1-45 of the Community Association Act, which then triggers a requirement for two-thirds owner approval?
A: Section 1-30 of the Common Interest Community Association Act states the bylaws of an association shall provide for the maintenance, repair and replacement of common areas. Section 1-45 states the board shall prepare a budget to pay for common expenses and allows for the adoption of a special assessment for expenditures not contemplated in the budget.
Replacement of a tree with a different species of tree is not an addition or alteration to the common area that triggers two-thirds owner approval of the special assessment.
Additions and alterations are interpreted to be a new or additional capital improvement to the property, not replacing a common area component with a similar component.
Q: Can a condominium association prohibit a unit owner from being a candidate to the board because of delinquent assessments if there is no such prohibition in the bylaws or rules and regulations on the issue?
A: Section 18(a)(1) of the Condominium Act states that a board of managers shall be elected among the unit owners. There is no other statutory provision governing board candidate qualification. Though not addressing the topic at issue, but addressing a consequence of an assessment delinquency, Section 18(b)(1) of the Condominium Act states that when voting on amendments to the association's bylaws, a unit that is in assessment arrears for 60 days or more shall not be counted for purposes of a quorum at a unit-owner meeting for such a vote.
Thus, in the absence of a valid provision in the association's governing documents relating to board candidacy criteria, there is no basis for an association to prohibit a unit owner from running for the board because of an assessment delinquency.

Investors eye Fed  Scotland vote  Alibaba IPOInvestors beware: Fed, Scotland vote, Alibaba IPO could roil market

Wall Street’s calendar next week is jammed packed with potentially market-moving events. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) ORG XMIT: NY115)
This is a big week on Wall Street. In a span of three days, investors will hear from the Fed, find out if Scotland opts to cut its ties with England and learn if the Alibaba IPO lives up to the mega-hype.
“It is of note that these date-certain events are clustered,” notes Woody Dorsey, who heads Market Semiotics, an investment research firm that specializes in behavioral finance and investor psychology.
Each event on its own has market implications. But clustered together in a three-day span that kicks off Wednesday, means the jumble of headlines could pack an even bigger market punch — perhaps dragging stock prices lower, Dorsey warns.
“Volatility and turbulence should pick up,” Dorsey tells USA TODAY. “It looks like (the risk is to the) downside. At the moment the reason is: “uncertainty” about the outcome of each news event.
In a sign of angst, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index last week finished lower, snapping a five-week winning streak. It kicks off the week 1.1% below its Sept. 5 record closing high of 2007.71. In early trading Monday, the benchmark U.S. stock index is down less than 3 points at 1983.
Here’s the key dates and news events to watch.
Day 1: WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 17
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen next week could signal an earlier-than-expected rate hike next year. (Susan Walsh, AP)
The news event: The two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting ends Wednesday with a policy statement and press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The fear: The central bank changes its tune on the timing of interest rate hikes, and tips Wall Street off to the fact that the first rate hike — which the market expects in mid-2015 — will come sooner. Low rates have been a major driver of rising stock prices in the bull market.
The risk: Stock investors are not positioned properly for an earlier rate increase and react negatively, pricing in slower growth and skimpier corporate profits going forward, causing stock prices to turn lower.
 
 Day 2: THURSDAY, SEPT. 18
Will Scotland vote “yes” or “no” for independence? (Andy Buchanan, AFP/Getty Images)
The news event: Scotland’s referendum vote seeking independence from England.
The fear: This once low-probability event can’t be ruled out, polls say. Scottish independence would mark a major “change” in the political and economic ties in the United Kingdom.
The risk: A surprise “yes” vote would add a fresh jolt of geopolitical uncertainty and could spook currency markets, as well as other markets, including London’s stock market. “It would be a change and hurts the euro,” says Dorsey.
 
 Day 3: FRIDAY, SEPT. 19

The news event: The hotly anticipated initial public offering of Chinese Internet giant Alibaba — expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO ever — is tentatively set to start trading Friday. The price range of $60 to $66 per share is expected to be raised higher amid strong demand.
The fear: The IPO doesn’t live up to the hype and the shares underperform on Day 1 of trading. On the flip side, if the IPO does match or exceed the hype, and the shares trade sharply higher, it could be the latest sign that investor optimism is nearing the stage of irrational exuberance.
The risk: Market sentiment sours on the view that a successful Alibaba IPO marks a stock market top or a poor outcome signals that investors are no longer willing to buy “story” stocks.
“Big IPOs can mark tops,” Dorsey says. “Tech is the market leader so far this year, so if that reverses, it would be a big signal.”

Bypolls: BJP sees disappointing results in Rajasthan  UP | Status quo in LS pollsSetback for BJP? Party sees disappointing bypoll results in Rajasthan, UP
PTI Sep 16, 2014, 05.47PM IST
Tags:
BJP
(The BJP, however, had a reason…)
NEW DELHI: The BJP today suffered a major blow in in the Assembly by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat,the states it had swept in the Lok Sabha polls four months ago, losing 13 of the 24 seats held by it.
Considered yet another test of popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, today's reverses in the by-elections come after the party's disappointing performance in the assembly by-elections in Bihar, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the last two months.
Out of the 32 Assembly seats across nine states for which counting of votes was taken up today, BJP won 10, Congress seven and Samajwadi Party seven while TDP, Trinamool Congress, AIUDF and CPI(M) bagged one each. One seat in Sikkim was won by an Independent. In three seats in UP where results were awaited, BJP was leading in two and Samajwadi Party in one.
It was Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was on a high after a near-total sweep of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, that delivered a humiliating blow to the saffron party as it lost seven of the 11 seats held by it, including one held by its ally Apna Dal. BSP's absence in the by-elections had made it a virtual straight fight between SP and BJP in the politically crucial state.
Equally crushing was the defeat in Rajasthan where BJP conceded three of the four seats to Congress, which also managed to wrest three of the nine seats in Gujarat, where the elections were held for the first time in 12 years sans Narendra Modi.
All the seats in Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9) and Rajasthan (4) were held by BJP and the bypolls were necessitated after the MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha.
Gloating over BJP's reverses, the Congress and Samajwadi Party called it as a defeat of the communal forces. They said people had rejected the Narendra Modi Government and BJP's "politics of polarisation".
The BJP, which is hoping to do well in the coming assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, conceded that the bypoll results were not up to expectations and said that people had voted on local issues.
The only solace for BJP on an otherwise dismal day was its entry in West Bengal Assembly.
BJP candidate Shamik Bhattacharya won the Basirhat Dakshin seat in North 24 parganas district by a margin of 1,742 votes against its nearest Trinamool Congress rival and former Indian soccer captain Dipendu Biswas. The seat was earlier held by CPI(M).
BJP retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Prime Minister Modi, albeit with a reduced margin. Ranjanben Bhatt thumped her Congress rival Narendra Rawat by over 3.29 lakh votes. Modi had won the seat by 5.7 lakh votes.
In the other two Lok Sabha bye-elections, Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, the stronghold of ruling SP, Tej Pratap Singh, the grand nephew of Mulayam Singh Yadav, defeated BJP's Prem Singh Skahkya by a margin of more than 3.21 lakh votes. Mulayam had vacated the seat after he chose to retain Azamgarh.
In Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, the ruling TRS retained the seat vacated by party chief K Chandrasekhar Rao. Its candidate K Prabhakar Reddy won by 3,61,277 votes.
In Uttar Pradesh, out of 11 assembly seats, Samajwadi Party won seven seats and BJP one. In Gujarat, BJP won six seats and Congress three, while in Rajasthan Congress bagged three and BJP one. In Andhra Pradesh, ruling TDP retained the Nandigama seat.
In West Bengal, Trinamool and BJP won one seat each. The BJP also made other advances in eastern region wresting Silchar constituency in Assam from the Congress. The All India United Democratic Front and the ruling Congress retained Jamunamukh and Lakhipur seats respectively in the state.
CPI-M won the Manu (ST) Assembly constituency in Tripura while Independent candidate R N Chamling, brother of Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling, won Rangang-Yangang assembly seat in Sikkim by 708 votes defeating his nearest Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) nominee.
Last month, the saffron party suffered a 4-6 defeat at the hands of the RJD-JD(U)-Congress alliance in Bihar and yielded two strongholds to Congress in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in the by-elections. In July, it lost all the three assembly seats in Uttarakhand to Congress in the by-elections.
In UP, among the seats lost by BJP were Bijnor, Thakurdwara, Nighasan, Hamirpur, Charkhari, Sirathu, Balha. It retained Saharapur (city seat).
Charkhari was earlier held by Union Minister Uma Bharati. In Gujarat, BJP lost Dessa, Mangrol and Khambalia seats to Congress. It managed to retain Maninagar, Tankara, Talaja, Anand, Kheda and Limkheda assembly seats.
In Rajasthan, BJP lost in Nasirabad, Weir and Surajgarh Assembly constituencies. It retained Kota city.
In West Benagl, whereas Trinamool Congress bagged the prestigious Chowringhee seat. TMC candidate Nayana Bandopadhyay won by a margin of 14344 votes against her nearest rival BJP's Ritesh Tiwari.
AIDUF's Abdur Rahim Ajmal won the Jamunamukh seat defeating Congress' Bashir Uddin Laskar by 22,959 votes in Assam.
AIUDF President Badruddin Ajmal's son Abdur Rahim Ajmal retained the seat polling 62,153 votes.
The ruling Congress retained Lakhipur seat as its candidate Rajdeep Goala defeated his nearest BJP rival Sanjay Thakur by 9172 votes garnering 40,090 votes, while Thakur got 30918 votes. In Silchar, however, BJP's Dilip Kumar Paul won.
Telugu Desam Party's Tangirala Sowmya won the Nandigama Assembly bypoll in Andhra Pradesh by 74,827 votes.
Riding on the sympathy wave, Sowmya, a software engineer, got 99,748 votes. The by-election was necessitated following the death of Sowmya's father due to a cardiac arrest.
CPI-M candidate Prabhat Chowdhury trounced his nearest INC candidate Mailafru Mog in Manu (ST) constituency in Tripura. The constituency fell vacant after former Idustries and Commerce Minister Jitendra Chowdhury was elected to the Lok Sabha.

Hindu activists thrash MP university VC over appeal to help J-K studentsComments
Vikram University vice chancellor Prof Jawaharlal Kaul was admitted to Sanjeevani Hospital after members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal manhandled him at his office in Ujjain on Monday. The mob also vandalised his office.

The VHP and Bajrang Dal created ruckus after vice chancellor Kaul appealed to students to help their Kashmir classmates in the time of devastation. About 100 Kashmiri students are studying in different departments of the university.
The activists barged into the university and straight away moved to the VC office. They lodged their protest against Kaul’s appeal and vandalised his office.
The university staffers rushed Kaul to Sanjeevani Hospital, where his condition is said to be stable. Raising voice against ‘hooliganism’ on the university campus, teaching and nonteaching staffers have decided to keep university shut for a day on Tuesday.
Ujjain police registered a case against accused persons and claimed that they arrested them.

It's hard not to envy the scientists who got a hands-on experience with this magnificent cephalopod, but at least we didn't have to spend three hours inhaling the scent of defrosting squid.

Passengers eject Pak politicians out of plane for causing delayprint
Angry passengers on board an Islamabad-bound Pakistan International Airways (PIA) flight from Karachi forced two prominent Pakistani politicians off the plane accusing them of holding it for more than two hours. 
PIA's flight PK-370 was scheduled to depart from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport at 7pm on Monday but according to passengers on board it started two hours late.
Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) leader and former interior minister Rehman Malik and Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) member of National Assembly Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani allegedly arrived two hours after the scheduled boarding time and were not allowed to travel by the angry passengers who shooed them off the plane.
Video: Rehman Malik thrown off PIA flight by passengers
Anger caught on camera
The entire episode was uploaded on a French video sharing website called Daily Motion by one of the passengers on board the flight. It then found its way on YouTube.
Around six to eight passengers can be seen assembled near the gateway, which connects the terminal to the aircraft. They can be heard raising slogans.
They then demand that the crew close the door and start the flight. But the crew refuses to do so leading to more commotion and more passengers start crowding the gateway.
Irritated by the VIP culture one of the passengers can be heard saying, "We have taken it for too long... 68 years... Are we going to take it for another 68 years?"
“My foot VIP. Don't you worry. I will grill him when he comes in,” says another passenger.
When Malik enters the gateway, one of the passengers tells Malik to go back.
"Malik sahab, sorry. You should go back. You should apologise to these passengers. You should be ashamed of yourself... 250 passengers have suffered because of you. It is your fault, sir."
Malik then walks away without confronting the passengers.
But Wakwani refused to budge and proceeded to the seat, only to be sent off after a series of altercations.
The crowd can be heard clapping and appreciating those who protested after Wakwani leaves the plane. 
Technical issue or Malik's fault?
Initially, the flight crew offered 'technical issue' as the reason for the delay.
PIA spokesperson Mashood Tajwar, speaking to Pakistani daily Dawn, also said that the delay was due to a technical issue and it was not Malik’s fault.
“PIA does not promote VIP culture... But this flight was delayed an hour and 30 minutes due to a technical reason,” said Tajwar.
“The delay had been conveyed to passengers via SMS. Some passengers who had given the contact details of their travel agent may not have been conveyed the message by their agents,” he added.
Malik also tweeted later that he had nothing to do with the delay.
I hv right to defend myself agst the allegation.PK370 /1900hr was delayed b/c tech reasons/was expected to leave at 2030. So no delay for me— Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik) September 16, 2014
After the incident, Malik argued that once he saw that he was not welcome on the flight, he decided to not travel on that aircraft.
He also asked people not to link him with Wakwani, who unlike Malik proceeded to his seat despite the protests.
Why am I being linked with PMLN minister.i saw the noise with the minister and decided not to go on the flight as One PTI worker was yelling— Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik) September 16, 2014
Interestingly, after deciding not to travel on PK-370, Malik boarded PK-300, another Islamabad-bound flight, which too started 50 minutes late.
am now leaving by pk 300 and now in the plane.50 minutes delay has been announced who shd be blamed for this delay.PIA or me?Obviously PIA— Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik) September 16, 2014

Three novels explain why it is so hard to get justice for rape victimsNote: This post discusses the plots of “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,” “The Interestings,” and “Open City” in some detail.
“Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage” by Haruki Murakami (Credit: Knopf)
Writing in the New Republic this week, Judith Shulevitz suggested  that “rape has never been as widely condemned as it is in the United States today. Obviously, too many people are still too confused about what rape is and too many women still don’t feel safe reporting it to the police.” Many of our discussions about public policy and sexual culture come with suggestions about how we might remedy these two grave and ongoing problems, including affirmative consent laws , consent education  and faster processing of rape kits .
While these sorts of conversations assume that we can reach a place of collective clarity, three extraordinary novels released in the past three years are more interested in the sort of uncertainties we hope we might be able to banish.
“Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage ,” the most recent novel from Haruki Murakami, “ The Interestings ,” by Meg Wolitzer and Teju Cole’s debut novel, “ Open City ,” all involve adult protagonists grappling with accusations of sexual assault from their youth. Each book has a slightly different arc. But each provides a powerful portrait of why people might refuse to seek out and accept the truth about a rape allegation.
In “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki,” the titular character, now in his 30s, begins to investigate why his exceptionally close group of high school friends dropped him shortly after they all started college. The answer his former acquaintances give him is intensely disturbing: Shiro, one of the girls in the group, accused Tsukuru of raping her.
The accusation is false. And because Shiro has died by the time Tsukuru begins to revisit the rupture in his friendship, neither he nor Murakami really investigate why she accused Tsukuru in the first place. Instead, “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki” explores why their friends sided with Shiro and cut Tsukuru off without giving him a chance to explain himself.
Tsukuru’s old friend Ao tells him that despite discrepancies in Shiro’s story, he felt certain that something bad had happened to her. “It was so detailed, what she told us, that we figured there had to be some truth to it,” Ao says, apologizing to Tsukuru for not asking for his side of the story.
Eri, the other girl in the group, is blunter in her reasoning, explaining to Tsukuru that she knew from the beginning that the accusation was false. “I had to protect her,” Eri explains to Tsukuru. “And in order to do that, I had to cut you off. It was impossible to protect you and protect her at the same time. I had to accept one of you completely, and reject the other entirely.” Believing that Tsukuru was better-equipped to survive the loss of his friends, Eri chose to take care of Shiro instead.
Meg Wolitzer’s “The Interestings” tackles a similar subject — how a group of friends decides what the truth is when one friend accuses another member of the circle of sexual assault — but with significant differences. In “The Interestings,” the friends do not reach consensus on whether or not Goodman Wolf, the troubled brother of Ash Wolf, raped his ex-girlfriend Cathy Kiplinger. And Goodman is not expelled from the group: rather, he skips town to avoid his trial.
For Jules Jacobson, the novel’s protagonist and Ash’s best friend, Cathy’s accusation forces less a choice between two friends than between convenient amnesia and the potentially discomforting search for the truth.
“Cathy had been strong and believable in the coffee shop, but Jules couldn’t hold on to her words,” Wolitzer writes. “If she held on to them, if she remembered them and completely absorbed them, then she might not have still been lingering around the Labyrinth.”
Voicing a belief in Goodman’s innocence, and later, keeping the secret that Goodman is in touch with Ash and her family, become the price Jules must pay for access to Ash’s world. This is not an admirable choice, but Wolitzer makes us see why Jules  made it: the best way for Jules to become a Wolf is for her to take on their most terrible secret, their most unpopular opinion, and to validate it for them.
It is only years later that Jules is able to have an open conversation with Ash’s husband, Ethan, about her decision to stifle her own doubts.
“He couldn’t imagine that she didn’t want to keep doing what they were doing,” Ethan tells Jules. “No one ever felt that way about him; everyone was charmed, at least at camp they were. It was that, plus maybe Cathy’s neediness. A bad combination. So, yeah, I would safely say he did something. I think he did it.”
The rapist who does not know the violence he does is an unsettling figure. Is he, as some public figures might suggest, the creation of women who have consensual sex they regret and want to paint themselves as victims? Is he the tragic result of our failure to educate boys and men on what it really means to consent? Literature suggests that he is less easily explained away and eradicated than either of these perspectives might expect.
Such a figure shows up in “Open City” in the form of Julius, a young psychiatrist who is about to go into practice on his own. During the events of the novel, Julius reconnects with Moji, a young woman he first got to know when they were both teenagers in Nigeria. Toward the end of “Open City,” Julius learns that something more than nostalgia has brought Moji back into his life.
“She said that, in late 1989, when she was fifteen and I was a year younger, at a party her brother had hosted at their house in Ikoyi, I had forced myself on her,” Julius recounts. “I had acted like I knew nothing about it, had even forgotten her, to the point of not recognizing her when we met again, and had never tried to acknowledge what I had done..But it hadn’t been like that for her, she said, the luxury of denial had not been possible for her.”
Cole does not address how it is possible that Julius and Moji have such wildly different memories. Nor does he try to determine which one of them is correct in their recollections or lack thereof.
But Julius’s behavior in the final act of the novel suggests that he is capable of the seeming amnesia Moji describes: Julius boxes up their disturbing conversation and gets on with arranging his new office and purchasing tickets to the symphony. If Moji is correct about this aspect of Julius’s character, it seems possible that she is correct about what passed between them. The fact of this blank in Julius’s memory is more frightening than any confirmation of his guilt could possibly be. It is terrifying to think that the event that shattered one person’s life could be utterly forgettable to another.
It is undoubtedly a good thing that, as Traister notes, rape is so roundly condemned. These three novels suggest, however, that there is a cost to that consensus. As sexual assault comes to be seen as a more serious crime, the incentives to deny such charges utterly or to believe them without question become much higher.
Hurting Tsukuru did not get Shiro the justice she deserved from the real culprit who attacked her. Preserving Ash’s belief in her brother embedded a lie at the heart of Ash and Jules’s friendship. And whatever psychological barriers Julius placed between himself and his memories of Moji did not make her pain go away. Even if the law had resolved all three cases fairly and clearly, the characters in these novels still might have done great injury to each other. There is no public policy solution for the complications of the conscience.

Addressing two additional legal rationales for Obamas war against ISISBy Ilya Somin September 16
In previous posts , I addressed some of the most common arguments justifying President Obama’s decision to launch a large-scale military campaign against ISIS without getting any new authorization from Congress.
Over the last few days, defenders of the President’s position have advanced some new arguments, as well as refinements of the old ones. In this post, cover the most important of these. Some of them are much better than the administration’s own reliance on the 2001 AUMF. But none actually work.
I. Defense Against Attack.
Perhaps the strongest of the newer arguments for Obama’s decision is Michael Ramsey’s theory that he does not need congressional authorization because he is merely responding to the intiation of war by ISIS, including a seeming declaration of war against the US by that organization.
Most experts agree that the president does not need congressional authorization to fight war in response to an attack by external enemies. And, as the war with al Qaeda demonstrates, the enemy in question need not be a state actor. Ramsey is also correct to argue that the president can wage war against a foreign power in response to a declaration of war against the United States by that country – even if the nation in question has not yet launched an actual military attack against the US large enough to qualify as a war under other circumstances.
The self-defense theory has several virtues. It does not rely on a strained interpretation of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or the 2002 Iraq AUMF. And unlike John Yoo’s theory of executive war powers , it does not give the president blanket authority to initiate new wars on his own.
But the idea nonetheless has some real flaws. ISIS’ atrocities in beheading two American journalists and holding a few other Americans hostage are horrendous . But it’s hard to argue they are an attack against the US on a large enough scale to count as a war. Serial murderers such as Ted Bundy and the Unabomber probably killed as many or more Americans than ISIS did before Obama ordered air strikes against it (like ISIS, the Unabomber even did it for political reasons). The same is true of quite a few pre-9/11 foreign terrorists. Yet few claim that their actions amount to initiating a war against the United States.
As for ISIS’ declaration of war, it might indeed be enough to give the president authority to wage war in response if issued by an internationally recognized state. But issued by a mere terrorist organization, it does not rise to the same level. Otherwise, the president would have the authority to launch a full-scale war without congressional authorization any time some small group of crazies issue a statement claiming that they are at war with the US. The president might have the authority to wage war against it if the group launched a large scale attack comparable to 9/11 or was imminently threatening to do so. But a terrorist group cannot trigger that power merely by issuing a statement or killing a very small number of people. The president can use law enforcement measures and small-scale military attacks in such cases, but not initiate a full-scale war without congressional authorization.
II. Continuity Between ISIS and al Qaeda.
Famed Harvard law professor (and former Obama administration official) Cass Sunstein argues that Obama’s air strikes are authorized by the 2001 AUMF against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. The 2001 AUMF is limited to “those nations, organizations, or persons [the president] determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.”
An organization that did not even exist in 2001 and is currently an enemy of al Qaeda’s seems to fall outside that definition. Moreover, as Bruce Ackerman points out, the 2001 AUMF was deliberately drafted more narrowly than the Bush administration wanted, in order to deny the president the power to wage an open-ended war against any and all potentially threatening terrorists. But, Sunstein argues that ISIS is nonetheless close enough to al Qaeda to come within the scope of the 2001 AUMF:
No one doubts that the AUMF authorizes the president to fight people who have joined al-Qaeda. It’s also clear that the president can use force against any group that links itself to al-Qaeda, at least if it can be considered part of the same “organization…..”
In light of Islamic State’s close working relationship with al-Qaeda, the president could “determine” that it was essentially part of the group in 2004 and for a significant period thereafter. Indeed, Islamic State has often been described as “al-Qaeda in Iraq,” and it has reportedly been subject to al-Qaeda’s direction and control.
Last February, however, al-Qaeda publicly dissociated itself from Islamic State, partly because of Islamic State’s brutality, including beheadings. So now the question is: Does this mean that Islamic State can no longer be treated as part of an “organization” responsible for the attacks of 9/11, such that the president cannot act (in the words of the AUMF) “to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States”?
Skeptics may think so, but it’s hard to see why. Imagine that in 2012, al-Qaeda split into two organizations: the original one and a new, more brutal group with a new name. Under the AUMF, the president would plainly have the authority to use force against both.
True, the Islamic State situation is not precisely the same, because it has always had its own name and identity. But if it was part of al-Qaeda for a significant period, it’s not easy to argue that al-Qaeda’s announcement of dissociation last February (for excessive brutality, no less) suddenly deprives the president of the authority he had in January. Keep in mind that the group insists it is the true inheritor of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.
If ISIS really were just a part of al Qaeda that later broke off, Sunstein’s analysis would be correct. But, as he recognizes, it has always had its own name and identity, and relations between the two groups had always been tense , even before their official break in February.
Using the 2001 AUMF to attack a separate group that had previously aided AQ and had a loose affiliation with it, but is now an enemy, seems a huge stretch. By that standard, FDR or Truman could have used the declaration of war against Nazi Germany to attack Franco’s Spain in 1945. After all, Franco’s regime and Hitler’s had similar ideologies, and had been allies in the past. German and Italian troops helped Franco win the Spanish Civil War, and Franco returned the favor by sending troops to aid the German war effort during World War II. The fact that he withdrew his troops in 1943 and later broke with Hitler would not have mattered any more than al Qaeda’s break with ISIS matters.
In a world where there are often connections between different nations and terrorist groups that are hostile to the US, Sunstein’s theory amounts to a rule that authorizing war against any one of them means authorizing a war against all of them. It may sometimes be good policy to start wars with the ideological soulmates and former friends of our enemies. But such action requires congressional authorization. That is not only the best legal standard, but also a valuable safeguard against potential presidential overreaching.
In this case, I think President Obama is right to target ISIS. But his actions are a dangerous precedent for the future. In general, it is best to have a broad consensus before embarking on war . The constitutional requirement of congressional authorization helps ensure that.

This robotic tentacle blows up like bubble gum to moveBy Rachel Feltman September 16 Follow @rachelfeltman
The octopus-inspired robot, made using 3-D printed molds, moves by inflating and deflating its segments. (Tom Buehler, MIT CSAIL)
Inspired by octopus tentacles, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)'s latest robot is as squishy as can be. It's a so-called " soft robot ," meaning it lacks any hard mechanical pieces. In this case, the bot is made entirely of silicon rubber, poured into 3-D printed molds.
The tentacle features hollow chambers on either side of each of its segments. To move the bot, the CSAIL team pumps pressurized air into one side or another. As the silicon segments blow up like bubble gum, they're pushed in different directions to produce snake-like movements, which let the tentacle curve around corners.
Like other soft robots, this tentacle has potential in search and rescue missions -- where debris might make traditional robots prone to damage, or simple unable to squeeze through -- and for work with humans and animals, who might be injured by the hard edges of other bots.
The algorithm that controls the robot could eventually allow it to snake through pipes without a human pilot. Instead of needing constant direction, the tentacle would know how to move its body based on the shape of its environment. CSAIL engineers also hope to give a future version of the robot the ability to grip and move objects.

Some bald men may be at a greater risk of devloping aggressive prostate cancerMen with male pattern baldness who experience hair loss in both the crown and front of their heads at age 45 are more likely to develop an aggressive form of prostate cancer later in life, a new study found.

Both prostate cancer  and the very specific pattern of baldness may be related to increased levels of male sex hormones and receptors. This study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , further supports a potential link between the two conditions; there was no link between other patterns of baldness and aggressive prostate cancer.
The study used data from the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which studied 39,070 men between ages 55 and 74. Participants were asked to recall what type of hair-loss patterns they experienced at 45.
Subsequently, 1,138 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and about half of those cases were aggressive. Men with this pattern of baldness at 45 were 40 percent more likely to develop a form of aggressive prostate cancer, which usually means faster tumor growth.
"Our study found an increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer only in men with a very specific pattern of hair loss, baldness at the front and moderate hair-thinning on the crown of the head, at the age of 45. But we saw no increased risk for any form of prostate cancer in men with other hair-loss patterns," the study's lead author, Michael B. Cook, said in a statement.
Cook, an investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute, added: "While our data show a strong possibility for a link between the development of baldness and aggressive prostate cancer, it's too soon to apply these findings to patient care."
After skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And an estimated 233,000 men will be diagnosed with the cancer this year, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology . The risk of prostate cancer increases with age and is genetically linked.
It may also be linked to high levels of male hormones, called androgens, which promote prostate cell growth, according to the ASCO.

Systematic investing can help you move from the sidelinesSystematic investing can help you move from the sidelines
Hemant Rustagi        Last Updated: October 21, 2014  | 19:06 IST

Hemant Rustagi, CEO, Wiseinvest Advisors
The stock market has been doing well over the past year or so. However, investors' reaction to this phenomenal run has been mixed. On the one hand, there is a small section that has been investing in equities and is willing to commit more, on the other hand there is a large section of investors that has been waiting on the sidelines faced with the dilemma of whether to invest or not. The trend highlights retail investors' apathy towards this wonderful asset class that has the potential to perform better than other asset classes and provide positive real rate of return over the longer term.  
One of the reasons that have kept retail investors away from equities is their lack of faith in the sustainability of returns. Their not-so-good past experiences and the volatile nature of the stock market makes them vary of taking the plunge. As a result, they have missed out on the initial part of the rally.
The truth is that a combination of systematic investing and long-term approach can ensure investment success for every equity investor. While the long-term approach helps in negating the impact of short- and medium-term volatility on the portfolio, a disciplined investment strategy ensures that one doesn't commit too much at a particular market level.
It is also important for investors to choose the right medium of investing in equities. For a common investor, mutual funds have proved to be a better option and continue to be so.
For this very reason, it is always recommended that individual investors, who want to build wealth through smaller contributions, should invest through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).
It is heartening to see a steady increase in the number of investors following this wonderful approach. However, the overall number still remains disappointing. In fact, even those who start investing in equity funds after careful planning and commitment to invest regularly are often found guilty of putting a halt to their investment process abruptly, especially when they are faced with adverse market conditions.
It is not to say that one should not make lump sum investment in equity funds. It's just that a disciplined approach takes away emotions from your investment process. In fact, a combination of a lump sum and systematic investing produces the best results for long-term investors.  
If you are one of those investors who have stayed away from investing in equity funds so far, it's time for you to make up your mind and begin your investment process through SIP.
However, make sure you don't start investing in equity funds because the stock market still has a lot of steam left. You should invest in equity funds with an objective to achieve your long-term goals such as children's education and your retirement planning. When you invest for a time horizon of 10-15 years, you don't have to bother about the current market levels.
Remember, too much of experimentation and adhocism can spell disaster for your equity fund portfolio. Also, don't make the mistake of thinking that a systematic investment approach alone can get you healthy returns.
There are a few other factors that require your attention for your portfolio to do well. Here are some of these factors and how your need to tackle them:
Be sure about how much you can invest through SIP: Investors often make the mistake of starting their investment process without having a clear idea of how much they can invest every month. Many a time, in their effort to make up for the lost time, they start investing a larger sum every month that they find it difficult to continue after sometime. In the process, they stop investing and hence interrupt their long-term wealth building process. Therefore, you must start conservatively and gradually increase the amount to ensure continuity. Budgeting can go a long way in ensuring this.
Invest for the longterm: It is quite common to see investors signing for SIP for a year or so even while investing in equity funds. While some investors do so thinking that they will renew it every year, there are others who want to see how it works and then take a long-term call. The problem is that when they assess the performance of their investment through SIP after one year or so, they often feel disappointed especially when the markets are in the midst of a volatile phase. Surely, this is an illogical way of assessing not only the performance of an asset class like equity but also the effectiveness of a powerful mechanism like SIP. The right way would be to have a clearly defined long-term time horizon right at the beginning so that you don't feel compelled to abandon this process during the tougher times. This alone can go a long way in maximising your return as investments made at lower levels will improve your long-term returns.
Choose the right funds: It is important to invest in well-diversified funds even while investing through SIP. Although volatility in the stock market helps investors in benefiting from averaging, investing a significant part of the portfolio in aggressive funds like pure mid-cap funds, thematic and sector funds may not be a good idea just because they tend to be more volatile than their well-diversified counterparts. Remember, too much aggression in the portfolio doesn't guarantee higher return. In fact, it can expose you to higher risk and derail your investment process. Of course, it makes sense for a long-term investor to have some exposure to mid-cap segment of the market. However, the bread and butter of the portfolio should be large cap or large cap oriented funds. Therefore, investing in multi-cap funds can be the answer to this dilemma as the fund manager has the flexibility of rebalancing the allocation depending on which segment of the market  he thinks will do well going forward.
Opt for growth option while investing through SIP: The power of compounding works out the best when you invest for the long-term and allow the gains to remain invested. Taking out money at a regular interval, say every year, by way of dividend, would defeat the very purpose and hence the results are likely to be disappointing. Therefore, you must opt for "growth" option.
As is evident, a disciplined approach can help you tackle the dilemma of when to start investing in equity funds. If you follow the guidelines, nothing can stop you from achieving your long-term goals.

Precious metals to trade lower in coming fortnightPrecious metals to trade lower, oil prices to trade higher in coming fortnight

Fortnightly Performance 
Non-Agri Commodities  
On a fortnightly basis, global markets traded on a positive note on the back of optimistic economic growth in the US, the world's largest economy showing signs of progress. Further, news of a cease fire agreement between Russia and Ukraine eased geopolitical concerns, which supported an upside in the markets. During the end of the fortnight, markets corrected as the European Central Bank (ECB) unexpectedly cut key interest rates to an all-time low.
On the domestic front, markets traded higher as a result of inflow of foreign funds in equities and debt markets totaling $30.6 billion in the current year. The Indian rupee appreciated by around 0.2 per cent owing to domestic equities reaching an all-time high levels. Further, optimistic economic growth in Q2 of 2014 along with selling of dollars by custodian banks acted as a positive factor. However, strength in the dollar index and rise in the Current Account Deficit (CAD) for (April-June'14) capped a sharp upside movement in the Indian rupee.  
In the non-agri commodities space, spot gold prices largely traded in a negative territory as economic data released from the US signals growth in the economy. The Conference Board's measure of U.S. consumer confidence rose more than expected in August, hitting its highest level since October 2007. Separately, orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods posted their biggest gain on record in July. In the ECB meeting held on September 5, the ECB unexpectedly cut already ultra-low interest rates by another 10 basis points and said the central bank would start purchasing securitized loans and covered bonds next month. The ECB is under strong pressure to tackle stubbornly low inflation at a time when the conflict in Ukraine threatens to destabilise the region's fragile recovery. Also, the metal was under pressure after Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined plans for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine's prime minister later dismissed the proposal as Russia's attempt to deceive the West on the eve of a NATO summit. Overall, spot gold prices declined by around two per cent in the last fortnight, while MCX gold prices declined by around 1.2 per cent.
Spot silver prices traded lower in line with weakness in gold prices and declined by around two per cent last fortnight. Strength in the dollar index, coupled with profit booking at higher levels, acted as a negative factor. On the MCX, silver prices fell one per cent.
During the last fortnight, LME Copper prices traded lower by around two per cent as weak manufacturing data and an investigation of the power grid in China raised concerns about the outlook for demand from the world's top metals consumer. Also, Newmont Mining Corp planned to resume copper concentrate exports this week, thereby fuelling investor concern that further supplies were coming to the market. However, signs of strengthening economic recovery in the U.S., the world's second-biggest consumer of industrial metals, restricted a sharp fall. Further, miner and metals trader Glencore forecasted strong demand for copper from both China and the West in the latter part of this year along with the ECB cutting interest rates, freeing up capital for industry and investors supported gains. MCX copper prices have fallen by 0.2 per cent in the oast fifteen days.
 
Crude oil prices traded higher in the past fortnight although manufacturing growth has faltered in Europe and China at a time of ample supply. The risk of production setbacks remained high in Libya where the government has lost control of most of the capital. In the euro zone, manufacturing growth slowed more than expected last month and factory activity in several key countries appeared to be stagnating. French factory output fell at its fastest pace in 15 months in August. Chinese factory growth slipped to a three-month low in August as foreign and domestic demand cooled, and the country's huge construction sector is also seeing a slowdown, muddying the outlook for demand. Overall, WTI oil prices gained marginally by around one per cent and MCX crude oil gained by around 1.1 per cent.
Outlook
In the coming fortnight, we expect precious metals to trade lower as the economic data released from the US is indicating that growth is evident in the country. Besides, prospects of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine will also exert downside pressure.
Crude oil prices will trade higher on bargain buying at lower levels. Good economic data from the US will lead to increased demand for crude acting as a positive factor.
Base metals are likely to trade sideways as strong improvement in the US labour market will support metals demands. Also, monetary easing by the ECB will support gains. On the other hand, serious concerns regarding the power grid company in China will act as a negative factor.
Agri Commodities
 
*Price performance as on 4th September 2014, at 5.00 pm.
With improving rains and narrowing kharif sowing deficit, almost the entire agri commodities basket remained negative to bearish over the last fortnight. However, for the season as a whole, rains continue to remain below normal.
As per the data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the cumulative rainfall for the season till September 4 was 14 per cent below normal at 635 mm compared to a normal of 741.7 mm. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kharif sowing as on September 4 was reported 3.35 percent lower at 98.66 mn ha as against 102.08 mn ha during the corresponding period last year. Sowing of pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals declined by 6.2 per cent, 8.2 per cent and 9.1 per cent while that of cotton increased 9.4 per cent, respectively.
Water levels in the 85 major reservoirs are below last year's levels but higher than the 10-year average. As per the latest data available from the Central Water Commission, the levels in the reservoirs were reported at 110.5224 billion cubic metres as against a full capacity of 155.046 billion cubic metres.   
NCDEX has postponed the launch of future contracts coriander and castor seed 1 MT (Jan '15), chilli (March '15) and turmeric (April '15). The exchange has also decided not to offer futures contracts in gur expiring March 2015 onwards till further notice.
The edible oilseed complex witnessed a steep fall in prices due to weak global edible oil prices and improving rainfall. Soybean declined 7.9 per cent tracking a pickup in sowing, good rains in the soybean regions, poor soy meal export demand and weak overseas markets. Soy oil and CPO declined 2.1 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, taking cues from weak global edible prices. Appreciation in the rupee also added to the downside pressure. Mustard seed was the only gainer in agri-commodities, posting two per cent returns on good demand for mustard meal exports and declining arrival pressure. However, weak soybean prices capped the upside.
Among spices, turmeric was the biggest loser with 3.8 per cent losses due to higher sowing in Telangana and weak demand in the spot markets. Jeera lost 2.5 per cent on sluggish demand from overseas buyers as well as huge carryover stocks. However, lower-level buying and demand from China supported prices. Coriander declined 1.3 per cent on sluggish domestic demand and lack of fresh export orders at higher levels.
Among soft commodities , sugar prices largely remained weak on sluggish physical demand, abundant supplies, selling pressure from the mills and weak overseas markets and settled 1.7 per cent lower. Cotton resumed its southward journey after witnessing short covering last month and declined 3.9 per cent. Prices continued to decline on higher sowing, favorable climatic conditions and expectations of a record output. Bearish sentiment in the global cotton market also added to the downside pressure on prices in the domestic markets.  
Chana futures gained initially on lower-level buying and festive demand. However, prices declined sharply from higher levels and lost 3.6 per cent on comfortable stocks due to a record output in the 2013/14 season.
Outlook
In the coming fortnight we expect most agri commodities to remain weak as improved rains and narrowing sowing deficit may keep prices in check. Agri commodities prices in global markets also are in bearishness due to good rains, favorable climatic conditions and the spillover effect can be seen in the domestic markets. However, no sharp downside movement is seen as demand is expected to emerge at lower levels ahead of the upcoming festive season. Prices are also likely to take cues from movement in the overseas agri commodity prices as well as the Indian rupee.
Also, the monsoon season is in the last month and now we need to carefully track the start of withdrawal of monsoons. Delayed withdrawal or unseasonal rains may lead to crop damage. Prices are also expected to take cues from market estimates of kharif output by the government as well as various private forecasters.

Mastek to demerge insurance business
Special Correspondent
insurance
Mastek, a leading player in the IT space, said it would demerge its insurance products and services business into a new company, Majesco. This will be followed by the transfer of the offshore insurance operations business by Majesco to a step-down subsidiary Majesco Software Solutions Private Ltd. (MSS India), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MajescoMastek Insurance Software and Solutions Inc.
Addressing a press conference, Sudhakar Ram, Managing Director & CEO, Mastek, said Mastek shareholders would get one equity share of Majesco for every equity share held in Mastek. Majesco is to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange where Mastek shares are already listed.
For Mastek, insurance constitutes around 55 per cent of business, government around 26 per cent with other verticals being financial services and retail. The insurance products and services business had revenue of Rs.507 crore in 2014 while the vertical solutions revenue was Rs.416 crore.
Mr. Ram said the insurance business had a customer base of more than 80 in the U.S. “Majesco is well positioned to gain a large share in the growing U.S. insurance market, and will pursue organic / inorganic opportunities.”
The scheme is subject to approval of the High Courts of Bombay and Gujarat, shareholders, and creditors of Mastek and SEBI.
The restructuring provided an opportunity for shareholders to participate in the businesses of their choice based on their risk-reward profile, Mr. Ram said, adding “it will facilitate businesses to independently pursue their growth plans through organic / inorganic means and will enhance management focus and operational flexibility.”
On the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, Mastek stock closed up 15.33 per cent at Rs.270.45.

US rate hike fears hit market as Sensex, Nifty fall most in 7 weeks

Mumbai: In their worst single-day drop in nearly 7 weeks, Sensex plunged 324 points to 26,492.51 and Nifty tanked 109 points to 7,932.90 on negative cues from jittery global markets before the US Federal Reserve's much-awaited monetary policy meeting that starts later on Tuesday.
An earlier-than-anticipated rate hike by Fed could lead to outflows, hurting emerging markets as the incentive for investors to seek higher yields stands reduced. Major markets in Asia ended down and Europe was weak in morning trades. Domestic investors also took money off the table in recent out-performers in sectors including realty, banking, consumer durables and oil & gas. All the 12 BSE sectoral indices ended in the red.
Smallcap and midcap stocks, which in previous sessions had bucked a weak trend, saw a huge sell-off with their indices falling over 3 per cent each.

#sensex #bse #nse #nifty
The 30-share Sensex after resuming higher at 26,854.90, improved to 26,861.29. However, it succumbed to widespread selling in blue-chips and slipped to day's low of 26,464.03, before ending at 26,492.51 -- down 324.05 points, or 1.21 per cent. This is its worst drop since August 1 when Sensex had plummeted 414.13 points. Tuesday's closing is also its weakest since August 26 (26,442.81).
Among major laggards, Tata Power suffered the most by plunging 5.85 per cent. Others include Tata Steel, Hindalco, NTPC, Tata Motors, ONGC, RIL, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and L&T. Bucking the trend, stocks of Dr Reddy, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys gained.
The 50-share Nifty dropped 109.10 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close below 8,000 mark at 7,932.90 after moving between 8,044.90 and 7,925.15 intra-day. Tuesday's drop is also Nifty's worst show since August 1 when it fell 118.70 points.
"Market players will be looking for clues on the timing of the first US rate hike in more than eight years. Consensus is that the Fed will hike interest rates next year and it may declare the timelines today," said HDFC Securities in a note.
Sectorally, the BSE Realty sector index suffered the most by losing 3.42 per cent, followed by Power down 3.26 per cent, Capital Goods 2.70 per cent and Oil & Gas 2.67 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 74.59 crore on Monday as per provisional data. issued by stock exchanges.

Inside #22Kill  a star-studded campaign to fight veteran suicideBy Dan Lamothe September 16 Follow @danlamothe
Michael Jernigan, a Marine Corps veteran and wounded warrior, poses for a photograph with actor and military consultant R. Lee Ermey, who starred in the movie “Full Metal Jacket.” Photo courtesy Honor Courage Commitment Inc.)
When Michael Jernigan medically retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 as a corporal, it was less than two years after an improvised explosive device blast in Iraq on Aug. 22, 2004, had taken both of his eyes and left him disfigured.
“I was one of those guys who didn’t come home whole,” he said. “I did 30 surgeries in the first 12 months.”
Jernigan struggled at first to determine what he’d do next. But he eventually attended college, graduating from the University of Southern Florida St. Petersburg in 2012 before joining an organization that is now in the middle of a social media awareness campaign that has captured the attention of not only military service members and veterans, but a variety of celebrities who have showed solidarity with them.
It’s called #22Kill, a nod toward a jarring statistic: About 22 military veterans commit suicide each day, according to a report released last year by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The majority are committed by veterans who are at least 50 years old, the VA said, but suicides in the active-duty ranks and by recent veterans have hit close to home for individuals like Jernigan, who have served alongside them.
The campaign was launched by Honor Courage Commitment Inc., a non-profit organization focused on helping veterans transition into civilian life. It began last year, but saw a resurgence in September, which is Suicide Prevention Month.
“It kind of just really began as a conversation,” said Jernigan, director of program development for the organization. “Someone brought up the statistic, and we really found it staggering. We wanted to bring awareness to that, because we figured with awareness comes prevention.”
The organization was started by Andrew Nguyen, who left the Marine Corps as a staff sergeant and served as an infantryman in Afghanistan. It promotes veterans getting a college degree, finding professional mentors and doing community service after they get out of the military. Too much rhetoric about recent veterans focuses on post-traumatic stress, rather than what they can offer, Nguyen said.
There are two main pieces to the #22Kill initiative , he said. In one, participants wear a black “Honor Ring” on their right index finger as a means of showing support for the military. That is sometimes combined with the second piece, which calls for individuals to push out 22 pushups out of respect for those who have served.
“I wanted a universal sign where I could see someone across the room and say, ‘That dude has got my back, and I’m going to go over and shake his hand,’” Nguyen said of the ring.
R. Lee Ermey (pictured above), who played the infamous gunnery sergeant in the movie “Full Metal Jacket,” is among those who have shown support for the initiative.
Others include outfielder Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets:

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks were little changed on Tuesday, though energy stocks were up for a second session as crude prices edged higher.
Traders eyed a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting which begins Tuesday for clues on the short-term direction of U.S. interest rates. The Fed will release a statement Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) and a news conference will follow.
"The big news comes (Wednesday) from the Fed and we'll work our way a bit lower before the announcement. Key points will likely suggest the Fed stays on hold until the middle of next year and that is already baked in," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.86 points, or 0.02 percent, to 17,035, the S&P 500 gained 2.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,986.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.57 points, or 0.08 percent, to 4,522.47.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Glimcher Realty, which jumped 30.41 percent, after Washington Prime announced the purchase of Glimcher for $4.3 billion. The largest percentage decliner was Atlantic Power , down 33.07 percent after it said it would replace its CEO and slash its dividend.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Glimcher, Bank of America which rose 0.12 percent to $16.76, and Petrobras, which gained 4.05 percent to $17.21.
Nasdaq's most active included Apple , down 1.3 percent to $100.29; Yahoo , down 1.5 percent to $41.93 and Facebook , unchanged at $74.60.
Advancing issues were outnumbering declining ones on the NYSE by 1,411 to 1,302, for a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,150 issues were rising and 1,113 falling for a 1.03-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The broad S&P 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 6 new highs and 45 new lows.

Trump Plaza closes  making it official: A third of Atlantic Citys casinos have closed this yearBy Mark Berman September 16 Follow @markberman
Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino has permanently closed its doors, making it the fourth Atlantic City casino to go belly-up this year. (Reuters)
A year of decay and decline continues to eat away at Atlantic City’s famed boardwalk, as another of the city’s casinos shut down Tuesday.
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino has closed up shop. In a rather remarkable illustration of Atlantic City’s downswing, this is the fourth casino to close in the city this year, costing thousands of people their jobs. Atlantic City began the year with 12 casinos, but a third of those have closed — and a fifth casino, Trump Taj Mahal, is expected to shut down in November .
When Trump Plaza — then known as Harrah’s at Trump Plaza — opened in May 1984, it became the 10th casino in Atlantic City. As the New York Times wrote at the time:
Analysts and rival casino executives agree the demand for gambling on the East Coast can accommodate at least the new casino and three more under construction, so long as their openings are not too close together.
”The growth potential is too large for the Trump opening to hurt the rest of us,” the executive vice president of Resorts International, H. Steven Norton, said. ”More casinos and more entertainment will only make Atlantic City a more attractive destination.”
Three decades later, after considerable churn in Atlantic City, several casinos opening and closing, billions of dollars gambled and lost, it is clear that Atlantic City’s gambling industry is on the decline . Casino revenue has been cut in half since 2006. (That is not a problem across the industry, as Nevada’s gaming revenue has been flat or even increased since 2010 .)
Instead, Atlantic City is simply no longer a gambling mecca for people along the Northeast Corridor and beyond. Other states have opened casinos, with Maryland and Pennsylvania, among others , offering gaming options that may entice travelers who would have otherwise made their way to Atlantic City’s boardwalk.
Trump Plaza was not exactly Revel, a gleaming jewel billed as a “turning point for Atlantic City” before closing down two years later . It was a 30-year-old workhorse of a casino that was  nearly sold last year to a company in California, before investor Carl Icahn said he would not allow the sale to proceed because he felt the price ($20 million) was too low.
The casino’s problems were evident this year. It was one of six casinos that posted a loss in the first six months of 2014, with the second-biggest loss in that window ($7.4 million) of any casino (trailing Revel, which lost $46 million ). That was up considerably from the $1.2 million it lost during the first six months of 2013.
Donald Trump, whose name adorns the newly closed casino, filed a lawsuit this year seeking to have his name removed from it. Trump does not run Trump Entertainment Resorts, but he does retain a 10 percent stake in the company. Among other things, this lawsuit expressed a concern that the casino closures could “further harm the Trump name and brand.” The lawsuit offered a timely bookend to what happened not long after Trump Plaza opened, when an argument over the facility’s name also  spilled into court.
(On Tuesday morning, the shuttered casino’s namesake also chimed in on Twitter, making sure people know he “ left Atlantic City Years ago ” and musing about jumping back in “to save” the closed Trump Plaza and its soon-to-be-shuttered cousin, Trump Taj Mahal.)
Trump Plaza’s closure comes not long after Revel Casino Hotel and Showboat ceased operations . These closings may also have odd, unintended side effects that can be felt far from the boardwalk. Revel, the $2.4-billion resort-casino destination that opened just two years ago,  shut down this month . Six days later, TMZ released footage  captured inside one of Revel’s elevators earlier this year showing Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens running back, punching his now-wife Janay in the face. This footage caused an uproar, leading to Rice’s suspension and a big outcry over how the NFL treats cases of domestic violence.
We cannot say for sure whether the closure of the casino had anything to do with TMZ’s ability to obtain the elevator footage. (TMZ did not respond to a request for comment after the video was released.) After all, the site also released security footage showing Rice dragging her out of the elevator in February, back when the incident occurred and when Revel was still open. But the timing was still curious, raising the question of whether the latest video came from someone who no longer had to weigh the financial benefits of releasing the video (TMZ openly pays for footage ) against keeping their job.
The next casino expected to close, Trump Taj Mahal, is likely to shutter by Nov. 13 . That venue lost $1.3 million during the first six months of this year, a significant drop from the $12.6 million in profit it made during the same period last year. Trump Entertainment Resorts, which emerged from its last bankruptcy in 2010, has also announced that it has filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware. By mid-November, barring something unexpected, the company will have no more casinos to operate.

BJP s polarisation strategy fails in UP  SP makes a comeback  Congress recovers in bypollsSep 16, 2014 at  10:02pm IST
BJP's polarisation strategy fails in UP, SP makes a comeback, Congress recovers in bypolls

Just months after its biggest ever victory in the Lok Sabha polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday faced a big jolt when the results of bypolls in 32 Assembly and 3 Lok Sabha seats was announced.
The BJP's polarisation formula seems to have worked in favour of its opponent Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. In a big shock to the BJP, of the 11 Assembly seats that went to polls in Uttar Pradesh, BJP won only three. While it was bitter for the BJP, the results were sweet for the Samajwadi Party which won 8 of the 11 seats. The BJP had won all seats in the last Assembly elections.
As the results were announced, BJP's star campaigner in the state Yogi Adityanath took a defensive stand and claimed that he was not allowed to campaign on all the seats that went to polls in the state. He even went ahead and blamed the Election Commission for being unfair in the treatment that was meted out to him.

#bypolls #bjp #congress #sp
While the BJP thought of enticing the voters through polarisation, the SP did not allow its senior party Azam Khan to campaign and divide the voters on communal lines.
Meanwhile, the Congress did not miss taking jibes at the BJP saying that within 100 days of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule, people have started voting for a 'Modi-free India". "Campaign creativity is evident by the fact that despite many existing issues in UP, precedence was given to fictional ones like love jihad," Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said.
Party leader Rashid Alvi also mocked the BJP saying that the reverses for the party was a "victory" of secularism in the country as people from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh have voted against communalism.
"It is befitting reply from the voters. They have shown people like Adityanath and Sakshi Maharaj the door," SP leader Gaurav Bhatia said.
"It is very easy to be communal but very difficult to be secular," Bhatia said as he quoted UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's ideology.
As questions were being raised about the central leadership, the BJP said that the results are not a referendum on the Central government. "These results are not a referendum on the Central government. They were fought totally on local level issues. The results have given us an opportunity to correct local level shortcomings and will definitely help us win the coming state assembly elections," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
In what could be a warning sign for the BJP, the Congress has regained some ground in Gujarat winning 3 of 9 seats. The BJP though has successfully won the remaining 6 seats. The BJP had won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat in May. It has retained the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat vacated by Prime Minister Modi.
In Rajasthan, the BJP has suffered a humiliating defeat. It has managed to win just one seat, out of the total four seats. The Congress has surprised everybody by winning 3 seats. An elated state Congress chief Sachin Pilot has described it as a victory of the workers of the Congress. He has also dubbed it as a vote against both the chief minister Vasundhara Raje and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Some good news for the BJP has come from West Bengal. It has won Basirath Dakshin seat and came second in the second seat Chowrangee. For the first time, the BJP has won a seat on its own in West Bengal. In Assam, the AUDF, Congress and BJP won one seat each.
In Andhra Pradesh, the ruling TDP won the lone Nandigama assembly seat. In Telangana, the ruling TRS won Medak Lok Sabha seat by a huge margin. The Congress came second and the BJP came third.
Independent candidate Rup Narayan Chamling won from Rangang-Yangang assembly constituency in Sikkim. "He (Chamling) won the bypoll by a margin of 706 votes," said an election officer of Sikkim. The bypoll was necessitated after Chief Minister Pawan Chamling resigned from the seat and retained Namchi-Singhithang after the April assembly elections.
Rup Narayan Chamling defeated Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) candidate Kumari Manger, Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Bikash Basnet, and the Congress's Bishnu Prasad Adhikari.
The Sikkim Krantikari Morcha opted out of the fray this time. RN Chamling is the brother of Chief Minister Pawan Chamling. Counting for the lone assembly seat in Chhattisgarh that went to polls will be on September 20.
At a time when Modi led BJP is trying to make its imprint with new policies and decisions at the Centre, it seems that it also needs to ponder over what went wrong on a local level and act immediately before it is too late.

By-poll results positive  would push seat-deal with NCP: Congress2
0
Mumbai: Maharashtra unit of Congress on Tuesday said that by-election results from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Tuesday were a morale-booster for the party cadre, and would also lead to speedy finalisation of seats-sharing deal with the NCP for the coming assembly elections in the state.
The seat-sharing talks are currently stuck over NCP's demand of equal number of seats. Reverses for BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Congress's gains in Gujarat and Rajasthan in Tuesday's by-election results had enthused Congress workers in the poll-bound Maharashtra, said state Congress spokesperson Anant Gadgil.
"It is a psychological boost. People are upset with the BJP government under Narendra Modi and are in rethinking mode. It will also expedite seat-sharing talks with NCP," he said.
The seat-sharing talks are currently stuck over NCP's demand of equal number of seats.
#ncp #congress #anant gadgil #bypolls
Shiv Sena, which had refused to accept BJP's demand for 135 seats, would now harden its stand, he claimed. "Today's results are a message to our ally NCP that people want us to unite and keep communal forces at bay."
Gadgil, who is also a member of AICC media panel, claimed that BJP's losses in Uttar Pradesh proved that people did not want communal forces, while in Rajasthan the youth had voted for the Congress in a big way. Ratnakar Mahajan, another state Congress spokesperson, said in the current legislative assembly Congress has 82 MLAs, which is close to the combined strength of BJP (46) and Shiv Sena (45). NCP (62) has more MLAs than the two saffron parties individually.
Despite this, Congress and NCP together are one member short of majority in the 288-member house, he noted. "Alliances are inevitable for both Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena-BJP. The extent of fragmented polity is such that more than Congress-NCP, it is BJP which has no candidates to field in several constituencies. In the Lok Sabha elections, it fielded outsiders at eight to ten places," he said.
In apparent reference to NCP's threat to go it alone if its demand for equal number of seats was not met, Mahajan said because of the Lok Sabha verdict in favour of a single party, the idea of going solo had now entered the heads of those who once thought coalition politics was here to stay.
Both Gadgil and Mahajan said the by-poll results proved that voters think differently in Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Focus of party's campaign will be on the developmental works carried out by the state government in the last 15 years, they said.
Commenting on the stalemate in Sena-BJP seat-sharing talks, Mahajan said, "We don't know whether their differences are for real or just a pretence to keep the smaller parties in the (opposition) alliance which are demanding large chunk of seats at bay."
After today's results, BJP will have to do a rethink on its confidence that the "Modi wave" would carry it to victory every time, he said.

Thrissur: Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Tuesday said that his Government wanted to convert the state into a global destination for higher studies with institutions of international standards.
Speaking after declaring St Thomas' College of Thrissur Catholic Archdiocese, as an autonomous college, he said it was most unfortunate that Kerala was lagging far behind in the higher education sector than other states. It was not because educational institutions lacked proper facilities, but they were kept as 'caged birds' without giving opportunities for their growth and development.
He said that the days of stifling growth of higher education in the State on 'flimsy principles and ideologies' were over it would be depriving of the opportunities of higher education for the coming generation, he said.
It would be a great mistake if opportunities for higher education for the coming generation are denied, the Kerala Chief Minister said.
It would be a great mistake if opportunities for higher education for the coming generation are denied, he said. This is the first college under Calicut University to have the autonomous status.

The instructions to this effect have been issued and are being followed up, said that Dr Satbir Bedi, Principal Secretary (WCD). "These children face problems with regard to their identity status when they are released from institutional care upon attaining the age of 18 years. This initiative will greatly help them to get into mainstream society," said Bedi.
The instructions to this effect have been issued and are being followed up, said that Dr Satbir Bedi, Principal Secretary (WCD).

Apart from that, having aadhaar cards will also help these children in the long run to get driving license, voter identity card and ration card. They will be also able to open a bank account, Bedi said.
The Department at present is maintaining 22 child care institutions for children in need of care and protection and juvenile in conflict with law under the provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2000.
Out of these, 16 children homes are for destitute, neglected, orphaned, run away and the children who are vulnerable to any type of exploitation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Have the people of Uttar Pradesh (UP) denounced the Modi wave? Samajwadi Party (SP) has won 8 out of the 11 assembly seats contested on Friday in the state. Interestingly, all these assembly constituencies in UP were won by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the legislative elections of 2012.
In a Lok Sabha by-poll, Samajwadi Party (SP) won the Mainpuri parliamentary constituency again as it did during the Lok Sabha polls this year.
If one compares the performance of BJP during the bypolls in UP with that in the national elections this year, it can be said that BJP lost on an average around one-third of its votes. In the assembly seats which went to poll on Friday, BJP lost around 40,000 votes per constituency on an average.
In the 11 UP constituencies that went to polls, BJP got a total of 730,393 votes compared to 1,204,038 votes it got three months back.
In the Charkhari constituency BJP did not even come second. In 2012, high profile candidate Uma Bharti had won this seat by 64,035 votes.
BJP won the Lucknow East seat but with the highest drop in the total number of votes. During the Lok Sabha polls BJP got 1,47,654 votes in Lucknow East while this time it managed just 62,164 votes. This was a drop of 85,490 votes, which was about 58%. The Lucknow parliamentary constituency seat is held by home minister Rajnath Singh.
Nighasan assembly constituency had the lowest drop of 462 votes for the BJP, a decrease of 0.5% from the LS polls. Bijnor had the second lowest drop of 6,057 votes.
The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) did not contest any of these seats. It is a fact that BSP has a big share of votes in UP.
The following graph gives the details of the vote loss of the BJP. It must be noted that Charkhari constituency has not been taken into account in this analysis because the state election commission has still not updated the BJP numbers as Congress has come second in these constituency after SP.

Some bald men may be at a greater risk of developing aggressive prostate cancerMen with male pattern baldness who experience hair loss in both the crown and front of their heads at age 45 are more likely to develop an aggressive form of prostate cancer later in life, a new study found.

Both prostate cancer  and the very specific pattern of baldness may be related to increased levels of male sex hormones and receptors. This study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , further supports a potential link between the two conditions; there was no link between other patterns of baldness and aggressive prostate cancer.
The study used data from the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which studied 39,070 men between ages 55 and 74. Participants were asked to recall what type of hair-loss patterns they experienced at 45.
Subsequently, 1,138 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and about half of those cases were aggressive. Men with this pattern of baldness at 45 were 40 percent more likely to develop a form of aggressive prostate cancer, which usually means faster tumor growth.
"Our study found an increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer only in men with a very specific pattern of hair loss, baldness at the front and moderate hair-thinning on the crown of the head, at the age of 45. But we saw no increased risk for any form of prostate cancer in men with other hair-loss patterns," the study's lead author, Michael B. Cook, said in a statement.
Cook, an investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute, added: "While our data show a strong possibility for a link between the development of baldness and aggressive prostate cancer, it's too soon to apply these findings to patient care."
After skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And an estimated 233,000 men will be diagnosed with the cancer this year, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology . The risk of prostate cancer increases with age and is genetically linked.
It may also be linked to high levels of male hormones, called androgens, which promote prostate cell growth, according to the ASCO.

An unfired, spare rocket engine for the Mars Viking lander—the first spacecraft to land on Mars—is currently bidding around $12,000, but according to its hawkers, it may sell for much more. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, tells Quartz it’ll go for at least $40,000. “It’s gorgeous,” he said. “If you ever wanted to go to Mars, now’s your chance.”
RR Auction has four astronaut consignors, and often acquires items from the US government directly. The rarest item in this particular auction, whose latest bid is $121,000, is a Rolex worn by US president Dwight Eisenhower . The 18-karat-gold watch, considered the most valuable Rolex watch in existence, has Eisenhower’s initials engraved on it.

Also available for bidding: the ‘Freedom Torch’  that Nelson Mandela held during a campaign ceremony at the Victor Verster Prison, where he was detained for 27 years. “It still has the wick in the torch, so you can still smell the flame,” Livingston said.
The ‘Freedom Torch’ is currently bidding at $50,000.
