Muthoot Finance seeks Sebi nod to mop up Rs 400 cr viaNCDFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Gold financing company Muthoot Finance has sought capital markets regulator Sebi’s approval for raising up to Rs 400 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to support lending activities.
The issue aims to garner up to Rs 200 crore with an option to retain over—subscription of up to Rs 200 crore, as per draft prospectus filed with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
NCDs are loan-linked securities issued by a company and can’t be converted into stocks. They usually carry a higher interest rate than a convertible debenture.
“Public issue by Muthoot Finance of secured redeemable NCDs and unsecured redeemable NCDs of face value of Rs 1,000 each, aggregating up to Rs 2,000 million with an option to retain over subscription up to Rs 2,000 million for issuance of additional NCDs aggregating to a total of up to Rs 4,000 million,” the prospectus stated.
The funds raised through the issue would be used for financing and lending activities and for general corporate purposes.
Muthoot Finance has already raised a total of Rs 864 crore via two tranches through NCDs route in the current fiscal (2014-15) so far.
ICICI Securities is the lead manager to the proposed issue, while Link Intime India Private Limited is the registrar.
Muthoot Finance is one of the largest gold financing company in India, with more than 4,200 branches as of June 30, 2014.

Mutual funds equity folio count expands by over 7 lakh inApr-OctEquity mutual funds added more than seven lakh investor accounts or folios in the first seven months of the current fiscal (2014-15) in view of sharp rally in the stock market.
Folios are numbers designated to individual investor accounts, though one investor can have multiple folios.
According to Securities and Exchange Board of India data on investor accounts with 45 fund houses, number of equity folios rose to 2,9917,974 at last month-end from 2,91,80,922 at the end of the last fiscal (March 31, 2014), registering a gain of 7,37,052 folios during April-October period this year.
The additions came at a time when the market was scaling new highs.
The month of April saw the first rise in more than four years. Prior to that, the equity mutual fund (MF) sector had seen a continuous closure of folios since March 2009 after the market crashed due to the global financial crisis in late 2008. Since March 2009, it has seen a closure of 1.5 crore folios.
The investor base reached its peak of 4.11 crore in March 2009, while it was 3.77 crore in March 2008.
Industry experts said that strong rally in the equity market and the consequent rise in investors’ interest led to a sharp increase in retail folios.
“There has been rise in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) registration and a lot of close-ended schemes have been launched by mutual fund houses in the past few months and the rise in such activities are supported by a sharp surge in equity market,” Quantum Mutual Fund Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Patel said.
The addition in equity folios is in line with BSE’s benchmark Sensex surging by 25 per cent in the first seven months of the current financial year.
Moreover, mutual funds industry reported net inflows of nearly Rs 34,000 crore in equity funds in the April-September period of the current fiscal (2014-15), which helped the industry grow its folio count.
Overall, the industry retail folios surged to 3.97 crore at October-end from 3.95 crore at the end of March.

Some Mutual funds miffed as AMFI kept them in dark on MarutipanelFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Some mutual fund houses are piqued at being kept in the dark about setting up a committee by their industry association Association of Mutual Funds of India to discuss the common stand on Maruti’s controversial plan to set up a plant in Gujarat, industry sources said here today.
The AMFI panel has been formed to discuss Maruti’s plans to set up its Gujarat plant as a fully-owned arm of its Japanese parent Suzuki as well as take a common position on similar cases where minority shareholders’ interests are involved.
After Maruti rejected mutual funds’ demand not go ahead with the Gujarat plan and instead hold an extraordinary general body meeting later this month, the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) had set up a panel to take a common mutual fund industry position on the issue.
As many as seven MFs hold 6.5 per cent stake in the country’s largest car maker, while LIC holds 6.83 per cent.
Some fund houses felt that AMFI should have informed them about the decision to form the panel on the issue. They have contended that the committee’s decision would not be binding on them while using their voting rights.
SBI Mutual Fund, which holds some stake in Maruti-Suzuki and has been kept out of the process, has been very critical about the manner in which the AMFI board constituted the committee.
Though the talks were on among mutual fund houses about formation of the committee for quite some time, many fund houses were not informed about the decision to set up the committee, the SBI MF said.
“Normally we are informed about any such decisions taken by the AMFI. However, this time we didn’t receive any communication from the association. Once we get some mail from AMFI in this connection, we will definitely take a call on whether to raise a questions about the issue,” SBI MF Managing Director and Chief Executive Dinesh Khara told PTI.
Maruti-Suzuki’s plan to set up a car plant in Gujarat as a fully-owned subsidiary of its Japanese parent has already been objected to by seven mutual fund houses holding stakes in the car company.
A decision on the proposed plant is likely to be taken by Maruti after its forthcoming extraordinary general meeting which is likely to be held later this month. It needs to get the permission of at least 75 per cent of shareholders for investment in the plant.
LIC Nomura MF, which holds 0.04 per cent stake in Maruti, has also been kept in the dark about the decision. However, it felt that it will raise objections in case any decision is taken by the committee and which was not informed to the MF house in advance.
“Formation of a committee was within the purview of the AFMI. However, we will raise a question before the association in case any decision is taken by the committee without keeping us informed,” LIC Nomura MF Chief Executive Nilesh Sathe said.
While LIC is the single largest minority investor in the country’s largest car maker with 6.8 per cent holding, seven mutual funds hold around 6.53 per cent and domestic financial institutions hold 7.95 per cent in the country’s largest carmaker.
An official of LIC said the financial giant is yet to take a view on the Maruti-Suzuki’s plan.
“A committee is a good forum to have consultation within the industry on issues related to corporate governance. However, any decision to be taken by the committee will not be binding on us when we exercise our voting rights,” Union KBC Mutual Fund Chief Executive G Pradeepkumar said.
However, the Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) has welcomed the AMFI move.
“It’s good to know that mutual funds and institutional investors are thinking about some critical transactions and getting more active, because every single vote of mutual fund houses, big or small, will count during the EGM of the company,” IIAS Chief Operating Officer Hetal Dalal said.

Market outlook: Inflation  IIP data  cabinet reshuffle key for mkts  sayexpertsInflation data for October, industrial output numbers for September, quarterly earnings of blue-chips such as Tata Motors, ONGC and SBI, as also the first reshuffle of the Union Cabinet would dictate the stock markets trend this week, say experts.
Besides, overseas investments and movement of the rupee against the dollar would be crucial for markets.
“Movement of index in near-term will depend on upcoming IIP, CPI & WPI data and second quarter results of important companies,” said Vivek Gupta, CMT-Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
Several blue-chips are slated to announce their earnings this week, including Tata Steel, Cipla, Tata Power, DLF, Hindalco Industries, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Tata Motors, Bharat Heavy Electricals, ONGC and State Bank of India.
Industrial production data for September would come out on Wednesday.
Inflation based on combined consumer price indices (CPI) for October would also come on Wednesday, while inflation based on wholesale price index (WPI) would be announced on Friday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today expanded his Council of Ministers, a move that was hailed by the industry as a further step towards faster reforms.
The benchmark BSE Sensex concluded the week at 27,868.63, showing a marginal gain of just 2.8 points.
“We expect the markets to gain medium-term support from 7,900-7,950 levels. FII flows are pretty strong in the past fortnight and their trend in the coming sessions, coupled with global cues, shall guide the market direction from this point,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.

Deepak Parekh says stock markets not helping Indians; only FIIs making biggainsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Raising concern about over-dependence of Indian capital markets on foreign institutional investors, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said that something needs to be done to change this pattern.
“There is too much dependence on foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and I think we have exported our capital markets abroad. We have to do something to change this pattern,” Deepak Parekh told a capital markets meet organised by the ISB here over the weekend.
“Who is really benefitting from our well regulated equity markets? It is not the Indians, it is not our institutions, it is not our labour, it is not our retirees, but the FIIs,” said Deepak Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.
FIIs’ stakes in the Sensex companies hit an all-time high of over 27 per cent in June this year. Their holdings in the wider BSE 200 Index reached an all-time high at 24.5 per cent, as per BofA-ML’s Jyotivardhan Jaipuria.
Incidentally, HDFC as also group firm HDFC Bank are among companies with very high FII holdings.
The companies where FIIs have exhausted their permissible investment limits include Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDFC, IndusInd Bank, Lupin, Maruti and Titan among others. The sectors where there is still some room comprise banks, cement, auto and consumer goods.
“We all know how fickle FIIs are. They move in and out of the markets effortlessly and there is a herd instinct. History is replete with examples of how sudden reversals in capital flows can cause extensive damage and volatility to a country’s financial system,” Parekh warned.
A vocal proponent of free market, Parekh also crticised the government for using the divestment as a tool to “plug the fiscal deficit,” and said state-run firms like LIC should not take holdings in other PSUs as part of divestment programme.
He also expressed displeasure at no progress being made on the front as yet, saying bunching up of issues towards the end of the fiscal reduces market’s absorption capacity.
He also said the government has been “hanging on senselessly” with equity in many public sector companies such as BSNL and Air India as private companies have done very well in their sectors.
Alleging that investigating arms of the government like the CAG or CVC have “little understanding of valuations”, Parekh also came out strongly over action taken against civil servants under whose leaderships such stake sales happen.
He further blamed the investment bankers and promoters for being greedy and commanding higher valuations in FY08, which saw a record initial public offerings and said that this behaviour has waned investor interest later.
“The cardinal rule is that one has to leave something on the table for investors, otherwise they will completely back out of such funding,” he said, adding the number of issuances have been few even though we are in the midst of a bull-run in the market at present.

Equity market: Second timeluckyFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
As a country, just a few months back we were in the midst of a vicious cycle of low growth, high inflation, high interest rates and low capital expansion,one feeding on the other. With consumer and business confidence improving, all these variables are now coming on to positive mode—slowly but surely. A virtuous cycle is beginning to form with growth looking up, inflation slowing down and expectations of a better capital expansion in the country. This change in the cycle is a result of a secular uptrend in economic cycle, benign global commodity prices and a confidence boosting strong government formation. Both sentiment as well as fundamentals are coming together in a very positive way. We expect these factors to continue to improve and the growth rates and prosperity in the country will improve at a faster rate over the next few years.
While the country’s growth rates will continue to remain sub-6% in the current year, it is expected to improve consistently over the next few years and if the government successfully executes the initiatives that it has identified, economic growth and corporate profitability will further move upwards. Recent measures by the central government has led to a gradual improvement in investment climate. Investment uptick and lower macro-economic imbalances may help sustain growth rates of 7% + over the next 5-10 years helping address constraints on sovereign credit profile.
Corporate profitability is one of the key drivers of equity market performance. We believe the corporate earnings could surprise us on the upside as against the current expectations, which is predicated on a ~6% GDP growth. Moreover, with a cool off in commodities, falling fiscal deficit and gliding down inflation, it would have a sobering effect on the interest rates. So, with risk free rate heading towards~@6%, the delta on equities will be big. On valuations, the headline NIFTY trades @~15.5x on FY16 consensus earnings, which are closer to the means. So it is not euphoric as yet. P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) expansion has traditionally always accompanied earnings growth. So a 10000+ NIFTY by December 2015 is a reasonable estimate given the improvement expected in the medium term.
Over the last three months, we have started seeing retail investor participation in equities either through direct investments or through mutual funds. However, the participation has been limited to few smart and high net worth investors. Real retail participation is expected to happen and will drive the next stage of the rally. The improving hiring environment, higher savings and better channelising of the financial savings would lead to more money into equity markets. Hence the ~R80 trillion lying in fixed deposits will have to find better investment avenues, as deposits will get re-priced lower (in the expected environment of softening interest rates). Even if a miniscule portion of such savings were to find a way into the equity markets, it will be enough to fuel a smart rally. Besides,the recent outlook upgrade of India’s sovereign rating is a precursor to an eventual ratings upgrade, which in turn will make India “investible” for many of global portfolio allocators.
In the last few years, while overseas investors were investing in the markets, Indian mutual funds and institutions were selling into the rallies as they were seeing redemptions from their retail investors. This time around we expect both the overseas investors and the Indian institutions will remain buyers resulting in a positive demand for Indian equity.
The returns in equity markets traditionally have always been lumpier and they come with steep intermediate corrections. That is the very characteristic of equity markets. One should not get perturbed by this and in fact, use this volatility to his/her advantage.
While headline indices (Sensex and Nifty) are important they are not the only benchmark for the returns from equities. Just to put things in perspective, while the markets have risen 25%, many domestic MFs have delivered 50%+ returns. So there are many companies beyond the ones in indices and there are several MFs schemes that have outperformed the headline indices and continue to do well. Now with overall environment and capital expansion cycle expected to look up the profitability growth will be wider and therefore the performance of wider market is expected to pick up pace and get in sync with the headline performance.
It would be wise for individual investors to invest consistently and regularly in the equity markets or MFs to realise the benefit of better returns that the equities are likely to provide over the next few years compared to any other asset.

Airports Authority, Pawan Hans to be Listed; Air India May Be Privatised in Future, Says Minister
NDTV | Reported By: Kashish | Updated On: November 10, 2014 19:08 (IST)
Tweet
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, who unveiled a draft policy on civil aviation today, said the government will list state-run Airports Authority of India and Pawan Hans in the next six months. He also signaled that loss-making national carrier Air India may be privatised in future.
Here is your 10-point cheat-sheet about the draft aviation policy:
The listing of Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans on stock exchanges will improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said today.
State-run AAI manages 125 airports across the country. Among them are 11 international and 81 domestic airports. It also owns stake in some of the country's premium airports located in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
Pawan Hans, one of Asia's largest helicopter companies, has a fleet of 47 helicopters. The government owns 51 per cent stake in the company, the remaining 49 per cent is owned by another state-run company ONGC.
Pawan Hans provides helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations. It also provides charter services for promotion of tourism.
Both AAI and Pawan Hans are profitable companies. During 2013-14, AAI reported a profit of Rs 796 crore. AAI is expected to double its net profit for the current fiscal year to more than Rs 1,400 crore, sources said. Pawan Hans reported a net profit of Rs 11.70 crore during 2012-13.
Mr Raju said it is essential to ensure that Air India achieves its full potential. To achieve this, the government had decided to form an expert committee, which will decide on privatisation or other solutions, the minister said. For 2013-13 fiscal year, Air India reported a net loss of Rs 5,389 crore.
The government will also review the 5/20 guideline. The archaic rule makes it mandatory for a carrier to have 5 years of domestic flying experience and 20 aircraft to become eligible to fly on international routes.
Mr Raju said he will intensify efforts to get states to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which currently ranges between 4-35 per cent. Jet fuel constitutes over 40 per cent of an airline's operating costs.
The draft policy entails measures to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode (public-private partnership) and improve passenger facilitation.
The civil aviation policy is expected to come into force early next year after consultations are done and an approval from the Union Cabinet is in place.

Here s Your First Look At Round 2 Of ObamacareObamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peek At New Prices
Posted:
reddit
Health insurance consumers using HealthCare.gov will get their first look at the prices for 2015 coverage starting Sunday night, when window shopping goes live on the website, federal officials announced Sunday.
Shoppers won't be able to choose a health plan for 2015 until Nov. 15, when the three-month enrollment period begins. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is providing early access to estimated health insurance premiums and the value of subsidies available to low- and moderate-income households. The window-shopping tool proved to be the most-visited part of HealthCare.gov during the first Obamacare enrollment period, officials said.
HealthCare.gov , which serves insurance consumers in more than 30 states , debuted Oct. 1, 2013, without the ability for people to window shop, which forced users to create accounts and begin applications for coverage before they could view prices. And since the website was barely functional for the first two months of the six-month sign-up period last year, the absence of this tool made it nearly impossible for people to gauge whether they could afford coverage -- and put greater strain on the system -- until the feature was added.
Obamacare officials said they would release an analysis of the health insurance premiums for 2015 later this week.
"We think the news is largely positive," said Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HealthCare.gov and the director of the Center for Consumer and Information and Insurance Oversight within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Independent analyses based on health insurance pricing information made public by state regulators have shown modest average premium increases for Obamacare plans across the nation. According to the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, rates will rise an average of 6 percent in states that have reported 2015 prices. The changes vary greatly, however, so some consumers will see double-digit increases while others will see prices go down if they keep their current coverage. The number of health insurers selling plans on the exchanges also is increasing by about 25 percent .
Consumers will be automatically re-enrolled into the plans they have this year if they are still being sold by their insurance carriers, but Counihan stressed that federal officials want individuals who already have coverage through the exchanges to revisit the website to ensure they're getting the best deal based on the new prices and the subsidies they can receive based on their incomes.
"The majority of our customers will be able to save money by shopping and comparing," Counihan said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. "We are strongly encouraging our customers to return back to HealthCare.gov, update their income and eligibility information, shop and compare, and see if there are better values out there for them."
Next year's prices will be available Sunday night on both HealthCare.gov and CuidadoDeSalud.gov , the Spanish-language portal to the federally run exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchanges and will provide premium information on their own schedules, the federal officials said.
The health insurance exchanges will open on time next Saturday, said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "We've hit all the critical deadlines," he said. "We're not contemplating anything unusual or out of the ordinary, regarding Nov. 15."
The HealthCare.gov team has streamlined the application process most consumers will use, and has completed more than a month of testing to ensure the website functions this time. The website also will be able to serve more users at a time than it did during the first enrollment period.
Officials said it will be easier than it was last year for visitors to HealthCare.gov to access the window-shopping tool and view estimates of the price and benefits of plans available in their local area before this sign-up period.
Shoppers can provide their zip codes, approximate income and information about the make-up of their households to get a look at what's available and what it costs, including the effects of tax credits to reduce premiums, and subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Then users can sort health insurance plans by price and level of benefits, view information on what services are covered or not covered, and see how much they will pay when they receive medical care. When consumers find a plan they may want to purchase during the enrollment period, they can print out or email the information to themselves or save the link to that plan.

Emails Paint Damning Picture Of GMGM Ordered New Switches Months Before It Told Regulators About Issue: WSJ
Reuters
reddit
NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ordered half a million replacement ignition switches almost two months before it alerted federal safety regulators of the issues that prompted a recall of millions of vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing email exchanges between the automaker and its supplier Delphi Automotive Plc.
The email exchanges, which took place in mid-December 2013 between a GM contract worker and Delphi, indicate GM placed an "urgent" order for 500,000 replacement switches on Dec. 18, a day after a meeting of senior executives, the newspaper said. GM announced its recall in February 2014. (http://on.wsj.com/142qQhn)
Representatives for GM and Delphi Automotive did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the matter.
"This is simply mind-blowing in its raw evilness," said Bob Hilliard, lead counsel for the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the Federal Multi District Litigation against General Motors.
"GM should have notified its customers immediately to take all weight off of their keychains. By the time GM actually ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making the decision to place the order," Hilliard said in a statement.
GM has faced criticism for waiting 11 years to begin recalling millions of cars with ignition-switch problems that have been linked to fatalities. The switch in question can slip out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags. The defect led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year.
So far, 61 claims have been deemed eligible for compensation, including 30 deaths and 31 injuries.
A federal judge in Manhattan has set Jan. 11, 2016, for the first trial in consolidated litigation against General Motors over a series of safety issues, including a faulty ignition switch.

As three-nation trip begins tomorrow  Modi to hold 24 bilateralmeetingsPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Written by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 9:38 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 10:43 am
With Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to embark on his 10-day three-nation tour on Tuesday, he is likely to have at least two dozen “one-on-one meetings” with world leaders in Myanmar and Australia, sources confirmed on Monday. It will be a power-packed schedule as he goes on a diplomatic blitzkrieg and interacts with world leaders on a global stage — his first since he took charge in May this year.
Officials said Modi will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott during his trip to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji between November 11 and 20. He is also likely to have a “pull-aside” with US President Barack Obama, as they will be part of  both the ASEAN and G-20 summits, which are going to take place back-to-back.
Modi will have his first meeting with Li Keqiang on the sidelines of the East Asia summit at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar, while the meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping will take place during the “informal” meeting of BRICS leaders on the fringes of the G-20 summit in Brisbane.
In Australia, as he meets Abbott, the two countries are also expected to sign a clutch of agreements on combating narcotics, social security, culture, transfer of sentenced prisoners and tourism. This will be their second meeting in two months, as Abbott was the first foreign leader to come for a state visit under the new regime.
“During the course of these summits and my bilateral visits, I will meet over 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Pacific Region, as also heads of many multilateral institutions. These meetings are taking place at a time of multiple global challenges. I look forward to seeking a global environment that supports our aspirations for economic development and a peaceful world,” the PM said in his departure statement on Monday, a day before he leaves for Nay Pyi Taw.
He said the ten-nation ASEAN community has the third largest population, the seventh largest economy, and the third fastest growing economic unit this century. “This dynamic region is our continental and maritime neighbour, linked by centuries-old ties. ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration. I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level, which will supplement our deepening bilateral ties with each member,” he said.
“No region in the world embodies so much dynamism or faces so many challenges as the region spanning the Indian Ocean, continental Asia and Pacific Ocean. And, no other forum, perhaps, has as much potential to shape this region and the world’s future as continued…

Alarming! 50% Indian youths have experiencedcyberbullyingThis behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 9:38 pm
According to a study conducted by McAfee, part of Intel Security, half (50%) of the youth in India have had some experience with cyber-bullying (been cyberbullied online or witnessed others being cyberbullied), out of which one-third (36%) have been cyberbullied themselves. The McAfee study aims to educate on the impact that risky behaviour has on their privacy, reputation and social media experiences.
This behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact. The study highlights how risky online activity can possibly make them even more susceptible to cyberbullying, substantiated through some of the following statistics.
An eye-opening trend is that half (52%) of India’s youth even access their social media accounts while at school, with tweens (57%) being more connected during school hours than teens (47%). Even though the minimum age to register to on social networking sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tinder, Tumblr, and Vine is 13, 10-12 year olds report higher daily access to than their teen counterparts.
Oversharing of risky information: Despite a majority (80%) of Indian youth being aware that their online activity can affect their identity, 92% have done or posted something risky online. An added fact is that of these, 70% have posted their contact details like email, phone and home address.
Youth are increasingly trusting unknown people in the virtual world, in spite of being aware that it is risky. 53% have met someone in person that they first met online. 63% of youth do not turn off their location or GPS services across apps, leaving their locations visible to strangers.
Another critical concern stemming from peer pressure is youth feeling compelled to portray an untrue image of themselves online. 64% even admit to trying  to reinvent their online personas making themselves appear older, creating fake profiles or posting photos that are not their own. Moreover, 46% say they would put themselves in danger to see more engagement/ activity on their posts (e.g., more likes, comments, shares or retweets).
The most surprising finding was that most parents in India simply don’t care about even having a conversation with their children on online safety.

Is a vote against a political party also a vote against the network that supports it?
The Democrats' sinking fortunes have been pretty accurately charted in the declining ratings at MSNBC, the party's house network, which culminated, on election night, in a 22% fall from the last midterm election in the all-important 25-to-54 age group.
MSNBC's problem is almost exactly the same as the Democrats' problem: It built its future around a vivid and dramatic hero who, unfortunately, turned out to be both opaque and conflict averse. MSNBC now has a lineup of ever-righteous and often sulky defenders of President Barack Obama, who seem, not just to conservatives but to many liberals, too, bizarrely tone deaf and lost in time.
This is just the sort of bad zeitgeist bet that can so often happen in television programming.
The network, seeking to imitate Fox's success in building a loyal audience of politically motivated viewers, first managed to boost its low ratings by aligning itself with the  widespread anti-Bush feeling. Then, thinking it had hit something of a jackpot with the Obama election, it became the voice of Obama's anticipated remaking of the nation.
But at Fox, Roger Ailes, the chief, has deep roots in conservative thinking. Fox's alignment against all things liberal, which first began in President Bill Clinton's Lewinsky years, has had a remarkably successful run because of Ailes' fine antennae as to the subtle changes in conservative aspirations and temperament.
At MSNBC, it was more an outsider's calculated strategy, even a cynical one, to build an Obama-centric network. Not that different, say, from some Manhattan old guys doing a show about Brooklyn girls. Or suits in New York thinking duck hunters might be cool. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And, indeed, it seemed like a reasonable bet that Obama would be good television.
MSNBC's president, Phil Griffin, is not a political person. He's a TV pro. (Ailes, at Fox, has the virtue of being both a gifted political operative as well as an experienced programmer.) Griffin is a pro who has likely survived less because of innovative, golden-gut programming instincts than because of just plain old survival instincts. At MSNBC, he played the cable-niche hand he was dealt.
The network, a hopeless laggard, finally started to break out of the cable news depths when its anchorman, Keith Olbermann, began to rant against President George W. Bush and against Fox. Olbermann quickly became MSNBC's star and big kahuna, and was behind the hiring of liberal radio commentator Rachel Maddow, who became a second anti-Bush, pro-democratic programming pillar. Olbermann, however, famously difficult, was ousted by his NBC bosses. That left Griffin to pursue, with quite some hyperbole and inadvertent self-caricature — including Alec Baldwin's brief moment and Ronan Farrow's agonizingly longer one — a programming strategy to support the Democrats and adulate Obama.
Arguably, this strategy was bucking another development, both linked to Obama but larger than him, too: an erosion of political interest, and shrinking of the dedicated core. Beyond the Republican victory last week, the more indicative trend, crucial to both parties as well as to the news media, was the perilous drop for all networks in election night viewership, with all experiencing a dramatic fall-off from the 2010 midterms. Gridlock is not much of a story, after all. And social issues, which had fueled a decade or more of political scares, seem increasingly neutralized and no longer such cliff-hangers in the narrative.
This erosion suggests that the new core will be ever-smaller than the previous core, meaning the networks will need even more vividness and heroism and home team razzmatazz to focus the niche, just at a moment when political drama and pride, especially for the Democrats, are in vastly short supply. Or, alternatively and precariously, they will have to enlarge the niche —  "We've got to get outside Washington and open up our aperture a little," Griffin told The New York Times — quite a dangerous, even existential, play in cable television, where the niche is the brand. And yet where is there to go?
In the past, when the Republican's have lost, Fox has doubled down on outrage and fervor. This seems harder to do in the stub years of the Obama term. It's not just an Obama problem, but a Hillary problem, too.
In character terms, the problem is making Obama sympathetic and compelling when he appears not to want to be either of those things. In dramatic terms, the problem is that he seems inclined to shrink in the face conflict rather than rise to it. Who really is eager to watch the Obama show?
Then, in a major setback for MSNBC, the upcoming presidential election, ordinarily a reliable narrative of shifting alliance and oddball characters and, ideally, uncertain outcome, is frozen in place by Hillary Clinton. There is no story as far as the Democrats are concerned. There is nothing to unfold.
Who, but a dedicated masochist, will diligently watch that show? Clinton is a purposeful non-character. And what she stands for, largely some grand establishment return, is the opposite of the sense of insurgency that makes for political storytelling. Such storytelling is what Ailes has so successfully, and for so long, convinced Republicans was good for them. (Of course, good for him, as well.)
That is finally the point. Griffin is no Ailes. And MSNBC is not Fox, with its ability to direct as well as portray the political drama. A poor political operative, Griffin has painted himself into a corner like political parties so often do, losing the base, and yet without the philosophical wherewithal to appeal to a larger group. There is the broken clock theory of politics and cable programming, in which, if you just keep doing what you're doing, the zeitgeist returns to you. But politicians and media executives, swimming against the tide, usually lose their jobs before their hour returns.

Eight new ministers in Modi Cabinet have criminal cases: ReportCrime slur on nearly a third of Modi cabinet
Reuters  New Delhi, November 10, 2014

Attempted murder, waging war on the state, criminal intimidation and fraud are some of the charges on the rap sheets of ministers Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed to the cabinet on Sunday, jarring with his pledge to clean up politics.

Seven of 21 new ministers face prosecution, taking the total in the 66-member cabinet to almost one third, a higher proportion than before the weekend expansion. At least five people in the cabinet have been charged with serious offences such as rape and rioting.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said any suggestions there were criminals in the cabinet were "completely baseless".
"These are cases arising out of criminal accusations, not cases out of a crime," he told reporters on Monday, adding that Modi had personally vetted the new ministers.
Ram Shankar Katheria, a lawmaker from Agra, was appointed junior education minister yet has been accused of more than 20 criminal offences including attempted murder and promoting religious or racial hostility.
Katheria was not immediately available for comment and a mobile phone number given by his office was switched off.
The inclusion of such politicians does not sit easily with Modi's election promise to root out corruption, and has led to criticism that he is failing to change the political culture in India where wealthy, tainted politicians sometimes find it easier to win votes.
"It shows scant respect for the rule of law or public sentiment," said Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which campaigns for better governance. "Including these people in the cabinet is a bad omen for our democracy."
Modi won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in May with a promise of graft-free governance after the previous government led by Congress party was mired in a series of damaging corruption scandals.
New cabinet more tainted than old?
Soon after coming to power, Modi called for courts to fast track cases against politicians in an effort to curb political criminality in the world's largest democracy.
Yet Modi's cabinet includes twice as many politicians facing criminal charges as the previous Congress party one.
Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the new junior chemicals and fertilizer minister, was another eye-catching choice. He is charged with around 20 offences, including intent to wage war against India, criminal intimidation and abetting a mutiny.
Ahir did not respond to requests for comment, and it was not immediately clear what incidents the more serious charges pertained to. His secretary said the cases were politically motivated.
Ahir is best known for helping unearth corruption in the coal industry while he served on a parliamentary committee. Shrikant Sharma, a spokesperson for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it was up to courts to decide if ministers were guilty, and said many of the charges related to political rivalries.
The BJP is led by Amit Shah, who is accused of ordering police to carry out three extrajudicial killings and running an extortion racket when he served under Modi as home minister in Gujarat almost a decade ago.
He has denied the charges. He is facing a trial in Mumbai. The number of lawmakers charged with offences has more than doubled in the last two decades. About a third of federal and state legislators face charges, the ADR said.
Politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win an election as their untainted peers, making them the preferred choice of candidates for political parties in India, according to a study published last year by the group.
In office, these politicians are sometimes accused of enriching themselves or their backers by siphoning off money from government spending.
"We hear again and again the country's leaders promise to clean up the system," said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation. "Self interest prevails over principles. That is why the system never changes."

Twitter Teams With Advocacy Group To Fight Harassment Against Womenreddit
Twitter has teamed up with a women's rights advocacy group to launch a new tool aimed at curbing gender harassment and abuse on the social media platform. The tool, launched Thursday, allows victims to report harassment or for individuals to report on behalf of others. Users can describe in detail the date the harassment started, whether or not the victim fears for their personal safety, the exact sort of abuse experienced and whether the abuse is coming from one account or many.
The information is then submitted to Women, Action, & the Media (WAM!), a nonprofit that has sought " gender justice in media " since 2004. WAM! collects the info and works to get a resolution from Twitter.
The joint effort follows months of heated discussion under the #GamerGate hashtag on Twitter that frequently resulted in abuse toward women -- sometimes so specific and violent that it drove victims into hiding out of concern for their personal safety .
But Jaclyn Friedman, executive director for WAM!, told The Huffington Post that the tool has been in the works since before the online firestorm surrounding #GamerGate.
"We feel that [Twitter's] current reporting tool doesn't capture enough of the context of the way different women are targeted on Twitter," Friedman told HuffPost via email.
A representative for Twitter told HuffPost via email that the WAM Twitter Harassment Reporting Tool is just the latest in a series of partnerships that Twitter has joined to combat different forms of abuse on its platform. The tool is hosted on WAM!'s page, rather than within Twitter itself.
Twitter does currently provide its own form to report abuse. That tool allows people to choose the sort of harassment they're experiencing from a menu that includes options like "specific violent threats," but does not offer the same level of detail -- "revenge porn," for example -- that WAM! does.
Though WAM! says it will bring reports of abuse to Twitter, the primary focus seems to be on data collection. According to the group's press release, information collected by the tool will ultimately inform how Twitter deals with harassment of women in the future.
Brianna Wu, a game developer who faced death threats on Twitter after criticizing #GamerGate , spoke to HuffPost via phone about the new tool. Wu said its heart is in the right place, but she's not certain about the impact it will have.
"It's very clear to me that they genuinely want to make it better," Wu said. "That said, from what I've read about this so far, there doesn't seem to be any teeth."
"I'll be sold on it when I report something and see action taken," she added.
Wu also told HuffPost that her opinion about Twitter's responsibility diverges a bit from that of other tech feminists. The social media platform has come under fire in the past for not doing more to directly combat abuse.
"I'm always a little bit bewildered when the focus of the conversation becomes Twitter. To me, it seems like being angry at the post office for sending you a threatening letter," Wu said.
"Ever since I offered that reward, it stopped completely. It's stopped completely. Not a single death threat. The tone of my tweets has vastly improved. I've been overwhelmed by that response," Wu said.

On the Wrongful Conviction of Krishna Maharajstumble
I was recently involved in a documentary about a man who was sentenced to death for a double murder that happened in October 1986 in Room 1215 of the Dupont Plaza in downtown Miami. His death sentence was overturned because the judge and the prosecutor secretly agreed to it before the judicial sentencing hearing, but he remains in prison 28 years later.
His name is Kris Maharaj, he is 75 years old, and as I worked on the film he appeared to me to be very innocent. Since transmission, even more evidence has come to light, prompting me to take up his case once again. It is not my job, ultimately, to decide his fate -- that is for the courts. And yet the system seems fundamentally ill-suited to the task in various ways.
The true killers appear to have been henchmen of Pablo Escobar. Room 1214, across the hall, was occupied by one Jaime Vallejo Mejia, a Colombian who was even then being investigated by the DEA for his part in laundering $40 million in cash through some Swiss banks. This fact was not disclosed to the defense. More shocking still, three decades on, the federal government has thus far declined to respond to the judge's order to turn over the evidence in its possession regarding Mejia and other cartel members. The federal government apparently argues, routinely, that a state court does not have jurisdiction over a federal agency. Yet surely the innocence of a person in custody in our country is cause for concern to anyone who believes in the law?
A former police officer, now in prison himself, has come forward admitting that Maharaj was framed. The officer says that, in cocaine-riddled Miami in the 1980s, corrupt elements of the Miami Police Department had a policy to "Serve and Protect" the cartels by destroying evidence or collaring the wrong person. He says that there are at least 18 unsolved (or wrongly solved) homicides that he can identify. All this has been brought to the attention of the FBI Civil Rights division, and yet they have not even responded, let alone taken action. Surely, if we accept the adage that it is better that 99 guilty go free than that one innocent should suffer, it is the primary task of any law enforcement agency to respond to such evidence.
Yet perhaps the ultimate flaw in the system is how the courts themselves assess innocence. The Supreme Court has long refused to accept that the federal constitution forbids the imprisonment of the innocent -- the most someone like Maharaj can expect, we are told, is a trial that is procedurally fair, not one that comes to the correct result. This seems bizarre to a lay person like me, as I suspect it does to most people -- the court should reconsider its position.
This simply cannot be right and it is time for President Obama and Congress to take up the issue. If Amtrak were to suffer a train wreck, we would have hearings to identify and eliminate the cause. The Maharaj case is a judicial train wreck, and it is sadly not unique: it is past time for a wholesale reassessment of how we deal with a miscarriage of justice, and time is running out for Mr. Maharaj.

Why I Want You To Watch Virungareddit
Virunga is an important movie for many reasons. A call to action, and a sobering account of how many competing forces are at work in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- the perils of global capitalism, the lingering effects of colonialism, an endangered environment, etc. I have seen many movies that address one or more of these themes, but few, if any, that have created such a complex picture of an impending disaster.
Director Orlando von Einsiedel presents both a world of forgotten history and a glimpse of current events that, for the most part, remain unknown. A heartbreaking story of an ecosystem on the verge of collapse and of a small group of heroic people determined to do something about it.
I am quite taken with the use of so many diverse techniques -- from exquisite nature photography (which at times seems so hopelessly sad given the underlying message of the film) to degraded surveillance footage (some of the most powerful footage I have seen in any film). Virunga conjures a world of almost unimaginable horror, and at the same time, extraordinary heroism and compassion. It is a reminder that we humans are capable of so much good and so much evil.
Heroes usually make a decision to put themselves in danger or to protect people who are in danger. But the true victims in this story -- the mountain gorillas of Virunga -- are hard to see as anything other than innocent quarry of machinations far beyond their ken. They are pure victims in every sense of the word. I don't know whether the gorillas have a good attitude or a bad attitude, but it's clear that the operatives from the oil company SOCO do not have their best interests at heart. To me it's the most memorable line in the movie, produced in one of the undercover sequences recorded by French journalist Melanie Gouby. One oil company operative, clearly unable to grasp that some sympathies cannot be bought, says, "They don't give a fuck about the gorillas!"
It's part of the power of the film -- that we sense this complex interplay of forces. Some of which, many of which seem beyond anybody's control -- products of just how the world is constituted. An interplay of greed and self-righteousness, but also of sacrifice and selflessness.
We may have thought that we heard the worst from the Congo. This movie shows that it's still in so many ways an ongoing tragedy. In 1999, the writer Philip Gourevitch wrote, "Oh Congo, what a wreck. It hurts to look and listen. It hurts to turn away."
Virunga, like the finest documentaries of the current era, presents us with the facts of injustice, but it also shows the mechanisms through which it endures. It's a powerful, Manichean story, where forces of evil and forces of good are working as hard as they can to either ruin or to preserve the world. A strange contest, the movie is a reminder that we're all a part of it.
Virunga premieres Friday, November 7 in theaters in New York and LA and on Netflix at Netflix.com/Virunga .

Buy rating to Maruti Suzuki shares: Clear roadaheadMaruti Suzuki
Rating: Buy
Strong market share performance across all segments: MSIL’s market share performance has remained strong over the past year. Its market share in the passenger vehicles segment rose to 45.5% in H1FY15 compared with 43.6% in FY14 and 41.2% in FY13. In our view, MSIL’s outperformance has been helped by: (i) continued strong growth in rural areas– rural volumes increased 16% y-o-y in FY14 and 26% y-o-y in Q1FY15; (ii) first-time buyer mix has risen to 42% in H1FY15, from 37% in FY14 –MSIL has very high market share (70%) in the entry segment and (iii) successful launch of its Celerio model–6,000 units/ month.
We expect MSIL’s new launch momentum to stay strong over the next two years, which should help it sustain the outperformance. Market share performance was strong across all segments. Here, we would like to highlight two points: (i) A steep improvement in market share in the hatchback segment in FY15 led by the success of Celerio (58-60% so far vs. 44% in FY14); and (ii) MSIL has held on to its market share in the sedan segment despite two launches–Honda Amaze and Hyundai Xcent– which is quite positive. With more launches planned in the UV (utility vehicle) segment over two years, we expect MSIL to improve its market share from 10-12% currently.

Raising FY17F EPS estimate by 9%: Our FY15-17F (forecast) volume estimates remain largely unchanged. We expect 13% volume growth in FY15F and 17% in FY16F. We raise our ASP (average selling price) estimates by 1-3% for FY15-17F to account for a better product mix–more launches in the high-end segment. Our FY15-16F Ebitda margin estimates is largely unchanged while we have raised our FY17F Ebitda margin by 50 bp. Based on currency rates, Ebitda margins can improve by 60bp from Q2 levels. We build in a 1% reduction in discounts over the next two years (FY16-17F).
Overall, we raise our FY15F EPS (earnings per share) estimate by 5%; our FY16F EPS estimate is largely unchanged, while our FY17F EPS estimate is up by 9%.
Conservative depreciation policy vs. peers:We note that MSIL follows a conservative depreciation policy compared to its domestic peers. MSIL’s depreciation rate (based on average gross fixed assets ex-land) is around 11% which is much higher than, say, M&M, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Thus, MSIL’s earnings quality is better than the rest.
Dividend payout ratio to increase going ahead: MSIL’s board has decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 18-30% going ahead, from 10-15% earlier. We are building in a 20% dividend payout ratio for FY15-17F into our estimates. However, we note that MSIL still remains a growth stock—at the current price, we estimate the dividend yield at 1% for FY16F.
Reiterate Buy; TP raised to R3,660: We retain our SOTP (sum-of-the-parts) valuation methodology. We value MSIL at R3,813/share based on 18x consolidated FY17F EPS of R212. We then roll back our TP (target price) by four months to Nov-15 at a 13% cost of equity to arrive at our 12-month TP of R3,660.
Given factors like an economic recovery, lower oil prices and benign commodity prices, the outlook for the auto sector is strong. The sector multiples will likely remain towards the higher end of the historical trading range. Further, for Maruti specifically, we foresee some structural changes taking place over the next one-two years: (i) start of its R&D centre in India, leading to faster model rollouts; (ii) a possible fall in royalty rates on new models post higher local R&D; (iii) reduced earnings volatility on lower import content and (iv) likely upside to FCF (free cash flow) from the Gujarat plant deal.
Given the above, we expect MSIL to trade at 16-20x FY17F EPS . We peg our target multiple at 18x FY17F EPS—at the mid-end of our expected trading range. If the four-wheeler industry volume growth is stronger, the stock can trade at 20x FY17F EPS–at the higher-end.

Study: China s New Semiconductor Strategy Seeks to Exploit Tailwinds from Markets and Technologyreddit
HONOLULU (Nov. 9, 2014) -- When it comes to U.S.-China trade, semiconductors are a big deal. The chips that power virtually all modern electronics are one of the United States' most valuable exports at $42 billion a year (second only to auto exports at $51 billion), and China's biggest import at $232 billion - bigger even than oil. But so far, China's own role in semiconductor production and chip design has remained relatively small, despite concerted but flawed efforts by previous Chinese administrations to boost it.
So it was no small matter this past June when the fresh Beijing leadership under President Xi Jinping issued a new set of "Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development." The guidelines spell out concrete and ambitious development targets for China's semiconductor industry, with the goal of moving from playing catch-up to forging ahead as an industry leader in integrated circuit (or IC) design and fabrication.
Now noted analyst Dieter Ernst , an economist with the East-West Center in Hawaii, has put out a new study examining the objectives, strategy and implementation policies of China's new push in semiconductors and what they imply for the country's prospects in this key industry.
Ernst's study, From Catching-Up to Forging Ahead? China's Prospects in Semiconductors , explores how China's new strategy seeks to benefit from four global transformations in semiconductor markets and technology: the demand pull from mobile devices; new opportunities for China's factories in trailing-node semiconductor technologies; global changes in the IC fabrication landscape; and a new interest in strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions.
The study analyzes two particular policy initiatives of the new Chinese strategy: the IC Industry Support Small Leading Group to enhance strategy coordination, and equity funds to improve investment allocation and enhance firm capabilities through strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions involving both foreign firms and domestic firms.
"The implementation of both policies signals a genuine effort to experiment with a bottom-up, market-led approach to industrial policy," Ernst says. "In the Leading Group, for instance, experts who are knowledgeable and well-connected in the highly globalized semiconductor industry play an active role in policy formulation and implementation."
The use of professional investment fund managers, as opposed to government subsidies or investment programs, signals the emergence of a hybrid model that seeks to combine the logic of equity fund management with the objectives of China's semiconductor development strategy, Ernst writes.
However, his study concludes that, despite movement in the right direction, the new Chinese semiconductor strategy's capacity for flexible policy adjustments remains limited, and that multi-layered industrial dialogues among key stakeholders in the industry are still at an early stage.
"To exploit the tailwinds from the market, China needs to experiment further with new more market-driven approaches to industrial policy," Ernst says.

Women in Business: Gloria Larson  President of Bentley UniversityGloria Larson is the president of Bentley University in Waltham, Mass., and launched the PreparedU Project in 2013. Before joining Bentley, Larson was an attorney, public policy expert and business leader.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
My career has evolved without a specific game plan in almost every way.  Through a combination of hard work and serendipity, I've had the good fortune to work in federal and state government, the private sector and the non-profit world, and to have had invaluable experience across a variety of industry sectors.  In addition, I've had the chance to participate in many highly gratifying local and global civic endeavors.  It's this unusual combination of career and life experience that has made me open minded to different perspectives, helped me to be a strong collaborator with a knack for problem solving, and sparked my interest in shaping public policy in important areas such as education, economic development and healthcare.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at Bentley University?
As an attorney, first serving in increasingly responsible management roles in government, later as a partner in a large Boston law firm, and now the first female president of a major business university - all fields dominated by men - I have had an exhilarating career.  As a lawyer charged with running large organizations, I've also faced classic gender challenges along the way. These varied experiences have given me the background and "nuts and bolts" skills needed to succeed at Bentley, while also fueling my interest in closing the gender gap - something that women clearly cannot do alone. Our economy is only at its best when every individual has an equal opportunity to participate and succeed at every level.  I'm thrilled to have been given this significant platform - it enables me to make a real difference on this front.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Bentley University?
Segueing from the leadership roles I've previously held to that of a college president was not an easy or seamless transition. I made a lot of early mistakes. It's a completely different environment, much more process-driven than others in which I have worked. It's far less about calling the shots and more about enabling faculty and staff to be as good as they can be so that our students will be successful in their pursuits.
One of the biggest changes that took place just as I joined the university was changing our status from Bentley College to Bentley University.  Much of the ground work had been completed to meet Massachusetts' regulatory requirements to become a university, but winning over alumni and other stakeholders to accept both the new name and the larger national and international aspirations that accompanied the change was not easy.  Many had sentimental attachments to the college and were concerned that becoming a global business university would change the nature and culture of the school. We needed to show them why and how our new name and bolder goals added value to the Bentley degree.
A major highlight for me has been the number of new programs created during my tenure by our faculty and staff that are focused on redefining a 21st century business education. For example, our graduate school developed a highly innovative new MBA program - a studio-based, 11-month, global degree that places special emphasis on honing students' individual leadership styles and change-management skills, while working on diverse teams and across cultures. And I'm especially proud to have helped found the Center for Women and Business at Bentley, designed to advance shared leadership among women and men at all levels of the corporate world.
Why do you think female graduates are more prepared for success than their male counterparts?
This is an interesting question, as men are usually assumed to be better prepared for life-long career success, particularly when it comes to senior management roles.  Recent research shows that this is based largely on general perception, rather than concrete evidence. That said, there are more women than ever entering the business world. A recent study on preparedness commissioned by Bentley found that women are seen as better suited to success when it comes to certain specific qualities, like organizational skills, as well as interpersonal and communication skills.  While women may have an advantage in these areas and men in others, I believe that both genders have the ability to be equally prepared for the workforce and should be equally accepted at all levels.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
Work/life balance is an elusive concept for most of us and I think one of the biggest mistakes we make is believing that we have to "have it all" -- at the same time. That's a lot of unnecessary pressure and it can ultimately lead to feelings of resentment or failure. It's important to remember that you can, over time, do everything you set out to do. It doesn't all have to happen simultaneously. Over many years my husband and I have figured out how to support each other in our various career, family and civic endeavors, prioritizing our activities differently at different times.  I've found support from family and friends to be especially helpful. Of course, time management is crucial too, whether you're balancing kids, or volunteer and community commitments, with a career. Equally important is that you make sure you reserve some time and relaxation for yourself.  Having three Labrador retrievers has been a great outlet for me!
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
There still seems to be significant unconscious gender bias in the workplace and, unfortunately, progress in eliminating it has been slower than we all wish. According to McKinsey and Company , women now fill 53 percent of entry-level positions, yet only 28 percent are in senior management positions. Board membership numbers for women are even lower . I've served on several corporate boards and, in each case I've been one of just a few women in the room. As this gender gap persists, it causes too many women to doubt themselves and then hesitate in pursuing senior management positions - and a self-perpetuating cycle continues. We need buy-in from both male and female executives to bring about real lasting change.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
Both mentors and sponsors can make a significant difference.  Mentors can share advice and provide support, while sponsors are people in your organization who believe in you and are in a position to help you climb the organizational ladder. I would not have possessed the confidence to achieve success without strong mentor and sponsor support. The preparedness survey I cited earlier underscores the importance of mentorship programs and women-specific networking events to help women succeed in business.  At the same time, recent research also shows that having someone in your company who can act as a sponsor, actually advocating for you in terms of career advancement, is especially effective for high potential women.
Very early in my career, I thrived with the support of a woman who held a presidential appointment at the Federal Trade Commission, someone who had already successfully broken through the glass ceiling in Washington in the early 1980's, an especially tough, male-dominated arena. A Commissioner at the FTC, Patricia Bailey not only served as a role model, but was in a position to help me move up in my career - two vital ingredients in helping me get to the leadership position I hold today. When women get close to achieving leadership positions, they need someone they can turn to in order to reach that next step.
This is a recommendation I strongly suggest to business-minded millennials who fear the gender bias that awaits them: Look for mentors and sponsors who will not only offer advice and support your career ambitions, but will help you reach your goals. Surround yourself with professional, strong women - and men - who will encourage you to succeed.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
Arianna Huffington immediately comes to mind.  She's visionary, smart, successful and candid in her views, while also having a good sense of humor and strong interpersonal skills.  She has urged all of us to get more sleep and to otherwise adopt a healthier lifestyle - great advice that I personally aspire to someday adopt!  Growing up, my earliest role model was the fictional character Nancy Drew.  She embodied everything I wanted to be: razor sharp and likeable, able to solve the thorniest of problems while always impeccably dressed in matching skirt and heels.
What do you want Bentley University, its students and staff to accomplish in the next year?
We launched our PreparedU initiative in 2013, and that will continue to be a main focus for this coming year. The University, its faculty, staff and students are committed to working together to bridge the gap between employers and higher education so we can better prepare our graduates for today's complex and demanding workplace. The post-recession job market has been tough for recent college graduates and our surveys have shown that employers don't believe most graduates are adequately prepared for the work world. While Bentley is fortunate as a business-focused university to have a high job and graduate school placement rate, our PreparedU Project has spurred a broader public conversation that highlights the career challenges that millennials face and also identifies solutions that all schools can adopt to better prepare them for success.

City panel set to hear tweaked SRO proposalSRO proposal passes committee hurdle

Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants. ( Mary Ellen Podmolik )
The proposal, named the Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance, would require building owners who want to sell their properties to take one of three routes to dispose of them. They can negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days to try to find a buyer who would maintain the building’s affordable status for 15 years. If that kind of transaction falls through, the owner has 120 days to try to sell the building to any buyer and if no sale occurs, the owner must again try and sell the building to an owner who would maintain it as affordable.
Or, an owner can bypass that entire process if he deposits into an SRO preservation fund a sum that amounts to $20,000 for each unit in the building.

Housing "justice" at its finest. Add food justice and job justice and we'll be launching 5 year plans next. Folks do need a place to live. So many of the folks who live in these SROs live on disability income due to mental illnesses. Some may have jobs but most are essentially...

Displaced tenants who lived in a building for at least 32 consecutive days would receive $2,000 to $8,600 in one-time relocation assistance, depending on the circumstances. A tenant who has to move because of unsafe building conditions would be entitled to $10,600 in relocation assistance.
Representatives of SRO building owners complained Monday during testimony at the committee meeting that the city is unfairly singling them out for tougher regulations than other landlords.
Some fair housing advocates meanwhile testified the plan makes it too inexpensive for real estate developers to get rid of affordable housing in neighborhoods like Uptown that have long been battlegrounds for gentrification.
The most recent draft of the proposed law would not apply to building owners who had sought city permits before June 25 for demolition or conversion to market-rate housing. The tweaked proposal also gives owners a year to formally close on the sale of a building. Also, the proposal more specifically states that preservation fees collected under the ordinance could be tapped to offer forgivable loans to rehab existing SROs or grants to prospective buyers who want to maintain the buildings as affordable housing.
Housing advocates estimate that Chicago has lost more than 2,200 rooms of housing for very low- and low-income residents during the past three years. In July, the Chicago City Council passed a six-month moratorium on the issuance of any building permits tied to the conversion or demolition of SRO buildings while aldermen devised rules governing redevelopment of the buildings.

authors and poets
Shantanu Moitra talks about composing for a Telugu-Malayalam bilingual and his forthcoming book
Shantanu Moitra feels the National Award Best Background Score he bagged for Naa Bangaaru Talli is truly national in its sense. “I am a Bengali born in Lucknow, grew up in Delhi and working in Mumbai, winning this award for a Telugu/Malayalam bilingual. Can it get any better?” he quips. He was in town for the film’s audio launch and discussed how he got involved with the film, why he’s selective with films and where his interests lie.
Shantanu was neck deep in recording for 3 Idiots when producer-activist Sunita Krishnan and director Rajesh Touchriver showed him their film. “I met Sunita five years ago after a TED talk and was astounded by the work she was doing through Prajwala. I had no idea how I could help but I told her to let me know if there was anything I could do. In between my schedule for 3 Idiots, I saw this film and couldn’t get it out of my head for the next three days,” says Shantanu.
He found himself is a tight corner. He was in awe of the film but felt the makers didn’t have its background score in place. “I was looking at it from a craft point of view and not as their friend. I knew what could be done but was afraid to voice it because they’d ask me to do it. I had my hands full with 3 Idiots,” he says. Shantanu ultimately shared his thoughts with Rajesh, who also felt that the background score had to be redone.
“It was challenging. The score had already been composed and I had to strip it down to zero and start from scratch,” he says.
He also composed a song, sung by Shreya Ghoshal, which was later incorporated into the film. If Shreya is nearly flawless with her Telugu diction, Shantanu adds, “I couldn’t understand the language. I found her impeccable with the emotions. Meanwhile Rajesh was filming how we, a bunch of people who didn’t know Telugu and Malayalam, responded to the visual medium and composed music.”
Shantanu, now working on Rajkumar Hirani’s PK, says his bread and butter comes from composing for commercials. That, he says, makes it possible for him to be selective with films and allows him time to travel and work with independent artists in remote villages who may not be able to make the journey to the recording studio. “I believe that any country’s representation of art, especially music, cannot be only from its cinema. If I travel to Spain and want to listen to music the country has to offer, I wouldn’t pick a Spanish film. A movie is about a story and its characters and music matches that. We are brainwashed into believing that unless a film star lip syncs a song, it cannot have a reach,” he says.
Shantanu has collaborated with independent bands and artists for Coke Studio and credits this interest to his beginnings, when he shot to fame with Ab Ke Sawan, sung by Shubha Mudgal. “Back then, I was in Delhi and had no interest in cinema. That year, I learnt that Javed Akhtar played Ab Ke Sawan repeatedly in the Holi bash at his house. He coerced me to move to Mumbai,” says the composer, who has penned his travelogues and musings on music in the forthcoming book ‘On the Wings of Music’. “Stories of rape and corruption alone do not represent a billion people. Through my travels, I’ve come across incredible stories of honesty and bonhomie and wanted to share this through the book,” he says.

Curbs on content in cyberspaceUpdated: November 10, 2014 00:17 IST
Curbs on content in cyberspace
social networking
Facebook has disclosed that it restricted as many as 4,960 items of content on the social networking site in India in compliance with official requests in the first half of 2014. The significance of the figure does not lie in the mere fact that it is the largest number of restrictions from a single country during this period, or in the detail that India ranks second only to the U.S. in the number of requests for access to user data. The real and disturbing significance lies in Facebook’s disclosure that these requests, primarily from law enforcement officials and the country’s Computer Emergency Response Team, were made “under local laws prohibiting criticism of a religion or the state”. The number of requests for access to users jumped from 3,598 (covering 4,711 users/accounts) in the previous six-month period to 4,559 (covering 5,958 users/accounts) in the first six months of 2014. Half of the requests were complied with. It is possible to argue in legal terms that the government may seek such access to user data or request blocking of content in exceptional circumstances. Article 19(2) of the Constitution permits reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, among other grounds, “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.”
Normally one would expect that any restriction on free expression in cyberspace would be aimed at curbing potentially explosive remarks that are likely to foment violence. It is indeed a bitter reality that social media have sometimes been used to spread rumours — the ones that sparked an exodus from Bengaluru of residents hailing from the northeastern States in 2012 being an example. However, the moot question is whether it will be reasonable to use the principle to bar all criticism of the state or religion. It cannot be forgotten that a book by the Indologist Wendy Doniger was withdrawn and pulped because the publisher was threatened with prosecution under Section 295-A of the IPC, which makes “deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings” a punishable offence. Recently, a political activist was arrested for an innocuous comment that implied that divine retribution was behind a cyclone that hit Visakhapatnam. If the government is making thousands of requests either for user data or blocking content, it should be transparent about the real nature of its requests. Only then will it be possible for citizens to know if they fall squarely within the constitutionally recognised reasonable restrictions, or if they amount to misuse of archaic laws.

Got Science The Lesson in Hyundai s $100 Million Finereddit
Can consumers trust companies' information about their products? That's the critical question raised by the U.S. government announcement last week that the Hyundai Motor Group, makers of Hyundai and Kia cars, would pay a record $100 million penalty for submitting inaccurate fuel economy and emissions data on their vehicles.
Hyundai and Kia, it turns out, submitted data to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that overstated the fuel economy on some 1.2 million of their 2011, 2012 and 2013 cars by one to six miles per gallon depending on the model. Similarly, they understated the global warming emissions of their fleets by some 4.75 million metric tons over the estimated lifetime of the vehicles. According to the EPA, that's equivalent to the emissions produced by power plants generating electricity for more than 400,000 homes for a year.
Corporate "Counterfeit Science"?
While Hyundai has apologized, it admits only to "procedural errors" in testing in the settlement of the case. But the facts presented by the EPA--and the size of the penalty--speak for themselves. Hyundai cherry-picked the data to submit numbers that made their cars seem greener and more fuel-efficient than they actually were. At the same time, the company heavily advertised about its cars' fuel economy and built its brand in part by attracting Americans interested in saving money on gas and lowering their emissions.
More importantly, though, Hyundai's inflated numbers follow an all-too familiar pattern of companies distorting or suppressing facts about their products. The auto industry has seen a lot of such behavior recently, from GM's efforts to sweep its deadly ignition switch under the rug to more recent allegations that Honda failed to disclose known defects in the Takata airbags found in many of today's car models.
But other fields are at least as rife with corporate counterfeit science, from the sugar industry's well-documented efforts to misrepresent the science about the adverse health effects of its product to the ongoing disinformation campaign underwritten by many fossil fuel companies to distort the truth about climate science.
The Irony and the Tragedy
One irony in Hyundai's case is that the company was selected earlier this year by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) as the 2014 " greenest automaker ." Dave Cooke, a vehicles analyst at UCS, explains that the data used by UCS in the determination all came after Hyundai had corrected its erroneous submissions which were first disclosed by EPA in November 2012.
In other words, Hyundai earned the designation fairly with an overall fleet that actually does have the best fuel economy in the industry. Still, Cooke says, that doesn't excuse submitting inflated numbers to the government. "It's crucial that consumers have access to accurate information. The real tragedy here is that this kind of incident erodes public confidence in the process."
Real-World Complaints
Hyundai's misrepresentations were uncovered by the EPA back in 2012 in audits commissioned after consumer complaints by owners of Hyundai and Kia cars when their real-world miles per gallon were significantly less than advertised on those government-certified stickers in the showroom.
In November 2012, Hyundai responded to EPA's findings by correcting the fuel economy ratings and establishing a reimbursement program to compensate owners for the increased fuel costs they incurred due to the overstated numbers. Now, with the recent penalty, EPA is not only levying the largest-ever fine for a violation of the Clean Air Act, but the Hyundai Motor Group will have to reform its own testing procedures at its Korean test facility as well as arrange for a separate team to independently audit its vehicles in the U.S. at an estimated cost of $50 million. The company will also forfeit emission credits technically worth upwards of $200 million. As Cooke notes, while the fine amounts to only about $100 per vehicle, EPA's action "definitely sends an important message" to automakers that the agency will insist upon accurate information in its fuel economy and emissions ratings.
Need for Independent Oversight
The Hyundai case, like so many others, underscores the importance of government oversight in the automotive field and elsewhere. In today's polarized political climate, with many voices calling for shrinking the federal government, it's important to remember the extent to which we rely on the integrity of the scientific data used in reporting and upon the independent analysis of government scientists and inspectors to ensure the safety of everything from our food and drugs to our nearby nuclear power plants.
The EPA deserves credit in this case, both for investigating this case and levying a record penalty. As EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy rightly explained, the settlement upholds the integrity of the nation's fuel economy and emissions programs and supports all Americans who want to save fuel costs and reduce their environmental impact. As McCarthy put it: "Businesses that play by the rules shouldn't have to compete with those breaking the law."

Top 10 Greatest Business Books of All TimeGo ahead and Google or Bing the phrase "Top 10 Business Books" and you get nearly 1.8 Trillion returns.
That in itself leads you to realize that this is an extremely important subject on this planet.
Everybody who is somebody from Forbes and Huffington Post to bloggers like Fernando Biz and Nicola Cairncross have chimed in at one point over the past few years to list for you what they feel are the pivotal "reads" in the world of success and entrepreneurship.
There is definitely no shortage of websites that have found it important to let the world know that there are at least 10 critical books that you need to read that will influence your way of thinking, make you a better person and give you the drive, direction and determination to become a business, financial and personal success in your lifetime.
So why in the hell would I think that I have anything else to offer on this subject?
Because, my fellow Survive55 followers, if you have been following my blog over the past 2 years and you find what I have to say (at times) interesting and helpful then you realize that we are cut from the same metal.
No,  we are not Steve Jobs or Marc Andreessen or Warren Buffet  but we want to be the next Salman Kahn, E.L.James or Julien Smith.
As we begin living in our 50s,  we have reached an impasse in our lives that involves great decisions and risk and we are all looking for something that will make us whole and satisfied and complete as we enter our retirement years.
This involves the basic tenants of financial security, working at a job/profession/skill that we love and making sure that we are truly going to make an impact on our worlds and leave, at least, a small yet important legacy for the future.
You might ask yourself: " Jay, where does your credibility come from?"
Well, although I may not be on the radar for Time magazine's top 100 most influential people of the past 100 years I still have done a decent job building a pretty solid resume.
I started in college by building and running my own business (remember there was no internet back then) which I sold off to join the corporate world.
Through the years, I successfully worked my way through a series of management and sales positions (considered the easiest job you make no money at or the toughest job you make lots of money at) spending the last 15 years in middle management positions with a couple of Fortune 200 companies.
And all of this time I have read.
I love to read and I love to learn.
I have read most of the books on the Forbes and Time Magazine and Huffington Post "must read" business books lists.
I have books in my office, in my bedroom, in the study and even in my bathroom.
My philosophy is to not waste time, so, if all else fails, I read.
That being said, I will share my list with you not so much as the consummate authority on which books are the best ever written on the subject but to offer you some insight from someone just like you.
You won't be a failure if you don't read these books and you won't become a success either just by reading them.
That comes from within.
My hope is that you take what you read in these books and build an entire life success path from their teachings.
But, I would be just as satisfied to know that you found at least one lesson or idea from just one of these books and you used it for a few months or even a couple of years to better yourself.
If I can take just one idea and implement it to become more successful then, to me,  that is money well spent.
Most of these books have changed my way of  thinking, given me strength to take risks I never would have and some have given me specific knowledge on how to improve my "under nourished" life skills that I was not using to their potential previously.
Each book I read allowed me to grow in different ways.
This list is in reverse order with the most influential book being listed last.
Top 10 Greatest Business Books of All Time
I hope you enjoy them.
10. Hard Sell (2005) by Jamie Reidy is the best example of how not to learn by example.
Reidy writes about his experiences as a pharmaceutical sales rep during the time when Viagra exploded on the drug scene.
His humorous look at big drug corporations and the ways in which their sales reps spent more time trying to work less is a testament to the fact that perception is not always reality.
9. Crush It! (2009) by Gary Vaynerchuck has a raw inspiration for driving you to believe in what you do and making sure that you enjoy yourself as you pursue your true passion in life.
This was one of the key books in my decision to finally launch my own website and blog.
Gary writes in a "no excuses" style as he takes you through developing your own "brand," building support communities, marketing your passion and most importantly making money while you are at it.
8.  Outliers - The Story of Success (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell
I wish I thought like Malcolm Gladwell.
This book launched the notion of taking 10,000 hours to get good at something.
Malcolm looks at success in a completely different (yet factual) way summarizing that it is achieved through a combination of intelligence (both IQ and emotional intelligence), luck (opportunities and timing), cultural context and hard work (the much-reported 10,000 hours).
I have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books (Blink, The Tipping Point, What the Dog Saw, David and Goliath) and recommend them all.
7. Jack Straight From the Gut (2001) by Jack Welch
If you want to learn about the world of big business why not learn from the best Jack Welch, former CEO of GE for 20 years.
This is a straight forward exercise on his rise to power, the pitfalls he encountered, the mistakes he made and the business systems that he forged and built.
No one can ever talk about modern business without referring back to his "Six Sigma" process, the "boundary less" leadership style and his "give and take" decision making style that centered around his intense focus on people.
6. In Business As In Life - You Don't Get What You Deserve, You Get What You Negotiate (1996) by Chester L. Karrass
This book is built upon the foundation created by his previous two books "The Negotiating Game" and "Give and Take" as well as the world renowned Karrass Negotiation Seminars.
The title says it all.
I read all three books and took both levels of the Karrass Negotiation Seminars.
There isn't a business or person decision I make now without utilizing something I have learned from this man.
Whether it's striving for a "Win-Win" solution, handling deadlocks or negotiating for long-term goals I am constantly using the tools and techniques I gained through his instruction.
5. The 4-Hour Workweek (2007) by Tim Ferriss has got to be the 'bible' for those looking to live more and work less, leave the corporate rat race, become location independent and/or fund the lifestyle you have been dreaming about.
This is a nuts and bolts approach to building a business that works for you and not the other way around.
When you read this book you will realize that it's not so much about working 4 hours a week but creating a business and lifestyle where you direct what happens as opposed to being pushed along by what happens.
There are a multitude of practical tips and case studies that help you reinvent how you should do business from ecommerce shortcuts to outsourcing repetitive tasks to taking frequent "mini-retirements."
This book remains on my desk still today and I refer to it constantly for direction.
4. The Little Red Book of Selling (2004) by Jeffrey Gitomer
In my opinion, Jeffrey Gitomer is the guru of sales.
This book as well as his entire "Little Book" series is a must have sales book for anyone working as a sales person or aspiring to become one.
It is loaded with small bite-sized pieces of expert "how to sell" information and sales techniques that inspire and encourage the reader to become the expert in sales as well as in the industry in which they sell for.
It is an excellent refresher for the seasoned sales person.
This sales book is such an easy read, although it is not something that you will read in one sitting.
If there is such a thing as a "devotional" for sales, then the Little Red Book of Selling would be that book.
As I read through it, almost each chapter (if not every page) encourages the reader to stop and think.
It gets the wheels of the imagination turning on how to improve and master the sales techniques that you are now using or if you are a beginner in sales, it turns the light on to what you should be doing to succeed.
This is one book that I would not pass by.
Having this on your bookshelf will be a key sales tool that will be referred to again and again.
3. The Art of Strategy (1988) by R.L. Wing
This is, in my opinion, the best in a long line of books translating the strategies and tactics outlined in the classic "The Art of War" by the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu.
This is a book that needs to be reread every couple of years.
The Art of War touches all aspects of life not just business.
Sun Tzu believed that victory (in any circumstance) is won long before confrontation and insisted that a skilled warrior (businessman, sales person, etc.) observes, calculates, outwits and outmaneuvers his adversaries averting the destruction and fall out from direct battle.
This translation by R.L. Wing is a clean and crisp direct translation of the original 13 "Chapters" written by Sun Tzu which lends itself to the original harmony and rhythm of the words and philosophies.
2. Think and Grow Rich (Original 1937) by Napoleon Hill
This is the single best selling personal success book of all times.
It is a "Must Read".
I have given copies to my entire family as gifts.
Every chapter and every paragraph outlines the basic money making practices of over 500 extremely wealthy people that Napoleon Hill analyzed and examined over long periods of time.
This book outlines the "secret" to success which is really no secret at all.
Think like the rich.....think how you can be rich......think, think, think.
If you are clueless as to how to become successful in your life then read this book and convince yourself that you can be successful.
1.    The Little Engine That Could (Original 1930) by Watty Piper.
You will probably never find this book listed on anyone else's top 10 best business books or any other top 10 books list.
I don't know why since it brings to life in a most simplistic way the single most important lesson to be learned by anyone that wants or needs to be successful.
Even before reading all of the proceeding 9 books, if you don't master the wisdom of "I Think I Can" then everything else is fruitless.
I realize that it is a child's book but the message is ageless.
If you have made a decision to change your life, master your future and experience your life to the fullest then start with reading this book.
I knew you could !!!
So there you have it, my Top 10 Greatest Business books of all times.
Did you notice that a great majority of these books are not only platforms to improve your business skills but your life skills as well?
If you don't become the best person you can be then your business and financial success will never be the best either.
I am sure that everyone who reads this list has read books that have changed their lives and redirected their business strategies.
I would love to hear your choices.

Government imposes fresh restrictions on overseas travels by bureaucrats

bureaucrats
(The order stipulates that…)
NEW DELHI: The government today imposed fresh curbs on foreign tours by bureaucrats saying that they should restrict their overseas visits to four in a year.
"No officer should undertake more than four official visits abroad in a calendar year. For visits exceeding four by an officer, detailed justification would need to be furnished and such visits would be allowed only in exceptional cases depending on functional need," said an office order.
The order further stipulates that travel expenses for officials for participating in conferences, study tours and presentation of papers should be borne by the sponsors.
"Proposals for participation in conferences/seminars/ conventions/workshop/study tours/presentation of papers abroad at government cost will not be entertained except those that are fully funded by sponsoring/inviting organisations which may be considered keeping in mind the public interest and the government business at home," the order said.
It said that the size of the delegation and the duration of the visit should be kept at "absolute minimum".
As regards the foreign visits by Secretary level officers, it said they should not go abroad unless their presence is essential and the officers of the level of Additional Secretary or Joint Secretary cannot be substituted for them.
Foreign travel by the officers at the expense of PSUs, it said, should be discouraged, unless the journey is undertaken specifically in connection with the affairs of the concerned PSU.
"Wherever the expenditure on the visit of the government officials is borne by PSUs, the entitlements of the officers shall remain as his entitlements under the Government rules," the order said.
The government had last month baned first class air travel by officers and asked them to effectively use videoconferencing facility.
It had also asked them to keep their travel expenses within the budgetary limit.

Aadhaar likely to be mandatory for issuance of passport
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 05.27AM IST
(In the new process, the applicant,…)
NEW DELHI: Government is planning to make Aadhaar mandatory for issue of passports and is in the process of establishing a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
The issue was discussed threadbare at a meeting between the Ministries of the Home and the External Affairs, official sources said today.
The MEA is working with the Unique Identification Authority of India to implement it and the process is expected to be completed by the end of this month.
In the new process, the applicant, if not in possession of an Aadhaar card, has to produce the Aadhaar enrolment number.
The move has been taken up as per the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has favoured faster passport services in a transparent and simplified manner to the citizens.
A number of complaints are being received regularly by the government related to police verification for passports and consequent delay in issuance of the travel document.
The MEA had a meeting with the National Crime Record Bureau, under the Home Ministry, and the latter confirmed that they will be able to establish a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
"NCRB has confirmed that they will be able to set up the validation mechanism within two months. Once this is established, the criminal antecedents of the applicants for all categories will be validated on NCRB database before passport issuance," an official note prepared on the issue said.
The MEA is of the view that when an applicant already has an Aadhaar card or has applied for, his identity to a major extent is established -- this needs to be confirmed by UIDAI.
Therefore, based on NCRB validation and the applicant's self declaration on the aspects of citizenship, criminal antecedents, criminal proceedings, summons/ warrants etc. the passport can be issued on post-police verification basis.
While granting the passport, the applicant will also be given the address of police station which is responsible for the police verification so that the applicant can also actively pursue and complete the process of verification before travelling abroad.
"In the event of any wrong declaration by the applicant, the passport will be impounded/ revoked as per specified procedure," the note said.
Though all the applicants in their passport application forms specifically declare information relating to their nationality, criminal antecedents, pendency of court proceedings, warrants/ summons etc. over a period of time, the government agencies, institute the police verification mechanism to verify the provisions that have been referred in the Passport Act.
The present practice is that police verification is required for issue of fresh passports if the applicant does not apply under the Tatkal category.
For the Tatkal category, additional documents, including verification certificate, are required. Also, in the case of re-issue passports, passports are issued without reference to the police, based on the self declaration of the applicants.
  After the receipt of police verification reports, passports are issued within a week. Passports are also issued within a week of application in respect of minor applicants, re-issue cases, Tatkaal etc. in which police verification is not required or is done on post-verification basis.
The move came after a U-turn by the Home Ministry from its earlier stand and coming out in full support of Aadhaar scheme saying it will facilitate "anytime, anywhere, anyhow" authentication to its beneficiaries.
In a letter to all state governments, the Home Ministry had last month said that since one Aadhaar number is allotted only to one person, it allows universal verification of one's identity.
"Since Aadhaar is based on the demographic and biometric information of an individual, it eliminates the threat of any fraud and bogus activity.
"Aadhaar will provide its possessor with universal identification. (It) will facilitate 'anytime, anywhere, anyhow' authentication to its beneficiaries (and) be a single source of identity verification," the Home Ministry had said.
The ministry's stand on Aadhaar is in complete reversal of the position taken by it under two predecessors of Home Minister Rajnath Singh -- Sushilkumar Shinde and P Chidambaram.
During the UPA regime, the Home Ministry had raised concerns over the sanctity of the the Unique Identification Authority of India's database, saying uniqueness of identity was not a necessary condition for ensuring authenticity of identity or genuineness of other entries or records of Aadhaar numbers.
The ministry had also flagged concerns over supporting documents submitted by people as proof of identity and proof of address for getting an Aadhaar number.

How the good fat  burns calories and could help treat type 2 diabetes and obesityBy Abby Phillip November 10 Follow @abbydphillip
A 15-year-old boy with type 2 diabetes checks his blood sugar. A better understanding of "brown fat" could lead to new treatments for the condition. (Richard A. Lipski/The Washington Post)
By now, you may have heard about brown adipose tissue , or "brown fat." It is a type of fat, most likely present in all humans, that is a super calorie burner.
In recent years, a renewed interest in brown fat has revealed some promising attributes. Not only does brown fat play a role in warming up the body in cold temperatures, but by doing that, it is also an extraordinarily efficient calorie burner. And while some people may have more of this fat than others, there are ways of increasing the amount of brown fat in your body.
A new study has unveiled a piece of the puzzle in the emerging research into this remarkable tissue. Brown fat, it turns out, acts as a "super vacuum" to suck up excess glucose (sugar) in the blood by producing large amounts of a substance that transports glucose into the brown fat cells, where it can be burned to produce heat -- a process called thermogenesis.
"If you can start the tissue to burn and produce heat, then you can actually in a way take away excess glucose in the blood," said Tore Bengtsson, one of the study's authors and a professor of physiology at Stockholm University in Sweden. "Now we actually understand how this production of these glucose transporters work."
Brown fat cells do this at a more efficient rate than other mechanisms the body uses to absorb glucose in the blood. When activated, the brown fat cells produce 10 or more times the amount of glucose transporters than insulin, for example, according to Bengtsson.
For people with type 2 diabetes, whose bodies do not use insulin properly and as a result have elevated blood glucose levels, these findings could lead to new drugs that can activate brown cells and reduce blood glucose levels without insulin.
More than 29 million Americans live with type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association . And more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; obesity can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes .
"The implication of this is normally when you have type 2 diabetes you have to inject insulin to reduce your blood sugar levels," Bengtsson said. "However you could make a medicine which is not based on insulin signalling. It's a completely new pathway that can be targeted for taking up glucose in the blood."
The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology on Monday, helps to connect the dots between years of findings suggesting that better understanding brown tissue can lead to new treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The tissue, which is typically found around the neck and spinal cord, is more present in the body when you are young; people who are overweight or obese tend to have less of it.
Initially, beyond infants who need the heat-producing tissue to maximize survival in the first days and months of life, scientists didn't fully understand whether adult humans had and used brown tissue. But recent research has also found that the amount of brown tissue grows in cold weather or when people are exposed to cold environments. Conversely, it declines in warm environments.
The findings support what scientists believe are the evolutionary origins of the tissue. In mammals and in humans, it helps regulate body temperature by converting glucose and free fatty acids in the blood into heat that the body might need to survive in colder temperatures.
"Brown fat has been investigated for a very long time in small mammals," noted Bengtsson. "Five or six years ago, we actually understood that we had brown fat in humans and the brown fat is working in humans -- not only in infant humans but in adults."
Bengtsson said that he is working on the next step in the research -- looking for specific ways of activating the cells, which will be crucial for the development of new drugs.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

CVC in the dark a month after Health Ministry appointedCVOPrint
Written by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:41 am
The Health Ministry has appointed a new chief vigilance officer without informing the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), barely three months after it ousted AIIMS CVO Sanjiv Chaturvedi on the grounds that his appointment wasn’t approved by the CVC.
Following repatriation of Vishwas Mehta, who was holding charge as CVO, to his parent cadre, the ministry gave Manoj Jhalani, joint secretary, the additional charge from October 10 for three months. But the CVC was kept in the dark.
“A CVO can be appointed for three months without the CVC’s prior approval, but the ministry is yet to inform us about the appointment,” a senior CVC official told The Indian Express.
As per the CVC manual, “suitable arrangements in vacancies for three months… due to leave or other reasons” is permitted without the CVC’s prior approval, but “the nature and duration of the vacancy” and the name of the officer must be reported to the Commission.
A month after Jhalani’s appointment, the CVC website still lists Mehta as the CVO of the Health Ministry. In its communications to the ministry on October 21 and 22, the Commission continued to address Jhalani’s predecessor as CVO.
The Health Ministry did not follow the due process — of furnishing a panel of names in the order of preference, along with their bio-data and complete ACR dossiers for the Commission’s prior approval — though it knew well ahead that a new CVO would have to be appointed once Mehta, who was on a three-month extension, left for his parent cadre on October 9.
J P Nadda, who replaced Harsh Vardhan as Health Minister Sunday, had repeatedly sought the removal of AIIMS CVO Chaturvedi on the ground that his appointment was not approved by the CVC, prompting Vardhan to rustle up signatures of 20 Health Ministry officials in 24 working hours between August 13 and 14 to remove Chaturvedi
The CVC has since taken cognizance of Chaturvedi’s petition against his removal and on October 22 sought the ministry’s response at the earliest. The IFS officer has accused the ministry of concealing facts and alleged that Nadda committed forgeries to force his removal.
Health Secretary Lov Verma did not respond to queries.

Reducing friction with judiciary my priority: SadanandaGowdaD V Sadananda Gowda taking charge as the Union Minister for Law & Justice in New Delhi on Monday. Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ananthkumar is also seen. (Source: PTI)

Newly appointed Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda Monday said there was a need to find a “new mechanism” to reduce the friction between the executive and judiciary.
“There are two issues. One is regarding electoral (reforms). The other is with regard to the judiciary and executive. The second one is a very big issue and we should find out some mechanism to work it out and also see that a new line of thinking is there,” he told reporters after taking over.
He rejected suggestions that he had been downgraded from Railway Ministry to the Law and Justice Ministry, saying that as a minister his job was to implement the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to appoint ministers,” he said.
Addressing mediapersons, Gowda also said reducing the number of litigations by government agencies and weeding out obsolete laws would be his priority.

Gets going  asks officials to prepare whitepaperPrint
Suresh Prabhu takes charge as the Union Minister for Railways at Rail Bhawan in New Delhi on Monday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:30 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 8:38 am
Within 20 minutes of taking charge at Rail Bhawan on Monday, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu made it clear that he means business.
He is learnt to have directed the Railway Board to prepare a white paper that can help him chart a roadmap for his ministry. He has also told board members to not bring files to him for signatures for the time being.
Speaking to The Indian Express, a member of the board said: “He (Prabhu) has said we must prepare a document outlining our priorities, necessities and a plan for turnaround. After finalisation, the minister may present it in the Parliament during Winter Session”. He added,
“Prabhu has also said that files related to tenders and similar matters should not be brought to him for the time being. Instead, we must look into them.”
Spurred by the minister’s directive, the railway board held a special meeting on Monday evening and decided to prepare material for the document. The officials will need to give Prabhu an update when he meets the board again.
Sources said Prabhu had told the board to chalk out “measurable, achievable targets and deliverables” for an overall turnaround against which the ministry’s performance can be gauged.
The last time Railways prepared such a document was during the term of Mamata Banerjee who unveiled a white paper on the ministry’s finances to debunk her predecessor Lalu Prasad’s claims of a cash-rich Railways. She had also released what is known as Vision 2020.
A highly-placed source said Prabhu inquired about the status of appointments and promotions in the ministry, but could not go into the details for want of time. Officials, however, expect Prabhu to bring up the matter again.
Meanwhile, the Railway Board’s first meeting with Prabhu has landed it in a conflict with the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways, whose meeting was scheduled for 11am Monday. Members of the Dinesh Trivedi-led committee was said to be livid when none of the board members showed up and the MPs had to wait for a good half-an-hour. The angry MPs also threatened to initiate proceedings against the board.
Sources said Trivedi had told Chairman of the board that he could come in for the meeting late since the new minister was taking over, but the rest of the members should arrive on time. Oblivious to this, Prabhu held his first Board meeting at around 11am for which all members had to be present.
A Standing Committee member told The Indian Express that the meeting could not take place as the MPs treated this as a show of disrespect. Sources said one board member had to pursue Trivedi outside Parliament to explain that it was a just a matter continued…

LKG student molested in Kolkata  school facesprotestsPrint
By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:21 am
An LKG student of a reputed south Kolkata school was allegedly molested on November 3. The incident took place when children from G D Birla Centre for Education of Ranikuthi were participating in a cultural programme along with students of two other schools at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.
According to the complaint, the six-year-old girl was molested on her way to washroom by the driver and the helper of a Volvo bus, hired by the school to ferry the students to the venue. The child had complained about the incident to the school maid, who earlier had asked the accused to accompany her to the washroom. She, however, did not pay heed to it, police said.
When the girl returned home, she was bleeding profusely and had to be treated at a private hospital. Her parents met the school authorities with a medical report of the child the next day, but the school allegedly tried to hush up the incident on the grounds that it might tarnish the school’s reputation and also affect the child’s future.
The school authorities had assured the parents of an internal inquiry into the incident and allegedly asked them not to file a police complaint. The authorities, however, did not take any action against the accused, forcing the several parents to protest in front of the school on Monday morning. Initially, the school refused the allegations, but later conceded that such an incident was reported to them.
Vijaya Bharadwaj, vice principal of the school, said, “The aayah (maid) has been suspended, and police have been intimated about the incident. We are also carrying out an internal inquiry.” A press statement later issued by the school said it had conducted a thorough internal probe to identify the offender, but the allegations were found “contradictory”. “The school management is and will continue to extend full cooperation. The school is also making extra security arrangement in all the buses,” it said.
The school authorities also said the matter had been brought to the notice of officials of Jadavpur Police Station. Santosh Pandey, DC (south suburban division) said, “We have started an inquiry. We hope there will be an identification within two days.”
State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said he had sought a complete report of the incident from the school authorities.

A Q&A with man behind Chicago s first Shake Shack1
Q: Why should someone come to Shake Shack instead of any other of the "better burger" places?
A: The first thing I would say is, don't come to Shake Shack instead of your favorite place. We may never be your favorite place. We may never be your favorite Chicago style hot dog. In fact, we don't even do it authentically well. We lost the neon from the relish ... (Meyer said a supplier wouldn't put the coloring in) … I would say come to Shake Shack and soak in the full experience … It may not be the same hospitality you get at Gold Coast or the Wieners Circle, but it's not bad.
Q: Talk a little about the local vendors you're using for this location.
A: We found that frozen custard has been a fantastic canvas for bringing in local bakers, doughnut makers, sometimes coffee roasters, sometimes beer producers.
The Publican is making our sausage for us. The sandwich is topped with our own fried shallots that have been marinating in Shackmeister ale (a beer exclusive to the chain) and then deep fried, and our own cheese sauce, but the sausage is made right here by someone we respect a lot.
Mark Rosati, our culinary director, was working at Gramercy Tavern before Shake Shack. Whenever we go to a new city, Mark will stay there for up to a month meeting chefs, meeting butchers, meeting bakers and literally tasting his way through the city looking for who he thinks is the best version. In Istanbul, he found the best producer of baklava, and that goes into one of our frozen custard desserts. It's fun, because it takes us longer to do it that way but it ends up feeling like we didn't just land on someone else's city like the house in the "Wizard of Oz" landed on the witch's legs.
Q: What do you think of the dining scene in Chicago?
A: I love it. I was just here two weeks ago and I went to a place I adore, which is one block away, called Joe's. I'm also a fan of the James Beard set. … I love the city. It's a very, very particular type of food town. On one hand, Chicago seems to me to be more traditional meat and potatoes food than you'll find in any other town in the country, and then on the other extreme Chicago is willing to push the boundaries of avant garde more than many, many cities. It's kind of fascinating to have both ends of that spectrum represented in one city.
Q: Food costs have gone up in general. How are you keeping control of that?
A: We are using all natural beef from an amazing farm in Kansas called Creekstone. It's no growth hormones, no antibiotics, it's the best of the best. And the price has, in one year, gone up probably a good 60 percent. And, meanwhile, we're trying to keep a lid on our prices (The mainstay ShackBurger costs $4.95 ). We're getting hurt by it, but we just feel that a huge part of this story is value. If you're someone who always ate fast food, for a couple of dollars more you can eat the same quality that you would get in one of our fine dining restaurants. If you're someone who is used to eating in our fine dining restaurants, for a whole lot less you can have the exact same quality. So, we love where this is positioned. I would call this category fine casual. It's certainly not fast. Pricing is a big pressure point.

Six closed Robert Vadra cos under corporate affairs ministrys lensSix closed Robert Vadra cos under corporate affairs ministry’s lens?
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 08, 2014

Problems for Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, may not end with the shutting down of six of his companies, which have bought properties and land in Rajasthan and Haryana.
The corporate affairs ministry will scrutinise the records of these companies and see why these companies have not been filing any annual returns.
Four of Vadra’s companies — Lifeline Agrotech Pvt Ltd, Greenwave Agro Pvt Ltd, Rightline Agriculture Pvt Ltd and Primetime Agro Pvt Ltd — have been dissolved, while two more, Future Infra Agro Pvt Ltd and Best Seasons Agro Pvt Ltd will be dissolved soon. Vadra was managing director in all these companies.
HT had first reported on July 8  that Vadra was shutting down these companies.
Denying all allegations, Suman Khaitan and Co, advocates and notaries, representing Vadra, said in a letter that the six companies have been closed or are in the process of closing because these companies have not done any business whatsoever. “These are private companies and our client is well within his right to close these companies lawfully. You may kindly note that since none of these six companies ever transacted any business, there is no question of any of these six companies having ever recorded any profit,” the letter said.
“If any prima facie evidence of illegality or wrongdoing is found, investigations could continue even after the companies cease to exist,” a senior official in the corporate affairs ministry said on condition of anonymity.
“The law will be followed and it does not matter whether a company has been shut or not,” he said. The companies that have been shut down or are in the process of being shut down have not filed annual returns or balance sheets since their incorporation.
“We need to see why these companies have never filed any returns and if there are any discrepancies in their records,” the official said.
“Winding up companies will not impact ongoing or future investigations into alleged offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act against directors or officers of such companies,” said Manoj Kumar, managing partner of law firm Hammurabi & Solomon.
There has been alleged discrepancies surrounding Vadra’s acquisition of land in some states. Reports have alleged windfall gains by Vadra due to undue favours by the previous Congress government, which was voted out of power in Haryana last month.

Refrain from high-pitched scrutiny: CBDT to taxmenComments
Seeking to usher in a non-adversarial tax regime, the Central Board of Direct Taxes  has asked officials to refrain from high-pitched tax assessments without proper basis and deal with assessees in a time-bound manner.
The CBDT also asked all its officials to maintain cleanliness in office and punctuality in appointments while avoiding unnecessary adjournments.
Though less that 1% of returns filed are selected for scrutiny, this area of work has often drawn adversarial comments.
Supervisory officers have been directed to play a more pro-active role in monitoring assessments to ensure that lengthy questionnaires or summons without due application of mind are avoided.
Taxmen have also been asked to ensure that inspections and reviews are done according to guidelines issued to enable capacity building within the department and accountability of officers.
Revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das had maintained that the key objective of the IT department is to foster a transparent non-adversarial tax regime while reducing the interface between tax officials and assessees. “We want full transparency and non-adversarial tax regime,” Das told HT earlier.
Several discussions have also been held between the CBDT and the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) on the issue. All supervisory authorities have been directed to enable an effective grievance-redressal system in their jurisdictions while adhering to timelines.
According to a finance ministry statement, senior officers have been directed to ensure that appeals are filed only on the merits and not merely on the tax effect involved. “Cases have separately been brought to the attention of officers wherein tribunals / courts have commented adversely on frivolous filing of appeals,” the statement said.

Will doggedly pursue reforms  but easier ones first: JaitleyIt was a rare evening when finance minister Arun Jaitley and his immediate predecessor, P Chidambaram, came together to candidly reflect on the 2014 elections, Congress’ mistakes, BJP’s successes, and the state of the economy.
 
Among other issues, Jaitley said the government would “doggedly pursue reforms” – but made it clear that the easier ones to implement would happen first. Chidambaram implored the NDA to reverse retrospective taxation introduced by his own government, and said that UPA should have cancelled the 2G licences on its own without waiting for a court order.
 
The occasion was the launch of senior television journalist and HT columnist Rajdeep Sardesai’s book 2014- The Election That Changed India.
 
Stating that his agenda was clear for the next two years, Jaitley said there was a renewed buzz about India and international investors were enthusiastic.
 
“We will doggedly pursue reforms,” he said, but added that there were different kinds of reforms – the ones easy to implement, the ones which needed larger consensus, and the difficult ones within the current realpolitik framework.
 
“You have to survive to reform. Reforms which are difficult and can create a confrontation in society…can happen at a later stage in government.”
 
Jaitley was responding to the perception that the government was not using its massive political capital to push early reforms. This approach, he said, was better than “pursuing confrontation and then saying we can’t do it.”
 
Chidambaram took issue with the FM, and said he felt “let down” that the government had not reversed retrospective taxation – which Jaitley was quick to point out was a problem of UPA’s making. “If I had 282, I would have done it,” Chidambaram said.
 
The former finance minister accepted certain things could have been done differently by UPA. “On 2G, the PM could have put his foot down and said we will not allow the first come, first served route or when the issue emerged, the government could have cancelled licences.”
 
Chidambaram said he had made such a suggestion in government “informally, in group and committee meetings” that this would be wiser than waiting for the court judgment, which was “damaging”.
 
He said that the government, maybe, held back because there was a perception this may drag it into numerous litigations with licence holders. “But I believed it was a simple decision...it might have contained the damage considerably.”
 
Looking back at the elections, Jaitley said this was a markedly different poll as it reversed the assumption that the era of tall leaders, of single-party majorities was over. “Traditional trends did not work. Parties which relied on caste loyalties did reasonably badly. And parties which relied on charisma of leaders, dynasties also did badly across the country.”
 
Chidambaram was also willing to credit the vigour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign. “Modi brought qualities which enhanced the scale and magnitude of BJP’s victory.”
 
But he said that if the UPA had been able to bring back the economy on track by 2013-14, the results would have been different – “even though BJP would still probably have been the biggest party”.
 
“The consensus worldwide was the answer to the great recession was Keynesian economics, spending money. We had three consecutive stimuli packages. This breached all limits of fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, inflation," Chidambaram said.
 
The government had been unable to recover from this period, with adverse global economic events making the task more difficult, he added. 
 
The conversation, moderated by journalist Karan Thapar, was laced with wit  – when the two leaders traded accusations about which party had opportunistically changed their positions on raising FDI insurance caps depending on whether they were in government or opposition; or when Chidambaram said that Jaitley’s advice to the CAG not to sensationalise had come a “bit late”.
 
In his wide-ranging book, Sardesai has documented the impressive backroom strategising of the Modi team as well as the PM’s energy, while tracing the many missteps of the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress campaign.

Stock markets retreat from record highs on profit-bookingComments
Markets took a breather after a record-breaking run with benchmark Sensex on Friday dipping about 47 points to close at 27,868.63 on the back of modest profit-taking in metal, capital goods and power sector shares.
In a volatile session, the 30-share BSE index Sensex resumed slightly lower at 27,902.71 and moved in a range of 27,980.93 and 27,739.56 before concluding at 27,868.63, down 47.25 points or 0.17%.
The index has risen in 5 of last 7 days. "Local equities saw profit booking after hitting all time highs on Wednesday," said Jignesh Chaudhary, head of research, Veracity Broking Services.
In the previous session on Wednesday, the 30-share Sensex had ended at its all-time closing high of 27,915.88 after touching an intra-day record high of 28,010.39.
Continued foreign fund inflows on government's reform push amid hopes of a rate cut by the RBI had fuelled the rally.
The CNX 50-share Nifty moved down by 1.30 points, or 0.02%, to finish at 8,337.00. "...sentiments were on the negative side in reaction to the OECD report, which lowered India's GDP growth forecast to 5.4% for this year from 5.7% earlier.
But, the downside also remained limited, tracking continuous FIIs inflow," said Jayant Manglik, president-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Asian stocks mixed on Friday after reports said European Central Bank president Mario Draghi vowed to take more easing steps to spark growth in the euro zone.
Key benchmark indices in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea rose 0.24% to 0.52% while indices in Hong Kong, China and Singapore fell 0.14 to 0.42%.
European stocks also ended narrowly mixed as investors turned their focus to the US economy before a monthly US job report.
Key benchmark indices in the UK and Germany moved up by 0.15% to 0.67% while France CAC was quoting down by 0.10%.

Blue tick on WhatsApp: Your msg has been readComments
WhatsApp just made ducking a text impossible! The messaging service has introduced a feature that will now confirm to senders that their texts had indeed been read.
The check marks that appears next to sent text will turn blue as soon as the recipient opens, accesses or reads it. So now you’ll have to say goodbye to “Uh, I didn’t see your text.”
Earlier, sent WhatsApp texts would appear with one check, in grey, to indicate the text had been sent. A double check, also in grey, would confirm successfully delivered.
“If you see two blue check marks next to your sent message, then the recipient has read your message,” said an updated WhatsApp’s frequently asked questions (FAQs) section on Friday. “In a group chat or broadcast message, the check marks will turn blue when every participant has read your message.”
You can also find out the time a message was delivered and read by pressing the message with the double tick — then holding it for a couple of seconds, before selecting “info”.
The changes will affect all versions of the app used on the Apple iPhone’s iOS, the Android operating system, as well as Windows phones, Nokias and Blackberrys.
According to reports, “this feature isn’t part of an update to the app through the App Store,” but an “over-the-air” update sent to iOS and Android builds of the app.
The Facebook-owned messaging service, which is very popular in India but has failed to take off in the US, is rumored to be planning voice over Internet protocol — letting users make phone calls.

Rolls-Royce rolls out Ghost Series II at 4.5 cr  looks to expand dealershipComments
Luxury car maker Rolls-Royce on Friday launched its latest super luxury offering – Ghost Series II – in the Indian market at Rs. 4.50 crore. It is the third model, after the Phantom and the Wraith, that the company has now on sale in India.
The Ghost Series II is powered by a 6.6 litre twin-turbo V12 engine that produces 563 PS of power. The engine is mated to a satellite-guided eight-speed transmission. The ultra-luxury car maker entered India in 2005 and has since sold 250 cars here.
“India is a key market for Rolls-Royce. We certainly see more growth. Sentiments are positive following the new government taking over,” said Sven Ritter, general manager, Asia Pacific, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, adding that the company was looking at opportunities to expand its dealership network.
Navnit Motors is Rolls-Royce’s authorised dealer in Mumbai.

Indian rupee ends lower as dollar gains ahead of US jobs dataIndian rupee ends lower as dollar gains ahead of US jobs data

The Indian rupee fell to a three-week low on Friday, continuing to track falls in emerging market currencies as sentiment turned cautious ahead of key U.S. jobs data that could help determine the timing of any U.S. interest rate hikes.
Unlike domestic bonds and shares, the rupee fell during the week tracking global gains in the dollar due to fears the Federal Reserve would move earlier than expected to tighten monetary policy.
The rupee fell 0.45 percent against the dollar in the holiday-shortened week, posting its second consecutive weekly fall.
U.S. employers were expected to have added 231,000 new jobs to their payrolls in October, with the unemployment rate forecast to hold steady at a six-year low of 5.9 percent.
"If the U.S. data turns out to be as good as market expects it to be, then the rupee could come under pressure in the coming sessions," said Uday Bhatt, a currency trader at UCO Bank in Mumbai.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.6425/6525 per dollar, weaker from Wednesday's close of 61.41/42, after earlier falling to as much as 61.6750, its lowest since Oct. 17.
The market was closed on Thursday for a local holiday. Falls came after the dollar firmed to near a 4-1/2 year high against a basket of currencies on Friday.
Still, recent falls in the rupee are smaller than other in emerging market currencies. The local unit has fallen around 0.44 percent against the greenback month-to-date, while most other Asian majors have fallen 0.75 to 2 percent.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.91/62.01, while the three-month contract was at 62.47/57.

DLF shares gain nearly 6% in early tradeDLF shares gain nearly 6% in early trade

Shares of DLF rose nearly 6% in early trade on Friday after the Securities Appellate Tribunal allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds worth Rs. 1,806 crore to meet working capital needs and service debt payments.
DLF's scrip jumped 5.64% to Rs. 133.80 on the BSE.
At the NSE, it surged 5.52% to Rs. 133.75.
In a major interim relief to DLF, the Securities Appellate Tribunal had on Wednesday allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds worth Rs. 1,806 crore to meet working capital needs and service debt payments.
DLF had sought permission to redeem money locked in mutual funds after being slapped with market regulator Sebi's ban last month that bars it from accessing the capital market for three years.
The final hearing in DLF's main appeal against the Sebi order would be held on December 10, prior to which Sebi and the company will have to file their replies with Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).
As an interim measure, SAT has allowed the company to redeem mutual funds worth Rs. 767 crore in the current month and further funds worth Rs. 1,039 crore in December.
In October, Sebi had banned DLF and six of its senior-most officials, including founder-Chairman K P Singh, from capital markets for three years. The company had challenged the ban in SAT on October 22 and sought an interim relief.

Military needs and societal valuesUpdated: November 10, 2014 01:22 IST
Military needs and societal values
Srinath Raghavan
armed Forces
The military is responsible to the political leadership, which in turn is accountable to the people. But ensuring that the military’s requirements remain subordinate to wider societal values is not easy. These requirements may well be legitimate, yet they can vitiate the democratic fabric of our polity
It is a grim irony. Ahead of the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, two Kashmiri boys are cut down by the bullets of the Indian Army . This is not just because Nehru’s birthday is celebrated as Children’s Day. Rather, the incident in Kashmir underlines the extent to which one of Nehru’s principal contributions to independent India has been undermined. Nehru’s role in nurturing democratic institutions, especially Parliament, is widely acknowledged. Less well known is his role in fostering democratic control over the military.
In theory, the lines of control in a democracy are clear: the military is responsible to the political leadership, which in turn is accountable to the people. But ensuring that the requirements of the military remain subordinate to the wider societal values and interests is not easy. These requirements may well be legitimate, yet they can vitiate the democratic fabric of our polity. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, under whose cover the boys were shot, is a good example. One of the aims of this Act was to ensure that soldiers undertaking operations in good faith were not subject to mala fide litigation. Yet, AFSPA has been used in a manner that confers impunity on the Army.

Civil-military relations
Take the Pathribal case. Five officers were named in a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charge sheet for killing civilians in a fake encounter. The Army and the government used AFSPA to stonewall and prevent prosecution for years. Eventually under pressure from the Supreme Court, the Army agreed to try them by court-martial. Unsurprisingly, the court-martial found no evidence against the officers.
Also Read: Reopen the Pathribal case
What’s more, despite widespread criticism, successive governments have been loath to repeal the Act. Their reluctance is directly proportional to the resistance from the AFSPA. Senior military officers are on record as stating that without AFSPA, the Army cannot undertake counter-insurgency operations. Such is the state of democratic control and civilian supremacy over the military.
Nehru was alert to these dangers even before he took over as Prime Minister. The British Raj was the archetypal garrison state — one that accorded primacy to its security and by extension to the military. Even in peacetime, up to half of the government’s expenditure was consumed by the armed forces. This extraordinary practice was possible owing to the institutional arrangements of civil-military relations in British India. The Commander-in-Chief of India also served as the Military Member — effectively the Defence Minister — of the Viceroy’s Executive Council. This enabled the military to have a dominant voice in the affairs of the government. In the run-up to Independence, the fusion of civil and military roles went even further. In 1943 the Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal Wavell, was appointed as the Viceroy. In its last days, then, British rule reverted to its origins as a military despotism.
Democratic control
Rectifying this state of affairs was on top of Nehru’s priorities. When the interim government took office in September 1946, the Commander-in-Chief was replaced as Defence Member by a civilian leader, Sardar Baldev Singh. Days later, Nehru instructed the Commander-in-Chief to initiate urgent reforms to nationalise the Indian Army. Recruitment, especially of officers, should be widened to reflect the composition of society. This would enable the armed forces to appreciate the values and aspirations of the country they served. Paramilitary forces should be raised to avoid using the Army for internal security and to keep it out of politics.
That said, claims about Nehru wanting to abolish the armed forces — given currency by Jaswant Singh among others — are utterly unfounded. Even a cursory acquaintance with Nehru’s published documents from that period will show up the absurdity of such assertions. What Nehru wanted was democratic control of the military. Matters were complicated by the fact that in the aftermath of Independence, India was forced to solicit the services of senior British officers. The Raj had not allowed Indians to join as officers until late in the day, so there were few Indians with experience of higher command and staff roles.
Yet, Nehru was keen to set the tone for civil-military relations from the outset. Thus, when the Commander-in-Chief issued orders to keep the public away from the flag hoisting ceremony on August 15, 1947, Nehru struck it down. He wrote to General Rob Lockhart: “In any policy that is to be pursued in the Army or otherwise, the views of the Government of India and the policy they lay down must prevail. If any person is unable to lay down that policy he has no place in the Indian Army.” Weeks later, when the British service chiefs protested against moving Indian troops against the State of Junagadh that had acceded to Pakistan, Nehru and Patel made it clear that they were prepared to sack the chiefs. Such problems did not disappear after Indian officers took over the armed forces. In the summer of 1951, the Indian Army — apprehending a Pakistani attack on Kashmir — wanted to move its armoured division close to the border in Punjab. When Nehru demurred, General Cariappa met President Rajendra Prasad and requested him to lean on the Prime Minister. Although Nehru gave in, he was not oblivious to the implications of such actions. A few months later, when Cariappa began airing his views on policy matters, such as economic development, Nehru advised him to avoid straying into these areas.
The most controversial episode was the resignation of the Army Chief, General Thimayya, in 1959. The conventional wisdom is that the resignation was spurred by Thimayya’s unhappiness with the style of functioning of the Defence Minister, Krishna Menon. In fact, the problem was Thimayya’s demand to consider Pakistan’s offer of joint defence arrangements against the backdrop of clashes between Indian and Chinese troops. The nub of the matter was policy — not personalities. Although Nehru talked Thimayya out of the resignation, he emphasised in Parliament that “civil authority is and must remain supreme.”
The 1962 war and after
The defeat against China weakened Nehru’s position vis-à-vis the Army. Thereafter, the military began to insist that civilians keep away from its “operational” turf. Unnerved by the debacle of 1962, the civilian leadership substantially conceded the demand.
Democratic control over the military weakened in Nehru’s own lifetime in other ways too. Despite his desire not to use the Army for internal security, Nehru’s hand was forced by the Naga rebellion. In 1956, as the Army was preparing to move in, Nehru instructed that the Nagas were to be treated as “fellow Indians.” The Army had to “win the hearts of people, not to terrify or frighten them.” Nehru disallowed the use of machine-guns from the air and called for the use of “moderate force.”
Yet, when Naga resistance intensified, Nehru’s government enacted AFSPA in 1958. The Act was modelled on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Ordinance of 1942 — used by the Raj to quell the Quit India Movement. The irony lay not just in the fact that Nehru and his colleagues had been imprisoned during the movement, but that the 1942 ordinance was less draconian than AFSPA. The ordinance had authorised the use of force to kill by an officer of the rank of captain or above. AFSPA allows even senior non-commissioned officers to do so.
Introducing the Bill in Parliament, Home Minister G.B. Pant stated that it would allow the Army to function more effectively in the context of the insurgency. There were dissident voices in the House. A member from Manipur memorably called it a “lawless law.” Yet it was passed without much opposition. After AFSPA was introduced, Nehru continued to keep a tab on Army operations in Nagaland and even deplored — on occasion, publicly — the loss of civilian lives. When the insurgency raged unabated, Nehru adopted a more political approach — a move that culminated in the creation of the State of Nagaland.
AFSPA, however, remained on the statute book. Over time, it came to be used with ever greater impunity and grievous consequences. As Nehru’s engagement with this issue suggests, intentions of individuals cannot substitute for appropriate institutional arrangements. AFSPA makes a mockery of democratic control over the military. The Army’s resistance to its repeal and the government’s acquiescence fly in the face of all norms of civil-military relations. This may seem like a minor problem. But as Nehru realised, unless military needs are balanced against societal values, Indian democracy could be hollowed out.

Micromax Canvas 4+ review: Good features that push limits for price rangeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
For the past year or so Micromax has been giving Samsung tough competition in the Indian hinterland with value for money smartphones. From the time it launched the Canvas Knight earlier this year, this Indian company has been clearly nurturing dreams of offering high-end specs at mid-range price points. The latest in this range is the Micromax Canvas 4+.
Specs: 5-inch HD AMOLED display |  MediaTek MT6592 1.7GHz True Octa core processor with 1GB RAM | 16GB internal storage expandable up to 32GB | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front | 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0 | Android 4.4.2 | 2000 mAh battery
Price: Rs 16,999
Design: Let’s just say this will remind you of the iPhone 3S once in a while. The phone as some bling factor thanks to the golden ring running around the bezel and golden flap on the back. The phone has a fixed back and the two SIMs and SD card go into flaps on the side. It is one of the lightest phones around, especially in this price bracket.
Display: The HD AMOLED display should be one of the selling points of this phone, but it isn’t. In the lock screen the display feels stubborn and need a good strong swipe to open. Inside, with dull colours like grey the pixels seems to show up and there is a matte finish like feel which is odd. The display is okay when the visuals are vibrant and colourful.
Performance: The octa-core processor makes this phone good for multi-tasking and some high-end gaming. There was no noticeable heating during the tests or even benchmarking. But don’t expect more than what you would from a mid range phone.
Software: Micromax still seems to believe in packing the phones with lots of software you might never use. This includes at least five Micromax apps and a few games. There is a camera widget that gives one touch access to features like selfie camera, dual shot using the front and back cameras as well as video. I also liked the simple lock screen that shows only clock.
Camera: This is among the few smartphones in this price range that gives you a 5MP front camera. This camera is good for selfies, though you will need to be in a well-lit area for the efforts to be successful. The rear camera is pretty decent too and has a totality that is rare in smartphone. The photos seem a bit underexposed, but in a good sort of way.
Storage: The phone has 16GB internal storage out of which roughly 11GB is available for users. The internal storage has a 2GB slot for system storage. You might want to buy a 16GB SD card with the phone.
Connectivity: No issues with connectivity, but we found that the FM radio seems to have antenna issues.
Battery: The battery will give you about 12 hours on a full charge. However, there seems to be apps that drain the battery quicker, like the FM radio.
Verdict: The Canvas 4+ has some good features that push the limits for the price range. But I doubt if it offers a great value proposition especially when there are other phones like the Lenovo Vibe X2 or Huawei Honor 6 offering much more at a slightly higher price tag. Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.

McDonald s October sales fall3
Same-restaurant sales fell 1 percent in the United States, less than the 1.9 percent decline analysts expected. Such sales have not increased at McDonald's since October 2013.
Under Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012, the U.S. operation is focusing on fresh ingredients and custom sandwich toppings as it seeks to compete more effectively with popular chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Subway, where diners pick the ingredients that go into their meals.
The Golden Arches also is giving restaurant operators more control over what they put on their menus and is expanding ordering to mobile devices and kiosks.
The company's shares were unchanged at $95.10 in early trading.
The changes come as McDonald's also struggles to get a leg up on smaller and more-nimble rivals such as Wendy's Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc, In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A.
“Market share declines continue to be an issue in major markets,” Stern Agee analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.
Same-restaurant sales were off 4.2 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, where analysts had estimated a 6.1 percent drop.
Diners shunned McDonald's restaurants in China and Japan after a television news expose showed workers mishandling meat at a key supplier in China. McDonald's scrambled to find new sources for ingredients to make its Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs.
Europe's comparable sales decreased 0.7 per cent due to store closures in Russia and “the significant weakening of the euro and Russian ruble.” Europe just edges out the United States as McDonald's top revenue market.

The company lowered its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $100 million-$120 million from its prior estimate of $105 million-$125 million.
Operating expenses rose 24 percent.
Net loss widened to $24.9 million, or 29 cents per share, from $18.7 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a loss of 26 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 22 percent to $104 million, above the average analyst estimate of $103.7 million.
Gogo's shares had closed at $16.64 on the Nasdaq on Friday. The stock had lost about one third of their value this year.

Black money will be key issue at G-20 says Prime Minister ModiComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said highlighting the importance of international cooperation against black money would be a “key issue” for him at the forthcoming G-20 Summit in Brisbane.

In his longest foreign tour after becoming PM, Modi will leave for Myanmar on Tuesday to take part in the India-ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit on November 12-13 followed by the G-20 meet in Brisbane on November 15-16 and a bilateral visit to Fiji Islands on November 19.
Modi will meet more than 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and the Pacific Region during his 10-day tour.
India will attempt to build consensus on a global framework for automatic sharing of information to check tax evasion during the G-20 Summit, at a time the government has stepped up efforts to bring back money stashed illegally abroad. Modi’s visit will be the bilateral visit to Australia by an Indian PM in 28 years.
“The G-20 Summit is a key forum for countries to coordinate their activities and pursue collective action to support global economic growth, stable financial markets and global trading regimes,” Modi said on the eve of his foreign tour.
He said he would also discuss how the creation of next generation infrastructure could be accelerated, including digital infrastructure.
He said a closer strategic partnership with Australia would support India’s economic goals, promote its security interests, including maritime security, and reinforce efforts to foster peace and stability in the extended continental and maritime neighbourhood.
On the Myanmar tour, Modi said ASEAN was at the core of India’s Act East Policy and the dream of an Asian century. “I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level,” the PM said.
At the East Asia Summit, the PM will discuss with other leaders ways to strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace and stability.
Modi will be the first Indian PM to visit Fiji in 33 years. “We owe them (Fiji) a debt of gratitude for hosting our scientists on the island in support of our Mars Mission.” He will meet leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations during the visit.

How to Avoid Another 1914 in Asia in 2014reddit
Asia's hitherto stable and peaceful strategic order faces pressure from the extraordinarily rapid shift in the distribution of wealth and power driven by Asia's, and especially China's, economic growth. These pressures have been most evident in the U.S.-China relationship, which inevitably forms the core element of the regional order, but they are also starkly manifest in relations between China and Japan. In each case, notwithstanding their deep economic interdependence, we have seen sharply rising levels of strategic rivalry, and a clearly increasing risk of conflict involving all three powers.
Even a short and limited conflict between them could have devastating consequences for the global economy, and there is no guarantee that it would be either short or limited. Any conflict would carry real risks of escalation which, once begun, would become harder and harder to control. We have an obligation to recognize and respond to the small but attendant risk that it could lead to a nuclear exchange.
Notwithstanding the very serious problems elsewhere, in the Middle East and eastern Europe, rising strategic tensions in Asia between the world's three richest states poses the greatest threat to global peace and prosperity today, and indeed the greatest the world would face since the end of the Cold War.
Rivalry and conflict in Asia is not inevitable, because effective action is certainly possible to avoid it. But such action must be taken, otherwise the chances of conflict will continue to grow and become, if not inevitable, then certainly very high indeed.
Effective action to address that risk must not be limited to efforts to address immediate issues of concern such as the management of maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas. Important though these are in themselves, they are only symptoms of deeper stresses in the Asian strategic order. These stresses have to be addressed and resolved directly if the region's peace and stability is to be assured.
This will require a major transformation of the U.S.-China relationship and the regional order it has supported since America's opening to China in 1972. The existing order is being eclipsed by the profound shift of weight, as China's economy has grown to rival America's as the largest in the world. For Asia to remain at peace, a new and contemporary order has to evolve -- one which accommodates Chinese as well as American power and aspirations.
To date that remains a remote prospect. On the contrary, China and America today have increasingly divergent views as to their future relationship and roles in Asia. China sees America wishing to preserve the existing order based on U.S. primacy, while it wants a new order based on what it calls a "new model of great power relations." These different perceptions drive their strategic rivalry, and they have to be resolved if their rivalry is to ease as a new and stable order in Asia is established.
There is no cogent reason to assume that their aspirations are inherently irreconcilable, as each has so much to gain from cooperation, as neither could profit from a protracted strategic contest. But reaching an accommodation will be very difficult, because it would require each country to scale back expectations about its regional role -- roles which have deep roots in their national histories and identities. Selling that to domestic audiences would take commitment and real political skill on both sides.
Notwithstanding the need, it is not apparent that either side's policymakers yet seem persuaded that accommodation is necessary. Both seem to underestimate the resolve of the other and hope that they can secure all they want because the other will back down to avoid confrontation. This is how Asia today most resembles Europe in 1914.
Determining how these risks can best be minimized requires addressing two questions. First, what characteristics might we look for in a new Asian order which offer the best prospects of regional peace and stability over the coming decades? Second, how could progress towards such an order best be initiated?  These are my suggestions.
Conceiving A New Order in Asia
We must start from the conviction that a new and stable order in Asia can be created that accommodates the shift in relative power and preserves the core interest of every regional country. There are many different models for the kind of order that could do this. But any order is much more likely to succeed if it embodies the following features:
Strong regional leadership roles in Asia for both the United States and for China, in which they share power in a relationship of equal standing.
An appropriate and secure place for both Japan and India which meets their essential security needs and provides them with a regional leadership role appropriate to their weight and standing.
Assurance for the security and well-being of the region's many middle and smaller powers.
An overarching commitment by all regional states to the core norms of international conduct embodied in the U.N. Charter, especially the prohibition on the use or threat of force to settle international disputes.
First Steps Towards a New Order in Asia
Clearly all states in the region must contribute to the creation of any new regional order. The essential first steps might best be taken through informal but focused discussions between the U.S. and China about the fundamentals of their future relationship, because closer convergence of their expectations about this is clearly necessary for progress towards a new regional order.
The most valuable first step towards such discussions would be for both China and the U.S. to communicate to one another, privately and eventually in public, their mutual acknowledgment of the need to reconcile their divergent expectations and their willingness to explore the compromises necessary to do so.
Even this first step will surely be difficult for leaders and citizens in both countries. But if due weight is given to the future of U.S.-China relations, and the future of Asia and the world,  this simple but vital first step must be taken, and taken soon.

Why Companies Should Hire Creative Peoplereddit
A colleague recently sent me a link to an article published on Linkedin earlier this year that was given a rather provocative title. "Why Companies Shouldn't Hire Creative People" by Paul Currant, an educator and, believe it or not, a novelist with enough arts degrees to wallpaper a New York City apartment, is an indictment of the modern business culture's decision to place high value on and attempt to encourage creativity in the workplace.
Basketball-hoop trash cans and "cool" office spaces -- particular bugbears for Currant -- are symptomatic of a corporate culture that has grown amnesiac as to its purpose. His advice (supported by an argument that boils down to "It worked this one time") is to return to a highly pragmatic thought process, one that elbows aside crosscurrent thinking in favor of practical, results-oriented conversations.
Internet commenters have already spent their rage, flinging the kind of ad hominen attacks at the author that make their valid critiques less persuasive, and I'm not about to follow their example and engage in fruitless mud flinging. I'm also not about to counter his argument with the equally ridiculous notion that companies should exclusively hire creatives; practical, results-oriented thinking absolutely has a vital role to play in all businesses no matter what size or what their product or service.
What I am going to do is look at Currant's six tips to a supposedly efficient but creativity-free office environment, what the consequences of putting such steps in action are, and why the lion's share of pack-leading businesses are actually doing the opposite of what Currant is suggesting. Let's take each of Currant's points in turn.
1. "No More Brainstorming" - Brainstorming is apparently a huge productivity drain. Rather than a sharing of ideas -- some good, some bad, some great, some awful -- and the ensuing separation of wheat from chaff, Currant suggests an intent focus on the bottom line, played out in meetings with nothing but "metrics and benchmarking" on the agenda. Leigh Thompson, Professor at the Kellogg School, suggests that brainstorming's tendency to congeal around low-hanging fruit may indeed be problematic, but, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, Thompson insists that the basic structure of brainstorming be retained. Her research found that "brainwriting [the process of writing out ideas prior to out-loud brainstorming meetings] generated 20 percent more ideas and 42 percent more original ideas" than brainstorming sessions. Rather than stifling creativity, forward-thinking employers are unleashing it.
2. "Copy Don't Innovate" - This one hardly deserves any comment. The world of business is moving juggernaut-like ever forward, and those who look sideways to match pace with their competitors have already fallen out of step both with them and the leaders of the pack. In Currant's model of a successful organization, the creatives have all either exited stage left or are taking their final bows; that may be an organization that is positioned reasonably well to cope with the business realities of the moment, but, without the innovation, imagination, and inspiration that creatives bring to the table, the organization will not be positioned to cope with the unique challenges that the uncertain future inevitably brings in its wake.
3. "Dismantle the Marketing Department" - The author's main beef with marketing seems to be its 'cool office.' Without any tangible reasons for the suggestion, he insists that marketing be installed "in the heart of the company." Presumably, this heart is sectioned into cubicles and communicates with the body exclusively in the language of finance. Unconventional workplaces aren't more productive in and of themselves, but, when they are an outgrowth of an employee-centric corporate culture, the results (think Google) can be utterly spectacular.
4. "Salespeople Stick to the Script" - Currant connects a spate of underhanded selling practices in the English energy industry (which resulted in sizeable fines for the companies implicated) with "'creative' selling." This is apparently evidence enough to indict all those who have thrown away their scripts in favor of a more personable approach to customer-seller relationships. Scripts are (or can be) helpful for salespeople who crave structure, and many salespeople swear by them, but tell your best salespeople that they're not allowed to deviate from the prescribed script and you'll be looking at an office practically bursting with empty, spinning chairs.
5. "No Original Sales or Marketing Strategies" - Currant poses the following mind bender: "Of course, some new sales and marketing ideas are a roaring success, but do you want to stake your job that yours will be one of the lucky few?" His solution is to, you guessed it, imitate and stick to the script. The problem is that, especially in marketing, if you're not evolving, you're decaying. Discouraging originality in your marketing department is the equivalent of flying a white flag in clear view of your competitors.
6. "Real Consequences for Failure" - I've yet to encounter an organization that rewards failure, or even one that turns a blind eye to dismal campaigns -- no matter how highly that organization has decided to value creative solutions. Swift consequences, according to Currant, "[sharpen] everyone's minds." He seems to be under the (misguided) impression that twenty-first-century sales and marketing departments are operating in consequence-free zones. This can apparently be fixed by hanging the sword of Damocles the lot of them. The amount of turnover such a policy would create would make almost any organization toxic for prospective employees and untenable for current ones. Today's top employers not only understand that high turnover rates, especially if they are lasting, are productivity killers, they also understand the risks (and rewards) inherent in creative and experimental practices.
If there's worse business advice out there, I haven't come across it. The links between creativity, innovation, and spectacular success have been well documented, and, though placing sensible limits on how large a role creativity plays in your organization is a sound strategy, the world's most successful businesses constantly re-evaluate and revise those limits -- usually upwards.
Today's business world demands and rewards unconventional ideas; we need more of them, not less. A creativity cull is, simply put, a recipe for disaster in the long-term (and perhaps the short-term as well). It's a good thing Currant isn't finding the business world very receptive to his ideas.

Opinion poll: Delhiites want Arvind Kejriwal as CM  but BJP to get absolute majorityLetters to  the editor
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will get absolute majority bagging around 46 seats in Delhi Assembly polls, riding on the ‘Modi wave’, while AAP is likely to win in 18 constituencies, an opinion poll said today.
As per the ABP News-Nielsen poll, Arvind Kejriwal is the most suitable candidate for the position of Chief Minister with 39 per cent of the respondents preferring him.
BJP’s Harsh Vardhan is a close second with 38 per cent while Sheila Dikshit has got support of 7 per cent respondents followed by Jagdish Mukhi who was preferred by 5 per cent.
The poll said BJP will have a vote share of 38 per cent as against AAP’s 26 per cent.
Congress will win in five constituencies with a further decline of three seats from eight it had won in Assembly polls in December last year, it said.
AAP had bagged 28 seats in the polls last year. The opinion poll said the Kejriwal-led party will get 10 seats less this time. The half-way mark in the 70-member Assembly is 36.
About two-third of the respondents said that they were satisfied with the work done by Kejriwal in his 49-day tenure.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the most popular leader amongst the respondents surveyed, leading with a huge margin of 63 per cent.
Kejriwal is the second-most popular leader with 25 per cent support. Rahul Gandhi trails behind with 12 per cent backing, the survey said.
The opinion poll was conducted among 6,528 respondents in 35 Assembly constituencies between November 5 and 7.

2G scam: P Chidambaram  blames  Manmohan Singh  H R Bharadwaj takes offenceNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Senior Congress leader H R Bharadwaj today attacked former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for blaming ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the 2G spectrum scam issue and instead accused him of being “solely responsible”.
A former Union Minister and a Governor, he disputed Chidambaram’s contentions on the 2G issue and said that if he had defended the treasury well as Finance Minister, then this scam would not have happened.
“I don’t think what Chidambaram is saying is the correct thing. It’s absolutely to the contrary. The Prime Minister had indicated to all the ministers that the 2G matter should be dealt with transparency.
“He (Manmohan) has done meticulous service to the country. Chidambaram is no match for him. His honesty, integrity is internationally recognised,” Bharadwaj said.
Bharadwaj, who had been at one time a Union Minister along with Chidambaram, even claimed that the latter was never a Congress man.
“Tell me when was he (a Congressman)? He has always been changing parties. To make him the Finance Minister, every person used to bring him to the forefront,” he said.
“Chidambaram used to browbeat everyone on the basis of his language and education. I have seen his performance everywhere. In 2G, he is solely responsible,” he claimed.
Replying to a question whether Priyanka Gandhi should be brought forward to revive the party, he said “I request the Congress leadership to bring her forward immediately.”
Earlier, Chidambaram had said the UPA government could have handled the 2G spectrum allocation case better.
“The CAG report on 2G and other issues,” Chidambaram had said, “clearly …hurt the Congress party. I think 2G could have been handled differently in the sense that the Prime Minister could have put his foot down and said I am sorry, I will not let you go forward with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) route.
“Or after licences had been granted and issue was brought up, he could have said cancel licences without waiting for the judgement. It hurt us. My personal view was once this came out as a scandal of bandwidth allotment, the government should have cancelled all the licences without waiting for the Supreme Court (judgement),” Chidambaram had said.

Indo-Japanese JV Nitta Gelatin office in India attacked by armed menEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
The corporate office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL) in Kochi, a prominent Indo-Japanese industrial venture, was attacked by an unidentified group on Monday.
NGIL’s unit in Thrissur district, which manufactures ossein, has been facing agitation over polluting a nearby river.  A nine-member gang, wearing masks, stormed into the corporate office after threatening the security staff. Using iron rods, they demolished the computers and window panes.
Kochi city police commissioner K G James said a special team is probing into the attack. “We have recovered a letter, which has reference to Maoists. The letter has called for armed struggle and indicates that Maoists have taken claim for the attack. But, whether Maoists were actually involved in the attack could be ascertained only after the probe, said the commissioner.
He said some ultra elements along with local people near the NGIL factory were involved in the agitation.  Hence, it has to be looked whether the local agitators were behind the attack and used the letter to divert the probe.
NGIL is a leading manufacturer of gelatin, ossein, di-calcium phosphate, collagen peptide and related products which have wide applications in pharmaceuticals. The NGIL’s unit in Thrissur was attacked last year in connection with the agitation against polluting river Chalakkudy.

CBI does U-turn over Kumar Mangalam Birla coal scam caseEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
In an apparent U-turn, CBI, which had filed a closure report in a coal blocks case involving industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, former coal secretary P C Parakh and others, today told a special court there was enough evidence against the accused to take cognisance of offences.
The Supreme Court appointed-special public prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema submitted before Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the court can take cognisance on the closure report filed by it on October 21 as there was prima facie “evidence against the accused to show their involvement”.
The court after hearing the submissions advanced by Cheema and CBI prosecutors V K Sharma and A P Singh fixed the matter for November 25 for consideration of the agency’s closure report.
“SPP states that under the facts and circumstances of the case, prima facie there is enough material to take cognizance of the offences against private parties and some of the government officials involved in the process of coal blocks allocation. Put up for consideration on the closure report on November 25,” the judge said.
The CBI also placed on record a compilation of relevant documents relating to the case.
During the hearing, Cheema said, “We are asking for cognisance on the closure report as there was evidence against the accused to show their involvement.”
The judge asked the prosecutor that if the court decides to take cognisance of the offences, will the agency be ready with its documents.
To this, Cheema said some further investigation was required in the matter.
Earlier, on October 21, CBI had filed a “detailed and comprehensive” revised final closure report before a the court in the case.
The FIR against Kumar Mangalam Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco  Industries within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours”.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others after it first filed the closure report on August 28.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III “citing valid reasons”.

Moody's sees sustained, robust growth in India in next 2 years

(Its peers S&P and Fitch had…)
MUMBAI: International ratings agency Moody's today said it expects India to witness "sustained robust growth" over the next two years.
"We expect sustained robust growth in the US, Britain and India over the next two years," Moody's Investors Service said in its quarterly Global Macro Outlook report issued in London.
The agency has a "Baa3" rating with a stable outlook on India, which is the lowest in the investment grade.
Its peers S&P and Fitch had flagged concerns over falling growth, high inflation, the high fiscal and current account deficits and a sense of 'political paralysis', among other factors and had also threatened to downgrade the country to junk status.
However, with the economic conditions improving, the country has been able to convince all the rating agencies' concerns and both S&P and Firch have upgraded their respective outlooks now.
In an earlier note, Moody's had said it expected GDP growth to touch 5 per cent in 2014 and accelerate in 2015. The country had two consecutive fiscals of sub-5 per cent growth, and the prospects have been looking up since the June quarter, when GDP growth accelerated to 5.7 per cent.
However, there are concerns that the number will slip to around 5 per cent due to a weak industrial growth. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had called the process of recovery as "uneven".
At the global level, Moody's said the US growth was likely to accelerate as pent-up consumer and investment demand is realised. For the G-20 economies, it is expecting a GDP growth of around 3 percent in 2015 and 2016, after notching up 2.8 percent in 2014.

Narendra Modi chairs meetings as government gears up for Winter Session

(Prime Minister Modi is understood…)
NEW DELHI: Ahead of Parliament's winter session , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked his Council of Ministers to cut down on unnecessary tours to ensure their maximum presence during the month-long affair.
He also asked the ministers to be ready with bills pending in both Houses of Parliament along with new legislative proposals.
Chairing a meeting of the Union Council of Ministers a day after a rejig of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister also gave a pep talk to the newly-appointed ministers on how to go about their job.
He also discussed with his colleagues the strategy to ensure that the session beginning from November 24 and ending on December 23 remains a "smooth affair" for the government during which it plans to pass most of the old pending bills as well as some key new bills.
He advised the ministers to come prepared with proper answers for questions which are posed during Question Hour.
Known as a workaholic, Modi is learnt to have said that ministers do not have offs and they should be prepared to work even on public holidays.
Modi's focus on ensuring that Parliament functions without any hitch comes in the backdrop of the budget session that saw several disruptions.
The Prime Minister also chose the occasion to remind the Ministers of State that they should prove to be "assets" to their ministries. He said the Ministers of State should be given due responsibilities and the Cabinet ministers should ensure that they meet their junior colleagues in the Council of Ministers regularly.
After a two-hour long meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister chaired a 20-minute long meeting of the Union Cabinet, official sources said.
Modi asked the ministers to direct the concerned departments to work effectively and ready the bills by the time the session begins. He also directed the ministers to pay attention towards the completion of old pending bills.
The Prime Minister told the ministers that they should avoid unnecessary tours and be present during the session. The instruction came a day before he leaves for a 10-day visit to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju could not attend the meetings as they were on tour.
Union minister Anant Geete , from the estranged ally Shiv Sena, was present, the sources said.
The month-long session will have a total of 22 sittings in which four days have been earmarked for Private Members' business.
A total of 67 bills -- 59 in Rajya Sabha and eight in Lok Sabha -- are pending and the government will push for passage of "at least 30 to 35" legislations, a senior minister said.
This will be the second major session since the Narendra Modi Government took over in May.
Congress has attacked the Prime Minister on Cabinet expansion accusing him of including "tainted" ministers in the government contrary to his election promise of "cleaning up" Parliament of criminals, a charge vehemently countered by the government and the BJP .
Indications are that Congress would raise the issue in a big way in the upcoming session to put the government on the backfoot.

Sena will oppose BJP in Maharashtra house  picks Eknath as leaderShiv Sena sits in opposition in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 10, 2014
First Published: 12:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(11/11/2014)
As the new Maharashtra assembly held its first sitting on Monday, the Shiv Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition even as it continued to negotiate with the BJP on joining the government.
 
The BJP confirmed talks were on but reiterated that the Sena should accept what was offered and stop demanding a certain number of ministerial berths or portfolios.

Undermining the seriousness of the legislature’s procedures in its bid to pressure the BJP, the Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for leader of the Opposition. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray justified it saying he sent the letter to the legislature secretary because the Congress was rushing to grab the post.
“The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn’t work? Then we won’t get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader),” Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening. If the talks with BJP fail the Sena would perform the role of a strong opposition party, he added.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12. The BJP is 23 votes short of a majority.
The two parties split just before the assembly elections after 25 years together. Now, both have taken strong positions on power-sharing, but are still talking. A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself would prefer to go with `natural ally’ Sena, but wants Thackeray to make `reasonable’ demands since the BJP already has 121 seats.
The Sena leadership, while slowly reconciling itself to sitting in the opposition, is wary the BJP could poach some of its 63 MLAs. It is also worried it could lose control of the Mumbai civic body, where it is in alliance with the BJP.
On Sunday, Thackeray asked Anil Desai, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member who was to join Narendra Modi’s ministry, to boycott the swearing in. Later, he asked the BJP to clarify its stand on seeking the NCP’s support from outside.
On Monday, the Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition a couple of hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his resolve to support the BJP from outside and ridiculed Thackeray for making remarks against him a day before.   
Armed with a plan B for winning the trust vote – support from the NCP and 14 to 17 MLAs from small parties and Independents -- the BJP was still hopeful of patching up with the Sena. It prefers the Sena because of their common ideology and experience of working together. The BJP was unwilling to go with NCP because of the party’s tainted track record.
The BJP can expect find the going tough if it leans on the NCP. Pawar gave it a veiled warning on Monday when he said that the BJP should reopen and inquire into all the cases (of corruption and irregularities) against his leaders. 
A confident Fadnavis, who said earlier his mandate (from the party high command) was to govern and not to save the government, put on a brave face by telling party colleagues that he would sail through in any case.
When asked, Fadnavis refused to comment on the matter.
A senior BJP leader told HT that the doors were kept open for the Sena even after the day’s development. “Talks with the Sena are on through several channels. We are still hopeful of the Sena withdrawing the claim [to the post of leader of the opposition] if we strike a suitable deal.”
 

Intermission: Romantic tragicomedyBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 10 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Part of my morning media diet was the trailers for the fourth season of “Girls” and the first season of “Togetherness,” which appears at the bottom of this post. The two shows will be paired on HBO in the new year, and they have in common adults in different cohorts acting as if relationships were monumentally difficult to maintain instead of something that most humans manage to pull off most of the time. The prevalence of this trope got me thinking: What perspective on relationships do you feel like is missing from pop culture today? What would you like to see more of?

• “ My Nude Photos Were Stolen, and I’m Fighting Back ,” by Gabrielle Union: The actress explains what it was like to have intimate photos, which she had deleted, resurrected and shared across the Internet. And in a particularly smart observation, she notes that wishing for relief means hoping for someone else’s victimization.
“It felt like ‘The Hunger Games’: You’re waiting to be attacked. Friends are assuring you that this will pass and people will move on to the next thing,” Union argues. ‘But in this case, the next thing means the next victim — the next woman to have her naked body exposed to strangers against her will. And the crowd in the arena is going wild. People are critiquing and judging, cheering for more. They’re shouting, ‘Next! Next!’ ”
• “ Why Actresses Reinvent Themselves as Folk—Not Pop—Singers ,” by Tanya Basu: On the occasion of the release of Leighton Meester’s latest album, Basu reflects on the genre choices of actresses who want to become singers.
“Folk is known for raw, reflective soundscapes, while pop music tends toward the carnivalesque. Lyrics are clean and relatively PG, with almost no references to sex,” she explains. “Because innuendo is minimal, videos featuring Meester, [Scarlett] Johansson, and [Carla] Bruni place nearly no focus on their bodies, despite them establishing previous careers where their bodies were a celebrated aspect of their performance. Objectification is kept to a minimum.”
• “ About The Time Shonda Rhimes Gave Me A Christmas Cat Intervention ,” by Linda Holmes: The NPR pop culture blogger turns a social media interaction into a chance to meditate on the appeal of Hallmark’s holiday movies, to which she nurses a mild addiction.
“It is a precision manufacturing operation, which can yield a result that’s either pretty charming or pretty much about Haylie Duff running a year-round small-town Christmas hat store that somehow lasted until 2013 before becoming an unstable business model,” Holmes writes. “Some of the conflicts are pretty relatable, involving fear of rejection and the tension between stability and adventure, and some of them are like the one in the movie that ran Sunday night, called ‘A Cookie Cutter Christmas,’ which hinged on a terrible moment when it seemed like the lady liked the guy only for his cookie recipe that she stole to win a bake-off against her mortal enemy. It was a false alarm. She came up with her own cookie recipe and won fair and square. And then they kissed. Where was I?”

(Gilmore is writing a book on the subject, which I will read the heck out of.)
“Satanism considers the study of the human animal to be a worthy pursuit and you’ll find incisive films that examine aspects of desire, power, lust, and greed in ‘Key Largo,’ ‘Citizen Kane,’ and ‘Blue Velvet,’ ” Gilmore explains. “Film noir was for [church founder Anton Szandor] LaVey an accurate stylization of contemporary human society, wherein each player may only be significant to him or herself. In a cold, concrete environment, one’s desires might be the only flame warming hearts seeking satisfaction. Such sparks are often snuffed­ out in its pursuit due to ill circumstances, poor decisions, misguided intentions or lack of understanding. Realism, even in a stylized form, can make films Satanic for us since they offer lessons about living via our most powerful contemporary art form.”

Dean Foods   DF  is attracting an appetite among investors, rising 14% to $16.40 after the company beat analyst expectations for the first time in seven quarters and said declining dairy prices would help 2015 results.
The company, the nation’s biggest dairy processor with brands including Meadow Gold, Land O Lakes and Pet, posted a third-quarter loss of 3 cents a share, vs.  consensus estimates of  a 12- cent loss estimate. Revenue rose nearly 8% to $2.4 billion.
Dean Foods has been hurt by raw milk costs, up 24% from the year-ago quarter and the second-highest average in U.S. dairy history, the company said.
“Given the continued challenges facing the dairy industry due to the dairy commodity environment, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement of our operating results which we believe reflects the success of our current business efforts,” said CEO Gregg Tanner.  “This year has clearly been the most difficult operating environment we’ve ever experienced as a company. And so, we remain rigorous in our focus on the things that we control: price realization, cost productivity and volume at margins that deliver an appropriate return.”

A new major security flaw found with Apple (AAPL) operating systems Monday is lifting shares of the company that found the problem.
Shares of FireEye (FEYE) closed up $1.61, or 5.3%, to $32.23 after the security company discovered the latest and potentially most dangerous security problem with Apple’s operating systems that power iPhones.
The flaw, present in both iOS7 and iOS8 allow hackers to easily steal user’s personal data. The attack, which FireEye calls a “Masque Attack” allows hackers to install software on Apple devices. This attack comes just after last week’s WireLurker attack that also breaks through Apple’s security to steal users’ data.
This rash of security problems comes at a bad time for Apple, as the company attempts to convince users to entrust it with critical financial payment data — not just emails and contact lists. Savvy marketing has long convinced Apple devices are immune to security problems — a belief that continues to erode as Apple market share increases and the devices become a more attractive target to hackers.
Apple investors, though, remain undisturbed and keep sending the stock to all-time highs. Shares of Apple fell a bit Monday by 15 cents to $108.86.

New Delhi has been ranked 25th among the world’s ‘Most Fun’ cities with Germany’s capital Berlin topping the survey.
New Delhi, the only Indian city to make the top 25 cut, was chosen among over 1,800 cities surveyed across the globe.
The Indian capital ranked high for its sports clubs, shopping and bars in ‘The Ultimate Fun City Ranking’ report commissioned by ‘GetYourOwnGuide’ and ‘GoEuro’ travel firms.
The two firms compiled data on 11 factors like nightlife, average beer price and entertainment options to define what exactly makes a city fun for travellers of different age groups and interests. Of the total 1,830 cities, Berlin topped the rankings for its all-round attractiveness of bars and museums, followed by London, Paris, New York and Tokyo.

8 new ministers in PM Narendra Modi Cabinet have criminal cases: ReportCrime slur on nearly a third of Modi cabinet

Attempted murder, waging war on the state, criminal intimidation and fraud are some of the charges on the rap sheets of ministers Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed to the cabinet on Sunday, jarring with his pledge to clean up politics.

Seven of 21 new ministers face prosecution, taking the total in the 66-member cabinet to almost one third, a higher proportion than before the weekend expansion. At least five people in the cabinet have been charged with serious offences such as rape and rioting.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said any suggestions there were criminals in the cabinet were "completely baseless".
"These are cases arising out of criminal accusations, not cases out of a crime," he told reporters on Monday, adding that Modi had personally vetted the new ministers.
Ram Shankar Katheria, a lawmaker from Agra, was appointed junior education minister yet has been accused of more than 20 criminal offences including attempted murder and promoting religious or racial hostility.
Katheria was not immediately available for comment and a mobile phone number given by his office was switched off.
The inclusion of such politicians does not sit easily with Modi's election promise to root out corruption, and has led to criticism that he is failing to change the political culture in India where wealthy, tainted politicians sometimes find it easier to win votes.
"It shows scant respect for the rule of law or public sentiment," said Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which campaigns for better governance. "Including these people in the cabinet is a bad omen for our democracy."
Modi won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in May with a promise of graft-free governance after the previous government led by Congress party was mired in a series of damaging corruption scandals.
New cabinet more tainted than old?
Soon after coming to power, Modi called for courts to fast track cases against politicians in an effort to curb political criminality in the world's largest democracy.
Yet Modi's cabinet includes twice as many politicians facing criminal charges as the previous Congress party one.
Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the new junior chemicals and fertilizer minister, was another eye-catching choice. He is charged with around 20 offences, including intent to wage war against India, criminal intimidation and abetting a mutiny.
Ahir did not respond to requests for comment, and it was not immediately clear what incidents the more serious charges pertained to. His secretary said the cases were politically motivated.
Ahir is best known for helping unearth corruption in the coal industry while he served on a parliamentary committee. Shrikant Sharma, a spokesperson for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it was up to courts to decide if ministers were guilty, and said many of the charges related to political rivalries.
The BJP is led by Amit Shah, who is accused of ordering police to carry out three extrajudicial killings and running an extortion racket when he served under Modi as home minister in Gujarat almost a decade ago.
He has denied the charges. He is facing a trial in Mumbai. The number of lawmakers charged with offences has more than doubled in the last two decades. About a third of federal and state legislators face charges, the ADR said.
Politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win an election as their untainted peers, making them the preferred choice of candidates for political parties in India, according to a study published last year by the group.
In office, these politicians are sometimes accused of enriching themselves or their backers by siphoning off money from government spending.
"We hear again and again the country's leaders promise to clean up the system," said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation. "Self interest prevails over principles. That is why the system never changes."

Saradha funded Messi match  confirms probeComments
A government agency that tracks corporate frauds has called for a CBI probe against West Bengal sports minister Madan Mitra and Kolkata Police chief Surajit Kar Purkayastha, among others in the multi-crore Saradha scandal.
Argentina's Lionel Messi (R) and Venezuela's Fernando Amorebieta fight for the ball during their international friendly soccer match in Kolkata.
In its 516-page report, accessed by HT, the serious fraud investigation office (SFIO), has recommended that the CBI “take further action” on allegations against Mitra, a close aide of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and Purakayasta.
An investigative arm of the ministry of corporate affairs, the SFIO based its report on depositions of suspended Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh , who is behind bars.
“While the evidence is not sufficient to frame any charge, however, since the CBI is looking into the larger conspiracy angle of the Saradha scam, it is recommended that the matter be referred to CBI for necessary investigation and further action at its end,” says the report.
Ghosh has submitted some pictures that show Mitra and Purakayasta at various Saradha group events. Also, Ghosh “has affirmed that very high profile personalities drawn from politics and bureaucracy were associated with the Saradha group publicly and shared stage with Sudipta Sen”, says the report.
Moreover, Saradha group chairman Sen, who has since been arrested, claimed that he had bought a Ferrari for Mitra’s son while Mitra allegedly took money from Sen to repair temples in his constituency and to hold a football match, involving Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi.
When reached for comments, Mitra said, “I won’t tell you anything. If some investigative agency summons me, I shall tell them. I’m ready to face any investigation.”  Purakayastha did not respond to HT’s calls or text messages.
“I can’t make any comments. Moreover, I haven’t seen the report you are referring to. I haven’t seen such reports anywhere, and they hardly have any credibility,” Bengal health minister Subrata Mukherjee said.
The report also recommends further CBI probe against a former Doordarshan director general and former Bengal top cop Rajat Majumdar, who has been arrested.
Last year, the Centre ordered a multi-agency probe into the activities of Kolkata-based Saradha group of companies in a scandal involving around `20,000 crore. The company’s promoters and top executives were accused by angry investors of creating a web of companies across several states in eastern India to dupe small depositors.
Its flagship company, Saradha Realty, collected `2,459 crore from hundreds of thousands of people, promising astronomical returns. It didn’t return the maturity value to the investors and closed down its offices without paying employees. The group went bust in April 2013.
From Assam, former Union minister Matang Sinh and former state transport minister Anjan Dutta are among those whose names figured in the list sent by the SFIO to the CBI for “necessary investigation and further action”.
Sinh was not available for comments. But Dutta said, “It was a completely business deal. I am a victim. His (Sen’s) cheque for `3.5 crore has been dishonoured. I have given all the evidence to the CBI.”
Besides the SFIO, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate are also investigating the scandal.

Rap for Haryana  fresh warrant againstRampalPrint
By: Express News Service | Chandigarh | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:11 am
The Punjab and Haryana High Court Monday expressed displeasure over the Haryana government’s failure to arrest and produce self-styled godman Sant Rampal against whom it had issued a non-bailable warrant in a contempt case.
The division bench of Justices M Jeyapaul and Sneh Prashar also expressed unhappiness over the Hisar administration forming a medical board, which certified that he was too ill to be produced before court.
Issuing fresh non-bailable warrant against Sant Rampal, the court directed Haryana’s Home Secretary and Director General of Police to either ensure his presence on or before November 17, or the two themselves appear before the court.
The court said: “We are not happy with the way in which a medical board was constituted, without the authority of this court in order to evade implementation of the directions of this court.
“We are totally dissatisfied with the view expressed by the medical board as regards the health condition of contemner Rampal,” the court observed.
The bench also initiated proceedings to cancel the bail which was granted to Rampal by a single bench in 2008 in a murder case. The court had initiated contempt proceedings against Rampal after his followers mobbed the courts in Rohtak and Hisar, where he was to be produced in the murder case in July. Despite notices, he did not appear in the court.
After the court issued non-bailable warrant, a large of number of his followers gathered at the Hisar ashram with armed men taking position both inside and outside.
When the proceedings began, Haryana DGP Shriniwas Vashisht filed a status report, stating that the police force provided was inadequate to maintain law and order in the event of Rampal’s arrest.
The police produced Ram Kanwar Dhaka, chief of the National Social Service Commission and a Rampal follower, against whom the court had issued a non-bailable warrant as well.

Minor blast near Kolkata NIAofficePrint
By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:09 am
A minor explosion occurred near a CRPF camp, which also houses the camp office of NIA which is probing the Burdwan blast, at Rajarhat area in Kolkata late on Monday, police officials said. The explosion peeled some concrete off the CRPF campus wall and twisted a portion of the tin shed of a bus stand.
The NIA camp office, situated in the Bidhannagar area in the suburb of the city, is also being used to interrogate Sajid, the mastermind of the Burdwan blast, and other arrested suspects in the blast.
According to officials of the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, “initial investigation has shown that at around 7.30 pm, two crude bombs were thrown towards the bus stand when a car was passing by the camp office area”.
Commissioner, Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, Rajeev Kumar and a team of CRPF personnel rushed to the spot. A team of bomb experts also reached there and collected samples.
According to officials of the Electronic Complex Police station, no casualties or injury took place.
Debasish Dhar, Additional Commissioner of Police, Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, said they suspect that the material used could have been a firecracker. “We are not taking it lightly. A police team has rushed to the spot to inquire into the nature of the explosive material,” Dhar said.
The police said there was no CCTV coverage even though three important police installations were located in a cluster at the spot — the CRPF campus, a BSF housing complex and a Seema Sashastra Bal office.

The day he took over, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar assured transparent and speedy acquisition of critical equipment. The former Goa chief minister, who described his new assignment as a “highly sensitive ministry”, expressed confidence that he would go ahead “with speed” on the work his predecessor Arun Jaitley had started.
“Whatever will be there will be transparent and fast-processed; that is my specialty,” Parrikar told reporters.
He began the day in Lucknow by filing a nomination for the Rajya Sabha, flew back to Delhi and took charge as India’s 36th defence minister, then held a quick meeting with ministry officials and the three service chiefs, followed by a cabinet meeting.

Stressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra “Make in India”, Parrikar said that “as much as possible, we should manufacture in India”. “The PM has been very clear in opening up defence (to the Indian industry). I feel that as much as possible, we should manufacture here in India.”
Dressed in a blue shirt, the IIT Bombay alumnus kept stressing he would comment on critical defence matters only after “understanding” them and taking a “grip of the situation”. “I came to know I had become defence minister only at 11.35 pm yesterday. Give me some time, let me understand the ministry. I will talk to the Prime Minister and then I will reply,” he said in Lucknow. And in Delhi: “I am coming from a state… The requirement at national level may be in a different connotation or different class… Secondly, I was left with no time… I virtually had to pack in five minutes.”
Asked about recent naval mishaps, Parrikar said, “I am equally worried — the torpedo recovery boat that sank at Vizag or even the earlier incident of explosion on submarines. But let me first take a real grip of the situation.”

Year of reckoning: paddy prices fall as Iran goes slow onimportsKhanna/ Panipath | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:07 am
By: Sandip Das & Harish Damodaran
Despondency is writ large on Kuldeep Singh’s face, as the boli (auction) for the paddy that was unloaded from his tractor trolley at an open platform in Khanna’s grain mandi is concluded.
This five-acre farmer from Behlolpur, a village in Sirhind tehsil of Punjab’s Fatehpur Sahib district, has managed to realise Rs 3,200 per quintal for his Pusa-1121 basmati crop, as against Rs 4,100 last year.
“The artiyas (commission agents) and even other farmers tell me I am lucky. The price I have received is the highest for this season,” he says, half sarcastically.
Kuldeep’s information isn’t wrong.
“Till a couple of weeks back, Pusa-1121 was selling for Rs 2,400-2,500 per quintal. It has since recovered to Rs 3,100, but we are still way below last year’s prices which were Rs 3,000-3,100 around October 10, and reached Rs 4,400-4,500 by the month-end,” says Pritam Singh, who farms 107 acres, including 77 acres taken on lease, at Urlana Khurd in Madlauda tehsil of Panipat.
“Prices this time have generally ranged between Rs 2,400 and Rs 3,200 per quintal,” confirms Kuljinder Singh Sidhu, secretary of the APMC at Rajpura, Punjab’s biggest mandi after Khanna.
According to Wazir Singh Kohar, a 60-acre farmer from Theri village in Fatehabad district of Haryana, traders were blaming the price crash on low export demand: “Jo bhi ho, thaggi ho rahi hai (Whatever be the reason, this is open loot).”
For many farmers, compounding the disappointment is the fact that last year’s record prices had led them to significantly expand basmati acreage, including by leasing in land.
Pargat Singh owns four acres at Kaddon village in Ludhiana’s Doraha tehsil. This year, he rented two acres at Rs 15,000 per acre to plant more area under Pusa-1121. But the returns on that extra investment haven’t matched his expectations.
These stories capture the remarkable phenomenon of a crop that allowed farmers to ride on a wave of high export-driven prices, and simultaneously benefit from new varietal technology.
Pusa-1121, an improved high-yielding basmati developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), was released for commercial cultivation in the 2003 kharif season.
Between 2003-04 and 2013-14, India’s basmati rice exports zoomed from 7.71 lakh tonnes (lt) to 37.54 lt. The increase was even more in value terms, from $ 433.73 million (Rs 1,993.05 crore) to $4.86 billion (Rs 29,291.82 crore). Pusa-1121’s share in total shipments last year was reckoned at over 70 per cent.
This year, the situation is different.
To start with, export prices have dropped. Parboiled Pusa-1121 rice is currently said to be fetching about $ 1,100 per tonne (landed cost, West Asia), compared to $ 1,400-plus at this time last year and $ 1,700 levels in March.
The main reason for this is Iran, which bought 14.41 lt or over 38 per cent of India’s basmati shipments in 2013-14.
“This year, their own Domsiah crop (a long-grain Iranian aromatic rice similar to basmati) is very good. Also, they have huge stocks from last year’s basmati purchases, prompting the government there to clamp a 40 per cent duty on continued…

Wagah a crystalline  horrible symbol of whats wrong withPakPrint
Written by Rakesh Sinha | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:03 am
Strobe Talbott, former US deputy secretary of state who now heads the Brookings Institution think tank, tells Rakesh Sinha why China’s assertiveness in the region is worrisome, and why no sensible American is thinking about an India-US alliance.
As someone who has engaged and tracked India very closely, what are your first impressions of the Narendra Modi government?
My sense is that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi hit it off quite well and that doesn’t surprise me, knowing a little bit about my own President and having heard some things about your Prime Minister. They are both highly pragmatic, they don’t go in for ceremony for its own sake, they are sort of get-things-done guys. They tend to get down as quickly as possible to the basic issues, see if they have a common view and then figure a way to maximise collaboration between the two countries.
The mood in the American private sector is a mirror of the mood in the private sector here. Americans who are interested in investing in India, trading with India, take seriously the Prime Minister’s stated and restated commitment to streamlining the process, making India investment-friendly and essentially getting the mojo back into the economy.
So their talks would have factored in a greater Indian role in the region?
My impression was that keeping in mind or within the limits of some differences, there was nonetheless a meeting of minds on some big questions, particularly having to do with neighbours or near neighbours.
The three big issues that preoccupy the US right now are all in regions closer to India than to the United States. By that I mean ISIS, which is accompanied by a larger crisis in the Middle East; Russia and its annexation of Crimea, its use of force to dominate Ukraine and intimidate its neighbours; and then, there is the worrisome assertiveness of the People’s Republic of China with regard to neighbours, particularly neighbours with which it has maritime, territorial disputes. And as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) made very clear at the time of President Xi Jinping’s visit to New Delhi, that includes India big time.
India and Pakistan are not quite moving…
I think it is a very positive thing that Prime Minister Modi has reached out to Nawaz Sharif, he seems to be interested in breathing fresh life into and making SAARC more robust. The Brookings India Centre is doing some serious work with regard to SAARC, coming up with some practical ideas on how to make SAARC more useful.
But the core is: As long as a critical mass of influential forces in Pakistan sees India as an existential threat to Pakistan, there is going to continue to be danger and from time to time some serious trouble. I have seen, talked to and been convinced by Pakistanis who want to put Partition, and the lingering disputes from Partition, behind them, and to strengthen the Pakistani State.
Unfortunately, there are others who either believe or profess to believe that protecting the Pakistani State requires them to continued…

Is Baghdadi dead oralivePrint
By: Agencies | Baghdad | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:00 am
Contradictory reports have emerged over the fate of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after US-led air strikes in at least two locations in Iraq on Friday night.
While the US said it had no information to indicate Baghdadi had been hit, Baghdad state television cited reports that he had been wounded.
Major Curtis Kellogg, spokesman at the US military’s Central Command, said they had no information to corroborate press reports that Baghdadi was wounded in either the strike on the city of Mosul in the north or the one on al-Qaim to the west.
“We conducted two airstrikes near al-Qaim on Friday evening, destroying an ISIS-armoured vehicle and two ISIS checkpoints, but we’re not aware of another gathering of ISIS leaders in al-Qaim,” he said.
Iraqi officials had on Sunday said the ISIS leader was wounded in an Iraqi airstrike in Qaim in the western Anbar province of Iraq as he was meeting militants. There have been no comments on the matter on jihadi websites.
On Sunday, Iraqi Defence Minister said on Facebook that Baghdadi’s deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured. In response, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said to be the Islamic State’s spokesman, dispatched his own update.
“Perhaps you suspected that the Caliphate ended with martyrdom of the Caliph,” The Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying. “I assure the (Islamic) nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank god, and I wish him a speedy recovery” — the implication being that he was at least injured.
A member of Anbar province’s security committee said he had heard unconfirmed reports that Baghdadi had been wounded and moved to Syria. Several other Anbar officials gave contradictory reports on Baghdadi’s fate.
Baghdadi’s fighters seized much of northern Iraq five months ago in a lightning offensive.
What next?
If he is dead…
To remain the self-anointed ‘caliph’, his body needs to be intact. The Washington Post quoted an expert as saying, “If he loses a limb, his credibility suffers. If he dies, it would toss the concept of legitimacy of the ‘Caliphate’ on its head.”
If he is alive…
The already reclusive leader may retreat further into the shadows. He is said to be careful about his security, especially after his predecessor Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and other ISIS leaders died in US bombings. Reports say that when commanders are called to meet him, they are told that he is in the group but isn’t identified. Other reports talk of how he wears masks when he meets prisoners.
If it is all unclear
The confusion helps bolster the Baghdadi legend, helps ISIS.

Centre likely to make Aadhaar card mandatory for earlypassportPrint
Written by Vijaita Singh | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:46 am
The NDA government is planning to make Aadhaar card mandatory for issuance of passports in a month’s time. In another bold step, the Centre is likely to do away with “police verification” prior to the issuance of a passport, if the applicant has a Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number, and conduct it later.
The Ministry of External Affairs, in a note sent to the Home Ministry, has said, “The government is making Aadhaar card as a mandatory requirement for issue of passports. The MEA is working with The UIDAI to implement it and the process is expected to be completed by the end of this month. If the applicant is not in possession of Aadhaar card, the enrolment number can be produced.”
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) will be roped in to establish a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
After Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), making Aadhaar mandatory for passports will be another push by the NDA government for the unique identification scheme, which was launched by the UPA government.
“Once the NCRB sets up its database, the criminal antecedents of the applicants for all categories will be verified before the passport is issued,” it said.
A senior official said PM Narendra Modi recently attended a meeting where the issue of delay in issuance of passports due to police verification was discussed. He added that a large number of complaints were being received at the PMO from applicants regarding police verification.
“The MEA is of the view that when an applicant already has an Aadhaar card or has applied for, his identity to a major extent is established — this needs to be confirmed by the UIDAI. Therefore, based on the NCRB validation and the applicant’s self declaration on the aspects of citizenship, criminality antecedents, criminal proceedings, summons or warrants etc, the passport can be issued on post police verification basis,” the note said.
It also said that when the passport is handed over to the applicant, the address of the concerned police station will also be given so that the “applicant can pursue and complete the process of police verification before travelling abroad”.

Give Narmada water to dry areas  not to Coca-Cola: Ahmed Patel to GujaratCMPrint
By: Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:44 am
Ahmed Patel, Congress Rajya Sabha MP, has written to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, expressing his “deep concern” on the state government’s decision to allocate three million litres of water daily from the Sardar Sarovar Dam to Coca-Cola for its Rs 500-crore bottling plant in Sanand. The decision was taken in September .
In his letter, dated October 10, Patel said that the state government should “prioritise” giving water to drought-hit parts of the state.
The letter states, “The Sardar Sarovar project was conceptualised with the aim of providing water to the drought-stricken parts of north Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch. In this light, I am surprised to learn of the government’s decision to allocate waters to a foreign consumer goods giant Coca-Cola, with a daily usage limit of three million litres.” Patel has also raised concern over the daily effluent of 450 kilo litres to be discharged by the said plant.
The Congress MP has “urged” Anandiben to “take into account the several villages in the vicinity of Sanand that do not have access to drinking water, terming the decision as one that makes “citizens lose out on their rights to a private corporation while damaging ecology”.

Aadhaar likely to be mandatory for issuance of passport
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 05.27AM IST
(In the new process, the applicant,…)
NEW DELHI: Government is planning to make Aadhaar mandatory for issue of passports and is in the process of establishing a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
The issue was discussed threadbare at a meeting between the Ministries of the Home and the External Affairs, official sources said today.
The MEA is working with the Unique Identification Authority of India to implement it and the process is expected to be completed by the end of this month.
In the new process, the applicant, if not in possession of an Aadhaar card, has to produce the Aadhaar enrolment number.
The move has been taken up as per the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has favoured faster passport services in a transparent and simplified manner to the citizens.
A number of complaints are being received regularly by the government related to police verification for passports and consequent delay in issuance of the travel document.
The MEA had a meeting with the National Crime Record Bureau, under the Home Ministry, and the latter confirmed that they will be able to establish a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
"NCRB has confirmed that they will be able to set up the validation mechanism within two months. Once this is established, the criminal antecedents of the applicants for all categories will be validated on NCRB database before passport issuance," an official note prepared on the issue said.
The MEA is of the view that when an applicant already has an Aadhaar card or has applied for, his identity to a major extent is established -- this needs to be confirmed by UIDAI.
Therefore, based on NCRB validation and the applicant's self declaration on the aspects of citizenship, criminal antecedents, criminal proceedings, summons/ warrants etc. the passport can be issued on post-police verification basis.
While granting the passport, the applicant will also be given the address of police station which is responsible for the police verification so that the applicant can also actively pursue and complete the process of verification before travelling abroad.
"In the event of any wrong declaration by the applicant, the passport will be impounded/ revoked as per specified procedure," the note said.
Though all the applicants in their passport application forms specifically declare information relating to their nationality, criminal antecedents, pendency of court proceedings, warrants/ summons etc. over a period of time, the government agencies, institute the police verification mechanism to verify the provisions that have been referred in the Passport Act.
The present practice is that police verification is required for issue of fresh passports if the applicant does not apply under the Tatkal category.
For the Tatkal category, additional documents, including verification certificate, are required. Also, in the case of re-issue passports, passports are issued without reference to the police, based on the self declaration of the applicants.
  After the receipt of police verification reports, passports are issued within a week. Passports are also issued within a week of application in respect of minor applicants, re-issue cases, Tatkaal etc. in which police verification is not required or is done on post-verification basis.
The move came after a U-turn by the Home Ministry from its earlier stand and coming out in full support of Aadhaar scheme saying it will facilitate "anytime, anywhere, anyhow" authentication to its beneficiaries.
In a letter to all state governments, the Home Ministry had last month said that since one Aadhaar number is allotted only to one person, it allows universal verification of one's identity.
"Since Aadhaar is based on the demographic and biometric information of an individual, it eliminates the threat of any fraud and bogus activity.
"Aadhaar will provide its possessor with universal identification. (It) will facilitate 'anytime, anywhere, anyhow' authentication to its beneficiaries (and) be a single source of identity verification," the Home Ministry had said.
The ministry's stand on Aadhaar is in complete reversal of the position taken by it under two predecessors of Home Minister Rajnath Singh -- Sushilkumar Shinde and P Chidambaram.
During the UPA regime, the Home Ministry had raised concerns over the sanctity of the the Unique Identification Authority of India's database, saying uniqueness of identity was not a necessary condition for ensuring authenticity of identity or genuineness of other entries or records of Aadhaar numbers.
The ministry had also flagged concerns over supporting documents submitted by people as proof of identity and proof of address for getting an Aadhaar number.

Stat of the day: 10% profit growth in 3rd quarterEMAIL
(Ints Vikmanis)
Not only is the stock market up double digits, third-quarter earnings for Corporate America are also up 10%.
With 90%, or 448 companies, of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index having reported third-quarter earnings, earnings per share growth is now estimated at 10% vs. the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Earnings growth for S&P 500 companies for the third-quarter of 2014 is now tracking at 10%, up from 6.4% on Oct. 1.
For the third quarter, nearly three out of four companies (74.6%) have topped Wall Street’s earnings forecasts, which is better than the 20-year average “beat” rate of 63%.
Corporate profitability has been bolstered by an improving economy and rising consumer confidence.
So how does a 10% growth rate stack up vs. history.
Well, while the double-digit gains are welcomed by Wall Street, it’s not even close to the top 10 quarters in the past 20 years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
(Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S)
But double-digit profit growth shouldn’t be downplayed, either. It is above the long-term average of 8.9% quarterly profit growth going back to 1968, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It is also inline with the 15-year average of 10.1%.

Column: An ideal hunting groundLetters to  the editor
Global defence OEMs look at India with glee. While their own economies are stagnating and defence orders are being cut, India, with its superpower ambitions, growing economy and belligerent nuclear-armed neighbours, provides a perpetual market.
Lack of a strong indigenous defence industry, resistance from the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) and defence PSUs (DPSUs), and the disproportionate influence of the ‘Bombay Club’ make India an ideal playground. It saves global players the pain of setting up factories in India at the cost of local jobs and political backlash in their own countries. For urgent requirements, the Indian government would anyway import defence equipment from them through the government-to-government route.
Under the defence offset rules, global OEMs are mandated to outsource a certain percentage of their contract value to Indian industry. Most of the components sourced from the Indian offset partners are what they are anyway good at, so there is no transfer of sensitive technologies. Indian partners simply ‘build as per design’ than ‘design and build as per user requirements’. Since civil aerospace also qualifies for defence offsets, some global players meet their offset obligations by sourcing aircraft doors and floor beams from India. Life is good!
Bold reforms needed
The ‘Make in India’ program in defence will have to be facilitated by the way of bold reforms in policy, procedures and our approach towards global investors. The misplaced bravado of ‘where else will they go’ has to go. India dropping by two ranks, to 142 out of 189 countries, in the World Bank’s latest Ease of Doing Business index doesn’t echo very well in global boardrooms.
The NDA government proposed 49%, 74% and 100% FDI slabs within days of assuming office. The Bombay Club, ably supported by leading industry bodies managed to pressurise it into limiting it to 49%. However, a 49% cap is no different from a 26% one, technically; hence, the opening up of FDI remains a non-starter.
In the case of state of the art technologies (SOAT), 100% FDI has been allowed. But there are no norms laid down on what qualifies as ‘state of the art’. Most OEMs that we spoke to feel that this ‘case-by-case’ approach may create interpretation issues, delays, misuse and legal disputes. No one wants to be the first one in and face undue attacks from competitors, cynics and the media. Therefore, SOAT will not float.
The Indian Air Force’s much-awaited $3 billion Avro replacement programme elicited only a single bid. It was believed that global players may be comfortable with 49% stake in a non-sensitive transport aircraft and may allocate higher work-share to their Indian partner. Not so, apparently.
Five months after the government increased the FDI limit, not a penny has been actually invested in India’s defence industry, while imports worth billions of dollars continue unabated. The situation may be worse with procurement programmes involving sensitive technologies like missiles, drones, stealth and non-conventional warfare. These have been developed by global OEMs over several decades, after investing billions of dollars. It is a fallacy to think that these can be handed over to India without majority control.
Demolish the iron curtain
A key reason behind India’s dubious distinction as the world’s largest importer of defence equipment is the near sidelining of India’s private sector. The DRDO needs to learn from its US counterpart, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) which is led by Delhi-born US scientist Dr Arati Prabhakar. The DARPA employs just 140 technical professionals and has no labs. Its entire research and development is handled by the US defence industry, universities, government laboratories and individuals. In stark contrast, the DRDO has 52 laboratories, over 30,000 technical staff and not much to show in return.
The armed forces in the US and the EU almost entirely depend on the private sector for their equipment. We need to jettison the old Indian fallacy that only government-owned entities in India are trustworthy.
Top decision-makers in India’s ministry of defence (MoD) may have administrative experience and high integrity, but their knowledge of defence matters is limited and is developed on-the-job. Their approach towards industry and academia is dismissive. This needs to change.
Ownership and control
The term ‘ownership and control’ gets disproportionate importance in India. We have zero ownership and control over the global OEMs from whom we import fully-built aircraft, guns and missiles. But if the same OEM wishes to assemble the equipment on Indian territory, albeit through a subsidiary it controls, we get fidgety. Real control comes not from Indian ownership, but from time-tested conditions like mandatory local-staffing (say, about 90-100%), local value addition (say, at least 20%), export controls, walk-in rights, exit restrictions, etc.
Ten years from now, some Indians working in such companies may move out to other Indian companies or become entrepreneurs widening our defence industrial base. We have seen that in sectors like auto, telecom, IT and pharma. Defence is no different.
We are proud of our armed forces. It is unfair to dump second-rate domestic equipment on them to support a distorted version of ‘self-reliance’. The range of emerging technologies is so complex that even the US has 100% subsidiaries of foreign defence OEMs like Airbus, BAE, Saab, Rolls Royce, etc. Competing with them improves the standard of the US defence companies and prevents complacency.
What India needs is a single FDI slab of 74% in defence with clear norms and a level-playing field. The 49% cap is of no use and 100% may be too one-sided. Higher FDI limit will also expose certain global OEMs that are not keen to invest in India, and are using 49% FDI as a convenient excuse to stay out. We also need to focus on key areas like land availability, uninterrupted power, logistics infrastructure, tax-relief and faster government clearances.
The NDA government today has the political mandate to bring in bold reforms. Making India an attractive destination for global OEMs is key to India’s long term self-reliance. The DRDO and DPSUs need a rude shake-up. The entry of Indian OEMs into the defence sector should be facilitated through fiscal and monetary incentives. The defence ministry needs to interact more with industry and academia, and heed contrarian opinions.
Twenty years from now, when we develop the capability to design and manufacture best-in-class fighter jets, submarines, missiles and UAVs, we can act all high and mighty. Now is not the time.

Editorial: E-Com RiseNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
There is little doubt that with increasing connectedness, the virtual world is becoming an important marketplace for goods and services. In fact, given cost efficiencies, the penetration of e-commerce is only bound to surge. A Morgan Stanley analysis holds that this “megatrend” (a Forbes term for globally transformative forces) is spreading at a rate that will see emerging economies close a significant gap with developed economies in terms of e-commerce penetration in the next 3 years. By 2018, nearly 50% of the online population in emerging economies will be transacting online for goods and services while the average penetration in developed economies will be at 63%. At the moment, the emerging market penetration averages just under 30% of the online population while that in mature economies, it is a little over 55%.
India—on the back of surging smartphone uptake and the resulting connectedness—will race ahead at a furious pace, increasing penetration from the 2014 level of below 20% to a little over 50% by 2018. The new penetration data should be seen as a pointer towards setting a clear policy environment for e-commerce, especially e-tail, given the opposition it is seeing from corporate brick-and-mortar retail. The spending on online retail, as per estimates, is unlikely to pinch brick-and-mortar retail, as it will remain a small part of overall retail spending in the next few years. However, e-tail’s implications for the nation’s economy are too significant—its boom will spill over to other sectors, from logistics to small and medium manufacturers, which will get a low-cost marketplace to sell wares—for us to ignore.

Editorial: Keep up the pressureNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief secretary Alok Ranjan’s letter to the finance ministry, asking it to tell PSU banks not to interfere in the state’s policy matters, shows the politico-bureaucratic class in the state continues to function in the old ways—the letter was first reported in FE last week. In this way of thinking, PSU banks are not supposed to look at their viability—profitability is a far cry—they are only supposed to dole out money to pay for irresponsible government policy and when the banks run out of money, capital infusion from the central government is always an option.
In this case, the heads of SBI and Punjab National Bank had written to the state government asking for the implementation of the Rangarjan formula for sugarcane pricing. That is, instead of asking mill owners to pay a higher—and completely unviable—state advised price (SAP) for sugarcane, move to a formula where mills share 75% of their ultimate earnings with the farmers with an initial payment on receipt of the sugarcane equal to the central government’s fair and remunerative price (FRP). The bankers needed to write since they have an exposure of around R6,000 crore to the sugar mills of UP and with the mills running huge losses, the banks have no way of getting their money back. With the sharp fall in global prices of commodities like sugar, the fears expressed by the bankers have become even more real.
Rather than get cowed down by the UP government, the banks would be advised to step up the pressure and refuse to give sugar mills any more working capital—in any case, with Karnataka and Maharashtra already implementing the Rangarajan formula, sugar from these states will be cheaper than that in UP, worsening the finances of the sugar mills. It is not as if the UP government has not had enough time to come out with a policy—during last year’s agitation by the sugar mills, it had promised to come up with a rational sugar policy by April 2014, but nothing has come of that so far. Indeed, even the sugar mills who have threatened not to start crushing sugar until a more rational policy is framed would do well to keep up the pressure—with the mills not buying sugar at the uneconomic SAP, farmers have already started selling to gur producers at much lower prices. Sooner, rather than later, the UP government just has to come to its senses and stop playing cane politics.

Editorial: The evidence is piling upNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The central bank has traditionally given several reasons for hiking interest rates or keeping them that way, and they ranged from high oil prices to high fiscal deficits and high inflationary expectations that needed to be anchored. Later, when the new RBI Governor came in, CPI inflation targets got added to this list. Most, if not all, of these reasons for a status quo on interest rates no longer exist. At $82 per barrel, oil prices are at their lowest in four years and few expect them to recover in a hurry with global demand not rising anywhere near as fast as expected, and OPEC in tatters thanks to the dramatic hike in US production levels—indeed, with diesel prices already at market rates, and falling, the danger of suppressed fuel inflation waiting to flare up in India seems remote at this point. As for food items, bumper harvests globally have led to a sharp fall in prices of most major crops, by around 20% in just the last 6 months; it helps that, apart from finally taking a decision to offload 10 million tonnes of FCI’s wheat stocks in the open market to dampen foodgrain prices, the government is also keeping MSP hikes to the minimum.
High fiscal deficits, cited as a major reason for increasing demand levels and inflation in the economy in the past, haven’t been an issue for well over a year now; indeed, some argue the government needs to go easy on this in order to stimulate the domestic economy.
During the last few months when the fall in inflation levels have been particularly savage—from 8.8% in January, CPI inflation is down to 6.5% in September, and core CPI from 8.1% to 5.9%—it has to be pointed out, effective borrowing rates have actually fallen with banks rushing to cut spreads for good borrowers and commercial paper and other rates also falling in the absence of any demand for funds. In other words, it is difficult to argue that monetary policy had much to do with inflation falling. The fact that the central bank’s inflationary expectations survey showed 3-month forward inflation rising from 12.9% in March (this is the inflation prediction for June when the actual was 7.5%) to 14.6% in September (this is the inflation expectation for December 2014) when inflation was collapsing makes it pretty clear the inflationary expectations survey—and the bit about inflation expectations getting embedded—doesn’t really add up to much.
But what if, it is argued, the oil price collapse is just a one-off, or that global food prices start rising again? Does the central bank want to be caught cutting rates one day and hiking them another? Put that way, it seems logical. But the important thing to keep in mind is that central banks work on broad probability of events, not on Black Swan probabilities. Right now, no one is looking at the oil or other commodity cycle turning for another year or so. And with the government keeping a lid on expenditure and trying to clear as many supply bottlenecks as possible, it is difficult to understand how RBI Deputy Governor HR Khan can feel inflation still has a long way to go.

Ebola: a stress test on health systemsNovember 9, 2014 2:15 pm
We play with fire if we skimp on public health
Lawrence Summers
Ebola was a ‘stress test’ on health systems, and Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea could not cope
©AP
Epidemics and pandemics are like earthquakes. Tragic, inevitable and unpredictable. It starts as a random event. A virus jumps species from a bird, bat, or other animal to “Patient Zero” – who passes it on to other human beings. More likely than not, over the course of this century we will face an influenza pandemic similar to the one in 1918 that killed 50m people.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said in the wake of the global economic meltdown that “you never let a serious crisis go to waste”. Crises are opportunities to learn. They point to measures that will prevent the collapse of institutions when they are under extreme pressure.
While the focus is understandably on responding to the Ebola crisis, it is equally important that it serves as a wake-up call with respect to inadequacies that threaten not just tragedy on an unprecedented scale but the basic security of the US and other wealthy nations. As with climate change, no part of the world can insulate itself from the consequences of epidemic and pandemic.
The report of the Global Health 2035 commission, which I co-chaired, points up three crucial lessons. First, collective action must be taken to build strong health systems in every corner of the globe. In west Africa, Ebola was a “stress test” on national health systems, and in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea the systems could not cope. There were too few trained health professionals; there was also too little equipment and too few supplies, and too little capacity for public health surveillance and control.
More
Reform as the answer
Nigeria’s containment of the virus after the first case was diagnosed in July is instructive. Its success, hailed by the World Health Organisation as a piece of “world class epidemiological detective work”, is explained by its aggressive, co-ordinated surveillance and control response. It already had a polio surveillance system, with skilled outbreak specialists who were quickly put to work tackling Ebola. While much of Nigeria’s health system, such as primary care services, remains very weak, on Ebola the surveillance and control system worked. Every country needs this kind of system. Prevention is cheaper than cure and leads to better outcomes.
Building these systems takes time and money. Our research, conducted with an international team of economists and health experts, and published last year in the medical journal The Lancet, suggests that the price of this “systems strengthening” would be about $30bn a year for the next two decades. The good news is that we have the financing to pay for this through a combination of aid and domestic spending. The cost represents well under 1 per cent of the additional gross domestic product that will be available to low- and lower-middle-income countries due to increased GDP growth over the next 20 years.
The second lesson is that the lack of investment in public health is a global emergency. The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. The entire budget for influenza was just $7·7m in 2013 – less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies.
It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever. It alone has the mandate and legitimacy to serve as a health protection agency for all countries, rich and poor. Starving it of funds is reckless.
The third lesson concerns scientific innovation. When it comes to discovering and developing medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tests, we have been largely ignoring the infectious diseases that disproportionately kill the world’s poor. Consequently, we still have no medicines or vaccine for Ebola. All we can do is provide basic life support, such as fluids and blood pressure treatment. For prevention, we have to rely on old-fashioned measures such as quarantine.
Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director-general, has explained the reason for this neglect. Doctors were “empty-handed”, she said, because “a profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay”. Ebola affects poor African nations, so drug companies see no profit in working on it. Nor is there an adequate incentive to invest in prevention. No society will allow companies to reap huge profits when disease is spreading rapidly.
Rich governments and donors need to step up. Investing several billion dollars a year, less than 0.01 per cent of global GDP, could be decisive in preventing tragedy on the scale of world war.
Some issues are even more important than recessions and elections. Ebola is a tragedy. Let us hope that it will also be a spur to taking the necessary steps to prevent the far greater one that is nearly inevitable on the current policy trajectory. The next Ebola is just around the corner.

Britain and the cuts: Blow for CameronGavyn Davies Britain will be squeezed
The level of cuts are nearly twice the £25bn estimate because that figure does not include planned cuts for two years out of the nine – 2015-16 and 2018-19 – and takes no account of the effect on departmental spending of rising numbers of pensioners and increases in pension payments. The Institute for Fiscal Studies last month criticised Mr Cameron for omitting the first and last year of the next parliament when calculating the size of the cuts to be made.
Even if the chancellor manages to cut welfare payments by another £12bn a year , as he promised in January, this would not be enough to prevent deeper overall cuts for government departments during the next parliament.
In the March Budget documents, data show that after taking account of inflation, the coalition cut annual day to day spending by government departments by £25bn between 2009-10 and 2014-15.
The Conservatives plan to increase the pace of these cuts over the next parliament, removing another £48bn from the total, reducing the total spent in departments from £312bn in 2014-15 to £264bn in 2018-19.
So far, the public sector has coped better than many expected. But with employees more restless about slow wage growth and the easier cuts already achieved, many experts think taxes are more likely to rise than fall after the next election to protect public services and keep the deficit falling.
The OBR and the Treasury have seen the FT’s findings but both declined to comment.

New species of frog named after Ozzy Osbourne for its shrill callBy Rachel Feltman November 10 Follow @rachelfeltman

A newly discovered species of tree frog has been named in honor of the British heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne. It's not unusual for scientists to honor celebrities when naming new species (just last month  a spider was named for John Lennon ) but those creatures don't always have obvious connections to their namesakes.
Dendropsophus ozzyi, which was described for the first time in the Nov. 6 issue of Zootaxa, actually has a clever (albeit dark) connection to the singer for which it's named. The .75 inch frog, which was found during a 2009 survey of the Brazilian Amazon, sounds remarkably like a bat.
Male tree frogs make their loud calls by inflating their vocal sacs. But National Geographic reports that Dendropsophus ozzyi has an unusually large sac, and sounds more like a bat than a tree frog. The scientists working on classifying the frog as a new species took to calling it a bat frog, and the connection to Osbourne came quickly after.
For those not up on their rock and roll history, Ozzy Osbourne and bats go way back: The singer accidentally bit the head off of a live bat during a 1982 performance (he thought the stunned bat, which a fan threw onto the stage, was made of rubber).
Hopefully the tiny frog will have a luckier fate than Ozzy's infamous bat buddy.

Why the Perry indictment should be dismissed: count II (threat of veto)  freedom of speechBy Eugene Volokh November 10 Follow @volokhc
As I noted below , Jim Ho and Prerak Shah (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher) and I have filed an amicus brief on behalf of 14 scholars, former judges, and former prosecutors (liberal, conservative, and moderate) arguing that the indictment of Gov. Rick Perry should be dismissed. (For a refresher on the indictment itself, see here .) You can read the brief in PDF form here , but I thought I’d also post the full text on the blog. Here is the argument on count II, which focuses on Perry’s threat to veto appropriations for the Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg’s office; I’ve posted separately on the separation of powers argument on count I and the immunity argument on count I .
* * *
II. Count II of the Indictment Should Be Dismissed, Because It Criminalizes Speech Protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Count II of the indictment alleges that Governor Perry violated the law by “threatening” to use his veto powers if a government official did not resign her post.  But he has every right to do just that.  Criminalizing Governor Perry’s threat to veto legislation violates his right to freedom of speech under the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.  This Count must also be dismissed.
A political official has the right to threaten to engage in an official act in order to persuade another government official to engage in some other official act.  That is not a crime — it is core political speech.  See, e.g., Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969) (“What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.”).
The Waco Court of Appeals said precisely that in a similar case over twenty years ago.  See State v. Hanson, 793 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App. — Waco 1990, no writ).  In that case, a county judge “was charged with having made a threat to take action as a public official in an attempt to coerce another public official into performing an official act.”  Id. at 272.  Specifically, the defendant in Hanson threatened to terminate some of the county’s funding in order to coerce a district judge to fire a county auditor and to coerce a county attorney to revoke an individual’s probation.  Id. at 271-72.  Both the trial court and the court of appeals correctly dismissed the charges.  As the court explained, in this sort of political context, “[c]oercion of a lawful act by a threat of lawful action is protected free expression.”  Id. at 272.
So too here.  Governor Perry has been charged with attempting to “coerce” a lawful, official act (the voluntary resignation of a public official) by threating to take a lawful, official act (the veto of an appropriations bill).  That is protected free expression, and the Governor cannot be prosecuted for it.[1]
Moreover, the consequences of allowing Governor Perry to be prosecuted under this law would be both far-reaching and devastating.  The prosecution’s theory of the case would criminalize a vast swath of constitutionally protected — and exceedingly common — political speech.  For example, it would make it illegal for:
a legislator to tell the Governor, “if you appoint John Smith to this position, I won’t vote for this law you want me to support”;
a Governor to tell a legislator, “if you don’t amend this bill in a particular way, I’ll veto it”;
a state legislator to tell a U.S. Senator, “if you vote for this federal bill, I’ll vote against this state law that you like”;
a legislator to tell the Governor, “if you don’t resign, I’ll vote to impeach you”; or
a government employee to tell his supervisor, “if you don’t give me a raise, I’ll ask for a transfer to a different department.”[2]
We need not limit ourselves to hypotheticals.  Consider, for example, what happened during the Texas Youth Commission controversy in 2007.  Countless state legislators across the political spectrum demanded the resignation of the commissioners — and threatened legislative action if they refused.  See, e.g., Lawmakers Decry Abuses Within Texas Youth Commission, Texas Senate News, Feb. 27, 2007 (“[Senator] Ogden said the Finance Committee is prepared to use the power of the purse to influence change at TYC . . . .  He said significant changes will have to occur within TYC, enough for him to have confidence to recommend to his committee members that ‘any appropriation’ should go to the agency.”); Perry: Board to Resign, Waxahachie Daily Light, Mar. 15, 2007 (“[At] a meeting of the joint committee charged with addressing problems at the TYC, lawmakers asked for the resignation of the board members, going so far as to pass a vote of no confidence against the board.”).
Likewise, when U.S. Senator Larry Craig was arrested for indecent conduct in a public restroom, “Republican leaders embarrassed by Craig’s behavior and news conference threatened to conduct hearings if Craig did not resign.”  Hardball with Chris Matthews, MSNBC, Sept. 5, 2007.
And when it was revealed that U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner had sent sexually themed photographs of himself via Twitter, “his fate was sealed . . . when party leaders in Congress and President Barack Obama began vociferously calling for him to go and threatened to remove him from various committees.”  Alex Spilius & Jon Swaine, Anthony Weiner Resigns over Lewd Twitter Photographs, Telegraph (U.K.), June 16, 2011.
According to the prosecution in this case, it would have been a crime under Texas law for any of those officials to demand the resignation of other officials, and then inform the other officials of potential retaliatory legislative actions if they refused.  That cannot be correct.  What the Texas legislators did in 2007, what the U.S. Senate Republican leadership did in 2007, and what the U.S. House Democratic leadership did in 2011 was neither criminal nor capable of being criminalized — it was protected political speech.
And so too here.  Just as Texas legislators were entitled to demand the resignation of the members of the Youth Commission, and just as members of Congress were entitled to demand the resignation of a Senator and a Representative who had disgraced their offices, Governor Perry was entitled to demand the resignation of an official whom he felt was no longer serving the best interests of the Texans he was elected to represent — and to promise to use his constitutionally provided veto power to achieve his goal.  That was protected speech, and the State cannot criminalize any of it.
* * *
Just last week, President Obama renewed his earlier threats to issue various executive orders if Congressional Republicans refused to pass comprehensive immigration reform.  See, e.g., President Barack Obama, Remarks by the President in a Press Conference (Nov. 5, 2014), transcript available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/05/remarks-president -press-conference; Neil Munro, Priebus: Obama Executive Amnesty Is A ‘Nuclear Threat’, The Daily Caller, Nov. 7, 2014, available at http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/07/priebus-obama-executive-amnesty-is-a-nuclear-threat.
If President Obama can tell Congressional Republicans (as he did just last week, at an official White House press conference):  “You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away” — why can’t Governor Perry tell a convicted official essentially the same thing:  “You resign from your office, and my veto goes away”?
Moreover, if this prosecution is not immediately dismissed, the chilling effect on political discourse could be disastrous.  Any public official who seeks to drive criminally or disgracefully behaving officials out of office will now rightly fear that a district attorney from the other side of the political spectrum would prosecute him — just as Governor Perry is being prosecuted here today.[3]
If Governor Perry is forced to endure a criminal trial, then the damage has already been done — even if he is ultimately acquitted.  The mere knowledge that an indictment can be maintained would itself chill a vast spectrum of constitutionally protected political speech by other political officials.  See Hanson, 793 S.W.2d at 273 (“A vague statute that potentially could punish protected political debate violates due process because of its chilling effect on the exercise of that essential right.”) (citing Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972)).
That is why an immediate writ of habeas corpus is necessary in this case.  This Court should announce — right now — that it is unconstitutional to prosecute Governor Perry for his protected political speech.
Conclusion
The flaws in this indictment strike at the heart of the separation of powers doctrine enshrined in the Texas Constitution, as well as the freedoms protected by both the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution.  So this prosecution must end immediately.  The application for a writ of habeas corpus should be granted.
[1]             We accept here for purposes of argument the special prosecutor’s position that District Attorney Lehmberg’s resignation would have constituted an official act.  But if leaving office is not an official act, then the elements of Section 36.03(a)(1) would not be satisfied, since that statute refers only to attempts to influence the exercise of official power or official duty.
[2]             This list of protected speech that would be deemed criminal reveals another fundamental problem with this count:  the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid.  So although Governor Perry engaged in constitutionally protected expression, in fact no one can be prosecuted under this statute.
A law is unconstitutionally overbroad if “a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”  Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (quotations and citation omitted).  And notably, prosecutorial discretion is not a defense to a statute that is overbroad.  “[T]he First Amendment protects against the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy of noblesse oblige.  We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly.”  United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 480 (2010).  Here, the law — as interpreted by the prosecution — would plainly capture an overwhelming amount of protected speech.  It is accordingly unconstitutionally overbroad.
[3]             See, e.g., Andrew Ramonas, Doggett: No Retreat on U.S. Attorney Picks, Main Justice, Oct. 13, 2009, available at http://www.mainjustice.com/2009/10/13/doggett-no-retreat-on-us-attorney-picks/ (quoting statement of U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett recommending “LULAC-supported Michael McCrum” for appointment as U.S. Attorney by President Obama).

You Might Not "Like" This: 3 Tips for Meaningful Conversationreddit
There's an element of awkward in a face-to-face conversation with someone new: direct eye contact that lasts a bit too long, the smell of coffee breath, and the tango of talking points that move the conversation forward.
It's far too easy to skip the human interaction and go on to the next "like" or reply to a new tweet. Unfollow and move on. Shift to a new conversation instead of digging deep and learning about the other person. I'm there with you, scrolling through my Facebook timeline and enjoying the random conversations between friends on different continents. A sucker for click-bait. The thing is, more and more people spend a large chunk of their time engaged in the digital world when a meaningful and authentic conversation -- one that builds a trusting relationship -- lies outside the screen of a smartphone.
Three Tips from the Greats on How to Build Meaningful Conversation
Having a meaningful and authentic conversation has been a struggle since we descended from trees whether it's to find a soulmate or the next cocktail networking party. Here are just three tips from the greats:
1. Build Trust With Others
Trust comes from time put in. The next time you meet someone new, listen to important dates or events coming up in the person's life. Put those dates into your calendar and send them an email or give them a call afterwards. Say the person you meet will be running the NYC Marathon in a few weeks. The day before the race, send a message wishing them luck on the race. Commit to a time to meet up again and ask how the race went. Continue to look for elements in the other person's life which you can follow up with the next time you see each other.
"Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships." - Stephen Covey
2. Ask Questions
It's so simple I'm afraid to even write it down and run the risk of you ditching this post to go read a new article that's flashing on the side of this screen right now. But it's incredible how many people, myself included, fail to ask meaningful questions about the other person.  Ramit Sethi tells us to get people to talk about themselves more and build a conversation around that. You may not care a lick about the topic they talk about, but that's not the point. The point is to learn about the other person. You may hate football, but if the person talks about her fantasy football team, then run with it.
Quick tip: Instead of asking "What do you do" or (even worse) "What do you do for money?" ask someone where they are from or take a note from Daniel Pink who says we should ask people "What's your story?" Many people don't like to be defined by their job. Life is much more than the job title we possess.
"Ask questions. Many people don't ask questions at all and love to talk about themselves." - Ramit Sethi
3. Swim in The Difference
There's a tipping point in a conversation after the initial hello. Understand that we all perceive the world differently depending on our own schema, culture, and individual experiences. You may feel comfortable with two feet of space between our faces when we talk and I might need three feet, all depending on our different cultural habits.
"To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this as a guide to our communication with others." - Tony Robbins
Meaningful conversation can be intensely awkward and your sweat glands may tell you to stick to the digital world for communication. There you'll be able to quickly leave and move on to the next tweet. The digital world is a beautiful place where one can communicate cross culturally, really connect with a micro-niche community that feels like family, and quickly engage in surface-level conversation. It's not, however, where we can often dig deep into a conversation that Socrates would be proud of.
I'll be there with you -- scrolling through my timelines, tagging others in my Instagram feed, and sharing what I read with others. I'd love to connect with you too and learn a bit about you and we'll chat, Tweet-style. I'm afraid our relationship, however, will likely remain surface-level until we meet face-to-face for a damn fine cup of coffee. And this coffee is on me.

5 Questions To Ask Before Seeking Startup Fundingreddit
Before you start looking for ways to fund your startup, make sure you can answer these questions.
Funding is one of the biggest concerns of new entrepreneurs. Determining how much you need, securing the capital, and following up with your investors are all stressful steps in the entrepreneur's journey, but before you even think about sourcing your startup capital, you need to make sure you can answer these five questions:
1. Why is your idea going to be successful? You need to know the answer to this question, backed with research and objective data. When you shop your idea around to investors, they don't want to hear "this is the greatest thing ever!" They want to hear real projections.
2. How much money do you need? Do the research ahead of time. Figure out exactly what you need to get the ball running -- eliminate everything that isn't absolutely necessary, and cut your business down to the minimum viable product. Then, determine exactly how much money you need to cover those costs. If you don't know, it's time to do some more research.
3. When will you start making money? You should be able to realistically project the turning point, at which your business will start getting a stable stream of revenue. Be conservative and realistic with this projection, and base it on actual data -- not wishful thinking.
4. Why would someone invest? How are you going to incentivize your investors? Are they getting partial ownership of your company? Sample products as a crowdfunder? Will they be involved with any major decision making?
5. Can you handle the financial planning? This is also important. If you don't feel confident in your abilities to keep track of all the major finances of your company, you need to hire an accountant or a fiscal consultant.
If you can answer these questions specifically, and without a sweat, then it's time to start seeking funding. Angel investors, potential partners, and crowdfunding are all great options, but it's up to you which one will work best for your business.

You Had Me at Hello: 5 Steps to Superhero Public Speaking Statusreddit
You're walking on stage and your heart starts beating out of your chest. You shake. You sweat. You sound like a robot. You forget your lines and freeze and probably turn red and then start apologizing before you continue an awful downward spiral of embarrassment. Ninjas have hijacked your brain and... wait... what are you supposed to be talking about? Did you really just forget your opening line?
Here's the good news: Chill out. You are not alone. Did you know that the number one fear other than death is public speaking? Yes, some of you would rather die than speak in front of a group of people (#drastic).
But here's the thing: Public speaking is not about perfection (who has time for that). It's not about people judging you (believe me they have better things to talk about). It's not about "speeches" anymore (no thank you, long boring commencement ceremony). Look at it with a different lens. It's about communicating who you are with confidence and content.
Think of it like talking to your friend in a casual, awesome conversation. Think of it as something fun. Not only is it one of your greatest assets through life but it helps you be superhero status comfortable in your own skin. It helps you own your message. It helps you communicate. And let's be honest: If your standing ovation talk goes online it can perhaps help you get into school, get more romantic attention, get lots of Facebook likes or  all of the above. Here are five steps to going from a scary red-faced robot to a TED-like superstar:
1. You had me at hello.
Get right to it. Forget the thank you's. Forget the "How are you guys doing today?" or the "My name is blah blah from blah blah." If you tell me something in that first sentence that makes me care... you have me for the entire ride. Be provocative. Be bold. Make a statement. Give us passion. Give us something to listen to. Edit out the noise. Edit out the filler words ("however," "moreover," "in addition," "in conclusion" -- this is not a paper we are grading you on). Give Trisha 10 seconds of your time and I bet you want to keep watching to see what the heck she's talking about.
2. This is a play and you're the star.
No matter how long you have up there, you need an opening, a middle and an end. It's like a play with three acts. Your opening should grab us (check). The middle stuff: Tell us a story. Make us laugh, Make us cry. Bring us on this journey with you. Try not to use too many quotes from others. Try not to use too many references. You are talking because we want to hear what you have to say.
Now for that last line: Make us remember it. Is it an action item? Is it a statement? Whatever it is, end it with power and conviction -- because whatever you talked about for say, 18 minutes, we're going to remember that last line most. Own it. Why thank you David Saddington , I will let you know how climate change affects me.
3. Keep it moving.
Be careful with memorizing word for word. Use an outline. Use slides or photos not just to help tell your story but to keep you on track. If you forget or fumble do not, I repeat (most important thing ever), do NOT apologize to your audience. If you do, you lose their trust. Take a few seconds. Regroup yourself (it feels longer to you than it does to us I promise). Reboot. Dive back in. Come back stronger than ever. Even if it's not what you rehearsed that's okay. Keep it moving. We don't know the difference. So stay confident and act like this is the way it was supposed to go. You know your story better than anyone. So just tell it. Patrick Kane has quite the story. He's bionic and now you want to become it too.
4. Everyone is in their underwear.
It doesn't begin when you start speaking. From the moment you walk on that stage -- it's yours. It's not just about your words. It's about your body language and engagement with the room. Whatever you need to do to feel comfortable do it. That good old "tip" that everyone is in their underwear might not work for you. Some plan ahead to know where a close friend or family member will be sitting so you can pretend you are just talking to them. But the one that I love the most is take a moment once you get in place to feel the space to look into the audience -- then forget they exist. Focus on something like a light in the back. Bring the attention back into your mind and just focus on you. It's not about them. Who cares about that cell phone ringing? Who cares about that person walking out the door? It doesn't matter. What matters is you. Dress like you. Talk like you. Don't give us anything but your most authentic self. Gabi knows how to command an audience. She is as authentic as you get. She took risks. She bared her soul. She took us on her journey. We danced, we cried, we clapped.
5. Mirrors, dogs and strangers.
Okay, okay, some people yes, are just naturally more comfortable and confident speaking in front of people. And I'm going to share the number one best kept secret when it comes to public speaking: Practice!
Wow, who would have thought? Even if you're going to "wing it," you still need to practice. Many of us run our talks in front of our bathroom mirror over and over. Change location as much as possible. The problem with rehearsing in the same physical space over and over is that when it comes to the real thing you will probably not be doing this in your mom's bathroom. Muscle memory is a bigger deal than you think. Every time you rehearse do it from a different location. Tell it to your dog, on your walk home from school. Ask a bunch of your friends if you can run it with them. The more you do it, and from the more places you do it from, the more it will brand into your brain. Then when it comes to showtime you just speak it from your heart. It will just flow. Feel the flow with Ankit and you'll never look at social media the same again.
Public speaking also helps build community. It helps connect you with like-minded people and it forces you to hone in on what is most important to you. It forces you to literally look in the mirror and make sure you like what you see.
In a world where we are all hiding behind computer screens most of the day, we need those nerves, that sweat, that moment of memory lapse to remind us that we are still human. To feel that rush of adrenaline and excitement.
You're on that stage. The lights are bright. The countdown clock begins....

00:01  Ever sense of the Internet was created it's been organized
00:04  around basic principles of openness. Fairness and freedom. There's no gatekeepers
00:10  deciding which sites you get access. There note holed roads on
00:14  the information superhighway. This set of principles. Idea of net neutrality.
00:20  Has unleashed the power of the Internet and given innovators the
00:23  chance to thrive. Abandoning these principles with threatened and Internet as
00:29  we know. That's one way out plan to keep the Internet
00:33  free and open. And that's why I'm urging the Federal Communications
00:36  Commission to do everything they can't protect net neutrality for every.
00:41  They should make it clear that whether using computer phone or
00:44  tablet. Internet providers have a legal obligation not to block or
00:48  limit your access to a website. Cable companies can't decide which
00:53  online sports you can shop. Which streaming services you can use.
00:57  And they can't let any company pay for priority over its
01:00  competitors. To put these protections in place I'm asking the FCC
01:05  to reclassify Internet service under title to along known as the
01:08  telecommunications act. In plain English I'm asking them to recognize that
01:13  for most Americans the Internet has become an essential part of
01:16  everyday communication and every day. FCC is an independent agency and
01:21  ultimately this decision is there's a law. But the public has
01:25  already commented nearly four million times asking the FCC to make
01:29  sure that consumers. Not the cable company. Gets to decide which
01:33  sites they use. Americans make their voices heard and standing up
01:37  for the principles that make the Internet a powerful force for
01:40  change. As long as I'm president that's what I'll be fighting

President Obama came out strongly Monday for the concept of net neutrality, saying that "an open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life."
In a written statement, Obama  asked the Federal Communications Commission to "create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality," and to ensure that phone and cable companies will not be able "to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."
The FCC is nearing a decision.
Net neutrality supporters hailed the president's comments as a victory for Internet users and free speech advocates. Critics, including major corporations and Republican lawmakers, called it an overreaction that will lead to lawsuits, worse service, and higher prices.
Tom Wheeler, the Obama-appointed chairman of the FCC, said that "like the president, I believe that the Internet must remain an open platform for free expression, innovation, and economic growth. We both oppose Internet fast lanes. The Internet must not advantage some to the detriment of others."
Wheeler said the commission would enter Obama's submission into the record of its proceedings, and would continue to hear "from all stakeholders, including the public (and) members of Congress of both parties."
In the statement — issued while Obama is in China for an Asian economic summit — the president noted that "the FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone."

Newcastle still gripped by austerity
Nov 10, 2014 : Newcastle upon Tyne's city council is undergoing a 3-year programme to cut more than £100m from its spending, with the loss of 1200 jobs. Chris Tighe, northeast correspondent, reports on a city where – in the words of one local charity worker – 'life is one long recession'.

How the good fat burns calories and could help treat type 2 diabetes and obesityBy Abby Phillip November 10 Follow @abbydphillip
A 15-year-old boy with type 2 diabetes checks his blood sugar. A better understanding of "brown fat" could lead to new treatments for the condition. (Richard A. Lipski/The Washington Post)
By now, you may have heard about brown adipose tissue , or "brown fat." It is a type of fat, most likely present in all humans, that is a super calorie burner.
In recent years, a renewed interest in brown fat has revealed some promising attributes. Not only does brown fat play a role in warming up the body in cold temperatures, but by doing that, it is also an extraordinarily efficient calorie burner. And while some people may have more of this fat than others, there are ways of increasing the amount of brown fat in your body.
A new study has unveiled a piece of the puzzle in the emerging research into this remarkable tissue. Brown fat, it turns out, acts as a "super vacuum" to suck up excess glucose (sugar) in the blood by producing large amounts of a substance that transports glucose into the brown fat cells, where it can be burned to produce heat -- a process called thermogenesis.
"If you can start the tissue to burn and produce heat, then you can actually in a way take away excess glucose in the blood," said Tore Bengtsson, one of the study's authors and a professor of physiology at Stockholm University in Sweden. "Now we actually understand how this production of these glucose transporters work."
Brown fat cells do this at a more efficient rate than other mechanisms the body uses to absorb glucose in the blood. When activated, the brown fat cells produce 10 or more times the amount of glucose transporters than insulin, for example, according to Bengtsson.
For people with type 2 diabetes, whose bodies do not use insulin properly and as a result have elevated blood glucose levels, these findings could lead to new drugs that can activate brown cells and reduce blood glucose levels without insulin.
More than 29 million Americans live with type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association . And more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; obesity can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes .
"The implication of this is normally when you have type 2 diabetes you have to inject insulin to reduce your blood sugar levels," Bengtsson said. "However you could make a medicine which is not based on insulin signalling. It's a completely new pathway that can be targeted for taking up glucose in the blood."
The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology on Monday, helps to connect the dots between years of findings suggesting that better understanding brown tissue can lead to new treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The tissue, which is typically found around the neck and spinal cord, is more present in the body when you are young; people who are overweight or obese tend to have less of it.
Initially, beyond infants who need the heat-producing tissue to maximize survival in the first days and months of life, scientists didn't fully understand whether adult humans had and used brown tissue. But recent research has also found that the amount of brown tissue grows in cold weather or when people are exposed to cold environments. Conversely, it declines in warm environments.
The findings support what scientists believe are the evolutionary origins of the tissue. In mammals and in humans, it helps regulate body temperature by converting glucose and free fatty acids in the blood into heat that the body might need to survive in colder temperatures.
"Brown fat has been investigated for a very long time in small mammals," noted Bengtsson. "Five or six years ago, we actually understood that we had brown fat in humans and the brown fat is working in humans -- not only in infant humans but in adults."
Bengtsson said that he is working on the next step in the research -- looking for specific ways of activating the cells, which will be crucial for the development of new drugs.

Description: Researchers at North Carolina State University have designed a technique that can remotely control cockroaches.
By Rachel Feltman, The Washington Post, Washington Post
Researchers at North Carolina State University have figured out how to make cyborg cockroaches -- or biobots, as they call them -- pick up sound and seek out its source. So one day, the first responders to a rubble-filled disaster scene might be rescue roaches.
Cyborg cockroaches aren't new: They came on the scene a few years ago, with DIY enthusiasts jumping to create their own remote-controlled bugs. It's not all that difficult to perform the necessary surgery and hook a roach up to a computerized backpack.
Acoustic Steering of Roach Biobots
Description: To help surviving victims buried under the rubble after natural disasters, biobots needs to localize them.

But while some people find it fun to steer a cockroach around, the obvious application is in search-and-rescue: Cockroaches are tiny and resilient, perfect for getting through the nooks and crannies of a disaster zone. If rescue workers can control them and have them carry mics and cameras, they can be used to track down survivors.
This work, published in IEEE Sensors, is a great step in that direction. The researchers equipped their latest biobots with an array of microphones, which together can detect the direction of a sound and steer the biobot toward it.

Though open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act doesn't begin officially until Saturday, those who plan on obtaining insurance through the public exchanges can start to browse plans starting today at healthcare.gov/see-plans/ .Enrollment extends through Feb. 15.
The federal website does not require browsers to register. Instead, it prompts people to enter a ZIP code and information about annual income, family size and whether or not family members smoke or are eligible for insurance through work or Medicare or Medicaid.
Illinois residents who enroll in Obamacare on the whole will pay higher premiums than last year for the most popular plans, but they'll have many more options to choose from, according to 2015 plan information released Friday. ( Wes Venteicher, Gregory Karp, Robert Channick )
On Friday, officials announced that Illinois would have 410 plans available in 2015, more than double the 165 offered this year. Along with more options, however, comes generally higher premiums for the most popular plans. Premiums for the lowest-cost options in silver plans will rise 2.6 percent on average statewide, although rates in that category will vary widely, from a decrease of 5 percent to an increase of 12 percent, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance.

You might not think that a luxury car as exclusive as the Maserati Ghibli S Q4 would ever be headed to the rental car fleets. But then again, this isn't any normal rental car fleet.
National Car Rental is adding the Ghibli S Q4 to its "Premier Selection" group, a special area of the rental lot where a few super-premium cars are offered. The Ghibli, which comes billed as Maserati's first midsize luxury sports sedan, can be rented at 10 National airport locations. They are Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, San Diego and Seattle.
"Through our work with Maserati, one of the most premium vehicle manufacturers in the world, we are able to provide National customers with another high-end upgrade option for their next rental," said Rob Connors, an assistant vice president for National, in a statement.
Ghibli S Q4 was introduced last year as Maserati's smaller model — 11 inches shorter than the Quattroporte sedan. Yet it still has the hallmarks of the brand, including a a 404-horsepower Ferrari-built twin-turbocharged V-6 engine, eight-speed transmission and Brembo brakes.

The brains of marijuana users are different  especially if they start youngBy Abby Phillip November 10 Follow @abbydphillip

If you're confused about what marijuana use really does to people who use it, you're not alone. For years, the scientific research on health effects of the drug have been all over the map.
But marijuana advocates point to other research indicating that the drug is far less addictive than other drugs , and some studies have found  no relationship between IQ and marijuana use in teens .
Researchers at the Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas in Dallas sought to clear up some of the confusion with a study that looked at a relatively large group of marijuana users and evaluated their brains for a slew of different indicators.
What they found was complex, but the pattern was clear: The brains of marijuana users were different than those of non-marijuana users. The area of the brain responsible for establishing the reward system that helps us survive and also keeps us motivated was smaller in users than in non-marijuana users. But there was also evidence that the brain compensated for this loss of volume by increasing connectivity and the structural integrity of the brain tissue.
Those effects were more pronounced for marijuana users who started young.
"The orbitofrontal cortex is one of the primary regions in a network of brain areas called the reward system," explained Francesca Filbey, lead author of the study and an associate professor of the neurogenetics of addictive behavior at the University of Texas in Dallas. "It helps us determine what is good for us and what keeps us sustained. "In this case, the orbitofrontal cortex plays a role in drug use because drug use and things associated with it -- paraphernalia for example -- are associated with the rewarding effects of drugs."
The study, published Monday in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , used MRI scans to look at the brains of 62 non-marijuana users and 48 regular marijuana users, 27 of whom used marijuana but not other drugs. The marijuana users reported ingesting the drug about three times a day --  very heavy use -- and had used it for an average of about 10 years.
Looking first at atypically heavy marijuana use is necessary to identify structural effects, if there are any, Filbey said. Subsequent research would look at varying levels of use to find out if differences compared to non-users are still observed. For example, in Colorado, only about 22 percent of marijuana users reported using the drug about once a day at most.
Relative to other studies, this one had a fairly large sample size; it also excluded participants who had symptoms of psychosis, brain injury or neurological disorders in order to reduce the likelihood that the tests would pick up on other confounding factors. And it looked at three brain characteristics: the volume of the orbitofrontal cortex, how connected that part of the brain was to other areas, and the structural integrity of the white matter.
"We found that while the orbitofrontal cortex was smaller, there was greater functional and structural connectivity," said Filbey. "The white matter seemed to have greater integrity than the [non-marijuana using group]. And the connection between the orbitofrontal cortex and other areas were stronger."
That's potentially positive news suggesting that whatever impact marijuana use might have on the size or volume of that part of the brain, it may be offset by better connectivity and structural soundness. "It suggests that there is definitely a more complicated pattern that the brain seems to be able to compensate for any kind of loss in order to keep that network maintained," Filbey said.
However, Filbey's research also indicated that some of these findings could be affected by how young the person was a the time that they started using marijuana and how long marijuana use continued. People who started younger appeared to show more protective effects -- stronger connectivity and integrity in their white matter. But the longer the person used the drug, those features began to erode. After about six or seven years of use, connectivity and integrity begin to erode.
"So whatever compensatory effects that there may be originally seemed to diminish with prolonged use," she added.
There is no proven connection between the structural characteristics of this area in the brain and certain behaviors in humans. And it is possible that the small orbitofrontal cortex observed in marijuana users predated their marijuana use.  A 2012 study found that smaller orbital frontal cortex volume at 12 years of age appeared to predict the initiation of marijuana use later in life.
Further long-term research is needed to determine what if any effects cessation has on brain structures of marijuana users.

3 of Chicago s best  most worthy--and unrealized--plansStill, she said The Resurrection Project installed Wi-Fi in at least one new development, based on its involvement in this planning process.
2. Cannery Row Shopping Center
Source: Chicago Lawn Quality-of-Life Plan
Originally a can factory, this site at West 60th Street and South Western Avenue was redeveloped in the 1980s for retail but much of the land remains unused.
The neighborhood wanted this multi-block property modernized into a town center.
"Greater Southwest Development Corp. was part-owner, working with General Growth, working with Sears and Jewel and others to make the deal happen," Vasquez said. "Then General Growth filed for bankruptcy. The foreclosure crisis, always simmering in Chicago Lawn, hit real hard. Economic recession. Et cetera."
And the Jewel and Sears have closed.
No one can control those larger economic forces. But in the case of this project, Vasquez said several developers "are still there and working at it."
The shopping center at the former cannery was first targeted in the neighborhood's 2005 quality-of-life plan, part of LISC's New Communities Program. One year later, in 2006, those communities were asked to select the most important project in those plans, the Chicago Lawn neighborhood chose the shopping center.
Even with the recession, Vasquez said 11 of the 14 projects in the 2006 document have been realized, making the loss in Chicago Lawn all the more frustrating.
3. Better transportation access among neighborhoods, without going through downtown
Source: NCP Neighborhood Partnership for Chicago 2016
Many ideas in this plan didn't move forward because Chicago lost its bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.
But Vasquez thinks the transportation recommendations should be implemented anyway.
The plan proposed three new "L" and seven new Metra stations as well as less costly solutions to connect neighborhoods, such as trolley service.
Trolleys have since been proposed for the museum campus as a way to connect the planned Lucas Museum for Narrative Art with nearby attractions, including Soldier Field and McCormick Place.
"We need everything you can think of to connect neighborhoods without making a journey to the Loop," Vasquez said. She noted the need for more bikeways, such as the elevated 606 trail, which are independent of the road system.
Since the 2008 proposal, key improvements such as a universal transit card and the Divvy bike-sharing program are in process or thriving. Yet other transit infrastructure, such as the Western-to-Fullerton leg of the No. 11 Lincoln Avenue bus, which serves a small business corridor, have been cut.
Meanwhile, Vasquez joked at the Club, "Planning for future plans is being planned."

Facebook Is Giving You More Control Over Your News Feedreddit
Facebook on Friday unveiled new tools to help users control and understand their News Feed.
The switch is part of an effort by Facebook to give its users more control over the site's mysterious News Feed algorithm. One key new feature: You’ll now be able to easily see who and what most frequently fills up your News Feed.
Under the updated News Feed settings (to be introduced as an added tab called Manage News Feed), you can find out which friends, pages and groups you’ve seen the most over the past week. According to Facebook's explanation of the algorithm , your feed is based on who and what you interact with when you're posting, liking and commenting.
We reached out to Facebook to find out if the profiles you browse but don't interact with (in other words, the people you Facebook-stalk) affect your most-seen list. A spokesperson told us the News Feed algorithm takes into account over 100,000 factors, including the profiles you visit, to determine what shows up in your News Feed. But actions, such as clicking on links and liking posts, are weighed more heavily than just browsing.
Your Facebook week in summary
The update also gives users more control over what content they see in their News Feeds. Previously, you could "unfollow" people and groups or say, "I don't want to see this," to hide posts similar to those you truly despise. Now you will have an additional option: to merely "See Less," limiting the amount of such content you see, but still giving you an occasional taste.
It's easier to limit what type of content you see
Oh, and if you ever regret unfollowing someone, you can now find and follow them again using the new tool. Just look at your Summary page (viewable above), and you'll be able to see a list of every user, page and group you have unfollowed.
Adam Mosseri, the Facebook News Feed's product management director, told the Wall Street Journal that Facebook users can expect more options and customization to the News Feed settings in the future. That may possibly include sorting posts by topic and more easily into friend groups.
This post has been updated to include information provided by a Facebook spokesperson.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose for a fifth straight session and gained 39.81 points, or 0.2%, to close at an all-time high of 17,613.74. Earlier, the blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 17,621.87.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 6.34 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2038,25 after earlier setting an all-time intraday high of 2038.70. The S&P 500 was up for a fourth straight day. The Nasdaq composite index gained 19.08 points, or 0.4% to 4651.62.
With 90% of the S&P 500 companies reporting, 74.6% have posted earnings above Wall Street analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. That's better than the average 63% of companies beating estimates in a typical quarter.
As the third-quarter earnings season winds down, retail earnings will be in focus this week as Macy's, Walmart J.C. Penney and Nordstrom report later this week.
Shares of cable companies took a tumble after President Obama strongly endorsed the concept of net neutrality and said Internet providers should not be allowed to form deals with online services to prioritize their content. Time Warner Cable (TWC) fell 4.9% to $136.50 and Comcast (CMCSA) fell 4% to $52.95.

Russia's financial markets were in focus after the country's central bank scrapped its daily controls on the value of the ruble, allowing the battered currency to float freely in financial markets earlier than planned. The currency has come under sustained pressure in the face of Western sanctions over Ukraine and plummeting oil prices.
The ruble has lost nearly half its value against the dollar this year. The move appears to have eased the pressure on the ruble, which strengthened sharply on the news, trading up 2.3% at 45.6 rubles a dollar in late trading.
In Asia, where China was hosting the annual meeting of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advanced 0.8%to 23,774.70 and China's Shanghai composite index shot 2.3% higher to 2473.67. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.6% to 16,780.53.

Planning to lease one more plane to Etihad, says Jet Airways

(Etihad Airways, which…)
MUMBAI: Private carrier Jet Airways today said it is likely to lease one more Boeing 777-300 ER to its equity partner Etihad.
Etihad Airways, which holds 24 per cent stake in the Naresh Goyal-led carrier, has already taken on lease six planes from Jet Airways.
"We may lease one more Boeing 777 aircraft to Etihad on a short-term basis," Jet Airways Vice-president for Aeropolitical, Government and International Affairs Gautam Acharya said during a post-earnings analysts call here.
The airline has leased out altogether nine aircraft to Etihad and Turkish Airlines, he said, adding, "Four Boeing 777-300ERs and two A330s are leased to Etihad, while three Boeing 777-300ERs are with Turkish Airlines."
Etihad had recently said it was planning to take some more planes from Jet. "We are finalising plans to introduce two aircraft before the end of the year," Etihad had said.
One of the three aircraft leased to Turkish Airlines is coming back, and which may go to Etihad on lease, Acharya said.
The Mumbai-based full service carrier has 113 planes in its fleet, of which 26 are owned by the carrier and the rest 87 are leased.
The country's second largest airline by market share, Jet cut down its consolidated loss by a whopping 95.7 per cent at Rs 43 crore in the three months to September on the back of a Rs 305 crore one-time income from the sale of its loyalty programme to Etihad and better operational efficiency.
Besides, on a standalone basis, it flew back into profit with Rs 69.82 crore profit against a net loss of Rs 891 crore in the year-ago period.
The operational restructuring initiatives with route and network rationalisation are already yielding dividends on the domestic and international network, the airline's Chief Executive Cramer Ball had said at the Q2 earnings.
The organic network expansion, coupled with enhanced global connectivity through alliances and code-share pacts, had also helped in increasing international passenger traffic, Ball had said in the result statement over the weekend.

(Barack Obama voiced support…)
WASHINGTON: Internet providers shouldn't be allowed to cut deals with online services like Netflix or YouTube to move their content faster, and should be regulated more like phone companies, President Barack Obama said Monday in an announcement that was swiftly rejected by industry.
The Federal Communications Commission is nearing a decision on how far to go to protect Internet consumers from backroom deals between broadband providers like Verizon and AT&T and content companies like Netflix. Obama's statement puts significant political pressure on FCC commissioners and aligns the White House with Internet activists who warn against the creation of so-called Internet ``fast lanes.''
``For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business,'' Obama said in his statement. ``That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information _ whether a phone call, or a packet of data.''
Industry quickly pushed back. CTIA-The Wireless Association called Obama's proposal a ``gross overreaction'' that would ignore other viewpoints.
``CTIA and its members are committed to delivering an open mobile Internet, but applying last century's public utility regulation to the dynamic mobile broadband ecosystem puts at risk the investment and innovation which characterizes America's world-leading $196 billion wireless industry,'' said the group's president and CEO, Meredith Attwell Baker.
Last January, a federal court overturned key portions of an open Internet regulation put in place by the FCC in 2010. The court said the FCC had ``failed to cite any statutory authority'' to keep broadband providers from blocking or discriminating against content.
That ruling sent the FCC back to the drawing board. Until the FCC can agree on new regulations that satisfy the court's requirements, Internet service providers could block or discriminate against content moving across their networks with impunity.
Internet activists say the FCC should reclassify the Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act to ensure it has enough power to regulate the Internet effectively. That's exactly what industry doesn't want to happen. Industry officials say they are committed to an open Internet in general but want flexibility to think up new ways to package and sell Internet services.

Starbucks CEO: Veterans Day has been turned into a weekend saleBy Dan Lamothe November 10 Follow @danlamothe
The CEO of Starbucks Coffee Company criticized the way America treats its veterans on Monday, saying that Veterans Day “has been turned into a weekend sale,” and more needs to be done to understand the military experience.
“That’s not respectful for me,” said Howard Schultz, speaking at an event for veterans at The Washington Post.
Schultz appeared along with Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert A. McDonald, Washington Post journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran and some veterans to discuss how those who serve can continue to contribute to America after they take off the uniform for the final time. There’s a business case to hire veterans into corporate jobs, Schultz said, citing the “authentic leadership” they bring. But it has to be ingrained in the hiring practices of companies, he added.
The panel discussion, “Leading the Way,” is one of several events planned in the nation’s capital this week in conjunction with Veterans Day on Tuesday. Notably, Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood, Eminem, Metallica, Rihanna, the Black Keys, Dave Grohl and other entertainers will combine Tuesday night to put on The Concert for Valor on the National Mall. The event — outlined here — is sponsored by Starbucks, HBO and Chase, and will air on HBO at 7 p.m.
Schultz, who never served in the military, is pushing other corporations to reconsider how they evaluate veterans for jobs. He just released a book, “For Love of Country,” that is co-written with Chandrasekaran and includes the stories of numerous veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Schultz said the book and concert are both efforts to get more people to talk about the veteran experience. The concert will include vignettes drawn from the book and delivered in filmed segments by entertainers like Will Smith and and Tom Hanks.
“We have to ask ourselves, what kind of nation are we? What kind of nation do we want to be?” Schultz said. “I think not only does the veteran deserve better, the American people will deserve much more by understanding collectively what we have done.”

8 Habits That Breed Successreddit
As an entrepreneur, chances are you always have new goals that you are looking to achieve and new milestones you are looking to conquer. However, finding the internal success you need in order to achieve these goals can sometimes be a challenge. In order to have true, inherent success in your life and in your career, it needs to come from within and be part of your personality and your being. Fortunately, there are eight easy habits that you can start participating in that breed this type of success. Letting yourself form these habits is a more sustainable way of finding success. This can help you find more long-term success as habits are not rules, and when they are incorporated into your everyday life it becomes part of who you are as a person and a professional.
1. Plan Your Work Day
Take time to make a plan. Truly successful people can take the time to spend 20 minutes planning out their day. This plan should be more than a list of things to do, but it should be a more detailed plan. It should also allocate the time of the day you are to work on each particular task. Get in this habit and it can help your everyday productivity.
2. Get in a Routine
Having a routine every day, or every week, can help any person be more successful. Those who have a routine are much more likely to be successful. This routine can help add balance and familiarity to otherwise chaotic schedules.
3. Always Look at Everything Again
One great habit for breeding success in your life, is the habit of looking over every decision you make, from the opposite perspective. Before making a decision, get in the habit of saying "Is there another way of looking at this?" Doing this can help you come up with more dynamic ideas and avoid some potential pitfalls.
4. Set Small Goals
Set three specific goals every week, and make setting these goals a routined habit. For example, take some time every Sunday evening to set your goals. These goals may be small, and they may only be for a few days, but by overcoming and reaching these small goals on a weekly basis, you are welcoming in much more success to your life.
5. End Your Day By Planning For Tomorrow
Before you end one day, make a list of things you want to get done the following day. This is a great way to unwind and bring the end of your workday to a close, and it will keep you on track the following morning.
6. Take the Time to Learn From Failures
Failure is an inevitable part of business. Every time you are faced with a failure, take the time to reflect on that failure. Instead of being distraught, take the time to write down what you have learned from that failure, and keep it for use later on. This can be a hard habit to stick with, but it is one that can be more than worth it.
7. Force Yourself to Take One Risk a Week
These risks can be small or large, but by forcing yourself to take a risk at least every week or every month, you can start finding much more natural, inbred success in your life. Successful people start doing things before they are ready, make this a habit in your life and start seeing the positive outcome.
8. Add a Sense of Urgency to Your Day
Add a sense of urgency to everything you do. When you get in the habit of acting with urgency, you are much more likely to find the most efficient solution to a problem and move on to the next task, while keeping an eye on your bigger overall goals. This simple mindset can lead to a great deal of success down the line.

New York City will stop arresting so many people for possessing marijuanaBy Mark Berman November 10 Follow @markberman
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)
The New York Police Department arrests thousands and thousands of people each year for possessing small amounts of marijuana. That will change next week, when officers will issue a ticket rather than arresting someone with a small amount of marijuana, city officials announced Monday.
Police officers will still arrest someone under certain circumstances, including if the person has a warrant for their arrest, but Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office said that the policy would mean that possessing small amounts of marijuana would only result in a fine.
This change, which begins on Nov. 19, would have a very real impact on the people who are arrested, a group that is overwhelmingly young and black or Latino, according to a recent study  from the Drug Policy Alliance and Marijuana Arrest Research Project.
Between January and August of this year, 86 percent of the people arrested for possessing marijuana were black or Latino, while just 10 percent of those arrested were white, the study found. The majority of these people were young adults (more than half were age 25 or younger) and had no real criminal record.
Police in New York still make a sizable number of these arrests each year, even though the overall total has declined in recent years. The number of arrests dipped to 28,000 last year from 50,000 during the later years of the Bloomberg administration, as documented by the Marijuana Arrest Research Project . An analysis by the New York Civil Liberties Union last year called New York City “the nation’s marijuana arrest capital” (and also noted “consistently large racial disparities in marijuana arrests” across the state between 2001 and 2010).
Other New York officials have publicly vowed to move away from focusing so much attention on such arrests. In July, Kenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, announced that his office would no longer prosecute most cases involving someone found with a small amount of marijuana.
“This new policy is a reasonable response to the thousands of low-level marijuana arrests that weigh down the criminal justice system, require significant resources that could be redirected to more serious crimes and take an unnecessary toll on offenders,” Thompson said in a statement. (In response, William J. Bratton, the New York City police commissioner, said the new policy would not change anything for officers.)
A shift in New York would follow consistent criticism of how the police department treats minority residents, something that has come up again and again in the last mayoral race,  discussions of “stop and frisk” and the July death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died after being placed in a chokehold by a city police officer.
This change would have a broader meaning, though, happening in such a high-profile place that is home to the country’s largest police department. And while the focus may be on what this means for how police officers interact with residents — and the way this affects some people much more than others – it also arrives as public opinion on marijuana is clearly trending in one particular direction .
Proponents of legalizing marijuana, fresh off a trio of victories last week, are hoping to get similar ballot measures ready in at least five other states. And a Pew Research Center poll earlier this year, which found that public support for legalizing marijuana had reached an all-time high, also found that even more people agreed that anyone convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana shouldn’t go to jail:
A year earlier, a broad majority told Pew that enforcing marijuana laws cost more than it was worth. Meanwhile, the share of arrests related to possessing marijuana has significantly increased in recent years . In 2012, for example, one of every eight arrests in New York was for possessing marijuana. In addition to being unpopular, this kind of policing is not cheap .
[This post has been updated now that the policy has officially been announced. The  New York Times  first reported that the possible shift was looming.]

The Low-Risk Way to Design Breakthrough Productsreddit
The fastest way to build something is to deconstruct it. Think about all those companies that produce complicated things on an insanely large scale: Toyota, McDonalds, Boeing. If you want to build enough cars to move the entire world or sell a trillion burgers or create an aircraft with millions of moving components, you need to first prototype the final product and then systematically divide it into its individual pieces. If you look at each part separately, you can develop a product faster and more flexibility. I call this process modular design and development: breaking down complex systems into parts that can be developed and tested independently.
This strategy works best on products or processes that are highly complex and contain identifiable subsystems. For example, think of the intricacies of a new surgical methodology or the construction of a eco-tech water filtration system. It also works best in situations of high volume or scope -- when you want to take your product or service to scale.
Modular design and development can help lead you to any of these desired outcomes:
Methodical development of products and services with reduced risk
Outlining of clear methods for designing quality
Adapting and customizing products or services to keep up with a changing marketplace
Reducing wasted effort by avoiding reactive behaviors
Modular design and development is not about radical innovation. It's about efficiency and reliability. It's excellent for those who desire incremental innovation, essentially building off existing sciences, technologies, or systems. Testing early and often is crucial to eliminating bugs on individual pieces before they are integrated. With this technique, you can experiment with numerous variations to find the optimal design with the lowest risk. Be methodical when you perform modular design and development:
First, clearly define the current specifications of the product.
Next, create concrete standards for development.
Then, estimate and assign time and resources.
Build prototypes, models, simulations, and proofs of concept.
Identify and communicate lessons learned from experimenting with these variations.
Finally, return to the first step and begin the next iteration of the product.
The goal is not to avoid failure but to accelerate the failure cycle with low risk of impact. Most early simulations and prototypes will inevitably fail. But these will move you closer and faster toward the product that will work.

As Bad As You Think It Is  It s Worse: Wage Theft Comes to Americareddit
In Denmark fast food workers make $20 an hour plus benefits, and the corporations who employ them are still profitable. Why there and not here?
The answer is simple and painful -- wage theft. In America corporations are systematically stealing our wages. Virtually everyone in the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution now suffers from wage theft... perhaps, including you!
It starts at the bottom of the income ladder. Many undocumented immigrant day labors survive by standing on street corners and selling their labor to drive-by construction and landscaping contractors. Unfortunately, far too many contractors refuse to pay after the work is done, something experienced by nearly every day-laborer.
What can undocumented workers do about it? For most, not much. If they report the theft, they run the risk of being reported to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Instead, most just go back to their corners hoping to find more scrupulous contractors. Or, if they are lucky enough to be affiliated with an immigrant worker center like the Workers Justice Project in Brooklyn, NY, they find jobs through its hiring hall where contractors agree to pay decent wages and provide safer working conditions.
Next come the fast-food workers who work overtime, but rarely see their time and half which they are entitled to by law. Franchise managers at McDonald, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy's and the like steal those hours by fiddling with the logs. You don't like it? Leave. But, if you're lucky enough to be part of the Fast Food Forward campaign, the threat of protest and legal action might force the employer to pay up. Try stealing OT in Denmark and the union would shut down the entire chain.
Move up the food chain a bit and you'll find the Amazon worker who must line up for 25 minutes to pass through "egress security" -- screeners to stop pilfering. Amazon says this is not "integral and indispensable" to the job, and therefore, it is lawful not to pay for the time. The Supreme Court will soon decide whether efforts to halt merchandize theft will become legalized wage theft.
Grand Larceny?
The research report, Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers, estimates the scale and scope of low-wage theft in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.  The authors write:
The average worker lost $51, out of average weekly earnings of $339. Assuming a full-time, full-year work schedule, we estimate that these workers lost an average of $2,634 annually due to workplace violations, out of total earnings of $17,616. That translates into wage theft of 15 percent of earnings.
The Economics Policy Institute (EPI) uses those numbers to provide a national estimate :
The total annual wage theft from front-line workers in low-wage industries in the three cities approached $3 billion. If these findings in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are generalizable to the rest of the U.S. low-wage workforce of 30 million, wage theft is costing workers more than $50 billion a year.
How much is $50 billion in wage theft? It's almost four times greater than the $13.6 billion reported by FBI for the total costs of all stolen cars, other larcenies, burglaries and robberies in 2012.  Fifty billion a year is enough to cover the wage bill for over 1.2 million jobs that pay $20 an hour.
Not me?
You may be thinking "Thank God, I'm not a low-wage worker. Nobody's stealing my pay."  Or are they?
The only difference between the rest of us  and a day-laborer is that our employers have developed ways to fleece us legally. And we're not talking about a few dollars here and there. Nearly half of our wages have been misappropriated. Enter Exhibit #1: The Productivity/Wage Gap.
This hidden larceny takes a little explaining. Productivity, a word near and dear to every manager's heart, measures how much we produce per hour of labor. For an entire economy, gauges our total level of knowledge, skill, technology and organization. It's also the key to the wealth of nations. The more goods and services produced per hour, the higher the standard of living. Of course this crude measure has trouble accounting for a sustainable environment or health or well-being. But usually,  those countries with the highest levels of productivity have the greatest ability to protect the public's health and the environment.
As the chart below shows that productivity in the U.S. economy (the top line) has risen steadily since WWII, climbing in 65 of the last 70 years. For generations, as productivity increased so did real wages (how much we earn after factoring out increases is the cost of living.) As we can see, from WWII until the mid-1970s, productivity and wages were virtually inseparable. As productivity increased, so did wages. In fact, when I was in graduate school in the early 1970s, they taught us that entwinement was an economic law -- the two lines had to rise together because when they separated, market forces would pull them back together. By about 1980, this iron law was repealed. Wages stalled while productivity continued to climb.
Let's be clear: When productivity rises, wages can increase without harming profits. For nearly a quarter of a century after WWII, about two-thirds of the productivity gains went to wages, while the rest went to profits, research and development, and the replacement of plant and equipment.  Now corporate elites are squeezing  revenues to reward themselves. Plant, equipment, research and workers must make do with less.
Since the late 1970s, the average real wage for most of us has stalled. Had we continued to get our fair share of productivity, our wages would be double our current pay. Think about how you'd be living with twice your current wages (like a Dane!).
What happened? Where did all that productivity money go? It all comes back to Wall Street. Financial interests were deregulated so that they could better manipulate the economy. (What they did and how they did it will be subjects of future articles in this series.) Laws and regulations were changed. Financial maneuvers that once would have landed financiers in jail, now land them in penthouses.
As the rules of the game changed, financiers began to siphon wealth away from corporations -- from our pockets to theirs. This chart shows how much the average top CEO makes for every one dollar earned by the average worker. Where did our productivity money go?  They took it.
Here's one more chart that tells the story. It compares financial incomes to non-financial incomes.  Until 1980 or so there was no premium for working on Wall Street. Now the average earnings are twice as high. That's your money.
But is it really theft?
Theft is defined as "the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny."
Even if it's legal, in my book, it's the very definition of "wrongful taking." Most of our economic ills stem from this productivity/wage theft. As economic elites siphoned away our wages, they turned the economy into a casino that crashed in 2008. The great American Dream that so mesmerized working people around the globe, is no more. And it will never return until we realize that our new financialized economy is now constructed upon "wrongful taking."

Stat of the day: 10% profit growth in Q3EMAIL
(Ints Vikmanis)
Not only is the stock market up double digits, third-quarter earnings for Corporate America are also up 10%.
With 90%, or 448 companies, of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index having reported third-quarter earnings, earnings per share growth is now estimated at 10% vs. the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Earnings growth for S&P 500 companies for the third-quarter of 2014 is now tracking at 10%, up from 6.4% on Oct. 1.
For the third quarter, nearly three out of four companies (74.6%) have topped Wall Street’s earnings forecasts, which is better than the 20-year average “beat” rate of 63%.
Corporate profitability has been bolstered by an improving economy and rising consumer confidence.
So how does a 10% growth rate stack up vs. history.
Well, while the double-digit gains are welcomed by Wall Street, it’s not even close to the top 10 quarters in the past 20 years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
(Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S)
But double-digit profit growth shouldn’t be downplayed, either. It is above the long-term average of 8.9% quarterly profit growth going back to 1968, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It is also inline with the 15-year average of 10.1%.

Sohrabuddin encounter case: Amit Shah exempted fromappearancePrint
Written by Meghna Yelluru | Mumbai | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:10 am
A special CBI court Monday exempted BJP party president Amit Shah from appearing in court till charges are framed against him in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh alleged fake encounter case. However, Shah would have to attend the hearing if the court directs him.
“I am of the view that instead of granting permanent exemption, attendance of accused number 16 (Amit Shah) stands dispensed with till framing of charges or as and when directed by court, whichever is earlier,” special judge B H Loya observed. Shah’s lawyer Mitesh Amin said the BJP leader’s discharge application will be heard and decided upon before the charges are framed.
Earlier, Amin sought permanent exemption for Shah on grounds that being the president of the ruling party, he would be occupied with party activities. Rubabuddin’s lawyer Vijay Hiremath had objected to the permanent exemption.
The court also exempted from appearance till the framing of charges to former Home Minister of Rajasthan, Gulabchand Katariya, one of the 38 accused in the case.
The court also allowed the plea of Sohrabuddin’s brother Rubabuddin, to provide an English translation of the charge sheet and all other documents. The CBI has been directed to submit a soft-copy or a hard-copy of the translation from Gujarati to English before or on the next date of hearing on November 21.

Kiran Choudhry is CLP leader in Haryana  Vikhe-Patil inMaharashtraKiran Choudhry (L); Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (R)
By: Express News Service | Mumbai/chandigarh | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:06 am
In a setback to former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Kiran Choudhry has been chosen to lead the Congress Legislature Party in Haryana where the party lost elections after being in power for 10 years. In Mahararshtra on the other hand where the Congress has been reduced to 42 seats in the Assembly polls, Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil has been appointed as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party.
Vikhe-Patil’s appointment comes shortly after a controversial statement made by his father and senior party leader Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil who suggested that the Congress should consider extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra to ensure stability.
However, state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre clarified, “The Congress has already staked claim for the opposition role in Assembly.
There is no question of Congress supporting the BJP government in Maharashtra.”
Vikhe-Patil had held the portfolio of agriculture in the Congress-NCP government. As Vikhe-Patil’s rivalry with Pawars is no secret, the Congress appears to have chosen him to ensure aggressive politics not only against BJP-Shiv Sena but also NCP in coming years.
In Haryana, where the party has been reduced to 15 seats, Kiran Choudhry has been chosen to lead the Congress Legislature Party (clp). Choudhry, the daughter-in-law of former CM Bansi Lal, is also known for her proximity to Sonia Gandhi. Her selection is being considered as yet another testimony to Hooda’s diminishing clout in the high command.
Despite heavy odds, Kiran was the only member of the Bansi Lal clan who won the election. While she was not inducted in the cabinet by Hooda during the second term of the government, she used her clout to make her way into the Cabinet and proved her influence.
Kiran, who has been confined to her constituency so far, has a tough task at hand with the Congress coming under attack from not only the treasury benches but also the main opposition INLD.

Mexico Says Gang Members Confess To Horrific Killings Of Missing StudentsMexico: Gang Members Confess To Mass Killing In Missing Students Probe

By Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Forty-three missing students  abducted by corrupt police in southwest Mexico six weeks ago  were apparently incinerated by drug gang henchmen and their  remains tipped in a garbage dump and a river, the government  said on Friday.
Attorney General Jesus Murillo said three detainees, caught  a week ago, admitted setting fire to a group of bodies in a dump  near Iguala in the state of Guerrero, where the trainee teachers  went missing on Sept. 26 after clashing with local police.
Then, the perpetrators set about removing all the evidence,  Murillo told a news conference, showing taped confessions of the  detained, photographs of where remains were found and video  re-enactments of how the bodies were moved.
"They didn't just burn the bodies with their clothes, they  also burned the clothes of those who participated," Murillo  said, adding the gang members spent over 12 hours torching the  remains. "They tried to erase every possible trace."
The government says police working with a local drug gang  abducted the students after the clashes. The kidnapping  triggered mass protests in much of the country and seriously  undermined President Enrique Pena Nieto's claims that Mexico has  become safer on his watch.
The disappearances have been the toughest challenge yet to  face Pena Nieto, who took office two years ago vowing to restore  order in Mexico, where about 100,000 people have died in  violence linked to organized crime since 2007.
A grim-faced Pena Nieto said the findings had "shocked and  offended" Mexico and pledged to round up everyone involved.
"The investigations will be carried out to the full, all  those responsible will be punished under the law," he said.
Dozens of police are among 74 people held in the case.
The scandal has forced Pena Nieto to cut short a planned  visit to China next week, and angry relatives of the missing  students said the government had only made the announcement to  clear the path for the president to go.
"Pena Nieto should think hard about his trip," said Felipe  de la Cruz, father of one of the missing students. "As long as  there is no proof, our children are alive."
The confessions of the gang members pointed to the murder  "of a large number of people," Murillo said, showing a video of  one suspect saying the victims had said they were students.
Identifying the remains, which were ground up after burning,  was so difficult that it was impossible to say when final  results would come in, Murillo said. But there was much evidence  "that could indicate it is (the students)," he added.
Teeth of victims found at the scene were so badly burned  that they virtually turned to dust upon contact, Murillo said,  adding that the remains would be sent to the University of  Innsbruck in Austria for final DNA identification.
The government would continue to view the students as  missing until their identities are confirmed, he added.
This week, Mexican police captured the former mayor of  Iguala and his wife, who the government suspects of being the  probable masterminds of the abductions.
Testimony from investigators suggested that the students,  from an all-male leftist college, had clashed with the mayor in  the past and that the city police had handed them over to local  gangsters who killed them.
The case has dented Pena Nieto's popularity and derailed his  efforts to turn public attention toward a string of reforms he  passed in the first part of his government, which he hopes will  spur stronger growth in Mexico's misfiring economy.

Astronauts Put A Camera Inside An Orb Of Water  And This Happenedreddit
Maybe you've seen videos of astronauts playing with floating blobs of water, but how about a video shot from inside the watery blob? That's just what we have here in a new video (above) posted on YouTube by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center .
In the video, shot last summer on ISS expedition #40 , NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman and Steve Swanson and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst gently finagle a GoPro camera inside a softball-sized water blob. The water assumes a roughly spherical shape because the surface tension keeps it from scattering around the space station in tiny droplets.
The astronauts also filmed their little water bubble experiment in three dimension as part of NASA’s experiment in 3D cinematography . If you have a pair of red-blue stereoscopic 3D glasses, you can have a look below.

After her counsel appeared before it and apologised
A special court on Monday issued non-bailable warrant against DMK MP Kanimozhi, facing trial in 2G spectrum case, for non-appearance only to cancel it in less than an hour after her counsel appeared before it and apologised.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini had issued the NBW against her for December 19, noting that neither she nor her counsel had appeared before the court.
“It is 11.30 a.m, neither any advocate for Kanimozhi is present nor any application for her exemption from personal appearance has been filed,” the judge said.
The matter was fixed for commencement of final arguments in the case and Kanimozhi failed to appear before it.
However, the court later cancelled the NBW while allowing the application of Kanimozhi’s counsel who appeared before it at 12.25 p.m.
“NBW is hereby cancelled. He (counsel for Kanimozhi) is advised to be careful in the future.”
The court fixed December 19 for hearing final arguments as the counsel for the CBI and the accused sought time to advance the arguments.
Besides A Raja and his erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, who were present in the court, other accused including former Telecom Secretary Sidharth Behura, Swan telecom promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka moved exemption plea through their lawyers which was allowed by the judge.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat state government today informed the state assembly that Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India would get an array of benefits, including refund of net tax paid by it for 15 years, for its manufacturing plant at Vithalapur village in Ahmedabad district.

On September 30, when the agreement was signed, it was announced by the Gujarat government that HMSI would invest Rs 1,100 crore to set up its plant at Vithalapur to churn out 1.02 million two-wheelers from this facility.

The day Doritos and Mountain Dew fans (well, maybe a few, at least) have long hoped for has finally arrived.
It may seem like an strange combination, but PepsiCo has confirmed a report — which first surfaced on Reddit — that it is experimenting with a new Mountain Dew flavor that incorporates the nacho cheese-flavored chip.
The result? Dewitos.
— OhioUSnap (@OhioUSnap) October 29, 2014
In a statement provided to USA TODAY Network and other news organizations, a Mountain Dew spokesperson said:  "We are always testing out new flavors of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us. We opened up the DEW flavor vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities."
No indications yet of when, or whether, Dewitos will actually be available in stores.
And how does it taste? Here's the verdict from the Reddit user (a Kent State freshman whose real name is Steve Barnes, according to The Atlantic) who broke the news: "It honestly wasn't that disgusting."

Why a stronger rupee doesnt always hit export-oriented coseconomy
(This is due to the fact that…)
ET Intelligence Group: Whenever the rupee starts strengthening against major currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the pound, it prompts equity traders to short sell stocks of export-driven companies. A general belief that triggers short-selling is that an appreciating home currency will adversely impact the country's exports growth, thereby hurting revenues and profits of export-oriented companies. This, in turn, would lead to a fall in their stock prices over a period.
Does this belief hold true in reality? A trend of India's export growth, plotted against the corresponding change in the average rupee-dollar rate over the past decade, does not offer convincing evidence of a consistently inverse relationship between exports growth and average annual currency fluctuations.
According to some economists, this is due to the fact that export growth depends more upon the global demand factors than on short-term currency fluctuations.
Currency fluctuations mask true export growth in the foreign currency. Thus, even if the dollar-denominated exports growth is low due to global slowdown, it would appear to be strong if the rupee depreciates against the dollar.
ETIG's analysis shows that since FY09, which is after the financial crisis in some of the western economies, there has been no meaningful relationship between India's annual export growth rate and the year-on-year change in the average rupee rate against the dollar.
"Export growth is largely driven by global demand. Between FY06 and FY09, global demand was firm and, hence, export growth was higher. It has, however, slowed since then, thereby impacting India's export growth," said Indranil Sengupta, India economist, DSP Merrill Lynch.
The analysis shows during the three years before the crisis between FY06 and FY09, the exchange rate seemed to share an inverse relationship with exports growth.
In FY07, exports growth accelerated to 27.9% from 25.4% in the prior year and the rupee depreciated by over 2% to an average of 45.3 against the dollar. The next fiscal, the rupee sharply appreciated to 40.2 against the dollar. Accordingly, the exports growth dampened to 8.2%.
In financial year 2009, the rupee plummeted to 45.9 and exports growth zoomed to 26.6%.
Beginning from FY10, however, exports growth was largely independent of the direction of the currency change. Dhananjay Sinha, head-research & strategist, Emkay Global Financial, says, "Currency change can be tracked to domestic economic gro- wth. A fast growing economy will attract more foreign capital , thereby strengthening the currency. Exports, on the other hand, would depend largely on the global demand scenario."
A weaker rupee will support growth in exports when dollar-denominated growth is lower. For instance, India's dollar-denominated exports grew at a CAGR of 8% between FY10 and FY14 to $470 billion, the period of slower global demand. But, since rupee fell sharply to 60.5 in FY14 from 47 in FY10, rupee-denominated growth in exports at Rs 28.4 lakh crore was higher at 21.5%.
Economists say looking at rupeedenominated export growth without considering dollar worth of exports will lead to wrong conclusions. This is because weaker rupee will tend to inflate export growth even though dollar-denominated growth stays low.

Wall Street continued to march further into record territory Monday as the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs again.
Investors have been pushing stocks higher on signs the U.S. economy continues to improve and as corporate earnings come in better-than-expected.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose for a fifth straight session and gained 39.81 points, or 0.2%, to close at an all-time high of 17,613.74. Earlier, the blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 17,621.87.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 6.34 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2038,25 after earlier setting an all-time intraday high of 2038.70. The S&P 500 was up for a fourth straight day. The Nasdaq composite index gained 19.08 points, or 0.4% to 4651.62.
With 90% of the S&P 500 companies reporting, 74.6% have posted earnings above Wall Street analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. That's better than the average 63% of companies beating estimates in a typical quarter.
As the third-quarter earnings season winds down, retail earnings will be in focus this week as Macy's, Walmart J.C. Penney and Nordstrom report later this week.

Russia's financial markets were in focus after the country's central bank scrapped its daily controls on the value of the ruble, allowing the battered currency to float freely in financial markets earlier than planned. The currency has come under sustained pressure in the face of Western sanctions over Ukraine and plummeting oil prices.
The ruble has lost nearly half its value against the dollar this year. The move appears to have eased the pressure on the ruble, which strengthened sharply on the news, trading up 2.3% at 45.6 rubles a dollar in late trading.
In Asia, where China was hosting the annual meeting of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advanced 0.8%to 23,774.70 and China's Shanghai composite index shot 2.3% higher to 2473.67. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.6% to 16,780.53.

Corporate earnings growing at weakest pace i...corporate earnings
(Corporate earnings are…)
MUMBAI/BANGALORE: Corporate earnings are growing at the weakest pace in nearly six years, in a more sober reflection of the economy than a stock market hovering near record highs since the May election of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.
The new premier, previously known for economy-stimulating infrastructure projects on a state level, has been widely touted as the man to revive an economy lumbering through the longest spell of below-5 per cent growth in a quarter of a century.
Such is investor sentiment surrounding Modi's premiership that main share index has risen by a third this year, touching a lifetime high on Wednesday.
But weakening corporate earnings growth highlight the continued need of Asia's third-largest economy for increased investment, lower interest rates and a slower rate of inflation, company executives said.
"We did assume at the beginning of the year that domestic conditions would improve post elections," said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of conglomerate Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
"It has, sentiment has improved, but the ground reality is still to change. I do think it will take a good six months for it (to) completely kick in. Hence, I want to be circumspect."
The median net profit growth of 102 Indian companies which have reported July-September earnings was 7.7 per cent, the lowest since October-December 2008, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data on companies tracked by at least one brokerage.
Median revenue growth at those companies - including cement maker ACC Ltd, financial services provider IDFC Ltd and mobile phone network operator Bharti Airtel Ltd - was 10.5 per cent, the lowest in nearly five years.
Revenue growth is likely to slow even more in October-December to 10 per cent, but will pick up to 12.5 per cent in January-March in line with a general expectation for quicker economic growth and a reduction in central bank interest rates.
  Even so, the country's biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, last month said its auto sales growth would slow in the second half of the fiscal year ending March 31, cooling hope of an industry rebound after two years of declining sales.
"The situation of course is not as bright as many people hoped it would be at this point. We do not expect the growth in sales of Maruti will be as high a per centage (as) in the first half and this will slow down," said its chairman, R C Bhargava.
The downbeat outlook puts pressure on Modi to deliver on election promises to take "decisive action" to facilitate investment in power generation, roads and rail, to stimulate economic growth.
"We need some fundamental changes on the ground," said the CFO of a large conglomerate who declined to be identified when expressing views on the government. "Up to now, there are many statements of intent, but there is no real investment."

WASHINGTON (AP) — McDonald's (MCD) is recalling a Hello Kitty-themed whistle given to children in Happy Meals, citing a chance they could choke on some of its parts.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that two children have reportedly coughed out pieces of the whistle that they had sucked into their mouths, including one child who received medical attention.
The safety agency said that parts of the three-inch tall "Hello Kitty Birthday Lollipop" whistle can detach and be inhaled, posing a risk to small children.
McDonald's handed out about 2.3 million of these whistles in the U.S. and 200,000 in Canada from October through November in Happy Meals and Mighty Kids Meals.
Consumers should return the whistle to any McDonald's for a free replacement toy.

Tech leaders here want to change that. And events like the Tech Challenge are a big part of the effort, ITA President Fred Hoch said.

Lavasa Corporation gets Sebi nod to raise Rs 750 crore via IPO
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 09.16PM IST
(The company, which is developing…)
NEW DELHI: Lavasa Corporation, the realty arm of construction major HCC, has received market regulator Sebi's approval for raising Rs 750 crore through an initial public offer (IPO).
The company had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in July this year for the proposed public offer.
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Prior to that, Sebi had sought clarification on two instances from Lavasa's lead manager, Axis Capital Ltd, regarding the company's proposed IPO.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares in 'Lavasa' near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money though IPO.
This is the company's second effort to hit the capital market. In November 2010, Lavasa had got the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan.
As per initial papers, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

The big bull mkt  is in pharma sector: ExpertsThe big ‘bull’ market is in pharma sector, say experts; top bets

Aurobindo Pharma
(The S&P BSE Healthcare index…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Healthcare index has rallied nearly 50 per cent so far in the year 2014, compared to a 30 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex.
The rally in the pharma sector was led by gains in Dr Reddy's, Lupin, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy Laboratories, which have rallied 30 per cent to 60 per cent so far in the tear 2014. However, Aurobindo Pharma has more than doubled investors' wealth in the same period.
Pharma stocks over the last one quarter have given extraordinary returns. And, there is a possibility that these stocks can correct and consolidate from these levels. However, that does not mean that it's time to cash out as the big bull market is here in pharma stocks, say experts.
"My view is that the biggest bull run in India is in pharma. We have seen nothing till now. It is a global bull run. Look at how global biotechnology stocks are moving," says Sandeep Tandon, MD & CEO, Quant Broking Pvt Ltd.
"There are possibilities that in the next quarter, pharma stocks can consolidate. The significant outperformance, which we have seen, may not happen up to that extent, but pharma still remains overweight for us," he adds.
It is demand which is taking the prices to the next level, explain analysts. They are extraordinary bullish on US economy and anything related to the US market has performed very well and pharmaceutical also fits very well in that space.
Commenting on the valuations, Tandon is of the view that they are not that expensive because if we look at 20-30% growth, the momentum can continue from these levels also.
Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, also shares the same view. "Most of the companies are already adequately priced in the pharma sector, but investors should look at adding positions on corrections," he says.
"I would like to buy pharma stocks in the portfolio only during the correction. So, would stay put on adding further at this point of time on pharma. Though I continue to hold many of the good quality stocks, but to buy afresh will wait for a correction in the market," explains Choksey.
Valuations are clearly very rich for pharma companies, but they are not overly expensive and investors with long-term horizon can look at buying into these stocks on declines.
"One has to question after the spectacular run up over the last one-and-a-half, two years whether this performance will continue in the next calendar year as well," says Harendra Kumar, Managing Director-Institutional Equities, Elara Capital.
"My guess is that given the spate of news flows, pharmaceutical stocks are likely to consolidate or see a correction at least for a quarter or six months from here on," he adds.
We have collated views and recommendations on various pharma sectors from different brokerage firms:
Aurobindo Pharma Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1308
The management has given a clear roadmap of its growth in formulation sales, which implies 15-20 per cent CAGR in FY15E-18E, Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report.
With more than 10 per cent CAGR in ARVs and EU sales (post Actavis), the company's roadmap for growth has limited challenging scenario. The stock trades at 19x and 16x of FY15E and FY16E with great potential to expand valuation multiple along with elevated fundamental parameters.
 
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd: Target price set at Rs 3300
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Q2FY15 PAT at Rs 5.7bn on lower taxes and forex gains of Rs 243 mn. But sales at Rs 35.9 billion fell 3 per cent short of RCMLe (Religare Research) on weaker US sales (over 8%) with only one new launch in Q2.
Religare Institutional research rolled over to a Dec'15 target price of Rs 3,300 (from a Sep'15 TP of Rs 3,150). They also like Dr Reddy's for its improving return ratios, a strong B/S (0.1x D/E) and discounted valuations (vs. large peers). They maintain a 'BUY' rating on the stock.
A slower pace of new ANDA approvals hurt US sales (down 13% QoQ) as existing products faced pricing pressure (prices down 7%). Domestic growth (14%) continued to outstrip industry growth while Russia/RoW growth was hit by fx movements.
Glaxo SmithKline Pharmaceuticals: Angel Broking maintains 'neutral' rating
The pharma major announced its numbers for the quarter ended September 30, which are below our expectations on the OPM and net profit front. On the other hand, the revenue for the quarter came in in line with our expectations.
Glaxo posted a revenue of Rs 655 crore, up 2.8 per cent YoY. The EBITDA margin came in at 16.7 per cent, dipping by 116bp YoY. Thus, the PAT came in at Rs 98.2 crore, a dip of 3.4 per cent YoY. The brokerage firm maintains their Neutral rating on the stock.
Ipca Laboratories Ltd: Downgraded to 'underperform'
Credit Suisse has downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral' and lowered its target price. According to the brokerage, adverse FDA action is likely at the company's Ratlam API and Indore SEZ plant. The 483 observations are critical and may delay the US sales recovery, it said.
Credit Suisse is of the view that there are 6 observations on Indore SEZ in Form 483, out of which 2 are critical observations.
The brokerage has lowered its target price to Rs 600 from Rs 740 post critical 483 observations
Lupin Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1515
Lupin's Q2 PAT at Rs 630 crore came on a lower tax rate (23% vs. 30% est.) and forex gains of Rs 17 crore. But sales at Rs 3110 crore disappointed as key US launches faced competitive headwinds, pushing down US sales QoQ.
Religare Institutional Reserach expects a pick-up in US launches/stable EBITDA margins (26-28%) to drive a 21 per cent EPS CAGR over FY14-FY17E. They have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a Dec'15 target price of Rs 1,515 (Sep'15 TP of Rs 1,365 earlier).

Porsche to sell out of priciest-ever model by December
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 10.56PM IST
(Profits from Porsche are…)
BERLIN: Germany's Porsche expects to sell out of its most expensive model ever by early December, bolstering earnings as the sports car maker grapples with rising capacity and technology costs.
Profits from Porsche are a key part of owner Volkswagen's drive to fund its global expansion plans and overtake sales at Japanese rival Toyota.
Operating profit at Porsche fell 12 percent in the third quarter to 529 million euros ($658 million) due to the cost of expanding its German plants in Leipzig and Zuffenhausen, as well as spending on fuel-efficient technology.
"We are close to the finish line" in selling all 918 of the 918 Spyder Hybrid model which starts at 768,026 euros, Porsche sales chief Bernhard Maier told Reuters on Monday, citing strong demand from North America.
Only a small double-digit number of the plug-in hybrid model, the price of which can rise up to 947,716 euros in Germany on optional equipment, was still available, Maier said in an interview.
Production of the 918 Spyder, unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt auto show, has been limited to 918 cars to underscore the exclusivity of the vehicle and the brand.
Porsche has forecast it will lift overall sales to more than 200,000 next year from 162,000 in 2013, benefiting from the new Macan compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) released last April.
With its growing push into SUVs, Porsche is hard pressed to lower carbon dioxide emissions across its fleet and is raising spending on hybrid models which combine a combustion engine and electric motor.
The new plug-in hybrid version of the top-selling Cayenne SUV, rolled out last month at the Paris auto show, may over time account for about 10 percent of the model's overall sales, the same as the Panamera plug-in hybrid coupe, Maier said.
"Interest (in hybridisation) is growing steadily," the executive said, indicating that the next generation of Porsche's iconic 911 sports car may also be offered as a plug-in hybrid.
Separately, Porsche said on Monday that October deliveries jumped 18 percent to 15,820 vehicles, lifting 10-month sales by 14 percent to 151,462 cars.

Chinese Cyber Monday  creates real richesEMAIL
AP
Internet investors know about Cyber Monday — the biggest day for online shopping in the U.S. But they’re quickly learning about the Chinese version — which is even bigger.
Shares of Alibaba (BABA) and several other leading Chinese e-commerce companies are rising amid “Singles Monday,” a day that shopper relish not being hitched and buy discounted items to celebrate.
Alibaba is one of the biggest proponents of the day, which some suggest is even busier than the U.S.’s Cyber Monday. Shares of Alibaba are up 1.5% to $116.26.
But other Chinese e-commerce companies are being lifted, too, including JD.com (JD) , up 7% to $26.48, Vipshop (VIPS) , up 3.9% to $24.24 and Jumei (JMEI) up 3.5% to $25.10.
The big jumps in shares of these companies are a big reminder to investors that being successful in today’s global economy requires the understanding of traditions and commercial events of that are important oceans away.

Why are NASAs new space station videos in 3-DBy Rachel Feltman November 10 Follow @rachelfeltman
Astronauts placed a sealed camera inside a floating ball of water and recorded the activity with a 3-D camera while onboard the International Space Station. (NASA)
Last week, NASA released two videos in 3-D -- A tour of the International Space Station and the goofy clip above, where astronauts build up a water bubble and float a camera inside of it. We've embedded the 2-D version of the video under the assumption that most readers won't have red-blue glasses at the ready, but no judgement if you've got a pair -- you can find the 3-D clips here .
First question: Why do we have 3-D YouTube videos of the International Space Station crew?
As it turns out, that's just the best way to take video in space. Radiation levels are higher up there in orbit than they are on Earth, and the tiny radiation particles that get through the hull of the station can damage camera sensors. Even when HD cameras were replaced frequently (at least once a year) images that came back were speckled with white pixels because of the damaged sensors.
But when 3-D cameras were brought on board, the images they produced had virtually no burned-out pixels -- and they last longer, too.
That's because the cameras double up regular images to create an illusion of depth. Because two images are overlaid, fewer pixels get lost. The 3-D camera also used a different kind of sensor, and researchers believe it may be less vulnerable to radiation damage.
Second question: What's up with that ethereal water bubble?
Water bubbles make regular appearances in photos and videos from the ISS , probably because they look so cool. I mean really, what's weirder than an astronaut rolling balls of soapy water around to wash their hands?
These bubbles form because water has really strong surface tension -- the molecules are super attracted to each other, and don't want to break apart. On Earth, gravity breaks that tension. But when water is in free fall (as it is on the space station) the membranes formed by water molecules can last for ages . As long as astronauts don't break these spheres apart by hand, they can keep adding water droplets to let them grow.
If NASA keeps putting out 3-D videos, we might have to go looking for some of those glasses.

Madhu Koda files nomination to contest fromMajhgaonPrint
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:16 am
In an indication of his growing confidence in the face of weakened cases against him, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda on Monday filed nomination papers to contest from Majhgaon, which votes on December 2.
Koda, who represented Singhbhum in the last Lok Sabha, had decided not to contest the general election and chose to field Jagannathpur MLA and wife Geeta Koda instead. She came a creditable second to BJP’s Laxman Gilua. Koda said his Jai Bharat Samanta Party will contest at least 17 seats this time. “We will contest five seats in the Palamu and 12 in Kolhan…. We had contested eight seats last time,” he said.
The former CM appeared confident as corruption cases against him look weak. Of the five cases initially registered against him, only three are effectively pending now.
The CBI had in November last year registered a closure report in the case alleging a representative of Koda received Rs 11.4 crore as kickbacks for a Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme tender. Earlier in March, the Jharkhand High Court had quashed a Vigilance case against him.
Koda, the first Independent legislator to become CM, is on bail in all the cases.

Will not destabilise govt  but play role of opposition: SharadPawarSharad Pawar arrives for an NCP meeting after the results were declared. (Source: Express photo)
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:14 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 8:33 am
Ahead of the trust vote in Maharashtra, NCP president Sharad Pawar Monday once again declared his party’s issue-based support for the minority government of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis even as he slammed the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray for displaying political myopia, and lacking in maturity needed in a democratic set-up.
The NCP’s criticism, on the other hand, appears to have served only to increase the uncertainty in the Shiv Sena. The NCP has been showing willingness to offer “inside or outside” support to the BJP, as the situation may warrant. The vote of confidence is on November 12.
With Pawar declaring unconditional support to BJP, which is short of majority in the state, new permutations and combinations have emerged. Pawar’s attack on Thackeray’s leadership served to goad the Sena to reopen talks with the BJP, in an apparent bid to corner the NCP.
Pawar, meanwhile, appears to have maintained the relevance of his party despite being relegated to the fourth place having won only 41 of the 288 seats in the Assembly.
On the other hand, Fadnavis appeared “confident” about his government winning the trust vote even as the BJP central and state leaders have not commented on NCP’s offer. In a candid admission, Pawar said, “I must declare that nobody from the BJP sought my party’s support for the Maharashtra government. The decision to support was to ensure political stability.”
NCP made it obvious it will not go against BJP during the trust vote. It is believed that the party may either abstain, or even consider voting in BJP’s favour, if Shiv Sena refuses support.
Stressing that the party’s support is unconditional, Pawar said, “Our support would be issue based. And we will continue to play the role of opposition in the state Assembly.”
“In a democratic system or legislature, individuals have to exercise their vote on issues on the floor of the House. It is not a question of giving or taking anybody’s support,” Pawar said attacking Thackeray for questioning the BJP over NCP’s offer.

45-year-old woman stripped  paraded on donkey in tribal village on charges ofmurderPrint
By: Express News Service | Jaipur | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:00 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:27 am
A 45-year-old woman was forcibly tonsured, stripped and paraded on a donkey across a tribal village in Rajsamand district on Saturday. Thirty villagers involved in the act have been arrested out of them 26 have been sent to judicial custody and the rest to police custody.
On November 2, one Vardi Singh from Thuravad village in Rajsamand district died under mysterious circumstances. His family cremated him soon after without a post-mortem but three days later a meeting of the village elders cast suspicions on the 45-year-old woman, who is a relative of the deceased. The villagers also filed a police complaint against the woman but did not wait for justice to be delivered. Instead they dragged the woman out of her house, blackened her face with charcoal, tonsured her head, stripped and paraded her on a donkey across the village.
The victim’s husband reported the matter to the police who swung into action and arrested 30 villagers including nine relatives of the victim. “The incident is shocking and we have not let anyone go scot free. All 30 villagers including a woman who were found guilty of being involved in the act have been sent to either judicial or police custody,” Sweta Dhankar, superintendent of police, Rajsamand told the Indian Express. “The victim was initially sent to a shelter home and counselled. She was in trauma and not in a state to narrate the incident. However after counselling her we have been able to record her statement. She is now at her parents’ place and we have provided her full security.”
“The victim was initially sent to a shelter home and counselled. She was in trauma and not in a state to narrate the incident. However after counselling her we have been able to record her statement. She is now at her parents’ place and we have provided her full security.”
Dhankar said that the cause of Vardi Singh’s death could not be ascertained as he was cremated without a post mortem. However circumstantial evidence points to a suicidal death. “The villagers cannot take the law in their hands like this. If they had any suspicion against the victim they should have approached the police for a fair investigation and not passed their own judgment. The matter is still being probed,” Dhankar said.
Tension continued to prevail in the village and heavy police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident.

The Choice Is Yours: 4 Guiding Principles To A Fulfilling Career In STEMreddit
In the early 1990s, when I was a few years into my career at AT&T, the company launched a series of commercials with the theme "You Will." The commercials showed concepts that seemed almost unthinkable at the time -- a look at what possibilities the future might hold -- while the narrator asked questions like, "Have you ever borrowed a book from thousands of miles away? ... You will."
Now, many of those things that seemed so amazing, like eBooks, GPS and video conferencing, are so common that most of us don't even think twice about them. That's why I love working in technology . It literally changes the world. What's not to love?
My story begins with math. In high school, I was a "mathlete," competing in team competitions around Georgia. One day, my math teacher pulled me aside and told me that the school was going to offer its first computer programming class and wanted me to take it. Keep in mind this was around 1980, when both computers and programming were pretty rare, especially at school.
I got pretty good at programming, but I still wasn't sure it was what I wanted to do as a career. When it came time to enroll at the University of Georgia, I went into the business school and found the perfect match: a Management Information Systems (MIS) major that combined my interest in computers and technology with business. I was hooked!
To choose a career in science, technology, engineering or math doesn't mean you have to have your head buried doing something like solving equations all day. Throughout my career I've done many things, from programming and systems architecture, to developing cool mobile apps and building tools that make things like using your tablet to pay a bill, or online shopping, a breeze. It's been thrilling to see these huge changes happen in a relatively short time, and I can only imagine what lies ahead. But all along the way, there are some things that have remained the same for me. Specifically, I've relied on four guiding principles to help build a satisfying and fulfilling career:
1. Be Bold and Believe: Sure, it's possible to reach a goal by taking small, cautious steps. But often you need to take a leap. It's doesn't need to be reckless, but it does need to be fearless.
2. Be Passionate, Positive and Prominent: The best part about this approach is how contagious it is. Whether you're talking to your peers or team leaders, a clear passion for what you're doing and a positive approach helps instill that same attitude in others.
3. Be Worth More Than You Make: Your contribution shouldn't be measured only in dollars and cents. This goes beyond being excellent at what you do, to include how you interact with colleagues, your reliability and responsibility, and dedication. Do more than people expect and they'll take notice.
4. Be Balanced: As the mother to a pair of teenagers, this one can sometimes be a challenge for me. There are constant demands from both work and family. Instead of allowing yourself to be pulled in a million directions, focus your devotion on your true passion, goals, and the people and things which matter most in your life. You'll then find that the balance often comes easier than expected.

Red or White Tell People What You Are Serving Them  and Why"A bottle of red, a bottle of white,
It all depends upon your appetite... "
Billy Joel, New York
Not so long ago, you'd enter a white tablecloth restaurant in most cities of the U.S. for a fine dining experience and the wait staff, or even Maître D' would approach your table with the simple, direct question: "Would you like red or white wine with your meal?"
That was it. There was can you believe not even a wine list. This was not so very long ago across the United States of America. Simply put, our attitude and aptitude toward wine had not been sufficiently educated, exposed, expanded. There is, today, virtually no corner Bistro that could get away with that simple "Red, or White" question. We now know that some of us fervently prefer a Cab to a Merlot, a Sauvignon Blanc to a Chardonnay; a Shiraz to a Pinot Noir...and from this region over that one... How did we come to this?
A leading trade group of vintners, and restaurateurs and wait staff educated us, that's how. That and travel, and our willingness to explore and extend our palette brought a type of education that spreads with each tasting room sampling, and our collectively gaining a deeper appreciation of craft, of stewardship, of provenance in our choices. Thanks to such efforts, we are hungry to become more educated in our eating experiences. This hunger is true at all socioeconomic levels of our world. We are in an Information Age and we want to know. Why can we not, therefore, expect to achieve a greater sense of provenance, of connection to the sources of our fish? It is time.
This is the fourth in this particular series of blogs on how to take some essential steps toward more ecologically responsible seafood menus.  The steps, learned from observing and listening to chefs who are making a difference, are:
• Source well
• Portion well
• Price well to your customer base,
• And next step is...Tell your customers what you have chosen to serve to them, and why
This step is so powerful, yet so often misunderstood in the power of its simplicity.  After all, if as a chef-leader, restaurateur or manager you have done the work of raising the standard of food elements, and the challenging work of menu development; now it is for you to claim the value of your work.
This is how you can gain back the risk value of your better choices... you gain this balanced pricing opportunity through education: you tell your customers what you have decided to serve on your menu, and why.
This seems so simple, and yet it is so thoroughly counter to the commodity business norms that it seems out of reach much more than it needs be. Yet, we have examples of Food + Beverage sectors teaching how to create value, through educating our palettes and informing our forks.
When go out to eat, we also -- not always but often -- want to learn about our food. The what and the wherefore of our food is part of our hunger. We leave our homes with our tongues seeking new textures, wondrous scents, the mouthwatering explosions that is most possible with the discovery of foods that bring us closer to producers, to nature, to our deeper connection with and appreciation for foods that tell us that there is more to life than the powerful processed food substance corporations might want us to remember.
I've just come from the annual Slow Food extravaganza of diversity and regional treasures known as Terra Madre. In 2004, as I was starting CleanFish, I attended the very first Slow Food/ Slow Fish Conference in Genoa. That gathering served to validate, to stretch and to enliven my instincts toward the network of artisan producers that we promote today at CleanFish.  This sojourn to Italy was a 10th anniversary check-in. It served again, to validate, to stretch and to revitalize my sense of purpose and resolve for participating in and leading where we can in the Food Revolution that is most certainly taking place.
Returning to U.S., I am awakened again to the realities of how pressing the issues of Good, Clean and Fair food truly are across this nation. Last week I attended an Aspen Institute gathering of urgent entrepreneurs painting pictures of the Middle East in much more hopeful scenarios than I ever see on mainstream media. What else don't we know about the rest of the world? I also sat with a Community College President looking with his staff as with new eyes at their entire campus while asking how aligned they could imagine being possible in their next educational Master Plan with a rather new educational theme: food.
Suddenly a curriculum more directly aligned with what their students do and what they will live with in their future began to evolve. When I asked where the students eat daily I was told that practically 10,000 of them, eat on campus 1 to 2 times per day. Yet, food was as if a revelation for them to consider learning as a formal program to be integrated. Just that fact takes to new levels the kind of thinking and actions hoped for when the first shovels and rakes were hauled out to dig into the very first Edible Schoolyard.
At the end of the last Clinton Global Initiative, panels of young people from all over the world were asked what they had learned. On this young leaders panel was a princess from Oman. Looking all the part of a royal princess from an exotic part of the world, this young woman stated that she returning to rally her peer group of next gen leaders to formulate strategies around the essential goal of "making growing food sexy."
From my small business platform working throughout the world with artisan producers of wild and cultivated fisheries, I am beginning to see the reality of new solutions through new design. Investors too are just beginning to see the wisdom of integrated ecosystems that will bring us food and water in ways ConAgra and Monsanto probably don't imagine. They are just way too sexy. Or, if they can imagine them, they are too coated in sugar, ethanol or food-like substances to be welcomed as authentic by young people looking askance at the consequences of those industrial food-like products in the epidemic of "diabesity" amongst their peers.
These young people see an America made weaker by its current industrialized food systems, and that weakness is what they don't want for their future. Increasingly children in developing lands, as well as those in our local schools have learned to question how a soda machine can be easier to deliver to them than the supply of safe drinking water to their cities, towns and classrooms. What does such a thing mean?
Over and again, the disconnections that typify the industrial food systems bring us back to a desire that seems growing in this country to know where our food comes from. Like the wine lists required even in today's most casual settings, it is time to list on menus the sources and the practices of the fisheries we are eating from. We are learning that we are the ones who can best influence the changes we want. Moving to ecologically responsible menus means we understand it is better when we know more about what we want to order, and so reward with our patronage better choices. We are learning and we really need to speed up the pace of realizing that we vote with our forks as well as our ballots. Aligned with our concerns about climate, energy, water and land use are learning that we are in a race, a cultural race of choices. We must learn faster, so we can vote and eat with greater trust, tomorrow.

Suresh Kalmadi grilled in Ranchi National GamesscamKalmadi, who remained from 12.15 pm to around 2.30 pm at the Vigilance Bureau, said he answered whatever the officials asked.
By: Express News Service | Ranchi | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:00 am
Former Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Suresh Kalmadi on Monday joined the Vigilance inquiry into the 2011 National Games in Ranchi, with the principal investigator saying it was too early to rule him out as an accused.
Kalmadi was asked to be present after two arrested accused in the scam told interrogators that they were merely procuring equipment that was recommended by the IOA.
Kalmadi’s interrogation could mean the investigators are the doorstep of the Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee as well, as multiple vendors associated with the 2010 event were allegedly awarded questionable deals by the committee.
“I am merely a witness in the case, not an accused,” Kalmadi told journalists outside the Vigilance office in Ranchi after spending two hours answering a questionnaire.
“We will ask him to come back if needed. He will be made an accused if evidence turns up against him,” said Assistant Superintendent of Police Anand Joseph Tigga.
The first arrests into the 34th edition of the games were made on October 14 this year, with Vigilance officials arresting former Sports Department Director P C Mishra and Organising Committee Secretary S M Hashmi.

Supreme Court clears way for women as make-upartistsTill now, only men were allowed to wield the brush while women could be hairdressers.
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:48 am
Describing it as a “taboo” stemming from acute “gender bias,” the Supreme Court on Monday put an end to a 59-year-old tradition that bars women from becoming make-up artists in the Indian film industry.
Till now, only men were allowed to wield the brush while women could be hairdressers.
The Indian Express had first reported on November 4 about the court’s ultimatum to the trade union to delete this clause on their own or be ready for a judicial order. The trade union, however, refused to accept the SC suggestion and argued that this was to ensure that men are not deprived of work. While issuing the order for Bollywood on Monday the bench said that it would also apply to such unions in Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad that have film industries and all other regional federations that bar women from the job.
The court ordered deletion of relevant provisions from the Constitution of the Cine Costume Make-up Artists and Hair Dressers Association (CCMAA), considered the Bollywood’s official body of these professionals. The trade union had said women could become members and work in the Bollywood only as hair dressers, apart from insisting on a minimum five-year domicile in Maharashtra to become eligible for a membership card.
The bench junked both the clauses and directed the Maharashtra’s Registrar of trade union to ensure omission in 10 days. Holding that harassment of women is “unconscionable, unacceptable and untenable,” the bench also directed the police to ensure they are not harassed as they seek to procure their membership cards.
Slamming the restriction, the court said, “It is scuttling drive in an individual to achieve excellence in his or her field of work. Such a limitation is unacceptable. We have no hesitation in saying that it is a discrimination between men and women without any reasonable or rational criteria but solely on gender basis.”
The court was hearing a petition by Charu Khurana and other women make-up artists, who were rebuffed by the CCMAA when they applied for make-up artist cards. Khurana, who was present in the court on Monday, said she was relieved that her right to earn a living had been restored and that her decision to fight back the bias culminated into a positive direction for all the women in the Indian film industry.

(Pizza Hut will serve pizzas…)
Pizza Hut will serve pizzas with a twist in its biggest-ever menu makeover, apparently aimed at wooing 18- to 34-year-old diners, after two years of sagging sales.
The changes, to be unveiled in US outlets on Nov 19, will go up against customized pizzas with upscale toppings offered by Blaze Pizza , Pie Five , Live Basil and other "build your own" chains that aim to be the Chipotle Mexican Grill of pizza chains.
"Our newest changes are the most significant we've made in our history," said David Gibbs, who was named Pizza Hut global chief executive last week, in a statement.
The new menu includes sriracha, ginger and curry-flavored pizza crusts, with items such as "Hot and Twisted" and "Cock-A-Doodle Bacon," and "Skinny," 250-calorie per slice pies.
The 56-year-old chain will update its mobile ordering as well as its logo, delivery boxes and staff uniforms in the revamp. Sixty per cent of its roughly 13,400 units are in the United States.
"In today's market, you have to take risks," said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at restaurant consulting firm Technomic. Still, he added, "it is quite a bit of change in a short period of time."
The changes appear to take direct aim at so-called Millennial diners, aged 18 to 34, who according to NPD Group spent $95 billion on food service meals and snacks in the United States in the year ending June 2014.
Pizza Hut's challenge is to lure Millennials, who are used to customizing their meals at chains like Chipotle and Subway, without alienating the older diners who are its main customers, Tristano said.
Plano, Texas-based Pizza Hut, which competes with delivery chains such as Domino's Pizza and Papa John's International, will continue selling familiar pizzas such as the Meat Lover's, Stuffed Crust and Supreme.
Domino's menu revamp started about five years ago. It admitted that its pizza fared poorly in taste tests and invited diners to try its new and improved recipe. The strategy worked. Since then, the chain has added pasta and other dishes.
It will be at least six months before the verdict comes back on Pizza Hut's changes, Tristano said.
Chipotle is backing a chain called Pizzeria Locale.

Internet service cos told to block pornograp...Government asks internet service companies to block pornography sites, upgrade systems

(Prasad said porn is legal…)
BENGALURU | DELHI: Blocking Internet porn may be next to impossible. But the Indian government is going to try anyhow.
The plan is to begin by creating a list of pornography sites, especially those hosting child porn, and provide that to Internet service providers (ISPs) to block. And then, to ensure that largescale blocking does not slow Internet access, service providers will be asked to upgrade their infrastructure. The Internet and Mobile Association of India has been asked to curate the list.
At a meeting chaired by Telecom & IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and attended by top government officials in September, the "problem of porn" was discussed and the minister directed the departments of IT and telecom to work together to improve "blocking infrastructure" at the ISP level.
Prasad said although porn is legal in other countries, it needs to be viewed in the "context of Indian culture and moral obligation towards society".
The meeting of the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee was triggered by a recent directive from the Supreme Court , which asked the government to place the issue before the committee. The committee has convened just five times since it was formed in 2000. The apex court is hearing a petition filed by lawyer Kamlesh Vasvani , seeking to ban porn as it leads to "activities like rape, harassment, molestations of women". At the last hearing, held on August 29, the government said that filtering porn was not practical.
The department of telecom had said large-scale blocking of websites could slow the Internet down, unless services providers upgrade their infrastructure.
"The problem is that you are veering down a slippery ground if you try to do this, installing filters and all," said Prasanth Sugathan, counsel for the Software Freedom Law Centre. Such blocks have been ineffective in countries such as the UK. However, in China, where the ban on online pornography is strictly enforced, it is another story, as that country has people dedicated to monitoring content, he said.
An extreme step would be to follow what countries such as North Korea do. Internet is regulated heavily and domestic Internet users are served by a sole provider with limited access to the global Internet. "But the question is, should we be moving towards that or we should be respecting Internet freedom," said Sugathan.
Blocking porn will not be an easy task by any means. According to one estimate by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, there are more than 40 million porn websites around the world and most of them operate outside India where porn is legal. Moreover, there are many ways including the use of proxies to get around to blocked websites.
For instance, in 2009, the Indian government banned a website which hosted porn-toon portraying the sexual adventures of a housewife. Content from the site is still widely accessible.
The use of the "https" protocol, which encrypts data transmission, makes it tough to block pornography. At the meeting in September, the IT department suggested the government start with a list of child pornography sites that can be obtained from other countries where it is blocked strictly.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also wants the government to take steps to block Internet pornography.
"A solution may need to be worked out to prevent availability of pornography on the Internet considering the cultural sensitivities of the country," Arvind Gupta, head of BJP's information technology cell, conveyed to the committee, according to the minutes of the meeting reviewed by ET.
Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg pointed out at the meeting that the latency of Internet access would go up if a large number of websites are blocked. India already has the lowest average Internet speed among most countries. Garg said the ISP infrastructure needs to be upgraded to deal with large-scale website blocking.
The committee comprises the minister for information technology and top officials from the ministries of legal affairs, commerce, home affairs, defence, the Central Bureau of Investigation as well as representatives from non-government bodies such as Nasscom , Confederation of Indian Industry and Federation of the Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry.
Legally, viewing pornography in private is allowed in India although hosting and transmitting porn is punishable. Further, according to the Information Technology Act, browsing, downloading, creation and publication of child porn is illegal.
"Child pornography and pornography cannot be said in the same breath. The government has very firm legislation against it," said Vidya Reddy, director of Tulir-Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse.
The government also suggested that NGOs will have to play a big role in creating awareness and sensitising the ill-effects of porn.

Is a vote against a political party also a vote against the network that supports it?
The Democrats' sinking fortunes have been pretty accurately charted in the declining ratings at MSNBC, the party's house network, which culminated, on election night, in a 22% fall from the last midterm election in the all-important 25-to-54 age group.
MSNBC's problem is almost exactly the same as the Democrats' problem: It built its future around a vivid and dramatic hero who, unfortunately, turned out to be both opaque and conflict averse. MSNBC now has a lineup of ever-righteous and often sulky defenders of President Barack Obama, who seem, not just to conservatives but to many liberals, too, bizarrely tone deaf and lost in time.
This is just the sort of bad zeitgeist bet that can so often happen in television programming.
The network, seeking to imitate Fox's success in building a loyal audience of politically motivated viewers, first managed to boost its low ratings by aligning itself with the  widespread anti-Bush feeling. Then, thinking it had hit something of a jackpot with the Obama election, it became the voice of Obama's anticipated remaking of the nation.
But at Fox, Roger Ailes, the chief, has deep roots in conservative thinking. Fox's alignment against all things liberal, which first began in President Bill Clinton's Lewinsky years, has had a remarkably successful run because of Ailes' fine antennae as to the subtle changes in conservative aspirations and temperament.
At MSNBC, it was more an outsider's calculated strategy, even a cynical one, to build an Obama-centric network. Not that different, say, from some Manhattan old guys doing a show about Brooklyn girls. Or suits in New York thinking duck hunters might be cool. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And, indeed, it seemed like a reasonable bet that Obama would be good television.
MSNBC's president, Phil Griffin, is not a political person. He's a TV pro. (Ailes, at Fox, has the virtue of being both a gifted political operative as well as an experienced programmer.) Griffin is a pro who has likely survived less because of innovative, golden-gut programming instincts than because of just plain old survival instincts. At MSNBC, he played the cable-niche hand he was dealt.
The network, a hopeless laggard, finally started to break out of the cable news depths when its anchorman, Keith Olbermann, began to rant against President George W. Bush and against Fox. Olbermann quickly became MSNBC's star and big kahuna, and was behind the hiring of liberal radio commentator Rachel Maddow, who became a second anti-Bush, pro-democratic programming pillar. Olbermann, however, famously difficult, was ousted by his NBC bosses. That left Griffin to pursue, with quite some hyperbole and inadvertent self-caricature — including Alec Baldwin's brief moment and Ronan Farrow's agonizingly longer one — a programming strategy to support the Democrats and adulate Obama.
Arguably, this strategy was bucking another development, both linked to Obama but larger than him, too: an erosion of political interest, and shrinking of the dedicated core. Beyond the Republican victory last week, the more indicative trend, crucial to both parties as well as to the news media, was the perilous drop for all networks in election night viewership, with all experiencing a dramatic fall-off from the 2010 midterms. Gridlock is not much of a story, after all. And social issues, which had fueled a decade or more of political scares, seem increasingly neutralized and no longer such cliff-hangers in the narrative.
This erosion suggests that the new core will be ever-smaller than the previous core, meaning the networks will need even more vividness and heroism and home team razzmatazz to focus the niche, just at a moment when political drama and pride, especially for the Democrats, are in vastly short supply. Or, alternatively and precariously, they will have to enlarge the niche —  "We've got to get outside Washington and open up our aperture a little," Griffin told The New York Times — quite a dangerous, even existential, play in cable television, where the niche is the brand. And yet where is there to go?
In the past, when the Republican's have lost, Fox has doubled down on outrage and fervor. This seems harder to do in the stub years of the Obama term. It's not just an Obama problem, but a Hillary problem, too.
In character terms, the problem is making Obama sympathetic and compelling when he appears not to want to be either of those things. In dramatic terms, the problem is that he seems inclined to shrink in the face conflict rather than rise to it. Who really is eager to watch the Obama show?
Then, in a major setback for MSNBC, the upcoming presidential election, ordinarily a reliable narrative of shifting alliance and oddball characters and, ideally, uncertain outcome, is frozen in place by Hillary Clinton. There is no story as far as the Democrats are concerned. There is nothing to unfold.
Who, but a dedicated masochist, will diligently watch that show? Clinton is a purposeful non-character. And what she stands for, largely some grand establishment return, is the opposite of the sense of insurgency that makes for political storytelling. Such storytelling is what Ailes has so successfully, and for so long, convinced Republicans was good for them. (Of course, good for him, as well.)
That is finally the point. Griffin is no Ailes. And MSNBC is not Fox, with its ability to direct as well as portray the political drama. A poor political operative, Griffin has painted himself into a corner like political parties so often do, losing the base, and yet without the philosophical wherewithal to appeal to a larger group. There is the broken clock theory of politics and cable programming, in which, if you just keep doing what you're doing, the zeitgeist returns to you. But politicians and media executives, swimming against the tide, usually lose their jobs before their hour returns.

BERLIN (AP) — Tensions between the major powers have pushed the world closer to a new Cold War, former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Saturday.
The 83-year-old accused the West, particularly the United States, of giving in to "triumphalism" after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc a quarter century ago. The result, he said, could partly be seen in the inability of global powers to prevent or resolve conflicts in Yugoslavia, the Middle East and most recently Ukraine.
"The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it's already begun," Gorbachev said at an event marking the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, close to the city's iconic Brandenburg Gate.
Gorbachev called for trust to be restored through dialogue with Moscow, and suggested the West should lift sanctions imposed against senior Russian officials over the country's support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Failure to achieve security in Europe would make the continent irrelevant in world affairs, he said.
Gorbachev's comments echoed those of Roland Dumas, France's foreign minister at the time the Berlin Wall fell.
"Without freedom between nations, without respect of one nation to another, and without strong and brave disarmament policy, everything could start over again tomorrow," Dumas said. "Even everything we used to know, and what we called the Cold War."
President Barack Obama appeared to share some of Gorbachev's concerns for Europe, though he blamed Moscow for the current tensions.
Paying tribute to the East Berliners who pushed past border guards to flood through the Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, Obama said in a statement Friday that "as Russia's actions against Ukraine remind us, we have more work to do to fully realize our shared vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace."

You Lose One-Out-of-Five for Being Too Aggressivereddit
…but you get the other four!
When I was in real estate there was this mega-successful mortgage broker named Mari Mahoney. She did more business than any ten “successful” mortgage agents combined.
I asked her how she did it. What was her key to success? She rapidly responded, “I lose one out of five for being too aggressive—but I get the other four!”
That statement changed my life.
Before then I was overly concerned about being too assertive or overbearing. If someone got mad or called the broker (my dad!) to complain that I was calling too early, too late, or showing up on their doorstep too often, I was horrified. After my lunch with Mari, being aggressive became my goal.
I was at my in-laws this past weekend. One of my brothers-in-law is currently looking for a job. I asked him how it was going and he responded, “I sent out 42 resumes, but no one has gotten back to me.” I asked him how many times he had called each employer and how many drop-ins he had made. I asked if he had sent any employer his favorite book. Had he sent a valuable article or press clipping on the organization or competitor? His response? “None, none, and no.”
I offered him some advice that you, too, might find valuable—whether in finding a job, recruiting top talent, capturing a dream client, or winning business away from a competitor.
1) Shock and Awe—Narrow your list to your highest-priority targets. Then unload every bit of arsenal you have. Call, fax, email, FedEx, telegram, show up, court the gatekeeper, bring lunch, send gifts (books, magazine articles, swag, etc.), and network their contacts (peers, underlings, superiors, vendors, attorney, CPAs, etc.).
Here is the magic: Don’t be afraid of being too aggressive. You might be for some, but who cares? You have a thousand times better shot at the others on your list. Get some people to call you, your boss, your association, your congressman, whatever, to complain that you are becoming a nuisance. You will then know you are on the road to victory.
I get solicitations every day from people who want to be featured in SUCCESS or want a job with the magazine. I either don’t respond or “brush off” the first attempt or two. Why? I want to know the character behind the solicitation. If someone persists, even if I am initially sure I am not interested, I will give an audience. If they are creative in their persistence, I am usually an easy sale.
2) Get Referred In—Cold calling is for weenies. Winners get referred in by other winners.
When I interviewed Bob Beaudine, author of The Power of Who and owner of the leading executive recruiting firm in sports and entertainment, he made this point abundantly clear: “In the last 30 years I have received over 80,000 resumes. Do you know how many jobs I have placed off a resume? Not one.” Beaudine will tell you that you already know everyone you need to know to get anywhere. You just have to ask, network through your relationships, and make new relationships.
If you don’t know anyone who knows your target contact directly, find someone who knows somebody one to two degrees away. Make a new friend and climb the rings on the daisy chain to your target.
If I am interviewing someone who was referred and endorsed by someone I have respect for, the interview is very different than the one who came from a Monster.com posting and a resume. The latter person really never had a chance.
3) Do the Unexpected—In my book The Compound Effect I tell the story of Alex, a friend of mine, who was up for a big job. He lived in California; the job was in Boston. He was one of twelve final candidates. The company was going to interview local candidates in person and conduct video conferences for those out of the area. Alex called me to ask if I knew how to facilitate a web videoconference.
“How badly do you want this job?” I asked him.
“It’s my dream job,” Alex replied. “It’s everything I’ve spent forty-five years preparing to do.”
“Then get on a plane and show up in person.”
“No need,” Alex said, “They’re flying in the final three for a last interview.”
“Listen,” I told him. “If you want to be in that final three, you should separate yourself by doing the unexpected. Fly across the country on a moment’s notice and show up in person. That’s how you make a statement.”
I also suggested Alex pull out all the stops—attack from every possible front and do it relentlessly: Research all the people in the organization. Take that list and run it by his entire network to see if anyone knew somebody in the organization. Search every name against his LinkedIn database. Find a few people to connect with. Talk with them and ask them to put in a good word for him. Send them gifts or notes and ask them to hand-deliver them to the decision-makers. Phone, e-mail, fax, text, tweet, connect through Facebook—do whatever necessary during the process.
I suggest you do the same.
Could this be overly aggressive? Heck, yes! But I have found that you may lose one out of five for being too aggressive, but you get the other four! And when it comes to capturing dream clients, you only need a few.
Now, no more namby-pamby, soft peddling around. Straighten your spine, get aggressive, and get after it!

Masked gang vandalise Nitta Gelatin office inKeralaPolice officials inspecting the office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL), which was attacked in a suspected Maoist attack in Kochi on Monday.(Source: PTI)

The corporate office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL) in Kochi, a prominent Indo-Japanese industrial venture, was attacked by an unidentified group on Monday.
NGIL’s unit in Thrissur district, which manufactures ossein, has been facing resistance over polluting a nearby river. A nine-member gang, wearing masks, stormed into the corporate office after threatening the security staff. Using iron rods, they demolished the computers and window panes.
Kochi city police commissioner K G James said a special team is probing into the attack. “We have recovered a letter, which has reference to Maoists. The letter has called for armed struggle and indicates that Maoists have taken claim for the attack. But, whether Maoists were actually involved in the attack could be ascertained only after the probe, said the commissioner.
He said some ultra elements along with local people near the NGIL factory were involved in the agitation. Hence, it has to be looked whether the local agitators were behind the attack and used the letter to divert the probe.
NGIL is a leading manufacturer of gelatin, ossein, di-calcium phosphate, collagen peptide and related products which have wide applications in pharmaceuticals. The NGIL’s unit in Thrissur was attacked last year in connection with the agitation against polluting river Chalakkudy.

Cops trace missing Hindu girl; stir by right wing outfitsavertedPrint

Police in Firozabad city managed to avert tension after a Hindu girl allegedly eloped with a Muslim youth and RSS wing Hindu Jagran Manch and BJP Yuva Morcha threatened massive stir if the girl was not recovered by Monday.
Additional SP, Firozabad, Rakesh Pandey Monday claimed that a police team, which had gone to Assam following a tip-off, had recovered the 19-year-old girl in Guwahati. He said they will bring her back to the city after completing the legal procedure.
The girl went missing from her home in Linepar police station area on November 6. Her father, a taxi driver, had registered a case against a Muslim youth living in the neighbourhood. Police, however, found the youth at his home. He failed to give any information on whereabouts of the girl.
Senior sub-inspector at Linepar police station Ashok Kumar Yadav said a police team led by the SHO was sent to Assam along with the girl’s father and the Muslim youth. He added that they have been informed that the girl has been recovered with another Muslim youth who hails from Firozabad. The girl and the youth were traced on the basis of tracking of their cellphones.
Soon after the girl went missing, BJP Yuva Morcha and Hindu Jagran Manch took up the issue. A day after the FIR was registered, the workers of the two organisations staged a dharna at the Linepar police station and threatened to launch a massive protest Tuesday if the girl was not recovered by Monday.
District President of Hindu Jagran Manch, Atul Yadav said they had “alerted the police that they will stage massive protest and all the schools would be closed”.
Firozabad district general secretary of BJP Yuva Morcha Nikunj Shukla meanwhile, said the girl’s mother and grandmother have not yet been informed of her recovery.

It’s been mostly no-go for in-flight Wi-Fi service provider GoGo this year, with lowered expectations and the threat of competition from AT&T. But after sinking 5% in early Monday trading following a lousy third-quarter earnings report, GOGO soared  11% to $18.40.
Behind the late liftoff:  reports that AT&T T decided against its own in-flight Wi-Fi service.  The telecommunications giant said it is no longer pursuing entry into in flight connectivity, according to aviation news website  runwaygirlnetwork.com
GoGo said quarterly earnings rose 22% to a record $104 million as the company partnered with Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada and Aero Mexico and expanded its partnership with United Airlines UAL . But losses widened to 29 cents a share from 22 cents in the year-ago quarter.
GoGo currently services over 2,000 commercial aircraft from 10 airlines, as well as 6,000 business planes. The Itasca, Ill.,-based company  went public in June 2013. Shares, priced at $17, climbed to $35.77 before losing altitude and bottoming at $11.66 in May.

The doctor who contracted Ebola in West Africa before returning to New York City has been declared free of the virus, hospital officials announced Monday. This news means that 41 days after the first Ebola diagnosis in the United States, there are no known cases of the virus in the country.
Craig Spencer, 33, who had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea, was diagnosed with Ebola on Oct. 23. Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City, where Spencer was being treated, confirmed in a statement Monday that he “has been declared free of the virus.” Spencer will be discharged on Tuesday, according to the hospital. [UPDATE: He was released Tuesday morning , an occasion marked with lots of hugs.]
Spencer’s diagnosis created concerns in New York, as the news of his illness was followed by the revelation that he visited a popular restaurant and coffee shop, rode multiple subway lines and went to a bowling alley and bar in Brooklyn. As city officials preached caution and calm, “disease detectives” fanned out to visit the places Spencer had gone and visit the people with whom he had interacted.
After returning to New York, Spencer had been self-monitoring and taking his temperature. He reported a fever of 100.3 degrees on Oct. 23, two days after he began feeling sluggish, and was taken to the hospital and isolated. He was the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the only one of this group to contract the disease after treating patients overseas. (Other people responding to the epidemic in West Africa have been diagnosed and brought back to the country for treatment.)
His diagnosis also sparked a panic among authorities, as the governors of New York and New Jersey hurriedly announced  that they would quarantine any medical workers returning from West Africa, a highly-criticized move that went against the advice of public-health officials. This drama spilled up the East Coast, as a nurse who had treated patients in West Africa (and had no symptoms of Ebola) was quarantined in New Jersey and had a prolonged confrontation with authorities in Maine over her treatment.
The first person diagnosed in this country , Thomas Duncan, was a Liberian man who contracted it before flying to Texas in September; two nurses who treated Duncan were infected during his hospitalization. Duncan died eight days after he was diagnosed, becoming the only person to die from Ebola in the United States, while the Texas nurses who contracted Ebola were  both treated and declared safe . The news that Spencer was cleared came three days after the last person being monitored for Ebola in Texas was also cleared , ending the Ebola saga there.
More than 350 people were being actively monitored by the New York City health department for Ebola as of last week, the department said in a statement. Most of these people had traveled to New York City from Liberia, Guinea or the Sierra Leone, but that number also included Bellevue staff members treating Spencer and lab workers who took his blood.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that people should be reassured by the fact that tried-and-true approaches, such as contact-tracing and active monitoring, have helped to prevent broader transmission of the disease in the United States.
“In fact, it has worked,” he said, noting that contacts of patients in Dallas have all been cleared and that people who interacted with Spencer so far appear healthy.
“That doesn’t mean we are not going to see another case; it’s possible we will,” he said. “[But] I think we are pretty well prepared.”

Winter car care  recalls and TPMS lights: Motormouth solves car problems0
--B.P., Tinley Park, Ill.
A: Take a copy of the NHTSA report and your repair bill to your Buick dealer. Ask them for consideration. You may get at least partial reimbursement. If it is denied, kick your complaint up the line to the regional GM rep and corporate via the customer hotline number in your owner's manual.
Q: The owner of the 2013 Accord in your Oct. 26 column provided precious little information about the TPMS light situation. Were the tires low by a few pounds or dramatically underinflated? Most TPMS lights come on when the tires are underinflated by five pounds or more. It is not uncommon for a non-leaking tire to lose a few pounds over a period of months. This is what the light is for! When the weather cools, like clockwork I see more people come into the tire shop where I work for air pressure checks due to the glowing light. You should tell your readers to invest in a tire gauge. While some vehicles have systems which alert the driver to which tire is overinflated, others do not. Some drivers just keep filling tires at random trying to turn the light off. I have seen vehicles come into the shop with drastically overinflated tires (60psi +) because the driver just kept filling until the gas station compressor maxed out.
--A.D., Chicago
A: We totally agree that everyone should have a tire gauge. It doesn't have to be fancy. A typical pencil gauge will do. We keep a gauge with each of our vehicles (including the motorcycle). But tire gauges are worthless unless they are used. Incidentally, you can buy inexpensive valve caps that visually indicate a drop in pressure. They may not be the most accurate devices, but they're better than nothing.
Q: I have a 2009 Scion TC, no problems but have just received a check in the mail for $29.86 from Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability and Litigation. I had heard nothing of this before I received this check, nothing about a recall. This says it is my part of a settlement. Any Info?
--P.M. Prospect Heights, Ill.
A: A class action lawsuit is usually brought by just a few people on behalf of any and all others affected by the issue. Since you are the owner of record for a car involved in the settlement, you got part of the payout. Isn't it amazing that a settlement for millions of dollars results in so little for the members of the class? In some cases, you only get a discount coupon good for a future purchase. At least you got real money with which you can by some chewing gum. The majority of the money goes to pay for lawyers and related costs.

Genetically Modified Potato From McDonald s Supplier Approved By USDAUSDA Approves GMO Potato Designed By Simplot
Posted:
BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved commercial planting of a potato that is genetically modified to resist bruising and to produce less of a chemical that has caused cancer in animals.
Boise, Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co. developed the potato, and it was approved by the USDA Friday.
Simplot is a major supplier of french fries, hash browns and other potato products for restaurant chains like McDonald's Corp.
The company altered the potato's DNA so it produces less acrylamide (ah-KRIL'-ah-myd), which is suspected to be a human carcinogen. Potatoes naturally produce the chemical when they're cooked at high temperatures.
The potato is also engineered to resist bruising, which can cause black spots in the potatoes, making them less desirable to buyers.
The USDA has approved genetically modified forms of many other crops, including corn and soybeans.

10 Easy Art Therapy Techniques To Help You De-Stressreddit
Art therapy is a form of therapy that encourages creativity and self-expression as vehicles to reduce stress , improve self-esteem, increase awareness and help remedy trauma. While many other forms of therapy depend on verbal language to express feelings and overcome personal obstacles, art therapy allows for other, more abstract forms of communication. This tactic makes room for elements of the subconscious that perhaps are not yet ready or able to be verbalized come to the surface.
You do not have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of art therapy. In fact, most of the exercises rely not on the final product you create but on the therapeutic, meditative ritual of the creative process. If you're intrigued by the process of relaxation through artistic imagination, we've compiled a starter kit to get you on your way.
The following 10 suggestions are simple ways to explore your inner creative voice while turning off the negative influences that so often get in the way. They may not all work for you, but hopefully one or more of the following techniques will serve as the artistic equivalent of a long, hot bath.
1. Design a postcard you don't intend to send
Whether it's a love note to someone you're not ready to confess your feelings to, or an angry rant you know is better left unsaid, sometimes enumerating all the details helps deflate the issue at hand. While writing the text can be therapeutic in its own right, designing the postcard gives even more value to the object. It also allows you to activate different portions of your brain while relaxing in a manner similar to coloring in a coloring book . Once you toss that signed and sealed letter in the trash (or tuck it away in a drawer), you'll find its message has lost some of its power.
2. Cut and paste a painting to create a collage
Create a painting on a material like paper or cardboard. When you're finished, cut or tear it up. Then use the pieces as building blocks for a new artwork -- a collage. See how your original artwork transforms into something new and exciting, something unpredictable. This exercise illuminates the close proximity between creation and destruction, encouraging us to take risks to push ourselves creatively and in other aspects of life.
3. Build an altar to a loved one
Take inspiration from folk art and create an altar honoring a unique relationship between you and another person, living or not. Decorate the shrine with photographs, letters and relics of memorable times spent together, as well as new art objects you've created in their honor. Anything can become artistic material, from gifts you've exchanged to a candy wrapper you know your subject would love. Building a totem to another person awakens memories and creates a physical manifestation of a relationship that can provide comfort in tough times.
4. Draw in total darkness
So much of the stress we experience when making art comes from the judgments and criticism that seem unavoidable every step of the way. Try creating artwork in total darkness to make art free from that inner art critic inside your head. (Think of it as a form of blind contour drawing.) You're suddenly freed up to create lines, shapes and patterns simply because you feel like you should. When you turn back on the lights, we suspect you'll be surprised by what you find.
5. Watercolor your bodily state
Lie down and close your eyes. Visualize your body as you breathe in and out. Try to imagine your breath as a particular color as it enters your body, another color as it exits. What do you see? Draw an outline of a body on a large sheet of paper, and inside, create a watercolor based on your bodily state. Think about what these colors mean to you, where they are densest, where they are most opaque. Think of this as the most relaxing self-portrait you'll ever create.
6. Create a Zentangle-inspired creation
Zentangle is a drawing method invented by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas, designed to make drawing meditative and accessible to all. To learn the official method you must be taught by a Zentangle Teacher, but you can recreate the basic idea on your own. Use a piece of paper, cut into a 3.5" square piece, and draw a freehand border around the edge in light pencil. Then use your pencil to draw a curved line or squiggle within the border, called a "string."
Now switch to a pen and begin drawing a "tangle," a series of patterns and shapes around your "string" and voila! You got yourself a Zentangle. The process is designed to encourage deliberate, ritual creation and allow room for human error -- no erasing, that's against the rules. Traditional Zentangles are always black and white but we fully support experimenting with color. The entire process shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, and can be repeated whenever you feel the urge. Keep some 3.5" squares handy so you can always create when inspiration strikes.
7. Produce a permission slip
Think of the societal and self-imposed pressures you feel on a day-to-day basis, the personal traits you see as faults, the natural slips you see as errors. Choose one of these things and give yourself, in ornamental detail, permission to do just that. Turning one simple defeat into an accomplishment can minimize feelings of self-hatred, allowing you to achieve more of your important goals. Remember, it's an art project, so make it pretty.
8. 'Write' a found poem
Don't consider yourself a poet? Let someone else do the hard part of coming up with the words by grabbing your material from old books, magazines, newspapers or even letters. Cut out words that jump out at or inspire you. Collage your found materials just as you would a visual collage. You can have a topic or story in mind at the beginning, or just get started and see where your word collaging takes you.
9. Craft a mark-making tool unique to you
Instead of spending the majority of your time on an actual painting, why not focus a little of that attention on crafting an alternative paintbrush all your own? You can make a mark-making tool out of nearly anything, whether it's a row of toothpicks (glued to a cardboard base) and dipped in paint, or a DIY paintbrush made from pom-poms and yarn. When you finally get around to actually making a piece with your new tool, you will have relinquished some of your artistic control to your distinct artistic medium, which, of course, is a work of art in itself.
10. Make a forgiveness box
If there is a certain person -- including yourself -- you don't want to harbor negative emotions toward any longer, try making him or her a forgiveness box. Decorate a small box with soothing images and words that can be either specific to an individual or catered to your desired inner state. You can write the person's name on a slip of paper and include it in the box if preferred, and the name can be removed and exchanged if needed. The act of making the box will bring up happy memories of whomever the box is for, as well as help you physically work toward a place of forgiveness.

Hindustan Motors declares VRS for all workers at Uttarpara unitUpdated: November 11, 2014 01:24 IST
HM trade unions frustrated over VRS
Indrani Dutta

The package offers each employee his balance salary dues (around Rs.45,000) plus encashment of earned and sick leave besides gratuity plus a Rs.1 lakh purse.
Trade unions associated with the Uttarpara unit of Hindustan Motors on Monday felt that the company should have talked to them before announcing the VRS scheme. The unit has been under work suspension since May 24.
However, a number of workers have already begun picking up application forms, which are available from the security office at the factory gates. There are 2,218 employees at its mother unit in Uttarpara here. The scheme is valid till November 20.
Experts felt that the move might eventually lead to phasing out of the iconic Ambassador cars. The company was making 150 cars against a breakeven of 1,500 vehicles.
The package offers each employee his balance salary dues (around Rs.45,000) plus encashment of earned and sick leave besides gratuity plus a Rs.1 lakh purse.
For a person with 34 years of service, this works out to around Rs.4 lakh. Workers were peeved that amount was not linked to the number of service years left. Hindustan Motors is now a BIFR-referred company with an accumulated loss of over Rs.500 crore.

Currently Not Promotablereddit
Jimmie was angry and hurt after his meeting with the EVP of the division he worked for. This was the third time he was passed over for a promotion and this time it went to a person much younger and less qualified (at least according to Jimmie). What the EVP told him, really stung, "Jimmie, you're currently not promotable."
In fairness to the company, Jimmie had been given consistent feedback that he was only half a leader. While his technical and operational skills were exceptional, they only made up half of the qualifications needed for the higher-level position that Jimmie was pursuing. At the close of the meeting, the EVP suggested speaking with June, who was the vice president of talent development.
At their first of several meetings June suggested...
Jimmie, your interpersonal skills, what the company refers as social intelligence, are lacking and holding you back from any further promotion. You have a reasonable sense of yourself. You just don't seem to be able to apply this in face-to-face situations, which causes us to question your potential as a leader within the company.
Essentially, we break social intelligence into five critical areas. These include your ability to
1. read your environment and act appropriately within that environment;
2. express empathy for those with whom you interact on a consistent basis;
3. demonstrate sensitivity to the motivations of the people you manage;
4. establish positive interactions with the people with whom you work on a regular basis;
5. communicate effectively with people whose "communication style" may be different from yours.
Let's look at number three, "demonstrating sensitivity to the motivations of the people you manage." We measure engagement within the company by asking all employees if the products and services and the way we operate the company contribute to fulfilling their sense of purpose or meaning in their life. While that's a big question, we can easily determine their level of engagement. Each employee aligns with one of three categories:
Engaged employees work with passion and feel a deep connection the values, beliefs and attitudes of our company.
Non-engaged employees are essentially "getting by." They minimally participate and there's little energy for what they do.
Actively-disengaged employees consciously sabotage the efforts of others.
Engagement is both collaborative and consensual. It's the leader's job to ensure that their direct reports are engaged. Unfortunately, your 360 feedback results indicate that others frequently see you as the "boss from hell" who is better at commanding than leading.
It's the company's job to provide each manager with resources and create recognition and reward programs. These are the functional aspects of creating engagement within the organization. Engagement starts to break down in the critical area where you have the most direct influence -- that is creating and enhancing the work community.
Your employees are desperate to feel like they belong within the organization. Jimmie, you're a smart guy whose technical and operational competencies are top notch. You are somehow using these competencies as a weapon to intimidate and belittle the people who report to you. You also haven't helped them to create the linkage between the mission of the company and what each person is looking to accomplish in her or his own life.
Usually this happens when a leader takes the time to just have a conversation with an employee. The feedback we receive about you is that you are always barking orders. Conversations need to be handled with sensitivity and genuine caring. You need to be fully present when engaged with an employee. Thinking about your next call or the text message you just received indicates that the person you're speaking with has lesser value.
As a leader within this company, you need to BE the example. Being requires authenticity and transparency of both your strengths and your opportunities for improvement. Our employees want to know that you're human, not superman.
Let's schedule another meeting where we can discuss some of the other five factors. OK?

What Republican control of Capitol Hill means to companies big and smallTaxes: Overhaul back in business
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) (Steve Helber/AP)
Tax reform has been lingering just out of reach since the start of Obama’s presidency, but it may have a real shot to reach his desk now that one party controls both chambers of Congress. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who are likely to head finance committees in each chamber, have said that crafting a workable, comprehensive tax proposal would be a top priority. At a recent campaign stop, Ryan said he expects to have legislation ready sometime next year.
It’s worth noting that a Republican-authored tax plan may sit better with smaller businesses than the alternatives pitched so far by the White House, as Ryan and others have insisted on an overhaul that includes lower individual rates and lower corporate rates (the Obama administration has pushed for corporate-only changes). Small-business groups have noted that most small companies are set up as pass-through entities, so their owners pay taxes as part of their individual taxes and would thus see no benefit from a law that merely lowers the corporate rate.

Immigration: Get ready for more debate
Top Republicans met with President Obama on Nov. 7 after warning him that changing U.S. immigration policy without involving Congress would invite “big trouble” and make a future compromise impossible. (Dennis Brack/Pool via Bloomberg)
Republican leaders have long said, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney reiterated last week, that the party would move immigration reform toward the top of its priority list if it took control of the Senate. And even with the president expected to circumvent lawmakers with executive action on some of the most immediate immigration-related challenges, it appears the GOP will start crafting its own broader package.
While the devil will be in the details, and though it remains unclear just how broad an overhaul Republicans are interested in pursuing, there will be many business leaders pleased to hear that the issue could be back on the table. Some seasonal and tourism companies, for example, have complained that they are having trouble finding low-skill labor to help them operate during peak season. Meanwhile, technology executives have urged lawmakers to address what they see as a shortage in highly skilled workers in fields such as science and engineering.

Health care: The battle continues
A man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website. (Mike Segar/Reuters)
While it has been the ultimate goal for some Republican lawmakers, the chances of a full repeal of President Obama’s signature health-care reform remains unlikely. Some political analysts have said they expect to see a repeal bill now finally reach president’s desk, but it would be swiftly vetoed by Obama. Republicans did not pick up enough seats to override a presidential veto.
However, that’s not to say that the outcomes last week will not have a significant impact on the law. Republicans are likely to start pushing through proposals that would chip away at the statute, and they have put a bull’s-eye on some of the most controversial provisions for small businesses — that is, rules requiring companies to provide health plans or pay a penalty, as well as language that define “full-time” worker status as at least 30 hours per week.
— J.H.
Trade: Prospects improve for agreements
Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D- Nev.) (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)
In many cases, Republican control on the Senate will put a clamp on the president’s agenda for his final two years, but there are a few exceptions. For example, his attempts to strike two massive trade deals — one across the Atlantic and another across the Pacific — have largely been thwarted by members of his own party, including now-outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.).
With Republicans at the helm, Obama may actually find it easier to close those deals. During a speech at the White House last week, he said trade talks would be one of the first items of business he discusses with Republicans on the Hill. If successful, the deals could be a boon for companies that bring in materials or goods from abroad, as well as those that are interested in selling to customers overseas.

Wages: Movement on minimums
Activists and workers, demanding an increase in minimum wage, march holding placards past a McDonald’s fast food restaurant in Manhattan, New York. (Adrees Latif/Reuters)
Perhaps counterintuitively, an effort to raise the federal minimum wage could get a boost under the new Republican-led Congress. On the campaign trail, a number of GOP candidates expressed support for a higher wage floor — an increasingly popular position among voters in both parties, as evidenced by the fact that all five states with minimum wage hikes on the ballot last week approved them. There’s some support for a higher federal limit as a way to bring some consistency to the hodgepodge of rates being set at the state and local level.
It’s an issue that has split business owners down the middle, as some have warned that forcing higher pay would hit their bottom lines and force them to cut back on hiring. Others believe that higher wages would put more money into the their customers’ pockets, resulting in more spending and higher sales.

Government contracting: Breathing a little easier?
Contractors are waiting to see how Congress decides to fund the government before the end of the year. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Now that Republicans are set to take control of the Senate, the outlook for government contractors, especially defense companies, appears the slightest bit sunnier.
Defense companies from Lockheed Martin to Raytheon to BAE Systems overwhelmingly donated money to Republican campaigns in this election cycle, so the GOP’s victory is certainly not unwelcome.
“Defense contractors almost never take sides in elections, but they know that Republicans are generally more likely to favor their programs than Democrats,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst and consultant to Lockheed Martin.
Regardless of who is in control, federal spending on defense is likely to increase, analysts say, because there is no shortage of global conflict at the moment.
Both parties are in agreement that the Pentagon needs additional support to address geopolitical threats such as the Islamic State and the Ebola crisis, said Ryan Crotty, fellow and deputy director in the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.
“The question is, what pays for it?” Crotty said. “There’s a political mandate that any additional spending you want to do has to be paid for by spending less from somewhere else.”
In the short term, contractors are waiting to see how Congress decides to fund the government before the end of the year. The government’s continuing resolution expires on Dec. 11. A lame-duck Congress has to decide whether to extend that resolution and maintain current funding levels or appropriate new funds. Defense spending is one of the key components of any funding measure that Congress decides on.
In the long term, the new Congress must also tackle the issues of sequestration, the debt ceiling and Defense Department funding in fiscal 2016, which come to the fore early next year and affect all businesses, including contractors.
“In terms of big issues, I don’t think anybody expects major progress” on budget priorities as a result of the election, said Stan Soloway, president and chief executive of the Professional Services Council, an Arlington-based trade group.
Instead, smaller measures on issues such as fixing the Pentagon’s procurement process are more likely, trade groups say.
“There’s an inclination to want to make government work well,” said Elizabeth Hyman, executive vice president of public advocacy at TechAmerica, an advocacy group. “We hope to see common-sense procurement and acquisition reform.”
Contractors are closely tracking changes in committee leadership after the Republican sweep.

For instance, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is widely expected to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee.
McCain, a former Navy pilot, has long been a vocal critic of cost overruns on big defense programs including the F-35 jet, which might put some weapons systems under the scanner.
But McCain is “a defense hawk” by any definition, Thompson said.
“That means if contractors can stand the pain, they’re probably going to end up better off in the end,” he said.
Similarly, Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) is expected to take over chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee from Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). This could mean additional funding for the Navy to modernize its fleet and potentially benefit contractors such as shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls, Thompson said. But it also gives Mikulski a less prominent perch from which to advocate for the region’s cybersecurity industry and press to locate the FBI’s headquarters in Maryland.
With the election out of the way, contractors are expecting a little more economic certainty, if only for a little while.
At the very least, “a Congress with one party holding both sides is more likely to be able to push through changes,” Crotty said.

Data security: Hope for a federal data breach notification law

There are currently 48 state laws governing how companies must notify their customers and employees if their data has been breached.
That makes it complicated for regional and national companies when a breach happens — if they are based in Washington but have employees or customers in a dozen states, for example, each of those dozen states’ different laws apply to how the company must notify those people.
For that reason, the business community as a whole largely supports the passage of a single federal law so that in the event of a breach, companies would only have to comply with one law as opposed to 48 different laws when notifying the affected customers and employees.
Versions of that legislation have been stuck in House and Senate committees, but now that the two chambers are both under Republican control, businesses are hoping that the passage of a unified federal standard will move more quickly.

Retail: Trouble for trolls and Internet taxes

Taxes and patent trolls are two issues the retail industry is hoping the Republican-led Senate will take up in the next two years, according to David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation.
“From a government standpoint, we think [a Republican pick-up in the Senate] is an important step in the right direction,” he said.
Among other measures, NRF officials said a Republican-led Congress is more likely to pass legislation limiting the reach of “patent trolls” that have long plagued the retail industry with lawsuits, especially when merchants venture into e-commerce. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pulled the plug on a patent reform bill earlier this year, but a Republican-led Senate may be likely to resurrect talks, French said.
The lobbying organization warned that Republican control of Congress may make it trickier to pass a bill requiring online merchants to collect the same sales tax as their brick-and-mortar counterparts. Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) has been a champion of sales-tax fairness, and with Democrats taking a back seat in the Senate, that could become a fading priority.
“With Durbin in the minority, the issue may be more challenging in 2015, so retailers need to step up efforts for the legislation to receive final passage during the lame-duck session,” J. Craig Shearman, vice president of government affairs at the retail group, wrote on the federation’s site Wednesday.

Banking: Time for relief

Four years after the implementation of the post-Great Recession Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, regulation is still top of mind for banks and credit unions.
Financial institutions are hoping a Republican stronghold in Congress will make for loosened regulation and tweaks to Dodd-Frank.
If nothing else, having a clear majority in both the House and Senate will help pass legislation more quickly, according to Katherine Marisic, vice president of political affairs for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. The Democratic-led Senate has blocked recent attempts by the House at changing key measures of the Dodd-Frank Act.
“We hope there is a real opportunity for some regulatory relief from Dodd-Frank that our members have been dealing with,” Marisic said. “The Republican-held Senate and the Republican-held House may be willing to work together on this type of issue.”

MS Dhoni
MS Dhoni has been rested for the first Test against Australia in Brisbane from December 4 to ensure his recovery from a right thumb injury. In his absence, Virat Kohli will lead India in the match.
Dhoni, who has been named squad captain and is expected to join the team for the three remaining Tests, has also been ruled out of the remaining two ODIs against Sri Lanka. Dhoni had earlier opted out of the first three ODIs, citing the need for a break to freshen up ahead of the Australia tour.
With Wriddhiman Saha expected to take the wicket-keeping gloves in Dhoni's absence, the Indian selectors have opted for another back-up, picking Naman Ojha . Ojha will travel with the team as cover for Saha only for the first Test and will return once Dhoni joins the squad.
Saha has long been Dhoni's understudy, but has played only two Tests and nine ODIs to date. When Saha got injured in England earlier this year, he lost his No. 2 slot to Sanju Samson who traveled with the team during the ODIs but did not get a game. Saha's replacement in the Test extras was Ojha.
Ojha, incidentally, had a good run for India A on their tour of Australia in July this year, slamming three successive first-class centuries in two games against Australia A. Ojha finished the tour with 430 first-class runs and was also added to the England squad after Saha suffered an injury. He extended his form with a score of 217 for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy game against North Zone in Mohali.

Air India charging govt employees up to 150% more on ticketsAir India charging govt employees up to 150% more on LTC tickets
By Sanjay Singh | India Today Group –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014 12:24 PM IST
Print
NEW DELHI: National carrier Air India (AI) seems to be draining the national exchequer by charging anywhere between 80 per cent and 150 per cent extra for tickets that 30.85 lakh Central government employees are supposed to avail as leave travel concession (LTC).
According to government rules, it is mandatory for all Central government employees to use Air India to avail LTC. The employees, who get LTC twice in four years, can choose to go by air, Railways, roadways or ship.    
The AI website has a special section for LTC tickets. Bookings can also be done through authorized agents such as state-owned tourism and travel companies like Ashok Travel and Tours, Balmer and Lawrie and Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation.    
Mail Today found that for a ticket booked on November 9 (Sunday) during evening hours for a Delhi-Hyderabad AI flight for December 14, normal one-way passenger fare was Rs 5,901, which was almost same as those offered by private airlines like Jet Airways, IndiGo and GoAir.    
However, AI’s LTC fare was more than double the amount at Rs 13,248 for the same trip.    
Similarly, LTC fares for other domestic and international destinations on November 9, as Mail Today further discovered, were much higher than normal ones. As LTC bookings are the most lucrative segment for loss-making AI, over 20 seats on any domestic flight are reserved for such passengers.    
When contacted, the AI spokesperson claimed that LTC fares are better than market fares. But the fares shown on the AI website accessed by Mail Today belie the claim.
The spokesman further stated, “Central government employees also get the benefit of changing their travel schedule or cancelling tickets. The cost of cancelling tickets is very minimal compared to cancellation in case of normal fares. The cost of LTC ticket is more or less the same if you compare with private carriers,” he claimed.    
A senior government official said that while the objective of travelling by AI seems to be to save money for the government, it actually ends up paying more for LTC.
“The government is losing crores of rupees due to this overcharging by Air India,” he added.    
In June, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) in an order reminded all government employees to buy LTC tickets from AI. “As far as possible, air tickets on government account may be obtained directly from the Air India (booking counters, offices, websites) and if obtaining tickets directly from Air India is not possible, the services of authorized travel agents may be availed of,” DoPT said in an order.    
The DoPT order further stated that in several cases, it has been noticed that the instructions are not being followed and as a result, various ministries and departments continue to make references to DoPT seeking relaxation of the conditions for one reason or the other.    
DoPT is also cautious about fake bills presented by government employees.

5 Pointz Landlord Says His Luxury Condos Will Be Just Like The Graffiti Mecca He Destroyed5 Pointz Landlord Says He Won't Back Down On Using The Graffiti Mecca's Name
Posted:
reddit
The unlikely New York City landmark known as 5Pointz has been at the center of controversy ever since landlord Jerry Wolkoff whitewashed the complex’s walls last fall, destroying layers of graffiti art painted there with his permission. Now Wolkoff tells HuffPost he plans to use the name “5Pointz” for the two new condos going up in place of the former graffiti “temple.”
“I’m trying to get the name registered,” Wolkoff told HuffPost in a phone interview Friday. Earlier this week, a report surfaced of a bid Wolkoff submitted in March to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which was denied due to a preexisting real estate development in California with a similar name. In the call to HuffPost, Wolkoff clarified that he plans to challenge the denial.
5 Pointz, before and after Wolkoff's whitewashing.
The move makes one more bullet point in a list of grievances for the key artists and activists associated with 5Pointz, for whom Wolkoff became an enemy after his dramatic overnight whitewashing. One, Marie Cecile Flageul, acted as the group’s press liaison when plans were underway to sway the city to preserve the graffiti-smothered building. Speaking to a reporter this week , Flageul accused Wolkoff of trying to “bank off our name.” She called the name-grab “ironic,” asserting that “the same corporation which single-handedly destroyed all the artwork known as 5Pointz” is “trying to capitalize” on its cache.
Speaking to HuffPost, Wolkoff insisted that the name is his to use. He contested an earlier New York Times report that seems to attribute the moniker “5Pointz” to Jason “Meres One” Cohen, a street artist who acted as the lead “curator” for the site in its heyday.
Wolkoff says he collaborated with Cohen on the name, which is meant to signify a meeting point of the city’s five boroughs. “We were talking, and we decided to use this thing of 5Pointz,” Wolkoff said.
He is also adamant that the name should be his to reuse in the context of the two condo buildings set to rise. Bringing up New York's Museum of Natural History, he hypothesized that “if they took that down and put up another building with more or less the same stuff inside, you’d still call it the Museum of Natural History.”
The new condos will by no means duplicate the function of 5Pointz, a decrepit building that for much of its later life did not meet city codes. For years, the building was legendary for its studios -- cheaper than any for miles. When a staircase collapsed in 2009 , the primary allure of the complex was its external facade, which artists of all ages tagged with spray paint.
Wolkoff says the upcoming $400 million luxury development will channel the ethos of the old 5Pointz, calling the property's second incarnation "the same" as its first. He plans to designate a tagging wall and studios inside the building, both features of which have been preemptively derided by artists as pale echoes of their soulful originals. Critics "don't believe that I’m going to bring them back,” Wolkoff said, referencing the artists who once flocked to his property. “But they will be back.”

Tough J&K team ready for bigger battlesTweet
0
Jammu & Kashmir needed two runs in the final over to shock Delhi in their opening game of the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Samiullah Beigh paddled Pawan Negi for a single, and then J&K's No. 10 batsman Ram Dayal jumped out to hit a four over mid-off and secure the victory. It was only the third time they had beaten Delhi in a List A match, yet the celebrations at the Luhnu Cricket Ground in Bilaspur stopped at cheerful smiles and high-fives.
Samiullah BeighA little over a month ago, life in the Kashmir Valley and majority of Jammu had been severely disrupted because of a devastating flood. Instead of preparing for the upcoming domestic season, some J&K players were paddling makeshift rafts and using overhanging electric cables to negotiate submerged streets. The Sher-e-Kashmir stadium in Srinagar was under 10 feet of water. The Science College ground in Jammu was badly damaged too.
The Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) sought the BCCI's help to move the squad's preparatory camp to Mohali in the last week of October. The camp was conducted by Sunil Joshi, the former Karnataka and India left-arm spinner who was appointed J&K coach last month. After the chaos and the struggle of the last few months, the players understand the significance of the win against Delhi.
"We have been brought up in a tough life. We are mentally tough," Beigh, the J&K arllounder, told ESPNcricinfo. He, along with his captain Parvez Rasool, was a key performer in the victory against Delhi.
Beigh knocked the top off the Delhi battingline-up, dismissing Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir and Unmkut Chand. Having failed to find control during a short first spell, Beigh switched ends successfully, claiming 3 for 8 in his last six overs. Delhi slipped from 59 for 0 to 74 for 3. "Against Viru bhai I bowled from wide of the crease an inswinger and he edged to the keeper. Bowling from round the stumps I swung the ball late to bowl Gauti bhai," Beigh said. "I again went wide of the crease to Unmukt and he edged behind the stumps."
Chasing 213, J&K started nervously and fell to 31 for 3. Their captain Rasool regained the initiative with an attacking 74 that included 12 boundaries, and Beigh began his innings 52 runs from victory. He had a vital 44-run stand with Waseem Raza for the eighth wicket. When the scores were tied Beigh told Deyal to go for a big hit. "Because even if he were to be caught I would cross and get on strike," Beigh said. "I did not want him to get lbw or bowled. It was smart thinking from both of us. He hit over mid-off for a four."
Beigh said the win was a "monkey off the back" because J&K had lost the advantage from winning positions in few matches last season. "We were not able to finish the games. Last year we lost a few tight matches from winning positions. So this time I made sure my partners were calm and made sure we played with the straight bat."
Beigh said the celebrations were muted also because it was only a starting point. "We did not celebrate much over this win because we have a bigger goal. We know we have a decent side and can easily reach the final."
Joshi said the victory showed the character and resilience of the J&K unit. "It is just the beginning. The players deserve every bit of this victory. They really need this moment especially keeping in mind what happened in J&K recently (floods). They fought very, very hard in every department and they won. They are talented and they have shown that by beating a star-studded Delhi team."
ML Nehru, the JKCA secretary, said the victory would inject much-needed determination to the team because J&K will be playing all their matches outside home this season. "Normally we had planned to play inter-provincial matches, which we could not hold. But despite that it is quite remarkable on the part of the players to register this win.
"We are requesting the BCCI to release subsidy since we have a lost a lot of ground equipment. The Sher-e-Kashmir stadium was submerged under 10 feet of water for a long time. So we want the BCCI to visit and examine the losses and accordingly help us out."

Raising the Minimum Wage Isn t Enoughreddit
As I wrote last month , for millions of American families, the recession has never ended, despite a booming stock market and a lower official rate of unemployment. As Republicans and Democrats sort out the changed political landscape they'll have to navigate next year, one lesson from our recent election is unmistakable:
Americans get that economic inequality is crippling our nation and they want our leaders to address it. Even as Democrats were getting their heads handed to them in both red and blue states, voters in those same states were doing what they could to help working families. In every state where a minimum wage increase was on the ballot, it passed easily , with some the biggest margins in red states. The same Arkansas voters who handed Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor a 16-point defeat passed a minimum wage increase by a nearly two-to-one margin. Voters in Alaska, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota did likewise.
Congress should pass a federal minimum wage increase yesterday (and if Republican leaders are listening to their own voters, they should lead the charge), but that's not enough. A higher minimum wage will help millions who are stuck in low-end jobs to make ends meet, but if families are to prosper -- especially in the communities of color that got most hammered by the Great Recession -- they need pathways to real careers and opportunities to build assets and prosperity.
The good news is that there are ways to help that happen. The bad news is that some things that could help probably can't get done politically, and some things that may be politically feasible could take us in the wrong direction if not done right.
For example, there is a lot of talk about corporate tax reform . The Greenlining Institute and others have complained for years about big companies parking hundreds of billions of dollars in profits overseas to avoid paying taxes on them. So far, the political talk is mostly about lowering corporate tax rates, but anything deserving to be called "reform" must include a push to collect the taxes that these companies are dodging -- and then use that money for education and investment in communities that still struggle. Think about what could be done if we collected those missing billions and put them to work helping students pay for college, or on infrastructure projects that could generate contracts for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses across the country, many of them rooted in the communities of color that have been on the wrong end of the racial wealth gap.
That shouldn't be a political non-starter given the election results, but in our dysfunctional politics, it may be.  Even so, officials can still take meaningful action. Recently, my colleagues on The Greenlining Institute's Economic Equity team raised a few of them with policymakers in Washington:
Small businesses play a critical role in generating jobs and building wealth, especially in our nation's African American, Latino and Asian communities, and the Small Business Administration must take a more aggressive role in ensuring that these entrepreneurs can access the capital they need to grow and prosper. Happily, SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet's statements suggest she understands the importance of these diverse small businesses.
The SBA can take numerous actions that will make a difference. It can push banks to increase SBA lending to Main Street small businesses. It can help these small businesses build capacity by connecting them to technical assistance and training that will help them put those loans to work. It can pilot an SBA direct loan program that targets businesses in areas lacking access to capital.
And on a variety of fronts, government financial regulators can collect -- and make public -- better, more detailed data that give us a clearer picture of how our banking and financial system serves (or fails to serve) the needs of all our communities. This sounds wonky and obscure, but remember: We can't fix what we don't know.
Congress and the administration can act to protect and expand crucial reforms contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. They can start with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which continues to do important work protecting consumers from the sorts of abuses that tanked our economy in the first place.
Less known but just as important are the Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion , created because Congress understood that including diverse voices in the management of both financial businesses and the agencies that regulate them can not only help communities of color and low- to moderate-income Americans, but ultimately strengthen our whole economy. For example, the OMWIs can encourage the financial industry to open up narrow "old-boy networks" of suppliers and contractors and provide more opportunities to diverse small businesses.
The OMWIs don't have the power to enforce diversity practices, but they can collect data and use their bully pulpit to lend a hand to small businesses in underserved communities. Right now, it's not clear that they're stepping up to the plate in a meaningful way, but our whole economy will benefit if they do.
Also, Congress must act to prevent a whopping tax bill from hitting homeowners who got their loans modified as part of settlements reached with major banks. This is simple: Just renew the Mortgage Debt Relief Act that was unfortunately allowed to lapse last year.
These suggestions aren't dramatic or headline-grabbing, but small actions done right can make a big difference. Large portions of our society are still hurting, and officials of both parties must act.

It’s the time of year when money managers whose funds are lagging the overall market or specific index or style benchmarks they are measured against have to start playing catch-up. And with a large swath of funds lagging behind this year, that means a lot of fund managers could chase the market and buy stocks.
And that so-called performance-chasing could provide yet another building block for a market already trading at record highs on the strength of a strong seasonal tailwind, robust corporate earnings, an improving economy and continued support and stimulus from central banks around the globe.
Only 14% of fund managers posted returns that topped the performance of the S&P 500 index this year through the end of October, according to an analysis done by Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The average fund return was 8.6%, which trailed the market benchmark by almost 2.5 percentage points. Fewer than 6% of growth fund managers topped the S&P 500, BofA data show.

Similarly, fewer than 18% of fund managers topped the large-cap Russell 1000 stock index — putting the funds’ miss rate at its worst level in 10 years.
While Subramanian says she’s not a big believer in the thesis that the market gets a fourth-quarter boost from funds “buying risk in an attempt to catch up,” many Wall Street pros say it can have a bullish effect on the market near year’s end.

Apple iOS bug makes devices vulnerable to at...Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc's iOS makes most iPhones & iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc's iOS operating system makes most iPhones and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, emails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple's App Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed "Masque Attack."
These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
"It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit," FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Apple's iOS has robust security features that make it extremely difficult for attackers to install malware on devices using traditional techniques for infecting Windows machines and Android mobile devices with malicious emails and Web links. The "Masque Attack" makes that possible by exploiting a system that Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through Apple's App Store, according to David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout.
Those applications are not vetted by Apple for malicious software, unlike apps in its App Store, though users do receive pop-up notifications asking if they want to prevent the apps from installing on devices, he said.
"You can just say 'Don't install.' As long as you do that, you will be protected from this vulnerability," Richardson said.
FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and representatives of the company said they were working to fix the bug, according to Wei.

Coal controller to collect data for 74 auction coal blocks

Coal Controller
(Data will include grade…)
KOLKATA: The Centre has asked the coal controller's office to collect data for 74 coal blocks that are to be auctioned and hand it over to a central sector company tasked with arriving at a reserve price for each block after compiling the data. "The PSU that has been handed over the responsibility of compiling the data does not have access to these blocks.
The coal controller , however, has offices at each state that holds coal reserves," said a senior official involved with the process. "An officer from the coal controller's office, accompanied by officials from the PSU, will visit the offices at each block and collect the data," the person said.
Data will include grade of coal in the reserves, investments made in setting up equipment and building infrastructure.
The coal ministry has already asked private companies that were allotted blocks to provide these data to the coal controller.
Of the 74 coal blocks, 32 have not started production. These blocks have stage-1 and stage-2 environmental clearances from the government.
There are 37 producing blocks while five blocks are ready to produce. Meanwhile, the Centre has yet to arrive at a benchmark price for coal, based on which the reserve prices are to be determined.

Tariff cap to stop power cos to pass on auct...Tariff cap prices to stop power companies from passing on auction cost of coal blocks
Sarita Singh, ET Bureau Nov 11, 2014, 05.02AM IST

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
(Of the 204 coal blocks cancelled…)
NEW DELHI: The government is likely to cap prices of power generated from auctioned coal blocks to prevent companies from inflating electricity bills and profiteering, besides allowing successful bidders to use coal from a block in different power plants of the group.
While the government believes that capping prices is necessary to keep electricity tariffs in check, power companies said they should be allowed to pass on the input cost to consumers since they will be paying a huge premium for the coal blocks. "We are working on a legal formulation to cap power tariff at a certain level for each block. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission may be asked to cap prices so companies do not pass on the entire cost of coal to tariffs. There will be a limit to fuel pass-through," a senior government official said.
The official, who did not wish to be identified, said price ceiling would promote efficient utilisation of coal while discouraging companies from bidding arbitrarily for blocks auctioned for power sector. The proposal, which will be part of the 'auction methodology' being prepared by the coal ministry, will be discussed with the power ministry on Tuesday at a meet to discuss auction methodology for power, cement and steel sectors and will be later sent to the Cabinet for approval, the official said. Power firms with existing or proposed end-use projects will be allowed to participate in the auction, expected to kick off before January.
Of the 204 coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court , 59 were allocated to power plants with combined capacity of over 67,000-mw capacity. Some of these have power purchase agreements with staterun distribution companies at a price determined through tariff-based bidding while some plants have agreements that provide fuel cost pass-through. Aprivate developer, who did not wish to be identified, said, "Price capping could have been done had the blocks been given to us for free or at a discount. Expecting us to pay for the blocks, pay royalty, develop them with all difficulties and absorbing costs by keeping the tariffs low is absurd and unfair."
The capping proposal replaces the bidding framework prepared by the UPA under which it offered 90% discount on coal blocks to power companies to keep electricity rates low. The UPA government sought to offer blocks to power firms via a UMPP-like tariff-based bidding.

Re-iterating the NDA government’s commitment to economic reforms, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that reforms are not about one big idea but a continuous process.
“We need to pursue a positive direction…. Reforms are not about one sensational idea,” he said at the India Economic Summit that is co-organised by the World Economic Forum and CII.
The finance minister expressed hope that the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill would be passed in the next session of Parliament. He also announced that the government would continue with efforts on disinvestment and said that reforms similar to coal block allocation would be considered for other minerals as well.
Pointing out that one bad idea can impact the economy adversely, the minister said that the provision on retrospective taxation was one such proposal that damaged the economy.
Jaitley also expressed satisfaction about the direction of reforms under the NDA government till now. “I am satisfied by the steps taken… we will take time to rectify the economy,” he said.
During the interaction, he also said that the government was open to privatisation of some loss making PSUs.

BSE Sensex hits 28K-mark  Nifty scales new high on hope of reformsPrint
By: PTI | Mumbai | Posted: November 5, 2014 4:52 pm
The BSE Sensex today breached the 28,000 level for the first time but ended a shade below at 27,915.88, its all-time closing peak, with gains of 55.50 points as banking and IT stocks rallied amid hopes of more reforms by government and a rate cut by the Reserve Bank.
The NSE Nifty also closed at record level of 8,338.30, gaining 14.15 points over the previous close. The 50-share index touched all-time intra-day high of 8,365.55 points, surpassing its previous record of 8,350.60 scaled on Monday.
During the day trade, the 30-share BSE Sensex scaled its fresh life-time high of 28,010.39 points, beating its previous record high of 27,969.82 reached on Monday.
“Market sentiment has been buoyed by a slew of economic reforms undertaken by the government recently, followed by optimism over strong second quarter earnings by blue-chip companies”, said Manoj Choraria, a Delhi-based stock broker.
Addressing business leaders at New Delhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the government was looking at areas like labour reforms, privatisation of some state-owned companies and improvement of land acquisition laws.
Besides government accelerating economic reforms, falling global crude prices, that raised hopes of an early cut in rates by the Reserve Bank, bolstered sentiments that lifted key indices to new peaks, brokers said.
Banking stocks such as Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI led the rally among Sensex stocks. Axis Bank rose the most by 2.93 per cent among 30 Sensex scrips, followed by SBI (2.24 per cent) and DR Reddy (2.24 per cent).
ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Sun Pharma, Infosys, TCS and ITC were among major gainers that lifted the index to record high.
Stocks of state-run oil companies such as HPCL, BPCL and IOC hogged the liemlight and rose up to 2.37 per cent after global crude prices hit multi-year lows that would improve their margins.
However, Coal India, Sesa Sterlite, Bharti Airtel, RIL, Hindalco and Tata Power were laggards on profit-booking.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth a net Rs 1,413.34 crore on Monday.
A mixed trend in the other Asian markets, a higher opening on the European markets on better corproate earnings, too influenced trading sentiments here, traders said.
“Markets consolidated post the recent rally in the markets, which has come about on the back of renewed optimism on fiscal reforms, sharp correction in crude prices, improved growth in US, liquidity easing by Japan and diminished possibilities of an immediate increase in US interest rates,” Dipen Shah, Head- Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Among the 30 Sensex components, 14 stocks advanced, while 16 ended in negative zone.
The Banking index gained the most by surging 1.41 per cent, followed by Healthcare by 1.01 per cent, IT index by 0.73 per cent, Capital Goods index by 0.57 per cent, FMCG index by 0.32 per cent and Auto index by 0.05 per cent.
However, Metal sector index slipped 3.03 per cent and Power index fell 0.91 per cent.
With continued improvement in trading sentiments, buying activity by retail investors also spread to small-cap and mid-cap stocks, brokers said.

Make in India push: Union Bank cuts rates for MSMEsUnion Bank has close to Rs 3,000 crore of excess liquidity which it has been deploying in the money markets.
By: ENS Economic Bureau | Mumbai | Posted: November 6, 2014 12:47 am | Updated: November 6, 2014 6:10 am
In a move that will help it align its loan rates to smaller companies with those of its peers, Union Bank on Wednesday said it was slashing rates by as much as 200-375 basis points for such customers.
The revised interest rate for investment-grade borrowers in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) segment, the public sector lender said, would range between 12.25 per cent and 13.75 per cent. The revision will also give fillip to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ campaign, PTI quoted a bank release as stating. Three weeks ago, Axis Bank reduced its base rate by 10 basis points to 10.15 per cent to bring it closer to those of its peers such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank whose base rates are at 10 per cent.
In a competitive environment in which the offtake of credit has been slow, banks have been lowering rates for customers; State Bank of India (SBI) chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya had recently said that corporates rated ‘AA’ were able to borrow at base rates because bankers had been left with very few options to grow their loan books.
K Subrahmanyam, executive director, Union Bank, said that the bank’s lending rates to the MSME segment had been higher than those of its competitors. “We have been wanting to lend more to retail, agriculture and MSME sectors and the cut would ensure we see more credit being deployed to MSMEs,” Subrahmanyam added. Union Bank has close to Rs 3,000 crore of excess liquidity which it has been deploying in the money markets.
The lender’s MSME advances grew a steep 31.6 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter but slippages — standard loans turning into non-performing assets — stood at Rs 358 crore, higher than the Rs 226 crore seen in the March quarter.
In the absence of a pick-up in the demand for loans, bankers have been flush with funds and have been attempting to reduce their cost of deposits. Over the past three months, several banks have lowered deposit rates, including, SBI, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank.
The lower rates could impact Union Bank’s net interest margins, analysts said, given the lender is unlikely to be able to drop deposit rates by an equivalent amount.
The bank said that it classifies medium enterprises into two classes: Manufacturing enterprises engaged with investment in core plant and machinery more than Rs 5 crore up to Rs 10 crore, and service enterprises engaged in rendering services with investment in core equipment more than Rs 2 crore up to Rs 5 crore.
“MSME is a dynamic and vibrant sector of our economy that nurtures entrepreneurial talent besides meeting social objectives including that of providing employment to a sizeable number continued…

Gujarat plant: FIs back Maruti plan on Suzuki funding  LIC undecidedPrint
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: November 6, 2014 1:07 am
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is learnt to have convinced a majority of its institutional investors to back the decision of its parent firm, Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), to directly invest in the upcoming Gujarat car manufacturing plant, a step in the direction of the car major bagging approval of its minority shareholders for the controversial proposal.
State-owned LIC, the largest domestic institutional investor that holds 6.8 per cent stake in the company, however, is the missing link and the life insurance firm is keeping its cards close to its chest.
Two officials associated with two different institutions that have investments in MSIL, told The Indian Express that MSIL had recently held meetings with them and have almost convinced them on the issue by stating that the cash with MSIL will be utilised for product development (customised for India), payment of higher dividends and investment in real estate.
Confirming the meetings with the institutional investors including LIC, chairman of MSIL, RC Bhargava, said that the financial institutions asked the company about utilisation of its cash if SMC was going to invest in Gujarat plant.
“We told that we will invest in developing new products and on their constant upgrades since more and more of that work will now be done in India by MSIL. We also told them that we will invest in real estate as there have been issues with dealers where the land owners put them under pressure by constantly increasing the rent,” said Bhargava, adding that the investors also asked if the company will increase the dividend payout ratio to which MSIL agreed. Stating that that the company has held three meetings with LIC, he said, “They have not expressed their opinion either ways.”
He, however, exuded confidence on getting the decision approved by the minority shareholders when the resolution comes up for voting and that there were no reasons for anybody to vote against it.
“While we haven’t got any feedback from them, a lot of foreign and other institutional investors seemed satisfied and have said that it was a good deal for Maruti and its shareholders,” said Bhargava.
The firm’s board’s recent guideline on dividend payout ratio to keep it between 18 and 30 per cent also seems to be stemming out of the demands made by the institutional investors as the chairman said, “The decision is based on the feedback after meeting with the institutional investors and demand raised by other investors at the AGM (annual general meeting).”
On the decision of buying real estate, Bhargava said that the suggestion came from SMC chairman Osamu Suzuki, who suggested that MSIL develop dealerships for the long-term.
While Suzuki said that MSIL should set up company-owned company-operated dealerships which companies are doing in Japan and some other countries, MSIL felt that that company-owned model may not work here, “But as a middle path we have now said that we will own the land for dealerships. While it will bring stability, it will also help us lock the dealers and ensure that they don’t migrate,” said continued…

Power sector to see investment of $250 bn over the next four years  says Piyush GoyalPiyush Goyal estimated India's total power consumption would double to 2 trillion units by 2019.
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: November 6, 2014 11:46 am
The minister for Power, coal and new and renewable energy, Piyush Goyal, today said that the sector will see an investment of $250 billion dollars over the next four years with $100 billion in renewable energy and around $50 billion in transmission.
Recollecting the state of power in the country, Goyal said that even after 67 years almost one fourth of the population does not have access to electricity and the new government will endeavour to provide electricity to all over the next five years.
“I am hopeful that in 2019 when we go for the next general elections we have provided power to all houses, offices and other establishments,” said Goyal while speaking at the India Economic Summit organized by WEF and CII. He said that almost 53 million houses in the country still need to be electrified.
He said the new government is hopeful that fuel supply issue will be addressed over the next few years and the government has taken steps in that direction. He said that coal production will be doubled to 1 billion tonnes by 2019 and the revised gas pricing will result in increased development and discovery.
Stating that the new government has raised the target for solar power generation by 2022 from 20,000 MW to 100,000 MW, he said that Nuclear energy too had potential but it even has some problems. “We want to be sure that we are not saddled with something that has been discarded by the West. We have to be clear on what we are getting,” said Goyal.
 

The Fifth Metro: Clean it like TokyoIn Bangalore, the government dithered over finding a suitable site to dump the hundreds of tonnes of waste that the city produces.
Written by Saritha Rai | Posted: November 10, 2014 1:13 am
In New Delhi this past week, politicians made an absolute farce of the Swachh Bharat Clean India campaign as they posed away, clearing rubbish specifically dumped for the photo-ops. In Mumbai, the campaign has made little headway in cleaning up a vast, smelly and dirty city. In Bangalore, the government dithered over finding a suitable site to dump the hundreds of tonnes of waste that the city produces. If there is a city for Indians to learn civic duty from, it has to be Tokyo.
Tokyo is an immaculate paradox. There is hardly a garbage bin to be found on the streets and yet, there is no litter in the world’s most populous metropolitan area. With its 38 million people, the largest urban conglomeration on earth is squeaky clean.
How do the Japanese (seemingly) effortlessly accomplish what the Americans, Scandinavians and the British also achieve — albeit only after spending millions of tax money on manpower and expensive equipment to clean their streets and public spaces? It boils down to the innate Japanese habit of picking up after themselves. The Japanese do not throw rubbish on the floor. They pocket or bag the litter and take it back with them.
Japan’s clean cities are a culture shock to visitors who realise that it is a combined citizens’ effort, only strategically supplemented by local governments. The no-littering ethic is rooted in Japan’s culture. The country is an island without access to endless resources and the Japanese value everything. What they don’t need, they dispose of correctly. “The Japanese will not do things that would embarrass — and littering would make us feel very ashamed,” explained Takanobu Iwasaki, a deputy director at the bureau of environment in the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
Instilling such a shaming system amongst Indians would have to start young, just as it does in Japan. Every Japanese child is told early on that littering is a no-no. Every 10-year-old in her fourth grade studies waste management as a compulsory part of the school curriculum. She learns how to reduce garbage, how to dispose of rubbish correctly and how to recycle.
There is another critical aspect. School children routinely clean up their schools, the streets near their schools and even their neighbourhoods. If the school baseball team gathers to practise every weekend, it would likely spend extra time one weekend a month cleaning up a road, a park or some area located in the community.
In India, we live in spotless homes and bathe at least once daily but thoughtlessly litter, spit, dump garbage and urinate in public spaces. In contrast, public places in Japanese cities and rural areas stay pristine. Households clean up the street in front of their homes by turn every other day. Residents painstakingly segregate their waste. The segregation might seem extreme to citizens in India, who are continued…

Slowing profits growth offers wake-up call for record-high sharescorporate earnings
(Corporate earnings are…)
MUMBAI/BANGALORE: Corporate earnings are growing at the weakest pace in nearly six years, in a more sober reflection of the economy than a stock market hovering near record highs since the May election of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.
The new premier, previously known for economy-stimulating infrastructure projects on a state level, has been widely touted as the man to revive an economy lumbering through the longest spell of below-5 per cent growth in a quarter of a century.
Such is investor sentiment surrounding Modi's premiership that main share index has risen by a third this year, touching a lifetime high on Wednesday.
But weakening corporate earnings growth highlight the continued need of Asia's third-largest economy for increased investment, lower interest rates and a slower rate of inflation, company executives said.
"We did assume at the beginning of the year that domestic conditions would improve post elections," said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of conglomerate Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
"It has, sentiment has improved, but the ground reality is still to change. I do think it will take a good six months for it (to) completely kick in. Hence, I want to be circumspect."
The median net profit growth of 102 Indian companies which have reported July-September earnings was 7.7 per cent, the lowest since October-December 2008, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data on companies tracked by at least one brokerage.
Median revenue growth at those companies - including cement maker ACC Ltd, financial services provider IDFC Ltd and mobile phone network operator Bharti Airtel Ltd - was 10.5 per cent, the lowest in nearly five years.
Revenue growth is likely to slow even more in October-December to 10 per cent, but will pick up to 12.5 per cent in January-March in line with a general expectation for quicker economic growth and a reduction in central bank interest rates.
  Even so, the country's biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, last month said its auto sales growth would slow in the second half of the fiscal year ending March 31, cooling hope of an industry rebound after two years of declining sales.
"The situation of course is not as bright as many people hoped it would be at this point. We do not expect the growth in sales of Maruti will be as high a per centage (as) in the first half and this will slow down," said its chairman, R C Bhargava.
The downbeat outlook puts pressure on Modi to deliver on election promises to take "decisive action" to facilitate investment in power generation, roads and rail, to stimulate economic growth.
"We need some fundamental changes on the ground," said the CFO of a large conglomerate who declined to be identified when expressing views on the government. "Up to now, there are many statements of intent, but there is no real investment."

Why women entrepreneurs dominate Google India head Rajan Anandan s portfolio in 2014Why women entrepreneurs dominate Google India head Rajan Anandan's portfolio in 2014

(Women account for 6 of 10…)
When she went looking for funds to give flight to her considerable ambitions, being all of 21 years of age and a woman should have been, in the orthodox construct that is the world of Indian investing, a disadvantage for Prukalpa Sankar. In a backhanded way, in the same orthodox construct, it turned out to be an advantage. "I was too young. The investors didn't ask about my marriage plans," laughs Sankar, recounting those times two years on. What they asked in great detail was about her business plans, which is what Sankar, like every other woman entrepreneur, wanted them to.
Sankar, a chemical and bio-molecular engineer, founder SocialCops, along with her friend Varun Banka. SocialCops is a technology company that uses crowd-sourced data to answer questions like what is the safest route to go home or where are the accident hotspots in a city.
In the coming years, it wants to do number enumeration exercises on the scale of the Indian census, in real time as opposed to the decadal frequency of the government's exercise. SocialCops has raised Rs 2 crore from Google India managing director Rajan Anandan, 500 Startups and Manoj Menon, managing director of Frost & Sullivan.
The first name in that list of investors is conscious of women entrepreneurs like Sankar, not so much about them being in a minority, but more about how their footprints are increasing on the Indian startup landscape. Anandan, a prolific angel investor, points to how his personal portfolio of startup investments has changed over the years.
Anandan began making such investments, mostly in partnership with other investors, in 2006. In the seven years to 2013, he funded 40 startups, of which, only six were by women. This year, the gender mix has changed. Of his 10 investments in 2014, six startups are founded or co-founded by women. All technology-driven businesses. "It's a shift from the past, when women would be seen in more non-tech startups," says Anandan. "These are hardcore tech startups, which have a capability to compete with the best in the world."
So, for example, Neha Behani, 31, has co-founded Moojic, an in-store engagement platform. Priyanka Gill, 34, and Namrata Bostrom, 29, have launched PopXO, a digital publishing platform targeting young women readers in urban India. Arathi Kuppu, 41, an MS in computer science and a mother of two, has started Cherish Maternity, an e-tailer whose products target pregnant women and young mothers.
  Those loaded gender questions or implicit inferences — how will you run your business being a woman, what are your marriage plans, will you stop working if and when you have kids, will you relocate if your spouse moves, can you stay alone at a hotel — have not disappeared and will not either. But women entrepreneurs like Behani, Gill, Bostrom and Kuppu are doing a lot to turn the prism of scrutiny, evaluation and decision-making in the startup investing ecosystem away from gender to business.
Pulls And Pressures
There's a long way to go towards gender parity, but the momentum is building. Indian Angel Network (IAN), a Delhi-based grouping of about 200 angel investors, gets 320-340 ideas a month seeking angel funding. "A year back, 5-6% of these were women-led and now that's jumped to 14-15%," says Padmaja Ruparel, president of IAN, who heads a male-dominated club of angel investors. "They are in traditionally thought to be male businesses like drug trials, water and even fashion and beauty products. And most women founders are below 35." Pranshu Bhandari, 28 years of age and based in Jaipur, co-founded CultureAlley with her husband, Nishant Patni, while they were in college.
CultureAlley is a language learning app. "At any point, one billion people are learning a foreign language globally, 60% of them English," says Bhandari. "Our app targets this market."
Bhandari finished her BTech in software engineering and MBA in 2009, both from Narsee Monjee Institute, Mumbai. She had brief stints at Sun Microsystems and Pitney Bowes before turning entrepreneur, a shift her family supported. "My father was actually disappointed when I was doing a job," she says. "He wanted me to do something on my own. Both me and my husband come from business families."
For the women entrepreneurs in Anandan's portfolio, family was not an issue. The outside world was. "There was no pressure from family. My batchmates and society questioned me more," says Sankar, who handles business development and marketing at SocialCops.
One batchmate who didn't was Varun Banka, co-founder and head of the technology piece at SocialCops. "I believe any organisation must have diversity as consumers include both men and women," says Banka. The duo did not come across investors who raised gender questions. But, adds Banka: "We would have rejected investors if they doubted the longevity of the startup because one of the co-founders is a woman."

("Infosys should follow…)
BENGALURU: Infosys Labs, the research and development arm of India's second-largest software exporter, will be the centrepiece of chief executive officer Vishal Sikka's efforts aimed at reviving the Bengaluru-based parent as a nextgeneration services company.
Infosys Labs will seek to implement disruptive technologies, including artificial intelligence and automation, by forging partnerships with companies engaged in these areas.
"We are now focusing more on automation and in future, on our mission learning, artificial intelligence... those again will be driven by Infosys Labs," said UB Pravin Rao, chief operating officer of Infosys. The engineering will be done by Infosys Labs and deployment by the business units, he said.
Infosys' focus on R&D mirrors the strategy adopted by global rivals, including IBM and Accenture , which have testing centres to help them keep pace with changing trends in technology. The effort is yet another attempt by Infosys to change the fortunes of its unit, which was set up in 1999. Since the return of founder NR Narayana Murthy in 2013 to steer the company, Infosys Labs has tried to reposition itself, leading some to believe it is fighting an "existential crisis."
In the past 18 months, Infosys has significantly reduced the workforce of Infosys Labs, leading even to the exit of its head Subrahmanyam Goparaju in December last year. Rao said a leader for Infosys Labs will be found in the next six months.
According to some experts, Infosys should follow an approach under which the talent at Labs is able to roll out next-generation technologies into parent Infosys, where Sikka took over as CEO and managing director in August.
"Vishal's decision to make automation and artificial intelligence a placeholder and reference point for leading Infosys back to its erstwhile glory is a prudent move. But crucially, it needs to be followed up by a coherent strategy and executives being able to drive these levers through the organisation," said Tom Reuner, an analyst at Ovum, a London-based IT research firm.
"For effective execution, you need strong frontline and engagement teams that understand the value the underlying AI technologies bring to specific client engagements," said Uday Chinta, India managing director of IPsoft , a New Yorkbased company that relies on artificial intelligence to manage computer networks. Infosys already has a revenuesharing partnership with IPsoft, which claims its software is capable of providing basic infrastructure management support services with limited human intervention.
Earlier, Infosys Labs was positioned on a "medium to longterm kind of thing" but of late, Infosys has started re-purposing it with a "short- to mediumterm" focus, Rao said in an interview to ET. As part of this strategy, one of the other focus areas for Infosys Labs will be to take some of the "cutting edge technologies" to help clients.

Festivals fail to lift mood: Car cos like Maruti  Hyundai see year in red as sales fallPrices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated festive season failed to trigger demand for cars in October as sales declined for the second consecutive month amid a slow economic recovery and high interest rates, raising concerns the industry may see a third straight year of declines.
Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai Motor and other car companies sold a combined 1,59,036 vehicles last month, a drop of 2.55% from 1,63,199 units in October 2013, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Monday. Overall domestic auto sales fell 4% to 17.87 lakh vehicles last month, pummeled by a sharp 9% decline in bike dispatches, turning negative for the first time since December 2013, when a 4.24% fall was registered.
"This year, the festival season has been subdued compared to last year. If we don't see some real growth in economic activity and some relief in the high interest rates on automotive financing that could improve customers' sentiment, we might not see automobile sales going up in the coming months," SIAM deputy director-general Sugato Sen said.
Sen declined to provide a forecast, although SIAM had earlier estimated a 5-10% growth in passenger vehicle sales in the current financial year. Following declines in 2012-13 and 2013-14, car sales in the country had increased every month from May to August. Automobile sales dropped 1.03% in September.

Eyeing 8% growth  govt to fast-track economi...Arun Jaitley
(The administration is well-placed…)
NEW DELHI: Having just completed a comprehensive round of ministerial and bureaucratic changes, the Narendra Modi government is set to embark on a series of economic reforms aimed at putting the country on track for 8% growth in the intermediate term and an even faster pace beyond that.
This will include ironing out the kinks in land acquisition, implementing the longawaited goods & services tax (GST), rapidly modernising the railway system to its fullest potential and fixing the seriously flawed agricultural produce marketing system. And where it sees the need for drastic, immediate change, the government won't be averse to taking the ordinance route, particularly with respect to the land acquisition law, seen as one of the biggest stumbling blocks to infrastructure development in the country.
The administration is well-placed to kick off its programme in the winter session of Parliament, when key economic Bills are expected to be introduced.
"Plate is full... focus areas are clear," said a senior government official. "All energies of the government will be directed towards this." A two-pronged approach to the reforms process will be followed — focusing on pushing key legislation and removing obstacles to procedures on the ground to improve governance, thereby lifting the curbs on growth and attracting greater levels of investment.
The government believed previously that changes in rules could help fix the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, that was moved by the UPA government, but it now believes an amendment will be needed. The law has stalled land acquisition because of the cumbersome procedures prescribed. The states have widely opposed it and the government is counting on that to get amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, where it doesn't have a majority. In case this proves difficult, the government may move an ordinance.
With Finance Minister Arun Jaitley shouldering a lighter administrative load after the reshuffle, negotiations on GST and talks with the Opposition on passing the insurance Bill to raise the foreign direct investment cap to 49% in the winter session will gather pace.
The government has already undertaken some big-ticket measures in the form of diesel price deregulation and an ordinance to sort out coal allocation. It is also expected to bite the bullet on rationalising other subsidies, including fertiliser, LPG and food, at the opportune time. The coal sector is expected to get a shakeup with a set of measures lined up.
Reforms in marketing and handling of farm produce through restructuring of the Food Corporation of India and changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act are expected to get a renewed push. In the light of court orders pertaining to coal mines and telecom spectrum, a cleanup of the allocation of natural resources by putting in place an e-auction system is being contemplated.
Road and railway projects are ready to be picked up by investors, which should help connect rural areas. This will also tie into the Digital India project to make sure more Indians get access to the Internet. People involved in the railway plan say the government is talking to unions to take them on board before selectively bringing in the private sector in areas such as running premium high-profit trains that can cross-subsidise general travel. The emphasis on rail has another dimension — its people connect.
Better trains, cleaner stations and baggage-handling facilities are in for special attention. Unlike other sectors, railways can absorb a great deal of investment without running into land or environment issues. On Sunday, Modi appointed trusted associate Suresh Prabhu as railway minister, seen as a statement of intent that it's of high priority for the prime minister .
"A lot is happening and the effect would be visible only in some time," said a senior government official. Economists said several steps are on the anvil but the effects will take a while to percolate through. "A number of things are happening and all of them will result in increase in efficiency in the economy. But how much quantum will this add to growth is difficult to say," said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
Handpicked officials have been placed in key ministries and the new ministers there could be much more visible than before. "Policy paralysis has been arrested," Joshi said. "They seem to be on the right track... From now till next budget we should watch for some big-ticket moves." Overall business sentiment that had soured in the past three years has turned around with the new government at the helm but investments are yet to pick up. Growth expanded by 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the fastest in two years, but revival is yet to take definitive hold.

UP Gov approves Usmanis name for CICPrint
Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:47 am
Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik Monday approved the name of former chief secretary and serving IAS officer Jawed Usmani for appointment as next Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), five days after he had returned returned the file for the same asking the state government to submit vigilance clearance.
The vigilance report was sent to Raj Bhawan Friday. The Governor, who had sought clearance from Central Vigilance Commission as well, took the opinion of legal experts before clearing Usmani’s name and sent the file for further action by the department concerned.
With Governor clearing his name, Usmani, a 1978-batch officer, would have to take voluntary retirement from service before taking charge as CIC. As per the rules laid for appointment of CIC, no one serving on any post in the government can take up charge of the post. Usmani, 58, is due to retire in January 2016.
“I will apply for the voluntary retirement after government notification,” Usmani said speaking to The Indian Express.

Three held for bomb hoax SMS to Bangalore airportPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:45 am
Police have arrested three persons from Channapatna town, nearly 60 km from Bangalore, after they allegedly sent a bomb hoax SMS to an official of Bangalore airport on Sunday.
The trio were arrested after the SIM card used to send the message was tracked. The SMS was sent to a terminal manager of the airport at 9.30pm Saturday, said police. It said a bomb was planted in an aircraft bound to fly at 11.30am Sunday.
The accused have been identified as Shivananda his cousin Ningegowda and a mobile shop owner Yogesh. Investigations have revealed that the SIM bought in Shivananda’s name was used by Ningegowda to send the SMS.
Shivananda initially told the police that he had not sent any threat SMSes. Police then tracked the sale of the SIM card to Yogesh’s store and learned that Ningegowda bought the SIM in his cousin’s name.
Police also said that Shivananda was changing his story. First, he claimed Ningegowda sent the SMS to frame him. Then, he said his cousin was a contractor whose bills were not cleared by the CEO of the Ramanagara Zilla Panchayat. The CEO was scheduled to leave for an official trip on Sunday and Shivananda said he sent the SMS on his cousins’s directive to sink the CEO’s trip, said police.

Gujarat compulsory vote law: EC Brahma asks  will you jail all those who dontPrint
In the general elections held six months ago, only 55.38 crore out of the 83.41 crore registered voters cast their votes — which means some 28 crore stayed away from polling stations.
Written by Maneesh Chhibber | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:24 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 8:14 am
Election Commissioner H S Brahma told The Indian Express on Monday that in his view, the Gujarat government’s move to make voting compulsory in elections to local bodies “may not be correct”.
Several legal experts questioned the constitutionality and workability of the law that was blocked by former Gujarat governor Kamla Beniwal for several years before it was cleared by Governor O P Kohli recently, and was notified in the state gazette on November 5.
Rules under the amended law are, however, yet to be framed, and the penalty for not voting is still to be notified.
“While the Election Commission doesn’t have a concrete view since these amendments pertain only to local body elections in the state of Gujarat, my own view is that such a provision may not be correct,” Brahma said.
“Let me ask you, what if we have a similar law at the Centre, and out of 83 crore-plus voters, 10 per cent choose not to vote? Will you put eight crore voters in jail or impose fines on them? Do we have jails to accommodate eight crore voters?” Brahma asked.
In the general elections held six months ago, only 55.38 crore out of the 83.41 crore registered voters cast their votes — which means some 28 crore stayed away from polling stations.
Former solicitor general of India Mohan Parasaran said the Gujarat law was “too much”, and may be stopped by the courts. “Democracy is all about choices. While in an ideal situation, every citizen should vote, to force people to vote is too much. I feel the Gujarat law may not stand the test of judicial scrutiny,” Parasaran said.
A senior Election Commission official told The Indian Express that the EC’s view on making voting compulsory, as sought in a PIL pending in the Supreme Court, was being firmed up. The court had in August sought responses of the Centre and the EC on a PIL seeking mandatory voting so that results were not skewed by low voter turnouts.
“But, we feel forcible voting is against the Constitution,” the official said. “Right to vote is a statutory provision, and compelling (voters) may not work. The basic feature of our electoral system is free and fair elections. Compulsory voting is not free. You can’t herd people into polling booths and make them vote,” the official said.
He disclosed that even in earlier discussions with the Law Commission on this matter, the EC had opposed any move to make voting compulsory.
Jagdeep S Chhokar, founder-trustee of the non-partisan Association for Democratic Reforms, said governments should perhaps make voting compulsory for lawmakers before imposing it on the people.
“Our parliamentarians are allowed the choice of abstaining during voting inside the House. Why doesn’t the government first make it compulsory for MPs to vote and then continued…

Hindalco Case: CBI says it has dirt on officials  private partiesPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:17 am
Contradicting its earlier stand, the CBI told the special court on Monday that there is “prima facie” material against “private parties” and “some government officials” to take cognizance of offences in the case related to the allocation of Talabira II coal blocks in Orissa to Hindalco, owned by the Kumar Mangalam Birla group.
This comes less than a month after the CBI filed a “detailed and comprehensive” closure report in the case on October 21.
Special Public Prosecutor R S Cheema told Special Judge Bharat Parashar on Monday that prima facie, there is enough material on record to take cognizance of various offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC, against private parties and “some” public servants. He, however, did not directly name former Coal Secretary P C Parakh, who is one of the main accused in the case.
When contacted, Parakh told The Indian Express: “I don’t know what evidence they are talking about. The CBI spent one full year in investigating the case, I don’t know what fresh evidence they have.”
During the court proceedings today, the judge asked Cheema if the CBI was ready with the relevant documents. Cheema replied that some further investigations were required. The court is set to take up the matter on November 25.
On October 21, the CBI filed a revised final closure report after the court pulled up the agency over the “missing documents” in the case.
On September 12, the court had asked the CBI to file the “relevant documents” after the investigating officer failed to submit the primary evidence containing the original minutes of the screening committee meetings in the case.

Options running out  Shiv Sena stakes claim for Leader of Oppostion in MaharashtraPrint

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that his party would stake claim to the post of Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly, but maintained that they were still open to talks with the BJP.
“We have submitted a letter staking claim to the post of Leader of Opposition. In today’s scenario, no one has faith in each other. The Congress has already staked claim to the post. If we wait any longer, we will be neither here, nor there. However, we can still have discussions with the BJP. If the alliance with BJP has to happen, it will, else we will sit in the opposition,” Thackeray said at a function held at Rangsharda in suburban Mumbai.
He added, “My patience should not be seen as a sign of helplessness. The power of those who are speaking against Hindus is growing and we do not want the forces of Hindutva to get divided.”
Senior Sena leaders Diwakar Raote, Ramdas Kadam and Eknath Shinde submitted a letter to the Principal Secretary of the state legislature to stake claim to the post.
Earlier in the day, Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said, “The talks that were being held between Uddhav saheb and Amit Shah have stopped. We are going to play the role of the opposition.”
With its relationship with the BJP deteriorating, Sena sought to take a more hardline Hindutva approach. Referring to the NCP’s offer for support, Thackeray asked the BJP whether it wanted to take help from those who supported terror and had paid money to the family of Ishrat Jahan. After Minority Affairs Minister Eknath Khadse announced that there will be an option to study Urdu in Marathi schools run by the state, Sena legislators tried to present him with a green skull cap.
Meanwhile, insiders suggested that the Sena’s flip-flops inside the Assembly and outside were a result of a divide within the party ranks, with several MLAs still urging Thackeray not to take an extreme stand against the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in the state.
Though Sena’s MLAs occupied opposition benches in the Assembly on Monday morning, the discomfort was visible on their faces.
A Sena MLA said on condition of anonymity, “It is strange that being the second largest party, we are in the opposition. We should have played our cards carefully to bring BJP to the negotiating table to form the government.”
In another indication that the Sena is still hopeful of a reconciliation, Uddhav seems to have decided not to pull out his nominee in the Modi Government, Anant Geete, just yet.
“No, no, I am not resigning,” Geete, Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, said when asked by The Indian Express if he planned to quit. “I will continue as a member of continued…

Singhvi in tax soup: officials reject his claim that termites ate vouchers  slap Rs 56-crore penaltyPrint
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi (Source: PTI)
Written by Ritu Sarin , Appu Esthose Suresh | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:07 am | Updated: November 12, 2014 8:19 pm
Multiplying Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi’s Income Tax problems, the Settlement Commission has added over Rs 91.95 crore to his declared professional income over a three-year period and slapped a penalty of Rs 56.67 crore. The order has since been stayed. He had moved the Commission on his own but a probe was launched subsequently, prompting him to describe the proceedings as a “cat and mouse game” which “trapped” him.
Citing inability to furnish documentary proof to back his expenses claim, Singhvi had told the Commission that a termite attack on the premises of his chartered accountant in December 2012 had destroyed all records and expense vouchers, documents.
The Income Tax department and the Commission also contested Singhvi’s claim that he purchased laptops worth Rs 5 crore for members of his staff over three financial years and was, therefore, entitled to 30 per cent depreciation.
As first reported first by The Indian Express, Singhvi approached the Commission last year, seeking immunity from penalty and prosecution which has since been denied to him on some counts.
Singhvi moved the Jodhpur High Court which stayed a 103-page Commission order passed on September 11 this year.
“I have been the highest tax-payer among lawyers. Even in this case, the entire income was received by cheque, so were the expenses. So it is a case of over-expenditure and the department not agreeing to it. I went to the Settlement Commission suo motu before any survey or investigation started since I could not back up my claim due to destruction of records, and the loss of which I had reported to police before the I-T probe even began,” Singhvi told The Indian Express.
The Singhvi tax case saw the Commission launching a full-fledged investigation into the expenses shown by the assessee. This is what the Commission highlighted:
> The sum has been added to Singhvi’s professional taxable income since he took the plea that a termite attack on the premises of his chartered accountant in December 2012 destroyed all his records and expense vouchers/documents. This was not accepted by the Income Tax Department (ITD) and the Commission.
> The Commission’s September order noted that since Singhvi’s salary sheet had shown that he had employed 14 advocates/professionals to assist him, he would have had to purchase 1,250 laptops (each costing Rs 40,000) to account for the amount under that head.
> The Commission also probed Singhvi’s claim that he spent Rs 35.98 crore on purchase of solar panels for his company, Rishab Enterprises. It declared that the transaction was “mainly intended at tax evasion by inflating the cost of the panels”. Of Rs 25.16 crore said to have been paid by Singhvi, the company concerned admitted it received only Rs 21.39 crore. The owner of the company which sold the solar panels, and whose premises were searched by the ITD, gave a statement admitting that the cost was “inflated” and that Rs 10 crore was to be repaid to Singhvi in the form of a loan to his sons.
Incidentally, the Commission also challenged Singhvi’s original contention — made at the first stage of his assessment — that the net income he earned from his legal practice was in the range of 55 per cent. The order noted the Income Tax contention that other equally senior Supreme Court lawyers had informed the tax department that their net income ranged between 90 per cent and 95 per cent.
The Commission also referred to the earlier probe by ITD in which several cheque payments made by Singhvi — to the tune of Rs 10.97 crore in the same three-year period — were found to be “non verifiable”. Reason: When inquiry letters were sent to 91 parties, 37 were returned.
Following the Commission order, Singhvi approached the Jodhpur High Court which granted a stay. In his writ petition, he reiterated the stand he had taken before the tax authorities: “The record of the petitioner had been destroyed on account of termite attack and could not have established existing claims by bringing on record documentary evidence.”
He said the loss of documents due to termite attack was reported to police on December 13, 2012. While contesting the I-T view, Singhvi’s petition stated: “There is absolutely no finding of the commission to the effect that termite attack, consequent destruction of records or the police report in that regard is false, misleading, lack authenticity or is legally unsustainable.”
Singhvi alleged that he had been “trapped” in a “cat and mouse game” and argued that the Commission did not have the jurisdiction to impose penalty on him. “No authority and power has been however been granted to the Settlement Commission in way of the provisions of Chapter XIX-A of the Act to impose and /or direct imposition of penalty under the provisions,” petition stated.
On the issue of the solar power company, Singhvi’s writ petition said: “No report could be furnished after 12 January 2014 being the expiry of the statutory period of 90 days for furnishing the report… DIT (Director, Income Tax investigation) Mumbai had no locus in the present proceeding… DIT Mumbai referred to ex parte enquiry conducted at Mumbai and is not tenable since the said statement was recorded under section 131 of the Act.”

4 women dead  20 critical after sterilisation camp in Ministers districtA woman being taken to hospital on Monday. (Source: Express photo)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:54 am
Two days after 83 women opted for laparoscopic tubectomies at a family planning camp organised by the Chhattisgarh government in Bilaspur, four women died on Monday while at least 20 more are reported to be in a serious condition.
The office of Bilaspur Chief Medical Officer R K Bhange told The Indian Express that senior surgeon Dr R K Gupta and his assistant conducted all the operations in five hours. Bhange, however, ruled out negligence. “There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe,” he said.
The camp was held in Pendari area of Takhatpur in Bilaspur, the home district of Health Minister Amar Agarwal, on Saturday.
“Eighty-three women underwent the operation, 25 are in hospital and some are very serious… We have already ordered a probe and the post-mortem reports are expected tomorrow,” said Agarwal. The state government has announced a relief of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of those dead, and Rs 50,000 for those critical.
According to reports, the women — all residents of neighbouring villages and most of them from BPL families — were discharged soon after their surgery on Saturday. But as their condition deteriorated, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital on Monday, where four of them died — three have been identified as Janaki Bai Suryvanshi, Dipti Yadav and Rekha Nirmalkar, all under 30 years.
The camp was organised as part of the central government’s family planning programme under which a woman gets Rs 1,400 for undergoing the operation, and the health worker who brings them gets Rs 200 for each woman.
The Congress accused the state government of negligence in a bid to meet the central government’s targets. A three-member panel has been set up to probe the incident.

Infrastructure companies in hunt for women directors to meet Sebi stipulation
Rachita Prasad, ET Bureau Nov 11, 2014, 06.03AM IST

Director
(“Companies are looking…)
MUMBAI: Several infrastructure companies, including blue-chips like Larsen & Toubro, are scouting for a lady independent director to meet Sebi stipulation as they do not have women on top positions who can be elevated as directors.
In an attempt to encourage diversity, the Securities & Exchange Boardof India has made it mandatory for all listed companies to have at least one woman director. The regulator had extended the deadline for this to April 1, 2015, from October 1, 2014, as many companies were unable to comply with this requirement.
Meeting this norm was tougher for infrastructure developers, power, port and roads companies since many of them did not have women on board, and due to the very nature of the industry, they did not have women in leadership positions who could have been elevated to join the board. "We see the mandatory requirement of at least one lady director on the board as progressive, as it sends out a strong message in the organisation about our commitment to gender diversity," said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer, Larsen&Toubro.
"There is a dearth of senior lady employees in the infrastructure sector. Talent development in an engineering and construction company often begins with roles at remote construction sites, but it isn't easy to find female employees able to accept such roles. On the other hand, there are large numbers of lady employees in our engineering-design centres, and are valuable assets in such roles,"headded. Prompted by the Sebi norm, India's largest private company Reliance Industries got its first woman director by inducting Nita Ambani , wife of chairman Mukesh Ambani, earlier this year. While some infrastructure companies have already appointed woman directors, companies like L&T, Adani Power, AdaniPorts, SimplexInfrastructure, among others, are still looking.
"There are not many women with backgroundin infrastructure,but it is not necessary that all director shave the same domain knowledge. We wanted someone who brings a unique attribute that can help us. Nirupama Rao has good understanding of country risks and challenges and it will help us in international business," said Ramesh Chandak, managing directorandCEOof KECInternational.
RPG Group's flagship infrastructure company KEC International recently appointed Rao, a former bureaucrat who was ambassador to China and the US and also served as the Foreign Secretary of India from2009 to 2011.
"There's a lack of women in leadership positionsincoresectorsaswellasinmanufacturing. Right now, companies are looking for women directors only to meet regulatory requirements and this does notchange the trendbut it isamovein the right direction," said K Sudarshan, managing director, EMA Partners International, anexecutive search firm.
"Companies are looking for women from different fields but preferably someone they have had an association with in the pastandhave comfort with," he said.

Driving for safe futureUpdated: November 10, 2014 08:49 IST
Driving for safe future
Reuters A representative image of a crash test.
TOPICS
road safety
Should affordability be at the cost of safety?
Last week, one of the 26 NGOs that have partnered with UN Road Safety Collaboration, an informal consultative mechanism for road safety efforts, attracted media attention in India through its recent “findings” on India-built small cars.
UK-based Global NCAP (GNCAP) said that it conducted crash-tests on Maruti Swift and Nissan’s Datsun GO and the results revealed that their weak structures and lack of airbags made them unsafe. This was the second round of crash tests conducted by it on India-built cars in 2014. It had conducted such tests on Maruti Alto, Tata Nano, Hyundai i10, Ford Figo and Volkswagen Polo. All these cars received zero-star rating for adult protection. But Volkswagen withdrew its non-airbag Polo model and introduced dual frontal airbags. This model received four star safety rating by GNCAP.
The UN has declared a Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020), which aims to reduce by 50 per cent the forecast number of road fatalities by 2020. One of its key aims is to encourage the development of NCAPs (New Car Assessment Programmes) in emerging markets, which rate the cars with stars awarded based on occupant protection scores. GNCAP is supporting those efforts and carries out such crash-tests.
Stringent standards
While GNCAP neither has the authority nor the jurisdiction to demand recall of any car model, its crash-tests and revelations are expected to spark debates and accelerate initiatives on vehicle safety in the country. The NGO applies a 5-star system, which are more stringent than legislative tests, for safety rating of vehicles. This is similar to what JD Power does in terms of rating of consumer satisfaction.
“The UN has established minimum regulatory standards for front and side impact crash test standards which we would encourage India to adopt. The UN frontal impact test is carried out at 56 km/h whereas NCAP tests (for consumer information) usually use a higher speed of 64 km/h. The higher speed ensures that the impact replicates crashes which commonly result in fatal injury. There are nine NCAP tests and eight of them use the same test format and speed as we have done in India,” David Ward, Secretary General of Global NCAP told The Hindu.
Interestingly, crash-tests have been conducted by GNCAP only on entry-level models that account for a good share of sales. So far, entry-level models sold in India do not come with airbags and other safety features; those with these features come at a premium. These base models meet Indian safety regulations, but do not go beyond.
Vehicle manufacturers don’t claim that these vehicles meet the 5-star requirements of NCAP. This is because it is expected that base model vehicles would not pass any tests which are higher than those demanded by the Indian safety regulations as they are meant for the Indian mass market, which is highly price conscious. Carmakers and industry body SIAM have defended their position and said they are complying with Indian norms, which may be right.
Not expensive…
There is no Indian law that requires its passenger vehicles to meet the United Nation’s minimum crash test standards. The country doesn’t have a New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which provides crash-tests information, either. “At the best of our knowledge crash standards have been formulated for full frontal, off frontal and as well as side crash. Bureau of Indian Standards is working to convert these standards in Indian format. These are basically derived from European regulations,” says Abhay Damle, Director, Central Institute of Road Transport.
However, GNCAP feels that it is possible to offer low cost models that are able to pass the minimum UN crash test. “In our recent tests, for example, we were able to compare the performance of the Maruti Suzuki Swift both with and without air bags. The car with airbags scored three stars which is a performance that exceeds the UN regulatory test. Without air bags the car would fail the UN test and has a high risk of life threatening injury.
“In contrast the Datsun Go has such a weak body shell that it would not pass the UN crash test and there is no point in fitting air bags at all,” said Mr. Ward.
India, as an evolving economy, needs affordable entry-level models so that the vulnerable road users (cyclists, two-wheeler users, etc) can gradually upgrade to safer mode of transport. Though Tata Nano or Maruti Alto received poor rating after crash-tests, these two affordable models have definitely helped vulnerable segment to upgrade.
Of course, the cost of the vehicles will go up on introduction of frontal crash tests as it would require development of reinforced structure and use of air bags etc. The cost rise could be in the range of Rs.30,000 per vehicle. Such increase in the present conditions would definitely impact the migration of the two-wheeler users to cars, as the entry-level is very price sensitive. But should affordability be at the cost of safety?
Holistic view needed
In contrast to entry-level models, most big cars made in India conform to safety features higher than that required by the Indian safety regulations. “We need to take a holistic view if we really want to reduce the fatalities by improving all types of vehicles running on the roads through lane allocation and driving, improving road infrastructure and strict enforcement, among others. Vehicle technology is only one part, and this has to be seen along with the other factors that influence road safety,” says Vishnu Mathur, Director General of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Mr. Damle asserts that most of our standards are at par with international regulations and in respect of remaining we are verge of adopting international norms. While admitting that fatalities on Indian roads are much higher than the comparable peers, he points out that better certification and testing process alone won’t do good, but we need to understand as to how many fatalities are due to head-on collisions and other factors such as road condition, driver behaviours, traffic conditions, enforcement and overloading, among others.
“Over the last decade, significant advancements have been made in improving safety features in cars. Seat belts have been made mandatory, side crash test is mandatory, standards for lighting, mirrors have been hugely upgraded to meet UN standards, advanced braking systems including ABS has been mandated in some category of vehicles, new safety codes for construction of truck and bus bodies have been finalised, under-run protection devices have been made mandatory for commercial vehicles. ,” Mr. Mathur adds.
India is also in the process of introducing the frontal crash regulations which is linked with the upcoming test facilities being set up at Pune, Manesar and Chennai. Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Programme is also being worked out by the government. The off-set frontal crash regulations will be implemented after the test facilities are ready by 2015. A lead time has been worked out for implementing the same as the industry would require time for development of the vehicles and certification.
Mr. Ward is of the view that although India has many distinct characteristics, its road safety challenges are not unique. The laws of physics and the typical mechanisms of injury are the same around the world. Also, the automobile industry is globalising very fast and vehicle designs are shared across markets. That is why it is important to ensure that UN minimum safety standards are applied by all the major car producers. The government needs to strike a right balance between safety concerns in entry models and affordable mobility solutions for the masses. India needs to evolve a holistic approach that addresses road infrastructure, technology, design and materials, enforcement of rules, and the consumer behaviour through aggressive awareness campaigns. Maybe, making airbags mandatory could be the beginning in India’s journey towards a safer regime.

Design for Every Day: Lessons on a Factory Floorreddit
It's 3:45 am. I place a bag filled with books, files and my laptop over the handle of my suitcase. I do the delicate dance of the traveler, pushing and pulling the wheeled box so that nothing drops as the door of my hotel room slams behind me. I get on the elevator, the doors close as exhaustion wafts over me.
Once down in the lobby, I put my game face on to greet my client, Andy, a bear of a man with an easy laugh and engaging intelligence. Andy is one of the few people I have met who works in a corporation and really loves his job. His enthusiasm buoys me at this ungodly hour. We put our bags in the car and head to the Seattle airport to meet the rest of our crew for our 5:30 am flight. The photographer and assistant left even earlier to deal with the 500lbs of photo equipment we were about to check.
Most people think the world of commercial photography is glamorous--multitudes of assistants, catered meals, fantastic wardrobes and beautiful models. Perhaps if you work for Vogue it is, but if you are working as many of us do, in the service of corporate marketing, it's a very different scenario filled with long days, ordinary locations and remarkable people. I've been all over the United States, art directing photo shoots for my client, a company that creates retirement plans. My client specializes in providing financial services for the non-profit sector, so the people that I meet, their clients, are often trying to solve some of society's most intransigent problems. None of the settings we see ever start out as photo worthy--John, the photographer and I have worked together for years and our challenge and our strength is to make an unexceptional place look extraordinary.
Today, we are leaving Seattle for Wichita, a trip that will take eight hours with a connection in Denver. After the flights we gather all the equipment and drive to Envision--a company that provides employment and resources for the blind and visually impaired--we are visiting their manufacturing facility. Our goal today is to scout and plan our shoot for tomorrow.
As I walk through the factory with our host, Shamain, our conversation is marked by the sound of machinery with metal hitting against metal -- only the presence of guide dogs and dark glasses on some of the workers belie the company mission. Most of us rarely think about what it might be like to live without sight -- I certainly don't. Did you know there is a 70 pecent unemployment rate among people with visual impairments?
I begin to think about all of the small details of daily life--how do you get to work? I only saw highways around here. When I ask this question, Shamain, smiles and says to me, "That is an issue. Our CEO is going to be on local television this evening to discuss the sales tax referendum -- you probably saw the billboards when you were driving over." She goes on to tell me there is an effort to increase the local sales tax by one percent to fund public transportation . It comes up for a vote on Election Day. "Our employees are dependent upon public transportation, and we see this as an important issue." Obviously, if you have a visual impairment, you can't drive. She starts to explain to me the challenges of a life without sight. Grocery shopping, a doctor's visit, simple errands--you can't dash out for a carton of milk. Every activity must be carefully planned.
The next morning, while we are working on the shoot, one of our subjects tells us about his little girl and the costume that she planned for Halloween. After he leaves the room, someone says, "I never expected him to have a family. I'm horrified that I am so narrow-minded." Our crew's conversation shifted from lighting and composition to the people we were meeting. We talked about how self-absorbed our society is. We take so much for granted. It's such a common practice to view those with problems as people who must have 'done something' to bring it on themselves--as if they are responsible for their handicaps. We dismiss the randomness of fate as a factor in life. And yet, when we meet individuals who face unimaginable challenges with dignity, they become real and we see their humanity.
We finished our work, packed our equipment and prepared to return to our lives in New York --each of us feeling admiration and a bit of awe for the people we met. I followed the election results this week--not Washington but Wichita. The sales tax increase was defeated 62 percent to 37 percent. Indifference can be so cruel.

Health Insurers (and Their Shareholders) Win Midterm Election!reddit
Republicans weren't the only big winners in last Tuesday's election. So were health insurance companies, many of which spent heavily to influence the outcome.
There are several provisions of the Affordable Care Act that the insurance industry would like the next Congress to change. If insurers get what they want -- and with the GOP in control of both houses of Congress, it's a decent bet they will -- Wall Street will be exuberant indeed.
Just the anticipation of what a Republican-controlled Congress might be able to pull off has put insurance company shareholders in good humor. Within 24 hours of knowing that Mitch McConnell would replace Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader, investors were active buyers of health insurance stock. In fact, the share prices of five of the six largest for-profit health insurers -- Cigna, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealthcare and WellPoint/Anthem -- reached their highest points in a year last Wednesday. Some even reached historic highs. Aetna was the only one that fell short of reaching a 52-week high, but only by pocket change.
Even though there is still chatter about repealing Obamacare, GOP leaders and insurance company executives understand that isn't likely to happen. And they really don't want it to. Insurance firms and their shareholders actually love the billions of dollars in new revenue they're getting as a result of the law's requirement that most of us buy coverage from private insurers. They're pretty confident that the cash will continue to flow, because, even with Republican control of Capitol Hill, the law will not be repealed.
No doubt a full repeal bill will pass in the House, just as previous bills have every year since the GOP took control of that chamber four years ago. But there's almost no chance the Senate version will match the House's action. Republicans still won't have the 60 votes necessary to overcome an almost-certain Democratic filibuster of any bill that would repeal or gut the reform law. Even if they did, President Obama would surely veto it.
But we can expect Republican lawmakers to quickly introduce bills in the new Congress that would strip the law's "root and branch," to use a favorite McConnell phrase. This is part of a skillful game of political chess insurance company executives and lobbyists have played since the beginning of the health reform debate. Despite the fact that they have given more money through their PACs to Republicans than Democrats and have sided with groups that have sought to abolish the law, the insurers have also played Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to their advantage.
While they didn't get all they wanted during the reform debate, they won the major battles. The insurance companies got the White House and Democratic leaders to stifle any real discussion of single payer health care. And they were able to kill the idea of a government-run public option to compete with them.
As a consequence, even with the provisions of the law that protect consumers from insurance company abuses, such as refusing to sell coverage to applicants with pre-existing conditions, insurers have thrived.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased an impressive 160 percent since President Obama signed the reform bill into law on March 23, 2010, the price of the insurers' shares have doubled -- and in some cases even tripled. If you had invested $25,000 in UnitedHealthcare stock in 2010, you would have $78,750 today, a 315 percent return.
But that's not enough for the companies or their shareholders. They figure they can do even better with a few industry-friendly "fixes" to the law. For one thing, they want to get rid of a tax on some health plans that covers some of the cost of the government subsidies to help low-income folks buy insurance. Even though the subsidies go to the insurers, they want to get rid of the tax, and they have the GOP on their side.
They also want to be able to once again sell policies that only cover 50 percent of a person's medical expenses. Not only are Republicans on board to allow that, so are many Democrats.
With Obama in the White House and the GOP in control of Congress, insurers are in the catbird seat. They know the president won't allow the law to be repealed or even altered substantially, which will be good for future profits, and they also know they can count on the Republicans to push through legislation to get rid of the health plan tax and let them sell low-value policies again.
No wonder shareholders are smiling -- all the way to the bank.

Big Foods weird war over the meaning of mayonnaise  Americas top condimentMayonnaise’s identity crisis goes to court. Courtesy of Hampton Creek.
A big-money war is brewing over the meaning of America’s best-selling condiment: mayonnaise.
The maker of Hellmann’s mayo, food giant Unilever, has  sued  the San Francisco start-up behind Just Mayo, an egg-less, mayonnaise-like sandwich spread giving Big Mayo a run for its money.
The global food giant argues that Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo is not, as Unilever lawyers wrote, “exactly, precisely, only and simply mayonnaise,” as defined by the dictionary and the Food and Drug Administration, which says  mayo must include “egg yolk-containing ingredients.”
The Just Mayo identity crisis, Unilever lawyers said, has hurt Hellmann’s market share, “caused consumer deception and serious, irreparable harm to Unilever” and the mayo industry as a whole. The firm wants Hampton Creek to stop calling it Just Mayo, yank the product off store shelves and pay Unilever damages worth three times the startup’s profits.
It is a strangely defensive stance for Unilever, a Big Food titan that made more than $64 billion last year selling foodstuffs in nearly 200 countries (including “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!”, a spread that is not butter). Hellmann’s, which is branded Best Foods west of the Rocky Mountains, dominates 45 percent of the mayo market, data from industry researcher Euromonitor shows.
But market watchers say it highlights the fears from traditional food conglomerates facing unexpected competition from crafty start-ups. It’s perhaps no coincidence that the biggest battleground is mayonnaise: Americans buy $2 billion  of the stuff every year — more even than ketchup, salsa or soy sauce.
“It’s not about using the (mayo) word,” said Michele Simon, a public health attorney who  wrote  about the suit. “It’s about the fact that this company is taking market share away. And now it’s like they’ve awakened the giant.”
That the plant-based Just Mayo is a new type of food will lend an interesting dimension to the legal proceedings: Brand disputes typically quibble over words, not the definition of the product itself.
But the very modern legal battle will be fought on regulatory territory that is decades old. The FDA’s definition of mayonnaise was set in  1957 , decades before the phrase “vegan mayo” ever made sense. (Maintaining that “standard of identity” is important: Kraft Foods’ Miracle Whip, which doesn’t meet the FDA’s standard, is technically a salad dressing.)
Unilever doesn’t just call out Just Mayo for what it calls confusing branding — advertisements have called the stuff “mayo,” and its logo resembles an egg — it also says the company has no proof in its claims of beating Hellmann’s in a taste test.
So what’s spooking Big Food? Hampton Creek has some big backers, including Bill Gates, and in a matter of months has spread rapidly to more than 20,000 Walmarts, Costcos and other stores across the country.
While other organic spreads like Vegenaise play up their place in the vegan niche, Hampton Creek has widely promoted Just Mayo as a mainstream brand: healthy, cheap and good for everybody. (Company ads rarely call it “vegan.”)
“We don’t market our product to tree-hugging liberals in San Francisco, even though I’m in the middle of nine of them right now,” said Josh Tetrick, Hampton Creek’s founder and chief executive. “We built the company to try to really penetrate the places where better-for-you food hasn’t gone before, and that means right in the condiment aisle of Walmart.”
The fate of Just Mayo, which swapped out eggs for Canadian yellow peas, will be watched closely by other food conglomerates. Hampton Creek also sells Just Cookies, a line of egg- and milk-free cookie dough, and is working on a gooey egg-free mix, Just Scramble.
The suit comes at a touchy time for Unilever, which just launched an ad campaign promoting itself as devoted to sustainability, and which backed its own soy-based egg alternative, Alleggra Foods, nearly ten years ago.
“Our concern here is not about innovation, it is about misleading labelling,” a Unilever spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “We simply wish to protect both consumers from being misled and also our brand.”
Just Mayo has fought back with the help of celebrity chefs including Andrew Zimmern, who launched a petition , “Stop Bullying Sustainable Food Companies,” that has more than 11,000 signers. The firm tweeted  Unilever’s chief executive’s own words against him (he called for “transformational innovation”) and was less than subtle on its Facebook  about its David-vs.-Goliath status (though the illustration has since been deleted):
Tetrick, the start-up’s chief executive, said his firm is looking at the lawsuit as a chance to not just expand their corporate profile, but to lift up their egg-free sandwich spread as the touchpoint for a larger food-based cultural movement.
“A lawsuit gives us the opportunity to talk about the things that matter,” he said. “So we’ll take it.”

New York doctor cleared of Ebola  which means there are no known Ebola cases in the U.S.By Mark Berman November 10 Follow @markberman
NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at Bellevue Hospital Tuesday regarding the release of New York's Ebola patient Craig Spencer. The doctor has been declared free of Ebola, which means there are no known cases of the virus in U.S. anymore. (YouTube/NYC Mayor's Office)
The doctor who contracted Ebola in West Africa before returning to New York City has been declared free of the virus, hospital officials announced Monday. This news means that 41 days after the first Ebola diagnosis in the United States, there are no known cases of the virus in the country.
Craig Spencer, 33, who had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea, was diagnosed with Ebola on Oct. 23. Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City, where Spencer was being treated, confirmed in a statement Monday that he “has been declared free of the virus.” Spencer will be discharged on Tuesday, according to the hospital. [UPDATE: He was released Tuesday morning , an occasion marked with lots of hugs.]
Spencer’s diagnosis created concerns in New York, as the news of his illness was followed by the revelation that he visited a popular restaurant and coffee shop, rode multiple subway lines and went to a bowling alley and bar in Brooklyn. As city officials preached caution and calm, “disease detectives” fanned out to visit the places Spencer had gone and visit the people with whom he had interacted.
After returning to New York, Spencer had been self-monitoring and taking his temperature. He reported a fever of 100.3 degrees on Oct. 23, two days after he began feeling sluggish, and was taken to the hospital and isolated. He was the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the only one of this group to contract the disease after treating patients overseas. (Other people responding to the epidemic in West Africa have been diagnosed and brought back to the country for treatment.)
His diagnosis also sparked a panic among authorities, as the governors of New York and New Jersey hurriedly announced  that they would quarantine any medical workers returning from West Africa, a highly-criticized move that went against the advice of public-health officials. This drama spilled up the East Coast, as a nurse who had treated patients in West Africa (and had no symptoms of Ebola) was quarantined in New Jersey and had a prolonged confrontation with authorities in Maine over her treatment.
The first person diagnosed in this country , Thomas Duncan, was a Liberian man who contracted it before flying to Texas in September; two nurses who treated Duncan were infected during his hospitalization. Duncan died eight days after he was diagnosed, becoming the only person to die from Ebola in the United States, while the Texas nurses who contracted Ebola were  both treated and declared safe . The news that Spencer was cleared came three days after the last person being monitored for Ebola in Texas was also cleared , ending the Ebola saga there.
More than 350 people were being actively monitored by the New York City health department for Ebola as of last week, the department said in a statement. Most of these people had traveled to New York City from Liberia, Guinea or the Sierra Leone, but that number also included Bellevue staff members treating Spencer and lab workers who took his blood.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that people should be reassured by the fact that tried-and-true approaches, such as contact-tracing and active monitoring, have helped to prevent broader transmission of the disease in the United States.
“In fact, it has worked,” he said, noting that contacts of patients in Dallas have all been cleared and that people who interacted with Spencer so far appear healthy.
“That doesn’t mean we are not going to see another case; it’s possible we will,” he said. “[But] I think we are pretty well prepared.”

PM Modi s cabinet expansion guided by work  allies | Coalition: Nos only  article of faithPM Narendra Modi's cabinet expansion guided by work, allies and caste balance
Nov 11, 2014, 06.37AM IST
Tags:
(The PM has chosen to keep…)
By Neerja Chowdhury
There are four clear messages emanating from the Sunday cabinet expansion undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first is an obvious one, the requirements of governance when more hands were needed on deck to man the important ministries which were being held by 7 or 8 people, and their workload was becoming too heavy to manage. Hence Manohar Parikkar and Suresh Prabhu, and they are leaders who have a clean image, who the PM trusts and enjoys a rapport with, and who are known to have administrative experience.
Six months into power, Narendra Modi has successfully managed to maintain a momentum, winning an endorsement even in state elections, of Maharashtra and Haryana. But he needs talent to translate his promises into results that people will demand to see very soon. Here Modi is working under constraints of not having enough people in the party who combine talent and experience and this too comes through the expansion exercise. The PM cannot bring people from outside because of the party's inability at this stage to ensure their election to the Rajya Sabha, which it may be able to do at a later stage, when it wins states, and vacancies occur.
The second is a political consideration— and this has taken into account the specifics of caste and community which cannot be sniffed away in the politics of Gangaland, no matter what the rhetoric. The idea is to buttress the party's efforts to wrest the big states of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh which go to the polls in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, without which the Modi agenda will remain incomplete.
So Bihar MPs like Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Giriraj Singh, Ram Kirpal Yadav have been inducted, in addition to the five already in the ministry from the state. So also from UP, it is Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, ostensibly to give a suitable signal to the minorities, though Naqvi is a Shia leader and he has only been made an MOS (which he was also in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government). Dr Mahesh Sharma, a first time MP also from UP, has however been given Independent charge, coming as he does under the coveted "technocrat" category. There are also saffron clad Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and Ram Shankar Katehriya, a dalit, made MOSs. As it is there were a whopping 9 ministers from UP already in the Modi government .
With a slump in Mayawati's fortunes in UP, dalits are clearly—and particularly-- on Modi's radar screen keeping in mind the state elections in the next two and a half years. The induction of Vijay Sampla, also a dalit from Punjab, goes to reinforce the "woo-dalit" plan of the party to neutralise the BJP's upper caste image. Punjab, where elections are due in 2017, has 30 % dalit voters, and here to the BJP may keep its options open on continuing the alliance with the Akali Dal. Sampla's entry is a snub to Akali Dal which had hoped for another minister this time round.
Given the good showing of BJP in West Bengal, Babul Supriyo's inclusion as MOS is also a signal to Mamata Bannerji's state of a resurgent BJP on the horizon, and the party's attempt is obviously going to be to push out the Left from the number two position. Supriyo has been known for his extraordinary connect with people through his singing.
Modi seems to have tried to zero in on those who had excelled in their respective fields Like Supriyo. Or Olympian shooter Col Rajyavardene RathoreThe decision to induct Rathore and Sanwarlal Jat from Rajasthan is being seen as bad news for Vasundhara Raje Scindia, for the CM had put her weight behind the inclusion of Col Sonaram Chaudhary, a Jat who she had fielded against Jaswant Singh in Barmer, and her son Dushyant Singh, who is the seniormost MP from Rajasthan today. All the 24 other BJP MPs who won from Rajasthan were either former MLAs or first time MPs.
The third message coming through the expansion is also clear—that the PM is now in the process of shaping what will be his own team, bringing in first timers, and those he has a rapport with like Parikkar and Prabhu. Their inclusion may alter the power balance at the top echelons of Government, including the apex Cabinet Committee on Security.
Fourth, Modi has given an unmistakeable message to the BJP's allies—that alliances will be on his own terms in a situation which has undergone a sea change, with people having given the party a clear mandate.

Obamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peek At New PricesObamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peek At New Prices
Posted:
reddit
Health insurance consumers using HealthCare.gov will get their first look at the prices for 2015 coverage starting Sunday night, when window shopping goes live on the website, federal officials announced Sunday.
Shoppers won't be able to choose a health plan for 2015 until Nov. 15, when the three-month enrollment period begins. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is providing early access to estimated health insurance premiums and the value of subsidies available to low- and moderate-income households. The window-shopping tool proved to be the most-visited part of HealthCare.gov during the first Obamacare enrollment period, officials said.
HealthCare.gov , which serves insurance consumers in more than 30 states , debuted Oct. 1, 2013, without the ability for people to window shop, which forced users to create accounts and begin applications for coverage before they could view prices. And since the website was barely functional for the first two months of the six-month sign-up period last year, the absence of this tool made it nearly impossible for people to gauge whether they could afford coverage -- and put greater strain on the system -- until the feature was added.
Obamacare officials said they would release an analysis of the health insurance premiums for 2015 later this week.
"We think the news is largely positive," said Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HealthCare.gov and the director of the Center for Consumer and Information and Insurance Oversight within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Independent analyses based on health insurance pricing information made public by state regulators have shown modest average premium increases for Obamacare plans across the nation. According to the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, rates will rise an average of 6 percent in states that have reported 2015 prices. The changes vary greatly, however, so some consumers will see double-digit increases while others will see prices go down if they keep their current coverage. The number of health insurers selling plans on the exchanges also is increasing by about 25 percent .
Consumers will be automatically re-enrolled into the plans they have this year if they are still being sold by their insurance carriers, but Counihan stressed that federal officials want individuals who already have coverage through the exchanges to revisit the website to ensure they're getting the best deal based on the new prices and the subsidies they can receive based on their incomes.
"The majority of our customers will be able to save money by shopping and comparing," Counihan said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. "We are strongly encouraging our customers to return back to HealthCare.gov, update their income and eligibility information, shop and compare, and see if there are better values out there for them."
Next year's prices will be available Sunday night on both HealthCare.gov and CuidadoDeSalud.gov , the Spanish-language portal to the federally run exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchanges and will provide premium information on their own schedules, the federal officials said.
The health insurance exchanges will open on time next Saturday, said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "We've hit all the critical deadlines," he said. "We're not contemplating anything unusual or out of the ordinary, regarding Nov. 15."
The HealthCare.gov team has streamlined the application process most consumers will use, and has completed more than a month of testing to ensure the website functions this time. The website also will be able to serve more users at a time than it did during the first enrollment period.
Officials said it will be easier than it was last year for visitors to HealthCare.gov to access the window-shopping tool and view estimates of the price and benefits of plans available in their local area before this sign-up period.
Shoppers can provide their zip codes, approximate income and information about the make-up of their households to get a look at what's available and what it costs, including the effects of tax credits to reduce premiums, and subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Then users can sort health insurance plans by price and level of benefits, view information on what services are covered or not covered, and see how much they will pay when they receive medical care. When consumers find a plan they may want to purchase during the enrollment period, they can print out or email the information to themselves or save the link to that plan.

Nifty reverses sharply after hitting new highNifty reverses sharply after hitting new high
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 10, 2014 16:23 IST
Finally, the Sensex closed at 27,875 up 6 points, while NSE Nifty closed at 8,344 up 7 points.
 
 
Following a truncated week, the Indian equity market saw some vigour at start as Nifty surged to a new high. The joy was short-lived as banks, oil & gas and capital goods failed to participate in the euphoria. Soon the mood turned sour and indices consolidated for rest of the day as has been the case in the last couple of sessions. Index heavyweights turned sideways, barring ITC, HDFC, Sun Pharma and Hero MotoCorp which helped the market end in positive terrain for the day.
 
Metal space has been the biggest underperformer so far in this current bull run. Even in today's trade, except for JSW Steel, most of the metal stocks closed lower like Jindal Steel & Power (down 4%), Hindalco Industries (down 2.5%), and SAIL (down 0.54%).
 
Commenting on the same, Amar Ambani, Head of Research at IIFL said, "Tata Steel is expected to report strong earnings growth in Q2 FY15 led by higher margins at its European subsidiary. The European subsidiary is expected to report better numbers due to softening prices of iron ore and coking coal. The decline in steel prices has been lower than the decline in raw material prices, leading to higher margins for steel players. We expect the company to report a growth of 15.2% yoy in operating profit to Rs42.6bn in Q2 FY15."
 
Investors turned cautious ahead of the announcement of plethora of macro-economic data. The government will release the IIP for September 2014 and CPI for October on Wednesday. It will also release the WPI data for October 2014 on Friday.
 
Finally, the Sensex closed at 27,875 up 6 points, while NSE Nifty closed at 8,344 up 7 points.
 
BSE Mid-cap closed up 0.14% at 10,013, while BSE Small-cap closed up 0.16% at 11,135.
 
ITC, Power Grid, Bank of Baroda, Sun Pharma, Coal India, HUL and Hero MotoCorp were among the gainers on NSE, whereas Jindal Steel, ONGC, Hindalco, L&T, Axis Bank and Tata Motors were among the losers today.
 
The INDIA VIX was down 1.27% at 13.93. It swung wildly and hit a high of 17.21 and a low of 12.97.
 
Meanwhile, the rupee is trading up 0.19% at Rs. 61.5 against the US dollar.

When It's About Money: Don't just save for your child's education

Many a times parents overlook other goals as they are too busy focusing on just one goal, that is on their child's education. They are too emotionally involved in achieving this particular goal that they forget planning for their retirement and saving for other emergencies.

Entrepreneurs, what's YOUR secret sauce?
Steve Strauss, for USA TODAY 5:13 p.m. EST November 10, 2014
Often it is the secret sauce -- like free wi-fi at a cafe, maybe? -- that will compel an investor to jump on board on your business.

Q: Steve – I am going to make a long story short because I think it is important to share. Having been in business for 20 years, what I have learned is that you have to differentiate yourself somehow from the competition. Everyone today is so obsessed with social media. Blech! Do something different people! -- Erin
A: Let me share a story: One summer about five years ago, when the kids were off at summer camp, my wife and I decided to head down to Mexico for a long weekend. I had read about a cool little fishing village on the coast that sounded idyllic and we wanted to check it out. And so we did.
The place was as nice as advertised, with several great bars and food options, but interestingly, I found myself in the same little restaurante every morning. And we weren't the only ones. The place was always bustling with locals and expats alike.
Why was that? Sure, they had great huevos rancheros, and I love that, but it was also something else.
The restaurant was the only place in town that offered free wi-fi.
Indeed, throughout the town there were flyers for the restaurant that prominently mentioned the free wi-fi factor. People came for the wi-fi and stayed for the food.
That little restaurante figured out what so many of my small business brothers and sisters miss, namely, that if you want to succeed, you have to set yourself apart from the crowd. There was no shortage of bars and restaurants in that sleepy little beach town, and it would have been easy (if a losing proposition) for the owners to compete on price or food or whatever. But they figured out something different, something that set them apart from the rest.
They had a secret sauce.
You remember the old McDonald's commercial , right (I'm dating myself here!):
"Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun."
In business parlance, "secret sauce" has come to mean that thing that you do that is unique, different, and special. When a VC looks to invest in a startup, they will look at many different things, including the financials, the entrepreneur, his or her team, and yes, their secret sauce.
Often it is the secret sauce that will compel an investor to jump on board.
Andy Bechtolsheim wrote out a $100,000 on the spot to "Google, Inc." after getting a demonstration of the search engine's capabilities when it was still a Stanford gradate school project in 1996. (Fun side note: Sergy Brin and Larry Page were unable to deposit the check for several weeks because they had not yet incorporated the business at that time.)
When I share the secret sauce secret with small business people, often they are intimidated. They worry that they have to be like Google or Amazon or something. That is not what I am saying at all. What I am saying is that you need to figure out what your version of free wi-fi is. That's it.
What is it that you do – or could do – that is unique, different, and special?
Here in my town, there is no shortage of organic markets. But one of them has a tagline, "The friendliest store in town." And heck if they aren't. For us it's a two-fer: We get great, fresh food there, and they are indeed quite nice about it (they better be given the prices!) For them, the key is that they know they have a lot of competition and so instead of competing where they may not win (price, selection, convenience, whatever), they changed the equation and compete in an area where they are strongest. Their "friendliness" is their secret sauce.
So that is today's assignment. Don't play on someone else's turf of location or lowest price or whatever. Play the game on your home field. Think about what it is that you do that is different, what your secret sauce is, and brand your business around that.
And if you offer some great huevos rancheros too, all the better.
Today's tip: I received a lot of positive feedback about my column last week on how the principles of famed UCLA basketball coach John Wooden can help any business. If you would like to see for yourself, there is an authorized training curriculum available. You can find it here at woodencourse.com .

General Motors planned to stock hundreds of thousands of replacement ignition switches two months before it announced a recall, but dumped the request without warning on its supplier.
A growing sense of urgency on GM's part, and a tone of incredulity at switch supplier Delphi over a sudden, huge order, can be seen in emails exchanged between the companies.
The emails became public after Texas lawyer Robert Hilliard successfully argued in court that there was no reason to keep them secret, as GM wanted.
STORY: GM CEO: Emails show automaker's process was faulty
Hilliard is suing GM on behalf of, his office says, 950 people, alleging fraud and product liability issues for not telling owners sooner about the danger of the ignition switches, now linked to 32 deaths.
Another 400 are applying to the GM victims' compensation fund administered by compensation specialist Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer hired by GM to independently run the fund. If people among the 400 aren't satisfied with the settlement the fund offers, they are expected to join the Hilliard lawsuit.
Hilliard calls the newly public emails "the single most explosive piece of evidence" that GM wasn't as aggressive as it should have been in warning owners about the dangerous switches. They can inadvertently move out of the "run" position and shut off the engine. That kills power assist to the steering and brakes, making cars harder to control. And it can disable airbags.
Here are excerpts from some key emails in the GM-Delphi exchange:
•Menlo Worldwide Logistics' Sarah Missentzis, representing GM, to Delphi's Lisa Augustine, Dec. 18, 2013:
"Per the voicemail I just left you, I am looking for a build and ship plan for a large volume of this part to support an urgent field action for our customers. I will need to secure a total of 500,000...."
•Delphi's Augustine to GM's Missentzis, Dec. 19, 2013:
"...this would be a huge increase in production for us. Please advise if this would be a firm order."
•Delphi account manager Anthony Simonton to Delphi colleague Susan Dowling, Dec. 20, 2013:
"...I can't believe they would enter anything for a high-volume field fix/campaign before discussing the issue with the supplier...."
•Dowling to seven others at Delphi:
"...Not our issue, but part of the solution. I don't know why we are just finding out about this, but the potential revenue is significant. Current price is around $5 and they are thinking they will need upwards of 500,000 units, possibly more.
"They will take units at any time...."
•Missentzis at GM to Dowling at Delphi, Jan. 7, 2014:
"...It involves 709,000 (model year 2005-2007) Cobalt/Pursuit/G5 vehicles."
•Missentzis at GM to Dowling at Delphi, Jan. 15, 2014:
"I left you another message. Please get back with me today with your ship plan. Please understand that we have to be able to provide timing and see what we can do to improve it. Delphi was notified of this urgent issue before Christmas and I have yet to see a plan.
"Please get me something by 4 pm today!!"
•Christine Witt, GM customer care, to Dowling, Delphi, Feb. 13, 2014:
"This 'Safety' issue was reported to NHTSA today. GM now has 60 days to notify all involved vehicle owners. this takes us to around April 8. (when we will only have about 50,000 pcs from Delphi) There are a total of 778,562 involved...."
NHTSA is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. On Feb. 25, GM announced the worldwide recall of 1.62 million 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5 and Pursuit, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, 2007 Pontiac Sky, Opel/Vauxhall GT, Daewoo G2X.
Nearly 1.37 million were in the U.S.
GM's latest count: 1,96 million U.S. cars ultimately are involved in the switch recall, once scrapped cars were identified. Of those, 54.9% had been repaired as of late last week.
Hilliard claims that at least 85 persons were hurt and one killed in GM crashes involving the faulty switches in the time between GM ordering the big supply of replacement switches and when the recall finally took place.

Asian markets edge lower, supply concerns keep oil down

(Asian shares and the dollar…)
TOKYO: Asian shares and the dollar got off to a lacklustre start on Tuesday as oil prices continued to drop, while Japanese shares marked early gains.
Crude oil prices shrugged off concerns about conflicts in Libya and Ukraine and continued to sag. Fears about a global supply glut and slowing growth have pushed oil prices down nearly 30 per cent since June.
US crude shed about 0.3 per cent to $77.17 per barrel.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down about 0.2 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei stock average added 0.6 per cent.
Data released before the open showed Japan's current account surplus rose more than expected in September from a year earlier, as income from investments overseas bolstered the balance of payments. The surplus stood at 963.0 billion yen ($8.4 billion), against a median forecast for a 534.2 billion yen surplus in a Reuters poll of economists.
On Wall Street overnight, both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials edged up to fresh closing highs.
US bond markets and government offices will be closed later on Tuesday in observance of the Veterans' Day holiday, while other markets will trade.
US Treasury prices slipped, putting a solid floor under the dollar as yields ticked higher. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.360 per cent in Asian trade, above its US close of 2.359 per cent on Monday.
The dollar edged down about 0.1 per cent on the day to 114.93 yen, below Friday's seven-year peak of 115.60. The euro was slightly up at $1.2425 though not far from a two-year trough of $1.2358 touched on Friday, and strategists said the single currency's downside remained vulnerable.
  "Our global flows data showed selling by both hedge funds and real money accounts post ECB in near record amounts. With both sectors not yet approaching oversold territory, there should be further room for continued selling," Citigroup's foreign exchange strategist Todd Elmer said in a note.
Investors had locked in gains on long dollar positions as Treasuries rose after headline US payroll figures on Friday fell short of high expectations. The report still provided evidence of solid improvement in employment conditions, and underscored the brighter US economic picture compared with Europe and Japan.
The Federal Reserve's monthly labour market conditions index released Monday showed an unchanged 4.0 level for October, which also allayed some concerns.
Diverging monetary policy outlooks between the Fed and both the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of Japan have lifted the dollar against its major rivals in recent weeks.

Did not create Facebook to attract girls: Zuckerberg on  The Social Network  movieFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg found 'The Social Network' movie hurtful.
By: PTI | Los Angeles | Posted: November 8, 2014 3:29 pm
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says ‘The Social Network’, director David Fincher’s take on his college life, took many liberties in telling his story which he found “hurtful”.
In his first public Q&A, Zuckerberg opened up about the movie, which was released in 2010, where Jesse Eisenberg played him. “The reality is that writing code and building a product and then building a company actually is not a glamorous enough thing to make a movie about. If they were really making a movie (of my life), it would have been of me sitting at a computer, coding for two hours straight, which probably would have not been that good of a movie,” Zuckerberg said.
The young businessman said the studio did get some interesting details like the design of the office correct but was not right in implicating that Zuckerberg created Facebook “to attract girls”.
“They just kind of made up a bunch of stuff that I found kind of hurtful,” he said.
Zuckerberg revealed that he wears the same gray T-shirt everyday to avoid wasting time in “things that are silly or frivolous”.

Kingfisher Airlines faces trading suspension from Dec 1Kingfisher Airlines faces trading suspension from Dec 1

The Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., India's two main stock exchanges, will suspend trading of shares of grounded Kingfisher Airlines Ltd from December 1 for failing to comply with rules on reporting financial results, the bourses said in separate notices.
Kingfisher, founded by liqour baron Vijay Mallya and once India's No.2 carrier, has not flown for more than two years for want of cash. The company last reported its financial results for the three months ended December 2013.
The exchanges will also suspend trading of UB Engineering Ltd, part of Mallya's UB Group, from Dec. 1, they said citing the company's failure to report financial results for two consecutive quarters to end-June.
Several other smaller companies are also facing trading suspension for the same reason, according to the stock exchange notices.
The companies can avert trading suspensions if they comply with the financial results reporting rules and pay required fines by Nov. 25, the exchanges said on Friday, adding the founder holding in the companies had been freezed, effective Nov. 7.

Long way to go before inflation eases  says RBILong way to go before inflation eases, says RBI
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 08, 2014

Even as record low crude oil prices soften inflation levels in the country, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) feels the price index still has a long way to go before it eases further, as overall input costs continue to remain steep.
“The risks still remain. On inflation, there is still a long way to go. There are structural issues also. We are seeing high inflation in rural areas,” RBI deputy governor HR Khan told a gathering of chief financial officers at a summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.
The central bank’s stance comes in the wake of calls by industry captains who have lobbied for an interest rate cut. Finance minister Arun Jaitley, too, joined hands with the industry when he hinted that economic conditions are ripe for a rate cut.
High inflation is usually cited as one of the main reasons for central banks to maintain status quo on interest rates or raise them, while falling prices could prompt a reduction in borrowing costs.
The consumer price index-based (CPI) or retail inflation grew to 6.46% in September, lowest in three years, mainly due to falling oil and food prices, the two major constituents in the CPI basket. India imports about 80% of its fuel requirements. Price of crude oil, which in 2013 reached $100 a barrel, has now softened to about $82.
The RBI has set a retail inflation target of 8% for next January and 6% a year later.
“Forming the monetary policy (in the context of changing geopolitical factors) has its limitations,” Khan said. “Projections are changing due to uncertainties.”
Stating that he is “chastened” bythe massive jump in foreign investments by Indian companies, Khan chided them for not doing enough research before taking their decisions, as many had to exit such investments in distress. “You’ve gone without proper research, due-diligence and adequate planning. So you now see a large-scale disinvestments of such assets happening.”
Khan said Indian companies would have to address major challenges, including exposure to large debt. According to RBI data, India Inc raised $3.17 billion from overseas markets in September this year, down 5.3% from last year.
 
Lauding the steps taken so far, Khan said getting complacent has its own risks. “Stability has the potential to become complacent. We are in an environment of Black Swans. On the domestic front, growth recovery is tepid but sentiment is good. Capital and investment cycle are yet to pick up. Since we are coupled with global economy we can’t be insulated by global uncertainty.”

ABB: Turning around  butslowlyABB
Rating: Hold
ABB India’s Q3 results are tricky to assess, especially given the distortion from the general elections this year. Order inflow momentum, which had turned around in the previous four quarters, fell by 19% year-on-year, thereby pushing back our growth expectations by six-nine months.
The bright spot of gross margin improvement continued (in a weak pricing environment), suggesting that the management efforts to cut costs are paying off. While we await the decisive cyclical turnaround, we cut our estimates by 19% for CY14e/CY15e to factor in the demand pushback and accordingly lower our 12-month DCF-based target to R1,030/share. We downgrade the stock to Hold.
Click here for grapph
Order inflows disappoint but operating results are par for the course: At first glance the Q3 results look like a miss, with order inflow of R14.2 bn (down 19%), net revenue of R18.5 bn (up 3% y-o-y) and PAT of R450m (up 26% y-o-y). However, in the post-earnings call, the management allayed concerns by highlighting that some procedural hiccups led to a large R6 bn order not being booked while other expenses were higher due to the company expensing some investments (made in anticipation of a demand recovery). Importantly, gross margins (33%, up 250bps y-o-y) continued to improve.
Order prospects have moderated vs. H1: Besides the few one-offs in Q3, management commentary on near-term order prospects moderated, suggesting a demand pushback. Given the more cautious order growth outlook and the pushback in order inflows, we lower our CY14e/CY15e EPS by 19%.
Valuations are rich after outperformance: As a result of the earnings cuts, we lower our DCF (discounted cash flow)-based 12-month target price to R1030/share, derived using a CoE (cost of equity) of 11.1% based on Deutsche Bank estimates of a 6.5% RFR (risk-free rate), 7.6% ERP (equity risk premium) and beta of 0.70 (all unchanged). With the stock now offering 8% downside potential to our revised target price after a 59% 12-month outperformance, we downgrade it to Hold. Slower/ faster-than-expected orders remain the key risk.
Other result highlights
* Net sales rose 3.3% y-o-y to R18.2 bn (2% lower than Dbe—Deutsche Bank estimates) on the back of 9% and 8% y-o-y increases in power systems and the Discrete Automation and Motion business. Broadly, all the divisions except Low Voltage registered growth during the quarter.
* Ebitda margin improved by 83bps y-o-y to 6.7% (42 bps below DBe) on the back of a 250bps gross margin improvement. The benefit from the higher gross margin was offset by the rise in other expenses/sales, which was up 146bps y-o-y to 17%.
* The higher other expenses included a forex loss of R110m (vs a forex gain of R70m in Q3CY13).
* The Low Voltage Products, Process Automation and Discrete Automation businesses registered an expansion in Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margins.
* The power products division saw a 236bps y-o-y dip in Ebit margins due to one-off costs on account of new investment. The Power Systems division’s Ebit margin was down 31bps y-o-y and there are still a few projects facing delays due to clearance/fuel issues.
* Profit after tax at R450m (up 26% y-o-y) was 15% lower than DBe, primarily due to a lower top line and higher-than-expected interest cost.

Jindal Steel & Power: ColdcomfortsJindal Steel & Power
Rating: Reduce
Broadly in line; raw material concerns remain. JSP’s Q2FY15 consolidated Ebitda was ahead of our estimates, led by a 5% beat from the power business and higher Ebitda from subsidiaries. A sequential spike in realisations contributed to the beat in the power business. Near-term earnings notwithstanding, the financial performance will deteriorate considerably once the cost of coal sourcing increases and will result in margin compression. Risks to domestic steel earnings are also high with the uncertainty on operational continuity of the Sharda mine. Maintain Reduce rating with target price of R170.
Click here for graph
Q2FY15 results: 8% beat at Ebitda level led by power and others Jindal Steel & Power’s consolidated Ebitda of R16.4 bn (+8% year-on-year, +5% quarter-on-quarter), was 8% ahead of our estimate. However, the standalone steel Ebitda of R9.6 bn was lower than our estimate due to a sequential decline in steel realisations. Despite a weak standalone performance, the consolidated Ebitda beat was led by (i) 22% q-o-q growth in Jindal Power’s Ebitda to R5.2 bn aided by a sharp increase in blended realisations and higher generation from Tamnar II (18% PLF for 1,800 MW), and (ii) higher Ebitda contribution from other subsidiaries.
We note that while aggregate disclosed Ebitda of foreign subsidiaries declined to $13m in Q2FY15 from $19m in Q1FY15, such an Ebitda calculation from reported consolidated financials shows an increase. Net income of R4.4 bn was aided by a lower effective tax rate of 7%.
Power: Spike in realisations: Jindal Power reported a strong 39% y-o-y growth in revenues to R9.2 bn on expanded capacities of 2,800 MW and gross generation of 2,799 MU (million units) (+ 33% y-o-y). The sharp spike in blended realisations to R3.6/kWh (+15% q-o-q) and the ability to absorb incremental depreciation and interest cost on additional 1,800 MW capacity (interest and depreciation cost of R1 bn reported) helped to report a respectable PAT of R2.9 bn. Cost of generation at R1.6/ kWh rose by 30% over previous quarters, reflecting the higher cost of sourced coal versus captive mines supply coal to Phase I.
The Q2FY15 results indicate Jindal Power was able to absorb the incremental cost associated with Tamnar II despite a sub-optimal 18% PLF (plant load factor). However, uncertainty over auctioning of coal blocks, likely over the next few months, is more relevant from the perspective of stock performance. We maintain our cautious view due to uncertainty about coal and iron ore.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an ice-breaking meeting Monday on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific conference in Beijing, following more than two years of deep tensions over an island dispute.
The spat between China and Japan over uninhabited East China Sea islands raised concerns of a military confrontation between Asia’s two largest economics. China also has been angry over what it sees as effort by Japan to play down its brutal 20th Century invasion and occupation of China.
The meeting between Xi and Abe in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People gives rise to hopes the countries will dial down the tensions. The two met ahead of Tuesday’s summit of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
The two sides had issued a joint statement on Friday agreeing to gradually resume political, diplomatic and security dialogues.
In that statement, Japan said it acknowledged differing views over the status of the islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japan. China has long demanded that Tokyo acknowledge that the islands’ sovereignty is in dispute, something Japan has refused to do.
China and Japan have had poor relations for decades, rooted in Japan’s fears of China’s economic and political rise and Beijing’s sense of victimhood. Japan’s nationalization of the islands in September 2012 infuriated Beijing, raising regional security fears as Chinese patrol ships repeatedly penetrated the surrounding waters to confront Japanese coast guard vessels.
Tensions remained strained after the late 2012 election of Abe, a conservative nationalist who infuriated China when in 2013 he visited a Tokyo Shinto shrine honoring Japan’s war dead, including executed war criminals — an act Beijing says shows Abe’s insensitivity to China’s suffering during the war. His government’s reinterpretation of Japan’s pacifist constitution to allow a greater role for its military has also raised alarms in Beijing.

Overweight rating to ICICI Bank shares: On a steady courseICICI Bank
Rating: Overweight
Q2FY15 earnings at Rs 27.1 bn (15% year-on-year) are in line with our estimates. Other income was slightly higher than our estimates due to Rs 1.65 bn gain from repatriation of profit from overseas branches offset by slightly higher provisioning.
Operating metrics loan growth moderated to 14% y-o-y as corporate growth remained subdued while retail book continued its growth momentum (25% y-o-y) led by mortgages and auto loans–as they entered new geographies. This led to the retail mix improving to 40%. Margins remained firm at 3.42% driven by healthy CASA mix (44%) and moderation in wholesale deposit costs. Fee income growth was moderate at16% y-o-y led by retail fees growing above 20% y-o-y and contributing to 60% of the total fees. Corporate fees, however, were lower due to weaker forex income and slowdown in corporate fees (transactional and commercial banking and lending related fees). Cost income ratio improved to 36.5% as the bank focused on leveraging its technology improvement by curtailing its staff expenses. GNPL (gross non-performing loan) ratio increased by 7 basis points to 3.12% as slippages increased to 1.9%. The restructured book was 3.05%, with the management indicating a pipeline of R18 bn for the remainder this year.

Earnings outlook: We continue to maintain stable asset quality outlook but increase our loan growth forecast slightly for FY16-17e to 21% y-o-y. Overall we expect steady performance with ROA (return on assets) in the range of 1.8-1.9% and ROE (return on equity) around 16-17% by FY16-17e.
Valuation and risks: ICICI is trading at 2.2x P/AB (price-to-adjusted book value) 12-month forward versus its five-year average of 1.8x P/AB, and 1.9x excluding subsidiaries. We value the stock at 2x 12-month forward adj.book on single stage Gordon growth model, thus, slightly increasing our TP to R1,910 (from R1,814) implying a potential return of 20%. Retain OW (overweight). Key risks: (i) Slower loan growth momentum; (ii) spike in NPLs and credit costs.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said the government is planning to bring down its stake in public sector banks to 52 per cent so as to meet Rs 3 lakh crore capital requirement.
"We are also trying to bring down the governmental equity in the banks to about 52 per cent so that a large amount of capital, almost closing to Rs 3 lakh crore, can be introduced into banks itself, so that they have a lot more resources for financial inclusion," he said.
In 2010, the then Cabinet had approved a proposal to keep the minimum shareholding of government to 58 per cent in the public sector banks in order to provide buffer for the future.
As per law, government holding at any moment must not come below 51 per cent to maintain the public sector character of PSU banks .
At present, government shareholding in various banks varies between 56.26 per cent ( Bank of Baroda) and 88.63 per cent (Central Bank of India).
Public sector banks require equity capital of Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms. For the current fiscal, the government has allocated Rs 11,200 crore for bank capitalisation.
The government had infused an amount of Rs 58,600 crore between 2011 and 2014.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Budget speech had said that "to be in line with Basel-III norms there is a requirement to infuse Rs 2,40,000 crore as equity by 2018 in our banks. To meet this huge capital requirement we need to raise additional resources to fulfil this obligation".
While preserving the public ownership, the capital of these banks will be raised by increasing the shareholding of the people in a phased manner through the sale of shares largely through retail to common citizens of this country, the minister had said.

2G spectrum case: Final arguments from Dec 19Print
Final arguments in the 2G spectrum allocation case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and 15 others have been fixed for December 19.

A Delhi court on Monday fixed December 19 for hearing final arguments in the 2G spectrum allocation case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and 15 others.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, who was scheduled to hear the matter on Monday, deferred the case after counsel for CBI and the accused sought more time.
“Put up for December 19 for final arguments,” the judge said.
During the brief hearing, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Anand Grover said that he required some more time to advance his arguments.
The SPP’s submission came after Vijay Aggarwal, counsel for Swan Telecom promotor Shahid Balwa, one of the accused asked the court how it can commence final hearing when an application has been moved by CBI for examining more witnesses.
Earlier, on September 10, the court had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case.
The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 30,984 crore to the exchequer in allocation of 122 licences for 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the Supreme Court on February 2, 2012.
The special judge, who is exclusively dealing with 2G scam cases, had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case in which the CBI had examined 153 witnesses while the accused called 29 witnesses in their defence.

Egyptian militant group pledges allegiance to Islamic stateIslamic State militants.
By: Associated Press | Cairo | Posted: November 10, 2014 12:36 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:41 pm
Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, a jihadi organization based in the northern part of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
The announcement pledging loyalty to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi came in an audio speech posted late Sunday on the Egyptian militant group’s official Twitter account and a militant website.
The unknown speaker says Ansar Beit al-Maqdis decided to join the Islamic State group “whose emergence resembles a new dawn raising the banner of monotheism.”
Earlier last week, the group denied on its official Twitter account reports saying it had pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi.
Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, whose Arabic name means Champions of Jerusalem, has claimed responsibility for a number of lethal attacks mainly targeting Egyptian security forces.

Suresh Prabhu: A political misfit in Modi s CabinetBal Thackeray
(Modi wanted the 61-year-old…)
MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Humble, soft spoken, man of integrity, these are attributes seldom associated with politicians but fits Suresh Prabhu . Once rated one of the three future leaders of India by Asiaweek, Prabhu was largely ignored by Shiv Sena since 2004. Ten years later, Prabhu returned to be sworn in as Cabinet minister , as a BJP member. Modi wanted the 61-year-old banker-politician in his government despite an overwhelming opinion that he's a 'misfit' in politics.
"He isn't a politician. He is a misfit because he doesn't subscribe to party culture, nor is he a yes-man. He is a fantastic administrator, but doesn't project himself as one. He is very well read and aware of what's going around him, but would be unaware of what's happening in his party," said a Sena leader who knows Prabhu. "And if anyone deserves to be a minister, it's Prabhu," he concluded.
He had brought a rare spark as power minister in Vajpayee's government. Veteran Journalist Pratap Thorat spoke of how Bal Thackeray discovered Prabhu: "Thackeray wanted some experts to interact with Uddhav to broaden his horizons. Shantaram Gotoskar, a journalist with a language daily entrusted the task to Prabhu, who was managing Saraswat Bank. His interactions impressed the Sena chief and he decided Prabhu would be the party's Lok Sabha candidate from Rajapur in 1996," reminisces Thorat.
Thackeray next chose him as a minister, ignoring the claims of seasoned Sena leaders. "I still remember senior leaders sitting at Matoshree to lobby for the post. Prabhu wasn't there, but Thackeray said Prabhu would be the party's choice," said Thorat. Prabhu was to impress his new boss Vajpayee soon. "Vajpayee had a special liking for him... Prabhu as power minister tried hard to initiate reforms in the sector. He campaigns hard for the issues he believes in and is a strong implementor," said ex-BJP member Sudheendra Kulkarni.
But this irked the Thackerays, and Sena forced Prabhu to resign. He, however, took this in his stride. "In all these years, he never spoke against the Thackerays, nor was he demoralised. He quietly went back to his consultancy work," said Thorat.
Prabhu has the ability to take risks and stand by his actions. "We used to tell him that we have plans for the bank but were afraid to implement them. He would always tell us not to bother about the consequences since he would take responsibility," said DR Shirodkar, CEO of New India Cooperative Bank, who worked with Prabhu for 12 years.
His main drawback is that he is not a people's leader. "When he was with the Sena, he stayed aloof from the cadres, and ignored his constituency as an MP. He couldn't connect with the people... he couldn't draw crowds with a speech. Since he is not a political operator, he can only work under a good boss," said Thorat. One will have to see whether he's found the right boss.

Manohar Parrikar: The man with impeccable integrity in Modi s CabinetManohar Parrikar, the man with impeccable integrity
MEERA MOHANTY, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Bush
(There are many accounts…)
BHUBANESHWAR: Bakul Desai, a Hyderabad-based businessman, has a story on Manohar Parrikar's sense of fairness. In the late 1970s, as students at IIT Powai, they were forced to travel ticketless as they could not wake up the man behind the counter at 4 am. At Dadar, a ticket examiner fined Parrikar Rs 10 plus an additional 40 paise for the fare. A furious Parrikar travelled ticketless for the next semester, as he thought it was unfair. "One day he found his free trips had cost the government Rs 11.20 paise. So he bought stamps from a post office and tore them up. Now, the Government of India and I are square,' he said."
Parrikar's friend believes his integrity is the reason why Prime Minister Narendra Modi picked him. What he will also bring to the job is a geeky passion for finance and engineering and a deep sense of nationalism. An admitted workaholic, Parrikar insists on leading a simple life.
The 58-year-old widower, who recently turned grandfather, lives with the elder of his two sons in a two-bedroom apartment that he is still paying installments for. Parrikar, whose father owned a grocery shop, is a metallurgist by training and runs a smallscale hydraulic engineering unit employing about 15 people.
There are many accounts of his spartan style — security personnel seeing him arriving at the airport in a rickshaw, carrying his own luggage, wearing rumpled bush shirts and chappals in North Block... None of this is for effect.
Talks that a national role, possibly as finance minister, awaited him was also the doing the rounds in May. "Parrikar has a khujli for numbers and finance. He understands the difference between 1% and 1.07%," said businessman Nandan Kudchadkar.
In 2012, after leading the BJP back to power, as promised, he reduced value added tax on petrol from 22% to 0.1%, making it cheapest in the country at Rs 55 a litre. Simultaneously, he also reduced VAT on aviation fuel from 22% to 12%, putting Dabolim airport on every airline's refuelling stop. That meant more flights to Goa, bringing with them planeloads of tourists and more than making up for the loss in revenue.
One of his most vocal critics is former Congress and now independent Goa MLA Vijay Sardesai .
"It is... a fact that Parrikar had succeeded in creating an inclusive model for BJP in Goa, given tickets and ministerial positions to Christians," he said.
But his departure for Delhi will undermine the party in Goa, he said.
"The BJP in Goa, minus Parrikar, will be totally exposed. That of all of 288 MPs in the country, the BJP in the Centre must take the Goa chief minister, also exposes the bankruptcy of leadership and talent in the party at the central level," Sardesai said.
Despite his long association with the RSS from his schooldays, when he attended Durganand Nadkarni's shakhas, Parrikar has managed to create for himself a reputation as a somewhat moderate leader. "For him, the RSS instilled discipline and an idea of patriotism, where India came before even Indians, and where one's being a Christian, or a Muslim, or a Hindu must not come in the way," said Desai, whose known Parrikar for nearly four decades.

(Sampla’s political journey…)
By ?Vinay Sharma
CHANDIGARH: From a labourer in Jalandhar, to a plumber in Saudi Arabia and now a Union minister of state, Vijay Sampla's life has been quite a roller coaster. 52-year-old Sampla was born in a poor Dalit family. Financial difficulties following his father's death forced Sampla, who was then 14, to work as a labourer in Jalandhar. In 1992, he moved to Saudi Arabia to work as an assistant plumber until 1997.
Vijay Sampla's political journey began soon after he returned from Saudi Arabia. In 1998, he was elected sarpanch (headman) of Jalandhar's Sofi village. This was the time when Narendra Modi was BJP's Punjab affairs in charge. Sampla, who was denied a party nomination for the 2012 Punjab assembly elections, contested and won the Lok Sabha election this year from Hoshiarpur reserved seat. He defeated Congress leader Mohinder Singh Kaypee. The fact that PM Modi preferred Sampla in his council of ministers over a seemingly stronger candidate from Punjab — Gurdaspur MP Vinod Khanna — speaks of the clout he wields in the Modi team.
By choosing an emerging Dalit leader (Sampla belongs to the Ravidassia sect of Doaba region), Modi has underscored the BJP's strategy for the next assembly elections in Punjab—that the party aims to win over the Dalits, who constitute 32% of the state's 2.77 crore population. The dominant Ravidassias have a considerable hold in more than 11 assembly constituencies of the state.
On Sunday, Sampla sounded wary of the SAD-BJP alliance. "BJP senior leaders have been taking feedback from us on the SAD-BJP alliance," Sampla told ET over the phone soon after taking the oath. "A lot will depend how it addresses the issues of our workers. Our leaders have already indicated that if Haryana-like situation develops, we may go alone."

Ministry expansion by Narendra Modi government reflects political realignment
November 10, 2014, 1:14 am IST ET Edit in ET Editorials | Edit Page , Times View | ET
8
The expansion of the Narendra Modi government by 21 people brings in some much-needed talent as well as more balanced representation of different communities and regions in the Union council of ministers. At the same time, the ministry expansion process also celebrates further consolidation of the BJP’s strength in different parts of the country and concomitant anxieties among the allies. The Shiv Sena is fairly embittered but still desperately looking for excuses not to make the final break with its ally of 15 years in things ranging from demolishing the Babri mosque to running the government of Maharashtra and the previous edition of the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. The Akali Dal leadership stayed away from the swearing-in ceremony, in a show of resentment at the BJP state unit’s talk of going it alone in Punjab.
Adding to the ministry’s talent quotient is a good idea, provided ministers are allowed to take some initiative in taking their ministry’s work forward. What we have witnessed so far in the present government is a tendency for the Prime Minister’s Office to centralise decision-making within itself, leaving individual ministers pretty much clueless about their purported charge. If this model of governance is to continue, the logical thing to do would be to strengthen the PMO further. An even more sensible course would, of course, be to let the ministries work with autonomy, with the PM’s office providing coordination and little more.
With the induction of the new ministers, the southern parts of the country would feel even more under-represented than before. At the same time, by giving representation to different communities and regions, Modi continues the process of pre-empting disaffection and consolidating support for the BJP, not only in regions that have offered overwhelming support but also in states in which the BJP hopes to expand. In sum, the ministry expansion represents a wholesome departure from the sterile view that governance and politics have to be separate strands that seldom meet.

Minimum government, maximum governance will evoke sarcasm now

(This makes the exercise…)
By Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay
Sunday's expansion of the Union Council of Ministers marks an important point in the political evolution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . He has undertaken a strategic course correction in governance by substantially increasing the size of his ministerial team and pragmatically drawn in talent from the scanty pool in his party. But while doing this, his eye has been on ensuing assembly elections over the next couple of years. Social engineering is the buzzword as several ministers from the different social groups, including OBCs, have been inducted. Performance and track record ceased to be a factor, barring a few names.
This makes the exercise more traditional in mould. The government has moved away from innovative character Modi promised during campaigning. There is little structural difference between the Modi government and the previous regimes. Tokenism on one front accompanies neglect on another because of the lack of political necessity.
The promise of minimum government, maximum governance will evoke sarcasm now. Many would say that the undertaking was misplaced in the first instance as a country of India's size requires far greater number of ministers. Most mature democracies, several times smaller, have greater number of ministers. But Modi will be accused of using the slogan as a ploy to discredit a terminally-ill regime. Another few instances of not delivering on promises, the Feku tag may make a comeback.
It was one matter to marginalise ministers and run the government with an iron fist with assistance from few officers in Gujarat, but attempting to doing so at the Centre is a different ball game. Modi is a tough player and brooks no interference, yet the RSS has also proved to be of equal mettle and has succeeded in inserting checks and balances.
Ideally speaking, Modi would have liked Manohar Parrikar — also an RSS loyalist — to have stayed back in Goa. It must have been a tough choice to make. Talented, performance-oriented ministers with a mind of their own are impediments to a centralised form of governance. Parrikar had also been briefly considered as BJP's electoral mascot and made certain statements that did not particularly overwhelm Modi. But if Modi took the decision on Parrikar with personal enthusiasm and not just at the nudging of the peer group in RSS, it would mark a significant transition point in his political persona.
An instance of Modi's discomfort with seniors with significant electoral base was evident after Maharashtra polls, when shrewd information management let it known that Nitin Gadkari had an eye on the CM's chair, whereas it was Modi's wish to confine Gadkari to one state. As of now, senior ministers with independent minds will have greater bench strength with the induction of Parrikar and Suresh Prabhu and how Modi reacts to possible combined pressure on him to devolve power will be an interesting narrative to track. It is still possible that he may subjugate the entire lot but that would also indicate sidelining of RSS, a possibility that appears distant at this point of time.
Expectations that Modi will induct talent from outside the political system have been belied. Barring odd instances, no one has CV that merited elevation. From the perspective of governance, this indicates that Modi is preparing to grant functional autonomy to select ministers while micro-managing lesser mortals. This could see him succeeding in making his government more dynamic but would reduce his minute-to-minute control of government and party. Unless Modi pulls a surprise or two and eventually devalues a couple of peers, this round shows the emergence of a tempered Modi. Whether this has been forced on him or is of his own volition will be revealed in days to come.

Modi s team expansion has compulsions of the non-coalition kindSearch for:
All hands on the deck
November 10, 2014, 1:45 am IST Indrajit Hazra in Red Herring | Edit Page , Times View | ET
5
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has no ‘coalition compulsions’. That was made all the more evident in Sunday’s exercise of expanding the Union council of ministers, especially the double-headed drama over the perennially air-dashing non-induction of the Shiv Sena’s Anil Desai and the induction of Suresh Prabhu from the same regional party into the Cabinet. The Desai drama was in the mould of a silent B&W slapstick comedy that calmly put the Shiv Sena’s tantrums in place. Making Prabhu a Cabinet inductee is a far more illustrative move as to what Modi wants out of his team now that he’s settled down to business.
Prabhu, a former minister in the Vajpayee government and heading this government’s advisory group for integrated development of power, coal and renewable energy, is exactly the kind of technocrat that Modi needs to execute the kind of infrastructural overhaul that is required and never usually leaves the domain of PPTs. But Prabhu also serves the purpose of Modi presenting himself as a headhunter who is willing to cut through political wrangles for the purpose of securing talent.
Hitching the Wagon Right
This isn’t the first time a person from a troublesome alliance party has been used by a PM to push policy as well as to send out a political message to an ally. In the UPA’s 2012 railway budget, railway minister from the Trinamool Dinesh Trivedi had announced an across-the-board hike in passenger fares for much-needed revenues for rail modernisation. Trivedi had worked in conjunction with PM Manmohan Singh, ostensibly without the knowledge of his own party boss Mamata Banerjee. That episode led to Trivedi’s ‘resignation’ as UPA minister (but not as Trinamool member, unlike Prabhu who has switched to the BJP).
The Medium is the Message
The situation between the BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra-Delhi is hardly the same as the Congress and the Trinamool in West Bengal-Delhi. But in both cases, the national parties no longer needed the regional ones and high-visibility members from the latter were used to send across the message.
Even as Manohar Parrikar, Prabhu, Jagat Prakash Nadda and Birender Singh have been inducted into Modi’s Cabinet for their performances in governance, their political heft —especially Singh’s as the erstwhile Congressman in charge of poll-bound Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh (Nadda’s state) and Delhi in 2014 before he switched over to the BJP — will always be at play. The inclusion of former Vajpayee minister Bandaru Dattatreya, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Mahesh Sharma as minister of state (MoS) with independent charge also follow this dual criteria.
Modi likes — unsurprisingly for any prime minister, until we recall the situation his immediate predecessor found himself in — to work with doers whom he is comfortable with. Just having doers in the mould of, say, a Jairam Ramesh or Arun Shourie won’t do. “One major component [of running an organisation] is human resource management,” Gujarat chief minister Modi had told journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, “and in the Sangh we are taught this from the beginning: how to use manpower resources to the hilt, to the optimum levels. In government, this is very easy. Identifying a team, building it, get the team to do the work.” What held for Modi in Gujarat is now being applied to GoI.
The 15 MoSs are straightforward political appointees — that is, appointed for political purposes. Take the inclusion of Giriraj Singh. That Singh made news during the Lok Sabha election campaign for the wrong reason — publicly stating that anyone not supportive of Modi “should move to Pakistan” — plays no retroactive role in his new role as a BJP central minister. What matters is that Singh is a Bhumihar leader whose localised support is sought to come into play to counter the likes of the JD (U)’s Rajiv Ranjan ‘Lalan’ Singh during the Bihar elections next year.
In Search of Right Algorithm
Similar caste and community considerations are obvious, whether for Sanwar Lal Jat and Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore from Rajasthan or Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and (perhaps a little less obviously as a ‘Dalit nomination’) Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti from Uttar Pradesh. Of course, there’s nothing sure-shot about such ‘political social-engineering’. The Vajpayee government had five Cabinet ministers from Bihar in 2004. The BJP was battered in the state in the Lok Sabha polls that followed.
What Modi is seeking from his less lean, hopefully mean, fighting machine is alignment. The matter of political alignment was taken care of in May. Now, what is sought is alignment of execution. Writing to Singaravelu Mudaliar, assistant professor of science in the Christian College, Madras, in 1894, Swami Vivekananda, spoke of how faith, knowledge and love alone can’t do any job at hand. “A harmony of all these is the thing required.… Each one may not individually attain to that perfection, still we may get it collectively by counteracting, equipoising, adjusting and fulfilling one another.”
PM Narendra Modi has no coalition compulsions. But the prime minister of a ruling party with 282 seats in Parliament will have to deal with other less visible, home-grown compulsions of his own.

Sensex ends flat after hitting all-time high of 28 028Sensex ends flat after hitting all-time high of 28,028

Mumbai, Nov 10:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session near flat after hitting all-time highs in early trade on heavy selling in capital goods and oil & gas counters, despite buying in FMCG and consumer durables sector stocks.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex ended at 27,874.73, up 6.1 points and the 50-share NSE index Nifty ended at 8,344.25, up 7.25 points.
Among BSE sectoral indices, oil & gas index fell the most by 1.29 per cent, followed by capital goods 1.01 per cent, banking 0.53 per cent and PSU 0.48 per cent. On the other hand, FMCG and consumer durables stocks were the star-performers and were up 2.81 per cent and 1.00 per cent, respectively.
ITC, Sun Pharma,Tata Power, Coal India and HUL were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were ONGC, Hindalco, Tata Motors, L&T and Axis Bank.
The Sensex resumed higher at 27,919.45 and firmed up further to an all-time high of 28,027.96 on the back of strong foreign capital inflows into the equity market coupled with mixed Asian cues. The CNX 50-share Nifty also hit a life-time high of 8,383.05.
Brokers said sustained foreign funds inflow and widespread buying by investors on hopes of acceleration in economic reforms process after Prime Minister Narendra Modi expanded his Council of Ministers, mainly buoyed the trading sentiment, lifting the key indices to new highs in early trade.
Domestic sentiment was also buoyed in early trade as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had yesterday said that the government will amend the tough land acquisition law.
European stocks inched higher early on Monday, reversing some of the previous session's losses, with Nutreco surging 14 per cent as SHV sweetened its takeover bid for the Dutch animal feed and nutrition company.
At 0850 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.3 per cent at 1,348.80 points, after losing 0.5 per cent last week.
Mixed trading was witnessed in the Asian markets after US jobs data pointed to solid economic growth, while China's export performance showed more resilience than some had expected.
US employers added 214,000 jobs in October, slightly below economists' median forecast of 231,000, but logging the ninth consecutive month of gains of more than 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.

After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark BSE Sensex today ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75. It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.

The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet, lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.

A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Marley Liberate BT review: Living up to the legendEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Bob Marley is still one of the biggest names in global music. His son Rohan Marley has for the past couple of years been trying to take the legend to the world of high end audio with a new brand called the House of Marley. I first got to hear and see the brand during the IFA tech show in Berlin this year. Though I couldn’t make out much of the music considering over 200 brands were blaring in the hall, there was no doubt that they had among the most stylish headsets and systems on show. Now, the brand has entered India with its products and sent me the Liberate BT speaker for a review. Here goes.
Design
As I said earlier, the Marley brand has a one of the most distinct design languages among audio brands at the moment. There is a lot of wood even in their headphones and earphones. The Liberate BT is not much different but there is more fabric here than wood, which is relegated to the rear panel where the Marley branding shows up in all its glory. The front panel is peppered with circles that let out the music. The controls are a set of buttons on the top that blend into the fabric. There is an LED lit Marley logo in front that tells you if the unit is on and if it is connected to the a smart devices by changing colours. The so-called ‘Rewind’ fabric is stylish but I am not sure they will work well in dusty environs like Delhi and most of North India for that matter.
Setup
Setup is simple. A long press of the Bluetooth button and the set becomes visible for smart devices. You can also use a line in wire, though it defeats the purpose of having a wireless set in the first place.
Performance
Strangely, I started with some 1950s Hindi numbers by Manna Dey on the Liberat and the experience was indeed liberating to say the least. Usually small BT speakers are heavy on bass, especially the ones that cater to the Bollywood crazy music lovers in India. But this one has the perfect balance and the soul stirring voice of Manna Dey shone through perfectly. But then I had to play Bob Marley to get a good grip on what this was all about. From the overplayed Buffalo Soldier to Is This Love, the Liberate kept reminding me it is made for this kind of music… my kind of music. But it can also liven up a rather large party with a perfect rendition of Tubthumbing and even get a heady for those who like the liquor laced music that seems to have found the favour of Hindi film industry at the moment. The battery life is good enough to last up to six hours with full volume.
Verdict
Put this in a corner of a terrace party or in your living room for some soft melodies, the Liberate BT is versatile enough to handle all of this. This is one of the best Bluetooth speakers out there at the moment and has enough to stick out in the crowd. The Rs 7,999 price tag does not seem too much given the versatility of the speaker.

Toshiba to invest USD 30 billion to expand power biz in IndiaEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Japanese firm Toshiba Corporation will invest about USD 30 million for expanding its production capacity in the power transmission and distribution business in India.
The investment is part of the company’s plan to invest USD 100 million in Indian power sector by 2016.
“Toshiba Corporation will reinforce its transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India with a 3 billion yen (approximately USD 30 million) investment in new production capacity at Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems India Private Ltd (TTDI) in Hyderabad,” the company said in a statement.
“India is a high-growth market that Toshiba has positioned as a strategic base for its power-related businesses.
“In the period to FY16, Toshiba plans to invest a cumulative 10-billion yen (approximately USD 100 million) in its T&D business there, including this current round of investment,” said Katsutoshi Toda, CMD, TTDI.
“Toshiba is seeking to secure a 20 per cent share of the Indian market by 2018, and also reinforce TTDI as a core T&D production base for other major markets, including Europe, ASEAN, and Africa,” Toda said.
A new facility for large power transformers will come on line in 2015 at Hyderabad at the same time as the full scale launch of a new unit for switchgears.
Alongside its existing production line of small and medium capacity transformers and low and medium voltage switchgears, the new power transformer line will support production of 765 kV (kilovolt) transformers with a capacity of 500 MVA (mega volt ampere), while the new switchgear line will produce high voltage products.
Toshiba established TTDI in 2013 by acquiring T&D business from Vijai Electricals for 20 billion yen or approximately USD 200 million, and also started operation of a new power transformer facility in Russia in February 2014.

Jitan Ram Manjhi hits back at BJP over demand to quitBy: Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:03 pm
Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi Monday hit back at BJP, which has been demanding his resignation in the wake of the controversial appointment of his son-in-law, saying the saffron party had given important posts to people facing corruption and rape charges.
“Why shall I resign? The BJP, which is asking for my resignation, should first answer about giving important posts to people like Y S Yeduruppa and even those facing vigilance cases and rape charges,” Manjhi told reporters on the sidelines of a ‘Janata ke Darbar Mein Mukhya Mantri’ programme at his residence.
He, however, refused to identify the BJP leader facing rape charges and vigilance cases.
On the controversial appointment of his son-in-law Devendra Kumar as his Personal Assistant (PA) against rules, Manjhi accepted it was a “mistake due to lack of information” which was corrected once his attention was drawn to it.
“The chapter is closed now,” he said.
Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and other party leaders had demanded Manjhi’s resignation over the issue.
Manjhi also rubbished reports of “differences” with his predecessor Nitish Kumar.
“He is running the party (JD-U) and I am running the government,” he said.
Asked if he would be part of Kumar’s ‘Samparak Yatra’ starting from November 13, the Chief Minister said, “It’s a party programme where I cannot go as a CM. But, if party workers demand my presence anywhere, I will be happy to be there.”
Manjhi, who had a nearly two hour-long meeting with Kumar on November 7 amid reports of a growing distance between the two leaders, said he received “tips” from Kumar for running the government more effectively.
Dismissing reports of Kumar avoiding to share dais with him as wrong, he said Nitish could not attend some of the functions with him due to personal reasons and prior engagements.
Asked if the JD(U) and the RJD should merge in the wake of efforts to bring old the Janata parivar together, Manjhi said, “Leaders like Sharad Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar can comment on such issues, not me.”
He, however, stressed on an alliance between JD(U), RJD and Congress in the coming Assembly elections to repeat the performance of the recent by-elections in which they won six seats out of ten.

Cunningham kissed her seven-month-old great-great-granddaughter before suiting up for her 100th birthday jump on Saturday at Saratoga Skydiving in Gansevoort (GANZ'-voort). It was her third jump, after taking up the sport at age 90.
Cunningham lives with her granddaughter in their Schoharie (skoh-HAYR'-ee) County home in central New York. Her doctor signed off on the skydiving expedition, saying her health makes her more than capable of doing what she loves.

Micromax Canvas 4+: Good features that push limits for price rangeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
For the past year or so Micromax has been giving Samsung tough competition in the Indian hinterland with value for money smartphones. From the time it launched the Canvas Knight earlier this year, this Indian company has been clearly nurturing dreams of offering high-end specs at mid-range price points. The latest in this range is the Micromax Canvas 4+.
Specs: 5-inch HD AMOLED display |  MediaTek MT6592 1.7GHz True Octa core processor with 1GB RAM | 16GB internal storage expandable up to 32GB | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front | 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0 | Android 4.4.2 | 2000 mAh battery
Price: Rs 16,999
Design: Let’s just say this will remind you of the iPhone 3S once in a while. The phone as some bling factor thanks to the golden ring running around the bezel and golden flap on the back. The phone has a fixed back and the two SIMs and SD card go into flaps on the side. It is one of the lightest phones around, especially in this price bracket.
Display: The HD AMOLED display should be one of the selling points of this phone, but it isn’t. In the lock screen the display feels stubborn and need a good strong swipe to open. Inside, with dull colours like grey the pixels seems to show up and there is a matte finish like feel which is odd. The display is okay when the visuals are vibrant and colourful.
Performance: The octa-core processor makes this phone good for multi-tasking and some high-end gaming. There was no noticeable heating during the tests or even benchmarking. But don’t expect more than what you would from a mid range phone.
Software: Micromax still seems to believe in packing the phones with lots of software you might never use. This includes at least five Micromax apps and a few games. There is a camera widget that gives one touch access to features like selfie camera, dual shot using the front and back cameras as well as video. I also liked the simple lock screen that shows only clock.
Camera: This is among the few smartphones in this price range that gives you a 5MP front camera. This camera is good for selfies, though you will need to be in a well-lit area for the efforts to be successful. The rear camera is pretty decent too and has a totality that is rare in smartphone. The photos seem a bit underexposed, but in a good sort of way.
Storage: The phone has 16GB internal storage out of which roughly 11GB is available for users. The internal storage has a 2GB slot for system storage. You might want to buy a 16GB SD card with the phone.
Connectivity: No issues with connectivity, but we found that the FM radio seems to have antenna issues.
Battery: The battery will give you about 12 hours on a full charge. However, there seems to be apps that drain the battery quicker, like the FM radio.
Verdict: The Canvas 4+ has some good features that push the limits for the price range. But I doubt if it offers a great value proposition especially when there are other phones like the Lenovo Vibe X2 or Huawei Honor 6 offering much more at a slightly higher price tag. Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.

Rupee closes 12 paise higher on dollar saleRupee closes 12 paise higher on dollar sale
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:32 IST

Snapping the three-day losing streak, the rupee on Monday gained 12 paise at 61.50 against the dollar on fresh selling of the US currency by banks and exporters on the back of strong capital inflows.
A weak dollar in the overseas market also boosted the rupee value against the greenback, a forex dealer said.
The rupee resumed higher at 61.45 per dollar as against the last weekend's level of 61.62 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market.
It moved in a range of 61.43-61.51 a dollar before finishing at 61.50 per dollar, showing a gain of 12 paise or 0.19 per cent.
The local currency had lost by 26 paise or 0.42 per cent in three trading sessions prior to today's close.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said, "Rupee continues to trade in a small range although today it has appreciated over 12 paise to close at 61.50. Slightly disappointing US job data has forced dollar index to trade weak for the second consecutive day at USD 87.28 which has helped rupee to trade firm and nullify the effect of profit-booking in local equities".
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
The Indian benchmark Sensex ended marginally higher by 6.10 points or 0.02 per cent to 27,874.73 after touching an all-time high of 28,027.96 in the trade.
In the forwards market, The benchmark six-month premium payable in April closed at 216-218 as against the previous close of 212.5-214.5 paise.
Far-forward contracts maturing in October, 2015 ended at 429-431 paise compared to the previous 422-424 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 61.45 and for the euro at 76.67.
The rupee ended at 97.77 against the pound and 76.82 against euro.

Tata-Starbucks blends Indian coffee for global marketsTata-Starbucks blends Indian coffee for global markets
IANS     Bengaluru   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:27 IST
Leading hot beverage joint venture Tata-Starbucks Ltd is marketing its Indian blended coffee in global markets, including Asia and the US.
"Locally sourced, roasted and packaged coffee brands are now available in our stores across Asia and online in the US to promote India's rich coffee heritage," the company said in a statement in Bengaluru in Monday.
The 50:50 joint venture of Starbucks Coffee Company and Tata Global Beverages Ltd has set up 59 stores across six cities-Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune-and employs about 1,000 people to serve its customers since the US-based company's foray into the Indian sub-continent in 2012.
"We have introduced Indian-made Arabica coffee to customers in Asia and the US as a whole bean, sourced, roasted and packaged as an Indian estate blended hot beverage," Starbucks president for China and Asia-Pacific John Culver said in the statement, issued to mark its second anniversary.
Unveiled in 2013, the Starbucks India Estates Blend Arabica beans are plucked from Tata Coffee's estates in Coorg and Chickmagalur districts across the Malnad region in Karnataka, about 250 km from Bengaluru, where the aromatic beverage originated.
"The single origin blend is a fine mix of herbal and chocolate content and represents the origin of the coffee," company's chief executive Avani Davda said on the occasion.
With chains of stores the world over, the 43-year-old Starbucks is a premiere roaster and retailer of speciality coffee in the plantation commodity sector.
As part of the Tata Group, Tata Global Beverage retails Eight O'Clock Coffee in major consuming markets across Europe and the US, besides Tata Tea and Tetley.

Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
New Delhi: Auto components firm Bharat Forge today reported an 81 per cent jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 174.49 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of robust export growth.

By: Express News Service | Gandhinagar | Posted: November 10, 2014 8:55 pm
In order to publicize the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit, 2015 (VGGIS) in foreign countries, Gujarat Government sent nine IAS officers to different countries and spent around Rs 33.36 lakhs on their expenses. This was revealed by Gujarat Government before the State Assembly, on Monday, while replying to a question during the Question Hour.
Congress MLA from Thasra, Ramsinh Parmar, had asked if how many IAS officers were sent to publicize the biennial event scheduled in January next year. In reply to the question, the government said that total nine officers were sent to different foreign countries between August and September.
These officers include Atanu Chakraborty, G C Murmu, Bharat Lal, BB Swain, L Chuaungo, Kamal Dayani, Pankaj Kumar, J N Singh and A K Rakesh. In all, these officers had visited United States (West Coast), Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, United States (East Coast), Canada, UAE, Qatar, China, Hongkong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden.
The total expense of around Rs 33.36 lakhs for these foreign trips was incurred mainly on air tickets, mediclaim and daily allowances, the government replied before the assembly.

Bollywood bias: SC quashes rule that prohibits women make-up artistsPrint

Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 2:23 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 2:49 pm
The Supreme Court on Monday quashed a close to six decade old rule that prohibited a women to become a make-up artist in Indian film industry.
The court ordered deletion of the pertinent rule of Maharashtra’s trade union that allowed women to obtain memberships only as hair dressers but not as make-up artists. The logic behind the prohibition was that if women were allowed to do so, male artists won’t get any jobs.
READ: The woman who has made up for 59 years of Bollywood bias
The court held this provision to be unconstitutional and said that such a discrimination smacked of acute gender bias.
It ordered the trade union to start issuing make-up artist cards to all eligible women and further directed the police to ensure they are not harassed at all.
The order came on a petition by Charu Khurana who was denied a card.

Despite Modi vow  nearly third of Cabinet charged with rape  rioting  more* PM Narendra Modi has promised to clean up politics
* Seven of 21 new Indian ministers charged with crimes
* Corruption was key battle ground in 2014 elections
* Nearly one third of cabinet members face prosecution
Attempted murder, waging war on the state, criminal intimidation and fraud are some of the charges on the rap sheets of ministers Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed to the cabinet on Sunday, jarring with his pledge to clean up politics.
Seven of 21 new ministers face prosecution, taking the total in the 66-member cabinet to almost one third, a higher proportion than before the weekend expansion.
At least five people in the cabinet have been charged with serious offences such as rape and rioting.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said any suggestions there were criminals in the cabinet were “completely baseless.
“These are cases arising out of criminal accusations, not cases out of a crime,” he told reporters on Monday, adding that Modi had personally vetted the new ministers.
Ram Shankar Katheria, a lawmaker from Agra, was appointed junior education minister yet has been accused of more than 20 criminal offences including attempted murder and promoting religious or racial hostility.
Katheria was not immediately available for comment and a mobile phone number given by his office was switched off.
The inclusion of such politicians does not sit easily with Modi’s election promise to root out corruption, and has led to criticism that he is failing to change the political culture in India where wealthy, tainted politicians sometimes find it easier to win votes.
“It shows scant respect for the rule of law or public sentiment,” said Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which campaigns for better governance. “Including these people in the cabinet is a bad omen for our democracy.”
Modi won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in May with a promise of graft-free governance after the previous government led by Congress party was mired in a series of damaging corruption scandals.
NEW CABINET MORE TAINTED THAN OLD?
Soon after coming to power, Modi called for courts to fast track cases against politicians in an effort to curb political criminality in the world’s largest democracy. Cases in India’s overstretched judicial system often drag on for years.
Yet Modi’s cabinet includes twice as many politicians facing criminal charges as the previous Congress party one.
Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the new junior chemicals and fertilizer minister, was another eye-catching choice. He is charged with around 20 offences, including intent to wage war against India, criminal intimidation and abetting a mutiny.
Ahir did not respond to requests for comment, and it was not immediately clear what incidents the more serious charges pertained to. His secretary said the cases were politically motivated.
Ahir is best known for helping unearth corruption in the coal industry while he served on a parliamentary committee.
Shrikant Sharma, a spokesman for Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it was up to courts to decide if ministers were guilty, and said many of the charges related to political rivalries.
The BJP is led by Amit Shah, the closest aide of Modi, who is accused of ordering police to carry out three extrajudicial killings and running an extortion racket when he served under Modi as home minister in Gujarat almost a decade ago.
He has denied the charges. He is facing a trial in Mumbai.
The number of lawmakers charged with offences has more than doubled in the last two decades. About a third of federal and state legislators face charges, the ADR said.
Politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win an election as their untainted peers, making them the preferred choice of candidates for political parties in India, according to a study published last year by the group.
In office, these politicians are sometimes accused of enriching themselves or their backers by siphoning off money from government spending.
“We hear again and again the country’s leaders promise to clean up the system,” said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation. “Self interest prevails over principles. That is why the system never changes.”

Manjhi targets BJP over corruption  rape chargesLetters to  the editor

India will cross 6 pct GDP growth: JayantNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Expressing confidence that India will cross 6 per cent GDP growth in 2015-16, the new Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha today said the priority of the government will be job creation and inflation management.
“We are expecting the growth to pick up and be on the accelerating trajectory. Hopefully we will cross 6-6.5 per cent next year,” Sinha told reporters soon after taking charge.
He further said the economy will return to 7-8 per cent sustainable growth trajectory in the coming years.
The economic growth slumped to 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 and is estimated to be between 5.4-5.9 per cent in current fiscal.
The 51-year old Sinha, an IIT-Delhi and Harvard alumnus, was inducted as the Minister of State during the expansion of Union Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday.
Sinha also expressed hope that the government will be able to push the Insurance Bill and the Constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) during the Winter session of Parliament beginning November 24.
Referring to the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, he said: “when it comes to Parliament we are confident that we will get the support that we require”.
As regards GST, Sinha said: “that itself has gone through years and years of preparation and consensus building … We are sure will be able to show some positive results in this session”.
On fiscal situation, he said, it was well in hand and the government is monitoring the situation very closely with respect to tax collections.
Referring to the priorities of the government, he said they have already been articulated by the Prime minister and the Finance Minister.
“First, creating jobs is very important for us and for the economy. The second area that we have emphasised and we have done well on is obviously managing inflation and price rise, which has been a major election issue and I think we have done remarkably well on that,” Sinha said, adding it was necessary to get the investment cycle moving.
Earlier, he was briefed by senior officials in the Ministry soon after taking charge. He assumes office at a time when the Ministry is preparing the Budget for 2015-16.
“We have been fortunate to have tailwinds of lower oil prices which are going to help on the expenditure side. So when we take into account we are very confident that we will be able to achieve our fiscal targets,” he said.
Sinha was elected to the Lok Sabha in May this year from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand.
His career has seen him work as an investment fund manager and management consultant.

(Proposals for listing of…)
NEW DELHI: The IPO market has not been able to match the bullish sentiment in the overall equity space, but year 2015 may well be the year which will have something for retail investors.
The state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, said a top government official on Monday. According to experts, the big bang announcement by the government are likely to keep the momentum alive for markets.
"The government has been providing positive and constructive news on a consistent basis in terms of both its vision and how it wishes to implement it. The changes the prime minister announced in his cabinet are quite exciting. I must say they are very good in terms of how the market sees it," says Ashok Wadhwa, MD & CEO, Ambit Holdings Pvt Ltd.
"So long as the government continues to take these administrative as well as legislative steps, the market will continue to receive these changes with a positive sentiment," he adds.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said that the privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy , released by Raju here.
Pawan Hans Ltd was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51 per cent with the Government of India and 49 per cent with state-run ONGC, said a PTI report.
However, year 2014 has not been all that great for given the fact that as a little over Rs 1,000 crore was raised through public offers in the first half of 2014-15.
According to Prime Database, as many as 25 companies have collectively mopped up a meagre Rs 1,019 crore through initial public offers (IPOs) during the April-September period of the current fiscal (2014-15), PTI reported.
At present, five companies planning to raise Rs 1,240 crore are holding Sebi's approval and another 11 firms intending to mop up Rs 4,707 crore have filed draft documents with market regulator and are awaiting its approval.
We have collated list of top stock offering which are likely to come up in the next 12 months:

Aster Health lines up 3 banks for Rs 1200 cr IPO

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened rules for so-called "shadow banks", raising minimum capital requirements and restricting deposits with a set of changes that it hopes will protect consumers and the market without stifling growth.
India's non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd provide a variety of banking services for both firms and individuals. They have been lending heavily to sectors like infrastructure at a time when traditional banks are held back by, among other things, hefty bad loans.
But NBFCs do not hold full banking licences and are not subject to the tougher rules imposed on commercial banks.
The RBI, which has long warned of the risks posed by unregulated financial firms, said on Monday that their growth meant NBFCs could now pose risks to the broader market. A senior RBI official said in September that the bank recognises roughly 12,000 registered NBFCs.
"NBFCs are now deeply interconnected with the entities in the financial sector," the RBI said in a statement on Monday.
"Being financial entities, they are as exposed to risks arising out of counterparty failures, funding and asset concentration, interest rate movement and risks pertaining to liquidity and solvency, as any other financial sector player."
The new rules are meant to replace a set of loose guidelines that had previously governed the NBFC sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years.
Analysts estimate NBFCs account for about 12 per cent of the total assets in the country's financial sector.
The RBI tightened Tier 1 capital requirements and said NBFCs would need to hold capital levels of at least Rs 1 crore ($162,668) by the end of March 2016 and Rs 2 crore by end-March 2017 to avoid losing their right to operate.
The apex bank also said only certain investment-grade NBFCs would be allowed to take deposits, saying the firms would have until the end of March 2016 to acquire a credit rating. It capped deposit-taking at 1.5 times the size of a firm's minimum capital - down from four times previously.
The RBI said the new rules would address risks posed by these firms "without impeding the dynamism displayed by NBFCs".
An executive at one of the country's biggest NBFC said the RBI would continue to tighten rules.
"RBI is slowly and steadily removing all kinds of arbitrage possible," he said, declining to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.
"To that extent, I am more inclined to believe, this is not the last of it."

Defiant Uddhav Thackeray s Shiv Sena delivers yet another snub to BJPLetters to  the editor
Putting an end to speculation over its participation in the BJP-led government in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena today decided to sit in the Opposition, a day after serving an ultimatum to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to come clear within two days on taking NCP support for survival of its minority dispensation.
The sudden move came on a day when NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his party’s decision to extend outside support to the Devendra Fadnavis government during the crucial trust vote on November 12.
A letter from Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray seeking the post of Leader of Opposition for its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde was delivered to the state Assembly Secretary Anant Kalse, party spokesperson Neelam Gorhe told reporters.
“A letter written by our President Uddhav Thackeray was submitted to Anant Kalse informing him that Eknath Shinde has been appointed as the leader of the Shiv Sena Legislature Party.
“Since we are the second largest party in the House with 63 MLAs, it is appropriate to appoint our leader as Leader of Opposition. We expect Shinde’s name to be announced as early as possible,” she said.
After boycotting the first expansion of the Union Council of Ministers and recalling Rajya Sabha member Anil Desai, who too was to be sworn-in as a minister yesterday, from Delhi airport, Uddhav had last evening served an ultimatum to BJP asking it to make clear its stand on taking NCP’s support to bail out the government in Maharashtra.
“If we don’t get a satisfactory answer (from BJP) in next two days, we will sit in Opposition,” Uddhav had said last evening after a meeting of party legislators where he appointed Shinde as their leader.
As Pawar, whose party has 41 MLAs in the Assembly, held forth on the reason for extending outside support to the Fadnavis government at a news conference, Sena, apparently peeved at lack of response from BJP to its ultimatum, made up its mind to occupy the space of the main Opposition party.
BJP, following promise of NCP’s support, reacted to Sena’s move with self-assurance, saying, “It is their right” and “who had asked them to join government?”
“Since they have got the largest number of seats among Opposition parties, it is their right to have the Leader of Opposition’s post. We extend them our best wishes,” Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse told reporters.
When asked how BJP with 121 MLAs will be able to prove a majority in the House which has an effective strength of 287, Khadse said, “We can’t reveal our strategy, but you will see on Wednesday we will win a comfortable majority and run the state comfortably.”
“There are several options. Many people have met and said they will vote for us… be with us,” he said.
Pawar told a press conference that the decision to back the minority government was “conscious and collective” and not part of a “hidden deal” with BJP.
“We have not discussed our decision with any one. It was a conscious and collective decision in the larger interest of the state. Nobody asked us for our support. BJP is free to not accept our support,” he said.
Pawar said since Congress and NCP were not in a position to provide an alternative government, the only way to avoid a fresh poll was to back the BJP dispensation.
“The number game is such that there is no (possibility of) alternative arrangement. We don’t want the state to go for another election immediately,” he said.
Rubbishing suggestions that NCP had lent unconditional outside support to the BJP government as part of a “hidden deal”, Pawar said, “The government is free to investigate all the charges and allegations against NCP leaders so the truth can come out. If its decisions or bills are not people oriented, we will not support the government.”
“Even though NCP will not destabilise the government, it will play the role of an effective Opposition,” he said.
However, the wily Maratha leader appeared to put a question mark on the longevity of the BJP government when he said he had never claimed it will last its full term.
“I never said this government would last for 5 years,” he said, replying to a query, adding, “we will be a formidable opposition.”
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition, the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
Several attempts were made by leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena over the last few days for a rapprochement between the two Hindutva fellow travellers but finally all came to a nought.
Uddhav’s last-minute arrival at the swearing-in ceremony of the Fadnavis government had revived hopes of a reunion but the two parties could not iron out their differences over Sena’s demand for Deputy Chief Minister’s post and a substantial share in the ministerial pie and key portfolios.
It is not clear yet whether Sena will pull out its lone member Anant Geete from the Union Cabinet and sit in Opposition in Lok Sabha too.
The two parties have been sharing power in the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for a log time and there is still no clarity on whether they will continue their alliance in the civic body or part ways.

Pakistan schools association observe  I am not Malala  dayPakistan schools' association observe 'I am not Malala' Day
PTI

A network of private schools in Pakistan on Monday observed 'I am not Malala' day to condemn Nobel laureate and teenage girls rights activist for her alleged support for controversial British novelist Salman Rushdie.
Malala Yousafzai, 17, shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 in Pakistan's northwestern town of Mingora, won Nobel Peace Prize 2014 with 60-year-old Indian anti-child labour activist Kailash Satyarthi.
All Pakistan Private Schools Federation, which last year banned the Malala's memoir "I am Malala", organised the "I am not Malala" day.
In a statement, the federation president Mirza Kashif Ali alleged that "Malala has nexus with Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin". He said Malala's book, written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was too sympathetic to Rushdie.
Ali said Rushdie's book was clearly "anti-Islam" and by supporting him, Malala has joined his club. "We severely condemned the chapter of the book in which Rushdie's book has been mentioned as freedom of expression by Malala while referring to father's views," said Ali.
Rushdie's book The Static Verses in 1989 created a storm in Muslim world. Bangladeshi author Nasrin was accused by radical Muslims of blasphemy over her novel "Lajja" in 1994.
Malala, who lives in Britain where she went for treatment after the Taliban attack, won worldwide acclaim for her campaign advocating education for girls in Pakistan.
However, some conservative circles in Pakistan allege that she was being used by the West. It is also believed that the private school might be targeting her to create sympathy among the Taliban who have destroyed hundreds of schools in the country.

Hyderabad, November 10:  
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and Origo Commodities, a collateral management firm, have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to realize better pricing for their harvest.
This will be done by providing them a facility for pledging their produce under Negotiable Warehouse Receipt financing. Origo allows farmers to make deposits of their produce in its warehouses and obtain pledge financing.
Timely help
“This MoU is going to help farmers to a great extent by realising the right price by offering them options to sell their produce at the right time. The initiative also focuses on Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) accreditation so that farmers can benefit from post-harvest loans at 7% p.a. with interest subvention,’’ Jiji Mammen, Chief General Manager, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Regional Office, Nabard said on Monday.
The joint would enable farmers to use the warehousing infrastructure of Primary Agriculture Co-operative Societies (PACS) and also more than 100 warehouses managed by Origo Commodities across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
Sunoor Kaul, Director, Origo Commodities said: ``The initiative will yield significant benefits for farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The key to success will be to make rural infrastructure accessible to farmers on the post-harvest side.’’
Origo Commodities will also extend its support in creating multiple integrated marketing platforms and storage infrastructure to sustain the activities of PACS and FPOs on post-harvest side, he added.

Number of foreign official visits for Government officers restricted to 4Number of foreign official visits for Government officers restricted to 4
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 10:  
Officials will now be able to make only four foreign official trips annually. Continuing with its austerity measures the Finance Ministry on Monday clarified that number of official visit abroad by a Government official is now restricted to four.
It also said that foreign travel of Government officers at the cost of public sector undertakings will be discouraged. The Ministry has issued a clarification with regard to an office memorandum issued on October 29, which was silent on number of trips.
The austerity measures included cut in non plan expenditure (barring certain items such as interest payment, salary & pension, defence etc.) by 10 per cent, no travel by first class, no creation of new posts besides others. These measures are aimed to check the fiscal deficit to budget target of 4.1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.
“For visit exceeding four by an officer, detailed justification would need to be furnished and such visits would be allowed only in exceptional cases depending on the functional need,” the circular said.
It also said that proposals for participation in any conferences, seminars, conventions, work shops, study tours or presentation of papers abroad at Government cost will not be entertained except those that are fully funded by sponsoring or inviting organisations. These may be “considered keeping in mind the public interest and Government business at home,” it said.
The Ministry has instructed that only appropriate officer dealing with subject of the conference should travel and not the officers at higher level. “Visits at the level of Secretaries should be planned only if their presence is essential and officers of or the level of Additional Secretary or Joint Secretary cannot substitute them for the purpose of enunciating Government policies or standpoint,” it said.
Although foreign travel at the cost of PSU will be discouraged, but can be undertaken specifically in connection with the affairs of the concerned company. “Specific reasons for charging the expenditure of the PSU on account of foreign travel must be spelt in the proposal,” the clarification said.

Coonoor tea planter comes up with solution to cut chemical fertilisers useCoonoor tea planter comes up with solution to cut chemical fertilisers’ use
Pratim Ranjan Bose
Tweet
Kolkata. November 10:  
At a time when the Indian tea industry is dogged by a host of issues concerning chemical residue; a Coonoor-based planter came up with a pilot project proposal that, he claims, should reduce use of chemical fertiliser by half and double the yield.
According to N Lakshmanan, director of Golden Hill Tea Estate in Nilgiri, the current method of broadcasting nitrogenous fertilisers (applying by hand on the surface) is both wasteful and leads to soil toxicity.
Water soluble fertiliser, if kept in the open loses efficiency due to volatilisation. Also part of the nutrients are swept away (leaching) by rain and irrigation.
Lakhsmanan says the loss is significant and can be reduced by injecting fertiliser directly at the roots, 6-8 inches under the soil, at a suitable time when the plants are most active.
The process is easier said than done. A tea bush releases specific enzymes through its roots to collect the nutrients from soil for two hours a day. This is referred as nitrate reductase activity. Manuring can be most effective, if fertilisers are injected during that two hour window.
Lakhsmanan proposes, the biotechnology department of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras should spearhead the pilot project to determine the exact time of nitrate redutase activity of each plant.
The information will be fed into a software - to be developed by Golden Hill Tea Estate – for further use of a programmable logical controller that will send radio signals to activate automatic drip irrigation machines, for due injection of manure.
The planter held preliminary discussions with the Israeli major, Netafim, for the drip irrigation. Texas-based National Instruments are proposed to be roped in to supply the logical controller.
Based on a concept note, submitted last month; the Tea Board has evinced initial interest in the project subject to submission of further details including the costs per hectare for the pilot study.
Lakhsmanan says he will meet all the partners in the proposed project in a week to prepare the detailed project proposal to seek Tea Board funding in the project.

Climate change: India to keep up pressure on first worldWill press for funding, tech transfer pledges at Peru meet
New Delhi, November 10:  
India will remain firm on its demand for greater commitments by developed countries at the UN conference on Climate Change in Peru, in December.
“We are clear on our position and remain firm that developed countries have to make financial commitments on the principle of historic responsibility as well as commit to technology transfer to developing nations,” a senior official in the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change told BusinessLine.
Subsequent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit there were talks within environmental lobbies as well as a section of the Government that India is likely to soften its stance. But the official said that the basic stance on the matter will remain unchanged.
A possible change, if at all it happens at the December meet, will be on India’s emission targets as a quid pro quo. India may agree to increase its emission targets.
Critical meet
The upcoming talks in Peru are critical since during the next Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in Paris, all the signatories, including India, are expected to arrive at a binding and universal agreement on climate change efforts.
While developed countries are yet to reveal their cards, India is gearing up for the negotiations. Recently, the PM’s Council on Climate Change, which had been defunct for three years, was reconstituted to include key officials involved in climate negotiations such as JM Mauskar and retired diplomat Chandrashekhar Dasgupta.
If India were to soften its stance, other least-developed countries in the Southern hemisphere will face a major setback.
India and China are the two biggest and most powerful countries, economically and politically, in this region.
Taking the lead
India has been leading the developing and least developed countries at climate change negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC).
At the UNCCC meeting last year, India had walked out along with more than 100 developing countries following the refusal by developed countries to agree to a mechanism for compensation for climate change-induced disasters.
Under the 2009 Copenhagen pledge, developed countries had assured a sum of $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate effects of climate change and also cut emissions.
However, since then, developed countries have been pressurising developing countries to commit to binding emission cuts, adaptation measures and others, which they are not bound to till now.
India, along with other developing countries, has been insisting that the developed world first honour promises over critical issues such as financial aid and technology transfer.

Manohar Parrikar demands Rs 10 royalty for photo!Letters to  the editor
As the journalists jostled to take pictures of Manohar Parrikar, after he filed his nomination for Rajya Sabha elections from Uttar Pradesh today, the new Defence Minister jokingly asked Rs 10 as royalty.
“Now if anyone takes the picture I will charge Rs 10 as royalty,” he said in a lighter vein as the photo journalists almost stormed the podium in the conference hall.
On being asked by the journalists to speak in Hindi Parrikar said,”I know Hindi, but it is not very good. I will learn Hindi in three-four months as I myself don’t like to mix English words.”
When a journalist raised that no new Sainik School had been set up in Uttar Pradesh after formation of Uttarakhand the minister said,”Now I belong to this place, the Prime Minister and the Home Minister are from here. Whatever we can do from army point of view we will do it, you need not worry.”

US lobbyists lose fire ahead of trade intellectual property reviewUS lobbyists lose fire ahead of trade intellectual property review
Aesha Datta/Amiti Sen
Better India-US relations, support of America Inc give India the advantage
New Delhi, November 10:  
The US pharmaceutical lobby seems to have become less aggressive in its efforts to make India tighten its intellectual property norms to give more protection to their own industry.
In a recent proposal sent to the US Trade Representative (USTR), which is carrying out an investigation into India’s intellectual property regime, the Global Intellectual Property Centre (GIPC), an arm of the US Chambers, has refrained from talking about any sanctions against the country. The same body, however, had asked for India to be listed as a priority country as late as April this year.
Strong position
A Health Ministry official said that this change in posturing could have come from the realisation that the US pharma lobby cannot force India to do anything that it does not want to do, especially when India is compliant with international norms.
“The fact is that they (US) are scared. They understand that we have a strong position as far as negotiations in this matter are concerned,” an official in the Health Ministry said, adding that while the US had been threatening sanctions, it had avoided taking the matter to the World Trade Organisation, for resolution of the demand.
“We are TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights)-compliant and have a very good case,” the official said.
GIPC, however, has not made any allowances in the demands that it had been putting forward.
More importantly, GIPC maintains that India needs to commit to not using compulsory licensing for commercial purposes.
But this is a demand that it cannot force on India as the TRIPS has a provision for compulsory licensing and many countries have resorted to it to prevent misuse of patents.
The US itself has taken steps to help its citizens by allowing import of ‘Lipodox’, a chemotherapeutic drug, as a replacement for ovarian cancer medicine, Doxil, due to shortage. Further, even when it did not present a “national emergency”, the USTR favoured mobile phone maker Apple in a case where Samsung had alleged infringement of US patent.
Corporate support
DG Shah, Secretary General of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said in April, when the USTR came out with its 2014 Special 301 Report, several US corporations, such as Boeing, Honeywell and Corning, filed their submissions in favour of India, expressing satisfaction with the IPR environment in the country.
Further, pharmaceutical companies such as Abott and Gilead have also remained focused on India and have announced new partnerships in the country, displaying their confidence.
These measures by US companies, besides the support of global academics and civil society, have resulted in making the case of US lobbyists weaker and resulted in a dilution of their demands for sanctions.
“Now, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi having visited the US and the US Government being positive about talks with India, a downgrade (to a priority foreign country) isn’t likely. At the most India will remain on the out-of-cycle reviews (the next one will take place in 2015),” Shah said.
“However, when bilateral talks are already being looked into there is no need for such unilateral measures. I think India will look at asking to be taken out of these reviews,” he added.
‘Priority’ nation
Officials in the Commerce Ministry agree. They say the threat to list India as a ‘Priority Foreign Country’ is unjustified as the category is reserved for very serious offenders of intellectual property.
On the issue of compulsory licences raised by US companies, officials say India has given such a licence just once and it was done after due diligence and strictly on the basis of rules laid down.
India could file a dispute against the US at the WTO if it takes unilateral action against it. “We are ready to discuss with US officials there concerns at the bilateral level. But we cannot support unilateral investigations,” the official said.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Lavasa Corporation, the realty arm of construction major HCC, has received approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for raising Rs 750 crore through initial public offering (IPO).
The company had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the capital market regulator in July this year for the proposed public offer.
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Prior to that, Sebi had sought clarification on two instances from Lavasa's lead manager, Axis Capital Ltd, regarding the company's proposed IPO.
The company is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares in 'Lavasa' near Pune. This is its second effort to hit the capital market. In November 2010, Lavasa had received the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan.
As per initial papers, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The HCC group, which has a 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

2G scam: Chidambaram  blames  Manmohan  Bharadwaj takes offenceNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Senior Congress leader H R Bharadwaj today attacked former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for blaming ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the 2G spectrum scam issue and instead accused him of being “solely responsible”.
A former Union Minister and a Governor, he disputed Chidambaram’s contentions on the 2G issue and said that if he had defended the treasury well as Finance Minister, then this scam would not have happened.
“I don’t think what Chidambaram is saying is the correct thing. It’s absolutely to the contrary. The Prime Minister had indicated to all the ministers that the 2G matter should be dealt with transparency.
“He (Manmohan) has done meticulous service to the country. Chidambaram is no match for him. His honesty, integrity is internationally recognised,” Bharadwaj said.
Bharadwaj, who had been at one time a Union Minister along with Chidambaram, even claimed that the latter was never a Congress man.
“Tell me when was he (a Congressman)? He has always been changing parties. To make him the Finance Minister, every person used to bring him to the forefront,” he said.
“Chidambaram used to browbeat everyone on the basis of his language and education. I have seen his performance everywhere. In 2G, he is solely responsible,” he claimed.
Replying to a question whether Priyanka Gandhi should be brought forward to revive the party, he said “I request the Congress leadership to bring her forward immediately.”
Earlier, Chidambaram had said the UPA government could have handled the 2G spectrum allocation case better.
“The CAG report on 2G and other issues,” Chidambaram had said, “clearly …hurt the Congress party. I think 2G could have been handled differently in the sense that the Prime Minister could have put his foot down and said I am sorry, I will not let you go forward with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) route.
“Or after licences had been granted and issue was brought up, he could have said cancel licences without waiting for the judgement. It hurt us. My personal view was once this came out as a scandal of bandwidth allotment, the government should have cancelled all the licences without waiting for the Supreme Court (judgement),” Chidambaram had said.

In his longest foreign tour after becoming PM, Modi will leave for Myanmar on Tuesday to take part in the India-ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit on November 12-13 followed by the G-20 meet in Brisbane on November 15-16 and a bilateral visit to Fiji Islands on November 19.
Modi will meet more than 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and the Pacific Region during his 10-day tour.
India will attempt to build consensus on a global framework for automatic sharing of information to check tax evasion during the G-20 Summit, at a time the government has stepped up efforts to bring back money stashed illegally abroad. Modi’s visit will be the bilateral visit to Australia by an Indian PM in 28 years.
“The G-20 Summit is a key forum for countries to coordinate their activities and pursue collective action to support global economic growth, stable financial markets and global trading regimes,” Modi said on the eve of his foreign tour.
He said he would also discuss how the creation of next generation infrastructure could be accelerated, including digital infrastructure.
He said a closer strategic partnership with Australia would support India’s economic goals, promote its security interests, including maritime security, and reinforce efforts to foster peace and stability in the extended continental and maritime neighbourhood.
On the Myanmar tour, Modi said ASEAN was at the core of India’s Act East Policy and the dream of an Asian century. “I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level,” the PM said.
At the East Asia Summit, the PM will discuss with other leaders ways to strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace and stability.
Modi will be the first Indian PM to visit Fiji in 33 years. “We owe them (Fiji) a debt of gratitude for hosting our scientists on the island in support of our Mars Mission.” He will meet leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations during the visit.

New Delhi has been ranked 25th among the world’s ‘Most Fun’ cities with Germany’s capital Berlin topping the survey.
New Delhi, the only Indian city to make the top 25 cut, was chosen among over 1,800 cities surveyed across the globe.
The Indian capital ranked high for its sports clubs, shopping and bars in ‘The Ultimate Fun City Ranking’ report commissioned by ‘GetYourOwnGuide’ and ‘GoEuro’ travel firms.

Of the total 1,830 cities, Berlin topped the rankings for its all-round attractiveness of bars and museums, followed by London, Paris, New York and Tokyo.

8 ministers of new PM Modi Cabinet declare criminal casesCrime slur on nearly a third of Modi cabinet

Attempted murder, waging war on the state, criminal intimidation and fraud are some of the charges on the rap sheets of ministers Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed to the cabinet on Sunday, jarring with his pledge to clean up politics.

Seven of 21 new ministers face prosecution, taking the total in the 66-member cabinet to almost one third, a higher proportion than before the weekend expansion. At least five people in the cabinet have been charged with serious offences such as rape and rioting.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said any suggestions there were criminals in the cabinet were "completely baseless".
"These are cases arising out of criminal accusations, not cases out of a crime," he told reporters on Monday, adding that Modi had personally vetted the new ministers.
Ram Shankar Katheria, a lawmaker from Agra, was appointed junior education minister yet has been accused of more than 20 criminal offences including attempted murder and promoting religious or racial hostility.
Katheria was not immediately available for comment and a mobile phone number given by his office was switched off.
The inclusion of such politicians does not sit easily with Modi's election promise to root out corruption, and has led to criticism that he is failing to change the political culture in India where wealthy, tainted politicians sometimes find it easier to win votes.
"It shows scant respect for the rule of law or public sentiment," said Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which campaigns for better governance. "Including these people in the cabinet is a bad omen for our democracy."
Modi won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in May with a promise of graft-free governance after the previous government led by Congress party was mired in a series of damaging corruption scandals.
New cabinet more tainted than old?
Soon after coming to power, Modi called for courts to fast track cases against politicians in an effort to curb political criminality in the world's largest democracy.
Yet Modi's cabinet includes twice as many politicians facing criminal charges as the previous Congress party one.
Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the new junior chemicals and fertilizer minister, was another eye-catching choice. He is charged with around 20 offences, including intent to wage war against India, criminal intimidation and abetting a mutiny.
Ahir did not respond to requests for comment, and it was not immediately clear what incidents the more serious charges pertained to. His secretary said the cases were politically motivated.
Ahir is best known for helping unearth corruption in the coal industry while he served on a parliamentary committee. Shrikant Sharma, a spokesperson for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it was up to courts to decide if ministers were guilty, and said many of the charges related to political rivalries.
The BJP is led by Amit Shah, who is accused of ordering police to carry out three extrajudicial killings and running an extortion racket when he served under Modi as home minister in Gujarat almost a decade ago.
He has denied the charges. He is facing a trial in Mumbai. The number of lawmakers charged with offences has more than doubled in the last two decades. About a third of federal and state legislators face charges, the ADR said.
Politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win an election as their untainted peers, making them the preferred choice of candidates for political parties in India, according to a study published last year by the group.
In office, these politicians are sometimes accused of enriching themselves or their backers by siphoning off money from government spending.
"We hear again and again the country's leaders promise to clean up the system," said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation. "Self interest prevails over principles. That is why the system never changes."

Kolkata: Saradha funded Messi match  confirms probeComments
A government agency that tracks corporate frauds has called for a CBI probe against West Bengal sports minister Madan Mitra and Kolkata Police chief Surajit Kar Purkayastha, among others in the multi-crore Saradha scandal.
Argentina's Lionel Messi (R) and Venezuela's Fernando Amorebieta fight for the ball during their international friendly soccer match in Kolkata.
In its 516-page report, accessed by HT, the serious fraud investigation office (SFIO), has recommended that the CBI “take further action” on allegations against Mitra, a close aide of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and Purakayasta.
An investigative arm of the ministry of corporate affairs, the SFIO based its report on depositions of suspended Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh , who is behind bars.
“While the evidence is not sufficient to frame any charge, however, since the CBI is looking into the larger conspiracy angle of the Saradha scam, it is recommended that the matter be referred to CBI for necessary investigation and further action at its end,” says the report.
Ghosh has submitted some pictures that show Mitra and Purakayasta at various Saradha group events. Also, Ghosh “has affirmed that very high profile personalities drawn from politics and bureaucracy were associated with the Saradha group publicly and shared stage with Sudipta Sen”, says the report.
Moreover, Saradha group chairman Sen, who has since been arrested, claimed that he had bought a Ferrari for Mitra’s son while Mitra allegedly took money from Sen to repair temples in his constituency and to hold a football match, involving Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi.
When reached for comments, Mitra said, “I won’t tell you anything. If some investigative agency summons me, I shall tell them. I’m ready to face any investigation.”  Purakayastha did not respond to HT’s calls or text messages.
“I can’t make any comments. Moreover, I haven’t seen the report you are referring to. I haven’t seen such reports anywhere, and they hardly have any credibility,” Bengal health minister Subrata Mukherjee said.
The report also recommends further CBI probe against a former Doordarshan director general and former Bengal top cop Rajat Majumdar, who has been arrested.
Last year, the Centre ordered a multi-agency probe into the activities of Kolkata-based Saradha group of companies in a scandal involving around `20,000 crore. The company’s promoters and top executives were accused by angry investors of creating a web of companies across several states in eastern India to dupe small depositors.
Its flagship company, Saradha Realty, collected `2,459 crore from hundreds of thousands of people, promising astronomical returns. It didn’t return the maturity value to the investors and closed down its offices without paying employees. The group went bust in April 2013.
From Assam, former Union minister Matang Sinh and former state transport minister Anjan Dutta are among those whose names figured in the list sent by the SFIO to the CBI for “necessary investigation and further action”.
Sinh was not available for comments. But Dutta said, “It was a completely business deal. I am a victim. His (Sen’s) cheque for `3.5 crore has been dishonoured. I have given all the evidence to the CBI.”
Besides the SFIO, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate are also investigating the scandal.

Vishal Sikka bets on Labs to reinvent Infy & to compete with rivals like IBM & AccentureVishal Sikka bets on Labs to reinvent Infosys & to compete with rivals like IBM & Accenture

Accenture
("Infosys should follow…)
BENGALURU: Infosys Labs, the research and development arm of India's second-largest software exporter, will be the centrepiece of chief executive officer Vishal Sikka's efforts aimed at reviving the Bengaluru-based parent as a nextgeneration services company.
Infosys Labs will seek to implement disruptive technologies, including artificial intelligence and automation, by forging partnerships with companies engaged in these areas.
"We are now focusing more on automation and in future, on our mission learning, artificial intelligence... those again will be driven by Infosys Labs," said UB Pravin Rao, chief operating officer of Infosys. The engineering will be done by Infosys Labs and deployment by the business units, he said.
Infosys' focus on R&D mirrors the strategy adopted by global rivals, including IBM and Accenture , which have testing centres to help them keep pace with changing trends in technology. The effort is yet another attempt by Infosys to change the fortunes of its unit, which was set up in 1999. Since the return of founder NR Narayana Murthy in 2013 to steer the company, Infosys Labs has tried to reposition itself, leading some to believe it is fighting an "existential crisis."
In the past 18 months, Infosys has significantly reduced the workforce of Infosys Labs, leading even to the exit of its head Subrahmanyam Goparaju in December last year. Rao said a leader for Infosys Labs will be found in the next six months.
According to some experts, Infosys should follow an approach under which the talent at Labs is able to roll out next-generation technologies into parent Infosys, where Sikka took over as CEO and managing director in August.
"Vishal's decision to make automation and artificial intelligence a placeholder and reference point for leading Infosys back to its erstwhile glory is a prudent move. But crucially, it needs to be followed up by a coherent strategy and executives being able to drive these levers through the organisation," said Tom Reuner, an analyst at Ovum, a London-based IT research firm.
"For effective execution, you need strong frontline and engagement teams that understand the value the underlying AI technologies bring to specific client engagements," said Uday Chinta, India managing director of IPsoft , a New Yorkbased company that relies on artificial intelligence to manage computer networks. Infosys already has a revenuesharing partnership with IPsoft, which claims its software is capable of providing basic infrastructure management support services with limited human intervention.
Earlier, Infosys Labs was positioned on a "medium to longterm kind of thing" but of late, Infosys has started re-purposing it with a "short- to mediumterm" focus, Rao said in an interview to ET. As part of this strategy, one of the other focus areas for Infosys Labs will be to take some of the "cutting edge technologies" to help clients.

Number of women execs taking GMAT at all-tim...Australia
(The total number of women…)
MUMBAI: With Indian and global multinationals wanting more women in their workforce, seasoned women executives appear to be keen to re-skill. According to the latest data from Graduate Management Admission Council , which conducts the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the number of women from India taking the test in the age group of 25-40 years, who are mostly professionals with work experience, have risen to an all-time high with a 14% increase year on year.
The total number of women from India appearing for the GMAT also hit an all-time high in 2014, with a 17% increase in July-June 2014, compared with the same period a year ago. This compares with a 12% increase in the number of GMAT test takers (men and women combined) from TY2013 to TY2014, suggesting that the pace of growth of women test takers from India has surpassed the growth in the total number of Indian test takers (men and women combined). The total number of women also include a 20.2% increase in the number of women in the age group below 25.
GMAC data is presented in testing years. A testing year (TY) runs from July 1 to June 30, mirroring the academic year. "Most large and evolved organisations are taking a much greater interest in furthering the career of women. There is a lot more conviction and seriousness around their careers," says Amitabh Jhingan, partner and education sector leader at consulting firm EY. That is driving this uptick in the number of women professionals wanting to re-skill, he adds.
The top 10 Destinations to which Indian citizens, both men and women, sent their scores in TY 2014 include US (55.4%), India (6.2%), Singapore (6.6%), UK (5.8%), Canada (5.1%), France (4.7%), Spain (1.4%), Australia (1.0%), Germany (0.8%), and Hong Kong (0.7%).
"We wanted more women to come into this. Whoever we talk to - corporate recruiters, business schools - all want more women...We started systematically with candidate outreach in campuses, particularly those that are womenonly. We talked to them about GMAT as an option to study abroad and in India," says Ashish Bhardwaj, vice president - Asia Pacific at GMAC. The GMAT exam is valid for admission into masters, MBA and executive MBA in India and abroad. The test scores are valid for five years.
The 14% increase in the number of women test takers in the age group of 25-40 years could also suggest that pressures of marriage and motherhood are no longer forbidding mid-level women professionals from opting for further education.
The increase is a clear pointer that women's aspiration and confidence levels have gone up, which in turn is boosted by a feeling that their aspirations will be met. This also means more women will be hired, says Saundarya Rajesh, founder and head of Avtar Career Creators, a talent strategy consulting firm. "We have seen that this hiring sentiment of organisations has gone up in the past 6-8 months and more importantly, the intent to hire women has gone up... This is also a clear indication that more women are wanting to be hired. That is (seen in) the trend of women returning to the workplace," she adds.
The focus is shifting from technology to behavioural and leadership skills as one grows. "Corporate India has raised the benchmark on their expectations from potential talent available in the market. Also, upskilling is essential at varied levels of career progression," says Gayathri Ramamurthy, lead - diversity and inclusion at Capgemini India.
Also, there are more women role models, which could be prompting an increasing number of women professionals to reskill. "There are many more women in the CEO/CXO position than five years ago," says Savita Mahajan, deputy dean, ISB.
Besides sectors like banking and finance, which have been seeing women at senior levels for a few years, e-commerce and technology services are also seeing more women, she adds.
Another motivator could be the increase in the number of young women getting into start-ups and entrepreneurial situations, says Mahajan.
Moreover, with an increasing number of multinational companies setting up their offices in India and strengthening the support system for women in the form of flexible work policies, work from home, sabbatical and sometimes even corporate sponsorship, there is this growing trend of women professionals wanting to up-skill, said experts. "Gender is very much a part of agenda for the MNCs outside and they are bringing it to India as well," says Mahajan.

Options running out  Shiv Sena stakes claim for Leader of Oppostion inMaharashtraPrint

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that his party would stake claim to the post of Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly, but maintained that they were still open to talks with the BJP.
“We have submitted a letter staking claim to the post of Leader of Opposition. In today’s scenario, no one has faith in each other. The Congress has already staked claim to the post. If we wait any longer, we will be neither here, nor there. However, we can still have discussions with the BJP. If the alliance with BJP has to happen, it will, else we will sit in the opposition,” Thackeray said at a function held at Rangsharda in suburban Mumbai.
He added, “My patience should not be seen as a sign of helplessness. The power of those who are speaking against Hindus is growing and we do not want the forces of Hindutva to get divided.”
Senior Sena leaders Diwakar Raote, Ramdas Kadam and Eknath Shinde submitted a letter to the Principal Secretary of the state legislature to stake claim to the post.
Earlier in the day, Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said, “The talks that were being held between Uddhav saheb and Amit Shah have stopped. We are going to play the role of the opposition.”
With its relationship with the BJP deteriorating, Sena sought to take a more hardline Hindutva approach. Referring to the NCP’s offer for support, Thackeray asked the BJP whether it wanted to take help from those who supported terror and had paid money to the family of Ishrat Jahan. After Minority Affairs Minister Eknath Khadse announced that there will be an option to study Urdu in Marathi schools run by the state, Sena legislators tried to present him with a green skull cap.
Meanwhile, insiders suggested that the Sena’s flip-flops inside the Assembly and outside were a result of a divide within the party ranks, with several MLAs still urging Thackeray not to take an extreme stand against the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in the state.
Though Sena’s MLAs occupied opposition benches in the Assembly on Monday morning, the discomfort was visible on their faces.
A Sena MLA said on condition of anonymity, “It is strange that being the second largest party, we are in the opposition. We should have played our cards carefully to bring BJP to the negotiating table to form the government.”
In another indication that the Sena is still hopeful of a reconciliation, Uddhav seems to have decided not to pull out his nominee in the Modi Government, Anant Geete, just yet.
“No, no, I am not resigning,” Geete, Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, said when asked by The Indian Express if he planned to quit. “I will continue as a member of continued…

Singhvi in tax soup: officials reject his claim that termites ate vouchers  slap Rs 56-crorepenaltyPrint
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi (Source: PTI)
Written by Ritu Sarin , Appu Esthose Suresh | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:07 am | Updated: November 12, 2014 8:19 pm
Multiplying Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi’s Income Tax problems, the Settlement Commission has added over Rs 91.95 crore to his declared professional income over a three-year period and slapped a penalty of Rs 56.67 crore. The order has since been stayed. He had moved the Commission on his own but a probe was launched subsequently, prompting him to describe the proceedings as a “cat and mouse game” which “trapped” him.
Citing inability to furnish documentary proof to back his expenses claim, Singhvi had told the Commission that a termite attack on the premises of his chartered accountant in December 2012 had destroyed all records and expense vouchers, documents.
The Income Tax department and the Commission also contested Singhvi’s claim that he purchased laptops worth Rs 5 crore for members of his staff over three financial years and was, therefore, entitled to 30 per cent depreciation.
As first reported first by The Indian Express, Singhvi approached the Commission last year, seeking immunity from penalty and prosecution which has since been denied to him on some counts.
Singhvi moved the Jodhpur High Court which stayed a 103-page Commission order passed on September 11 this year.
“I have been the highest tax-payer among lawyers. Even in this case, the entire income was received by cheque, so were the expenses. So it is a case of over-expenditure and the department not agreeing to it. I went to the Settlement Commission suo motu before any survey or investigation started since I could not back up my claim due to destruction of records, and the loss of which I had reported to police before the I-T probe even began,” Singhvi told The Indian Express.
The Singhvi tax case saw the Commission launching a full-fledged investigation into the expenses shown by the assessee. This is what the Commission highlighted:
> The sum has been added to Singhvi’s professional taxable income since he took the plea that a termite attack on the premises of his chartered accountant in December 2012 destroyed all his records and expense vouchers/documents. This was not accepted by the Income Tax Department (ITD) and the Commission.
> The Commission’s September order noted that since Singhvi’s salary sheet had shown that he had employed 14 advocates/professionals to assist him, he would have had to purchase 1,250 laptops (each costing Rs 40,000) to account for the amount under that head.
> The Commission also probed Singhvi’s claim that he spent Rs 35.98 crore on purchase of solar panels for his company, Rishab Enterprises. It declared that the transaction was “mainly intended at tax evasion by inflating the cost of the panels”. Of Rs 25.16 crore said to have been paid by Singhvi, the company concerned admitted it received only Rs 21.39 crore. The owner of the company which sold the solar panels, and whose premises were searched by the ITD, gave a statement admitting that the cost was “inflated” and that Rs 10 crore was to be repaid to Singhvi in the form of a loan to his sons.
Incidentally, the Commission also challenged Singhvi’s original contention — made at the first stage of his assessment — that the net income he earned from his legal practice was in the range of 55 per cent. The order noted the Income Tax contention that other equally senior Supreme Court lawyers had informed the tax department that their net income ranged between 90 per cent and 95 per cent.
The Commission also referred to the earlier probe by ITD in which several cheque payments made by Singhvi — to the tune of Rs 10.97 crore in the same three-year period — were found to be “non verifiable”. Reason: When inquiry letters were sent to 91 parties, 37 were returned.
Following the Commission order, Singhvi approached the Jodhpur High Court which granted a stay. In his writ petition, he reiterated the stand he had taken before the tax authorities: “The record of the petitioner had been destroyed on account of termite attack and could not have established existing claims by bringing on record documentary evidence.”
He said the loss of documents due to termite attack was reported to police on December 13, 2012. While contesting the I-T view, Singhvi’s petition stated: “There is absolutely no finding of the commission to the effect that termite attack, consequent destruction of records or the police report in that regard is false, misleading, lack authenticity or is legally unsustainable.”
Singhvi alleged that he had been “trapped” in a “cat and mouse game” and argued that the Commission did not have the jurisdiction to impose penalty on him. “No authority and power has been however been granted to the Settlement Commission in way of the provisions of Chapter XIX-A of the Act to impose and /or direct imposition of penalty under the provisions,” petition stated.
On the issue of the solar power company, Singhvi’s writ petition said: “No report could be furnished after 12 January 2014 being the expiry of the statutory period of 90 days for furnishing the report… DIT (Director, Income Tax investigation) Mumbai had no locus in the present proceeding… DIT Mumbai referred to ex parte enquiry conducted at Mumbai and is not tenable since the said statement was recorded under section 131 of the Act.”

4 women dead  20 critical after sterilisation camp in MinistersdistrictA woman being taken to hospital on Monday. (Source: Express photo)

Two days after 83 women opted for laparoscopic tubectomies at a family planning camp organised by the Chhattisgarh government in Bilaspur, four women died on Monday while at least 20 more are reported to be in a serious condition.
The office of Bilaspur Chief Medical Officer R K Bhange told The Indian Express that senior surgeon Dr R K Gupta and his assistant conducted all the operations in five hours. Bhange, however, ruled out negligence. “There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe,” he said.
The camp was held in Pendari area of Takhatpur in Bilaspur, the home district of Health Minister Amar Agarwal, on Saturday.
“Eighty-three women underwent the operation, 25 are in hospital and some are very serious… We have already ordered a probe and the post-mortem reports are expected tomorrow,” said Agarwal. The state government has announced a relief of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of those dead, and Rs 50,000 for those critical.
According to reports, the women — all residents of neighbouring villages and most of them from BPL families — were discharged soon after their surgery on Saturday. But as their condition deteriorated, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital on Monday, where four of them died — three have been identified as Janaki Bai Suryvanshi, Dipti Yadav and Rekha Nirmalkar, all under 30 years.
The camp was organised as part of the central government’s family planning programme under which a woman gets Rs 1,400 for undergoing the operation, and the health worker who brings them gets Rs 200 for each woman.
The Congress accused the state government of negligence in a bid to meet the central government’s targets. A three-member panel has been set up to probe the incident.

Why a stronger rupee doesnt always hit export-oriented companieseconomy
(This is due to the fact that…)
ET Intelligence Group: Whenever the rupee starts strengthening against major currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the pound, it prompts equity traders to short sell stocks of export-driven companies. A general belief that triggers short-selling is that an appreciating home currency will adversely impact the country's exports growth, thereby hurting revenues and profits of export-oriented companies. This, in turn, would lead to a fall in their stock prices over a period.
Does this belief hold true in reality? A trend of India's export growth, plotted against the corresponding change in the average rupee-dollar rate over the past decade, does not offer convincing evidence of a consistently inverse relationship between exports growth and average annual currency fluctuations.
According to some economists, this is due to the fact that export growth depends more upon the global demand factors than on short-term currency fluctuations.
Currency fluctuations mask true export growth in the foreign currency. Thus, even if the dollar-denominated exports growth is low due to global slowdown, it would appear to be strong if the rupee depreciates against the dollar.
ETIG's analysis shows that since FY09, which is after the financial crisis in some of the western economies, there has been no meaningful relationship between India's annual export growth rate and the year-on-year change in the average rupee rate against the dollar.
"Export growth is largely driven by global demand. Between FY06 and FY09, global demand was firm and, hence, export growth was higher. It has, however, slowed since then, thereby impacting India's export growth," said Indranil Sengupta, India economist, DSP Merrill Lynch.
The analysis shows during the three years before the crisis between FY06 and FY09, the exchange rate seemed to share an inverse relationship with exports growth.
In FY07, exports growth accelerated to 27.9% from 25.4% in the prior year and the rupee depreciated by over 2% to an average of 45.3 against the dollar. The next fiscal, the rupee sharply appreciated to 40.2 against the dollar. Accordingly, the exports growth dampened to 8.2%.
In financial year 2009, the rupee plummeted to 45.9 and exports growth zoomed to 26.6%.
Beginning from FY10, however, exports growth was largely independent of the direction of the currency change. Dhananjay Sinha, head-research & strategist, Emkay Global Financial, says, "Currency change can be tracked to domestic economic gro- wth. A fast growing economy will attract more foreign capital , thereby strengthening the currency. Exports, on the other hand, would depend largely on the global demand scenario."
A weaker rupee will support growth in exports when dollar-denominated growth is lower. For instance, India's dollar-denominated exports grew at a CAGR of 8% between FY10 and FY14 to $470 billion, the period of slower global demand. But, since rupee fell sharply to 60.5 in FY14 from 47 in FY10, rupee-denominated growth in exports at Rs 28.4 lakh crore was higher at 21.5%.
Economists say looking at rupeedenominated export growth without considering dollar worth of exports will lead to wrong conclusions. This is because weaker rupee will tend to inflate export growth even though dollar-denominated growth stays low.

Lavasa Corporation gets Sebi nod to raise Rs 750 crore via IPO
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 09.16PM IST
(The company, which is developing…)
NEW DELHI: Lavasa Corporation, the realty arm of construction major HCC, has received market regulator Sebi's approval for raising Rs 750 crore through an initial public offer (IPO).
The company had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in July this year for the proposed public offer.
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Prior to that, Sebi had sought clarification on two instances from Lavasa's lead manager, Axis Capital Ltd, regarding the company's proposed IPO.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares in 'Lavasa' near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money though IPO.
This is the company's second effort to hit the capital market. In November 2010, Lavasa had got the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan.
As per initial papers, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

Gujarat compulsory vote law: EC Brahma asks  will you jail all those whodontPrint
In the general elections held six months ago, only 55.38 crore out of the 83.41 crore registered voters cast their votes — which means some 28 crore stayed away from polling stations.
Written by Maneesh Chhibber | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:24 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 8:14 am
Election Commissioner H S Brahma told The Indian Express on Monday that in his view, the Gujarat government’s move to make voting compulsory in elections to local bodies “may not be correct”.
Several legal experts questioned the constitutionality and workability of the law that was blocked by former Gujarat governor Kamla Beniwal for several years before it was cleared by Governor O P Kohli recently, and was notified in the state gazette on November 5.
Rules under the amended law are, however, yet to be framed, and the penalty for not voting is still to be notified.
“While the Election Commission doesn’t have a concrete view since these amendments pertain only to local body elections in the state of Gujarat, my own view is that such a provision may not be correct,” Brahma said.
“Let me ask you, what if we have a similar law at the Centre, and out of 83 crore-plus voters, 10 per cent choose not to vote? Will you put eight crore voters in jail or impose fines on them? Do we have jails to accommodate eight crore voters?” Brahma asked.
In the general elections held six months ago, only 55.38 crore out of the 83.41 crore registered voters cast their votes — which means some 28 crore stayed away from polling stations.
Former solicitor general of India Mohan Parasaran said the Gujarat law was “too much”, and may be stopped by the courts. “Democracy is all about choices. While in an ideal situation, every citizen should vote, to force people to vote is too much. I feel the Gujarat law may not stand the test of judicial scrutiny,” Parasaran said.
A senior Election Commission official told The Indian Express that the EC’s view on making voting compulsory, as sought in a PIL pending in the Supreme Court, was being firmed up. The court had in August sought responses of the Centre and the EC on a PIL seeking mandatory voting so that results were not skewed by low voter turnouts.
“But, we feel forcible voting is against the Constitution,” the official said. “Right to vote is a statutory provision, and compelling (voters) may not work. The basic feature of our electoral system is free and fair elections. Compulsory voting is not free. You can’t herd people into polling booths and make them vote,” the official said.
He disclosed that even in earlier discussions with the Law Commission on this matter, the EC had opposed any move to make voting compulsory.
Jagdeep S Chhokar, founder-trustee of the non-partisan Association for Democratic Reforms, said governments should perhaps make voting compulsory for lawmakers before imposing it on the people.
“Our parliamentarians are allowed the choice of abstaining during voting inside the House. Why doesn’t the government first make it compulsory for MPs to vote and then continued…

Hindalco Case: CBI says it has dirt on officials  privatepartiesPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:17 am
Contradicting its earlier stand, the CBI told the special court on Monday that there is “prima facie” material against “private parties” and “some government officials” to take cognizance of offences in the case related to the allocation of Talabira II coal blocks in Orissa to Hindalco, owned by the Kumar Mangalam Birla group.
This comes less than a month after the CBI filed a “detailed and comprehensive” closure report in the case on October 21.
Special Public Prosecutor R S Cheema told Special Judge Bharat Parashar on Monday that prima facie, there is enough material on record to take cognizance of various offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC, against private parties and “some” public servants. He, however, did not directly name former Coal Secretary P C Parakh, who is one of the main accused in the case.
When contacted, Parakh told The Indian Express: “I don’t know what evidence they are talking about. The CBI spent one full year in investigating the case, I don’t know what fresh evidence they have.”
During the court proceedings today, the judge asked Cheema if the CBI was ready with the relevant documents. Cheema replied that some further investigations were required. The court is set to take up the matter on November 25.
On October 21, the CBI filed a revised final closure report after the court pulled up the agency over the “missing documents” in the case.
On September 12, the court had asked the CBI to file the “relevant documents” after the investigating officer failed to submit the primary evidence containing the original minutes of the screening committee meetings in the case.

Beware! Wilful defaulters may face trial wit...30 days
(It'd happen if proposal…)
NEW DELHI: Those accused of wilful default face the prospect of being put on trial within 30 days of a bank determining that a borrower was not paying despite being able to, if a proposal being considered by a committee set up by the government to deal with high value loan defaults finds its way into the statute books.
The finance ministry had set up a committee to suggest measures to deal with wilful defaulters. VK Bhasin, former secretary in the law ministry's legal department, is the advisor to the committee. "Some suggestions include, 'summary trials,' in such cases.
The recommendations are being examined," said a person aware of the deliberations.Summary trial is essentially a fast track proceeding where a case is resolved in one or two sittings.
However, no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three months can be passed in a summary trial.
"These are meant to act as deterrent, and in cases where more action needs to be taken, regular trial procedure can be followed," said a finance ministry official, adding that the recommendations are still being debated.
The number of wilful default cases at state run banks has risen to 1311 at the end of December 2013 from 854 at the end of March 2011.
State-run lenders are attempting to declare Kingfisher Airlines and its promoter Vijay Mallya as wilful defaulters. Kingfisher Airlines owes about Rs4,022 crore to a consortium of 17 lenders. Mallya has chllened the move to declare him a willful defaulter in court.
Summary trials are dealt with under section 260 - 265 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
Wiflul defaulters lose access to capital markets and cannot access more loans from a bank or financial institution as per current regulations. The lenders can also initate criminal proceedings against willful defaulters, but there is no legal backing for speedy recovery of dues.
The committee, which also had representation from Indian Banks' Association (IBA), Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and RBI is also examining suggestions to amend the Sarfaesi Act, an act under which banks can seize assets of borrowers, and RDDB Act (Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions). In his budget speech , finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced setting up of six new debt recovery tribunals and said that government will come up with effective measure for revival of stressed assets.
There are over 40,000 cases worth Rs 1.73 lakh crore pending before various courts and debt recovery tribunals."If these summary trials can include the large corporate defaulters then only there will be some impact," said an executive director with a state run bank. The top 30 non-performing accounts of state run banks account for 40.2 % of their gross bad loans.Experts believe that wilful defaulters will not be deterred unless the judicial machinery to deal with it is specialized and the trial of offences are expeditious.

Edit: What damage can a rate cut inflict nowNovember 11, 2014, 4:53 am IST Govardhana Rangan in The Skeptic | Economy , Finance , India | ET
25
The buzzword in New Delhi now is empowerment. In a refreshing departure from the past, bureaucrats have the freedom to decide. But where does that leave the RBI governor? Indications are that there is nothing amiss so far — unlike when finance minister P Chidambaram wanted to run monetary policy to the chagrin of then-RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao.
With Arun Jaitley joining the chorus on the need for an interest rate cut, is it going to be another tug of war between an RBI governor and finance minister? It’s unlikely. But cordial relations can’t be taken for granted either.
For a government that trusts its officers to decide, to meddle in the affairs of governor Raghuram Rajan, especially on interest rates at this juncture, would be hara-kiri. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have turned the investor tide, but Rajan had already done his bit to restore credibility. If India’s poor macroeconomy was half the reason for last year’s currency crisis, the rest was due to loquacious bureaucrats and an activist finance minister who nullified the central bank’s actions by publicly confronting it.
The singular demand from business is that policies on tax and economic activities be stable. But when it comes to monetary policy, it is different. It suits their interest, but not necessarily the economy’s. Just like a governor is not qualified to dictate how businesses are run, chief executives can’t wade into monetary policymaking. Rajan is paid to do that.
The cry for lower interest rates is due to the consumer price index (CPI) sliding below the RBI’s 8% target for January 2015. But there’s a long way to go on the inflation front. The target of 6% by January 2016 may also be possible given the slide in crude oil and tomato prices. Or so goes the argument. But a closer reading of the RBI will tell you that the long-term aim is to have it at 4%, in a band of 2 percentage point on either side. A premature rate cut would jeopardise that objective. If inflation is not below 4% for a decade or so, then returning to the cherished 8% economic growth will remain a dream.
Not many had forecast the fall in crude oil or tomato prices — which rose to .`80 a kg from .`20 in a matter of weeks. How would cheerleaders of interest rate cuts know that prices won’t surge in a matter of weeks? Rewind to April 2012 when Subbarao was browbeaten to cut interest rates without a firm handle on the direction of prices. There was also a flimsy argument that supply-side inflation could not be tamed by monetary policy. When the reality began to bite, Subbarao had to abandon cuts and publicly defy his boss. If the present government repeats this, there is no reason to believe that results would be any different.
What is at stake? There is near unanimity that lower interest rates will not lead to a jump in new projects. Not many are willing to invest in equity. Unless entrepreneurs bring in equity, banks won’t lend to indebted companies. So why force a reluctant governor and damage credibility?
What damage can a cut inflict now? If crude prices jump back to $100 a barrel or if tomato prices surge to .`40 due to poor harvest, the CPI may return to 8% by May or June. Does the RBI raise interest rates then? The repo rate can’t move like tomato prices. If it does, the currency and the economy will be back in the crisis square.
Carry trade has got a new life with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan revving up their currency-printing machines with the end of quantitative easing in the US. This could trigger another bout of speculative jump in commodity prices. And that poses a risk for India. In these circumstances, no principled central banker would lower interest rates, especially after years of battling doubledigit inflation and a currency crisis not so long ago. It would mean frittering away whatever little was achieved in the last 15 months.
Rajan may argue with Jaitley that the time for a rate cut is yet to come. And that when it comes — sometime in February or March when he would have inflation data for a few more months — he would cut rates by 75 or 100 basis points instead of a meaningless 25 basis points now. That could be abooster dose for the economy.

Eyeing 8% growth  PM Modi set for big reforms | Higher duty on cardsArun Jaitley
(The administration is well-placed…)
NEW DELHI: Having just completed a comprehensive round of ministerial and bureaucratic changes, the Narendra Modi government is set to embark on a series of economic reforms aimed at putting the country on track for 8% growth in the intermediate term and an even faster pace beyond that.
This will include ironing out the kinks in land acquisition, implementing the longawaited goods & services tax (GST), rapidly modernising the railway system to its fullest potential and fixing the seriously flawed agricultural produce marketing system. And where it sees the need for drastic, immediate change, the government won't be averse to taking the ordinance route, particularly with respect to the land acquisition law, seen as one of the biggest stumbling blocks to infrastructure development in the country.
The administration is well-placed to kick off its programme in the winter session of Parliament, when key economic Bills are expected to be introduced.
"Plate is full... focus areas are clear," said a senior government official. "All energies of the government will be directed towards this." A two-pronged approach to the reforms process will be followed — focusing on pushing key legislation and removing obstacles to procedures on the ground to improve governance, thereby lifting the curbs on growth and attracting greater levels of investment.
The government believed previously that changes in rules could help fix the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, that was moved by the UPA government, but it now believes an amendment will be needed. The law has stalled land acquisition because of the cumbersome procedures prescribed. The states have widely opposed it and the government is counting on that to get amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, where it doesn't have a majority. In case this proves difficult, the government may move an ordinance.
With Finance Minister Arun Jaitley shouldering a lighter administrative load after the reshuffle, negotiations on GST and talks with the Opposition on passing the insurance Bill to raise the foreign direct investment cap to 49% in the winter session will gather pace.
The government has already undertaken some big-ticket measures in the form of diesel price deregulation and an ordinance to sort out coal allocation. It is also expected to bite the bullet on rationalising other subsidies, including fertiliser, LPG and food, at the opportune time. The coal sector is expected to get a shakeup with a set of measures lined up.
Reforms in marketing and handling of farm produce through restructuring of the Food Corporation of India and changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act are expected to get a renewed push. In the light of court orders pertaining to coal mines and telecom spectrum, a cleanup of the allocation of natural resources by putting in place an e-auction system is being contemplated.
Road and railway projects are ready to be picked up by investors, which should help connect rural areas. This will also tie into the Digital India project to make sure more Indians get access to the Internet. People involved in the railway plan say the government is talking to unions to take them on board before selectively bringing in the private sector in areas such as running premium high-profit trains that can cross-subsidise general travel. The emphasis on rail has another dimension — its people connect.
Better trains, cleaner stations and baggage-handling facilities are in for special attention. Unlike other sectors, railways can absorb a great deal of investment without running into land or environment issues. On Sunday, Modi appointed trusted associate Suresh Prabhu as railway minister, seen as a statement of intent that it's of high priority for the prime minister .
"A lot is happening and the effect would be visible only in some time," said a senior government official. Economists said several steps are on the anvil but the effects will take a while to percolate through. "A number of things are happening and all of them will result in increase in efficiency in the economy. But how much quantum will this add to growth is difficult to say," said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
Handpicked officials have been placed in key ministries and the new ministers there could be much more visible than before. "Policy paralysis has been arrested," Joshi said. "They seem to be on the right track... From now till next budget we should watch for some big-ticket moves." Overall business sentiment that had soured in the past three years has turned around with the new government at the helm but investments are yet to pick up. Growth expanded by 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the fastest in two years, but revival is yet to take definitive hold.

Aditya Birla Group plans to acquire Stemcor’s India assets

Aditya Birla Group
(There is no guarantee that…)
MUMBAI: Metals-to-telecoms Aditya Birla Group has revived plans to acquire the Indian assets - or at least some of the significant parts -- of Stemcor, one of the world's largest steel traders, majority owned by the Oppenheimer family.
In 2013, Stemcor --- also one of the largest private companies in UK - had appointed Goldman Sachs to sell its controlling 73% interest in an iron ore mine, a manganese ore mine, a 4 million tonne pellet plant and a 230 km long slurry pipeline connecting the iron mines with the pellet factory in the steel making hub of Odisha. But earlier this year, the formal divestment process fizzled out amidst heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny on the domestic metals and mining sector. Moreover, Stemcor also successfully completed a complex, $1.3 billion global debt restructuring involving 80 banks. The recast -- in February of 2014 - means the multinational trading group, can sell several of its assets in different parts of the world at a more leisurely place in contrast to the fire sale that had seemed likely earlier.
The renewed interest from the Birlas, eight months after process was put on hold, currently center around Stemcor's pellet plant, which, unlike its mines are free from regulatory issues, said multiple sources aware of the developments. The group has already initiated discussions with several banks to explore financing for the transaction which will be carried out by Essel Mining and Industries (EMIL) - an unlisted mining company, which has long been considered the AV Birla Group cash cow.
The equity valuation of the pellet plant is likely to be around Rs 1200 -Rs 1250 crore, as per estimates of the Birla group and which it is willing to pay upfront. The plan also has Rs 1500 crore of debt.
There is no guarantee that these discussions will result in a definitive transaction, according to the people cited earlier.
Essel is also open to acquiring Stemcor's iron ore mine for an additional Rs 1000 crore equity, but only if the mining license gets transferred to them and other regulatory clearances come through within a 12-18 month period. Since May, several mines in the state have been temporarily shut and their licenses are unlikely to be automatically renewed after mining activities in the state came under Supreme Court's scanner. Most of Essel's own mines, and that of Stemcor, are currently non-operational. According to industry officials, prior to the current impasse, Stemcor used to produce 5 million metric tons of ore in a year but has access to significantly higher reserves of over 100 million tonnes.
  When contacted a Birla Group spokesperson said the group does not comment on market speculation. Responding to ET's detailed questionnaire, Charles Armistead, spokesperson for Stemcor in London said, though no formal sell off exercise is currently on but the company continues to receive interest from strategic buyers. "The regulatory environment in Odisha is currently quite complicated so our discussions with third parties are on hold until the situation is resolved. There is no timeline attached to the sale of our Indian assets. All of that said, they are very valuable assets and continue to attract interest. We don't comment on any specific approaches or dialogue."
Interestingly, unlike the previous round, Birlas are on their own this time around and have decided not to partner with JSW. A Essel-JSW consortium had previously bid for the Stemcor's mines and pellet unit. JSW, sources say, is no longer keen to pursue the transaction. Morgan Stanley is advising the Birlas. JSW's withdrawal stems from the fact that Odhisa's metals and mining sector has been severely hamstrung following a series of regulatory and legal interventions resulting in bans. The unpromising regulatory landscape had resulted in conservative bids in the previous round from potential suitors including Kumar Birla and the billionaire Jindal brothers - Sajjan and Naveen. JSW was always keen on Stemcor's mines while the Birla interest was focused on the pellet unit. Investment bankers felt, the differences in valuations was another reason why the sale process was put on hold earlier in March. Since then, approaches were made to Gautam Adani and local mining baron B Prabhakaran of Thriveni Earthmovers, add sources.
PELLET PLAY
"In a worse-case scenario, Birlas will only get to retain a large pellet plant. In a best case scenario, they also get access to iron ore mines. With a pellet plant they can also bargain with the Odhisa government to reopen Essel's own mines citing value-addition in the state," said a senior source involved directly in the talks, explaining the Birla rationale.
Transfer of mining lease and shareholding under Rule 37 of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Act requires state government consent.

Car cos Maruti  Hyundai see year in red as s...Prices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated festive season failed to trigger demand for cars in October as sales declined for the second consecutive month amid a slow economic recovery and high interest rates, raising concerns the industry may see a third straight year of declines.
Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai Motor and other car companies sold a combined 1,59,036 vehicles last month, a drop of 2.55% from 1,63,199 units in October 2013, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Monday. Overall domestic auto sales fell 4% to 17.87 lakh vehicles last month, pummeled by a sharp 9% decline in bike dispatches, turning negative for the first time since December 2013, when a 4.24% fall was registered.
"This year, the festival season has been subdued compared to last year. If we don't see some real growth in economic activity and some relief in the high interest rates on automotive financing that could improve customers' sentiment, we might not see automobile sales going up in the coming months," SIAM deputy director-general Sugato Sen said.
Sen declined to provide a forecast, although SIAM had earlier estimated a 5-10% growth in passenger vehicle sales in the current financial year. Following declines in 2012-13 and 2013-14, car sales in the country had increased every month from May to August. Automobile sales dropped 1.03% in September.

China’s Trina Solar heeds PM Narendra Modi’s call, plans to ‘make in India’

Company Expansion
(Officials of the company,…)
NEW DELHI: Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to global manufacturers, Chinese company Trina Solar is planning to set up a facility over the next few years to "make in India, supply in India and even export from India".
Officials of the company, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) modules, participated in the World Economic Forum held in Delhi last week to actively look for a joint venture partner and assess the Indian market.
"As far as 'make in India' is concerned, maybe we can make in India, supply in India and even export from India. We want globalised manufacturing, not only 'make in China'," Zhiguo Zhu , senior vice president of Trina Solar and the president of its module business unit told ET. Zhu added that from next year the company would start expanding outside China. "We want 20-30% of our production to take place outside of China.
India is one of the places we are exploring to do this," he said adding that the company expected to double its revenue share from India to 10%.
In India, where it has been operating for three years, Trina Solar has a market share of over 10%. Of the total 2,700 Mw solar power capacity in the country, it has supplied solar power to projects with 280 Mw capacity.
Zhu exhorted the government to sort out a few issues that he said would make India more conducive for business and attractive to foreign investors, even as he expressed confidence in the India growth story.
"We don't see India as one country because there are too many provinces and that makes doing business very complicated. We have to spend a lot of time to understand this. We want the government to make the process simple.
Then more people will come here for investment," he said. Zhu also spoke of the need for special incentives such as land and infrastructure to foreign companies to facilitate investments. India also needs a simplified taxation structure to create a better business environment, he added.
The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE )-listed Trina Solar announced net revenues of $519.4 million for the second quarter of 2014. Its total shipments during this period stood at 943.3 Mw. In the third quarter, the company plans to report shipments of 1,060-1,120 Mw of PV modules.

(The PM has chosen to keep…)
By Neerja Chowdhury
There are four clear messages emanating from the Sunday cabinet expansion undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first is an obvious one, the requirements of governance when more hands were needed on deck to man the important ministries which were being held by 7 or 8 people, and their workload was becoming too heavy to manage. Hence Manohar Parikkar and Suresh Prabhu, and they are leaders who have a clean image, who the PM trusts and enjoys a rapport with, and who are known to have administrative experience.
Six months into power, Narendra Modi has successfully managed to maintain a momentum, winning an endorsement even in state elections, of Maharashtra and Haryana. But he needs talent to translate his promises into results that people will demand to see very soon. Here Modi is working under constraints of not having enough people in the party who combine talent and experience and this too comes through the expansion exercise. The PM cannot bring people from outside because of the party's inability at this stage to ensure their election to the Rajya Sabha, which it may be able to do at a later stage, when it wins states, and vacancies occur.
The second is a political consideration— and this has taken into account the specifics of caste and community which cannot be sniffed away in the politics of Gangaland, no matter what the rhetoric. The idea is to buttress the party's efforts to wrest the big states of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh which go to the polls in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, without which the Modi agenda will remain incomplete.
So Bihar MPs like Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Giriraj Singh, Ram Kirpal Yadav have been inducted, in addition to the five already in the ministry from the state. So also from UP, it is Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, ostensibly to give a suitable signal to the minorities, though Naqvi is a Shia leader and he has only been made an MOS (which he was also in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government). Dr Mahesh Sharma, a first time MP also from UP, has however been given Independent charge, coming as he does under the coveted "technocrat" category. There are also saffron clad Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and Ram Shankar Katehriya, a dalit, made MOSs. As it is there were a whopping 9 ministers from UP already in the Modi government .
With a slump in Mayawati's fortunes in UP, dalits are clearly—and particularly-- on Modi's radar screen keeping in mind the state elections in the next two and a half years. The induction of Vijay Sampla, also a dalit from Punjab, goes to reinforce the "woo-dalit" plan of the party to neutralise the BJP's upper caste image. Punjab, where elections are due in 2017, has 30 % dalit voters, and here to the BJP may keep its options open on continuing the alliance with the Akali Dal. Sampla's entry is a snub to Akali Dal which had hoped for another minister this time round.
Given the good showing of BJP in West Bengal, Babul Supriyo's inclusion as MOS is also a signal to Mamata Bannerji's state of a resurgent BJP on the horizon, and the party's attempt is obviously going to be to push out the Left from the number two position. Supriyo has been known for his extraordinary connect with people through his singing.
Modi seems to have tried to zero in on those who had excelled in their respective fields Like Supriyo. Or Olympian shooter Col Rajyavardene RathoreThe decision to induct Rathore and Sanwarlal Jat from Rajasthan is being seen as bad news for Vasundhara Raje Scindia, for the CM had put her weight behind the inclusion of Col Sonaram Chaudhary, a Jat who she had fielded against Jaswant Singh in Barmer, and her son Dushyant Singh, who is the seniormost MP from Rajasthan today. All the 24 other BJP MPs who won from Rajasthan were either former MLAs or first time MPs.
The third message coming through the expansion is also clear—that the PM is now in the process of shaping what will be his own team, bringing in first timers, and those he has a rapport with like Parikkar and Prabhu. Their inclusion may alter the power balance at the top echelons of Government, including the apex Cabinet Committee on Security.
Fourth, Modi has given an unmistakeable message to the BJP's allies—that alliances will be on his own terms in a situation which has undergone a sea change, with people having given the party a clear mandate.

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening higher; may hit fresh record highChina
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Tuesday following positive trend seen in other Asian markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to surpass its previous record highs of 8388.05 hit on 10 November 10, 2014.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 16.50 points higher at 8,407 indicating a flat-to-positive opening on the domestic market.
Nifty oscillated in and out of the negative territory to finally conclude the session with a gain of 7 points at 8344 on Monday. The Sensex ended higher by mere 6 points at 27874.
The sideways activity of past few sessions is likely to resolve itself on the up side and the momentum may yet again catch up as long as Nifty respects the immediate support level of 8,290.
"On the higher side 8400 to 8460 range may be the likely upside targets. Only a move below 8290 would be the initial sign of weakness and may suggest further correction till 8220 to 8200 range," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"However, the index has a key positional support placed at 8170, as long as 8170 is respected the uptrend should remain intact," added the report.
Overnight, US stocks ended higher with the Dow and S&P 500 hit yet another record high closes for a fourth session, led by transportation and healthcare shares.
The Dow and S&P 500 have each risen more than 7 percent over the past three weeks, the best three-week performance for both indexes since October 2011, Reuters reported.
Oil prices initially rose on renewed political tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine . But they subsequently gave up their gains, with Brent crude off 1.5 percent at $82.70, and U.S. light crude off 1.7 percent at $77.63, added the report.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.81 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 17,613.74, the S&P 500 gained 6.34 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 2,038.26, and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.08 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 4,651.62.

Asian Shares Edge Lower, Supply Concerns Keep Oil Down
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 07:24 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Tokyo: Asian shares and the dollar got off to a lacklustre start on Tuesday as oil prices continued to drop, while Japanese shares marked early gains.
Crude oil prices shrugged off concerns about conflicts in Libya and Ukraine and continued to sag. Fears about a global supply glut and slowing growth have pushed oil prices down nearly 30 per cent since June.
US crude shed about 0.3 per cent to $77.17 per barrel.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down about 0.2 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei stock average added 0.6 per cent.
Data released before the open showed Japan's current account surplus rose more than expected in September from a year earlier, as income from investments overseas bolstered the balance of payments. The surplus stood at 963.0 billion yen ($8.4 billion), against a median forecast for a 534.2 billion yen surplus in a Reuters poll of economists.
On Wall Street overnight, both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials edged up to fresh closing highs.
US bond markets and government offices will be closed later on Tuesday in observance of the Veterans' Day holiday, while other markets will trade.
US Treasury prices slipped, putting a solid floor under the dollar as yields ticked higher. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.360 per cent in Asian trade, above its US close of 2.359 per cent on Monday.
The dollar edged down about 0.1 per cent on the day to 114.93 yen, below Friday's seven-year peak of 115.60. The euro was slightly up at $1.2425 though not far from a two-year trough of $1.2358 touched on Friday, and strategists said the single currency's downside remained vulnerable.
"Our global flows data showed selling by both hedge funds and real money accounts post ECB in near record amounts. With both sectors not yet approaching oversold territory, there should be further room for continued selling," Citigroup's foreign exchange strategist Todd Elmer said in a note.
Investors had locked in gains on long dollar positions as Treasuries rose after headline US payroll figures on Friday fell short of high expectations. The report still provided evidence of solid improvement in employment conditions, and underscored the brighter US economic picture compared with Europe and Japan.
The Federal Reserve's monthly labour market conditions index released Monday showed an unchanged 4.0 level for October, which also allayed some concerns.
Diverging monetary policy outlooks between the Fed and both the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of Japan have lifted the dollar against its major rivals in recent weeks.

Bond market expects RBI to cut rates in DecemberSuvashree Choudhury and Gaurav Pai     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 16:26 IST
RBI governor Raghuram  Rajan.
The rally in bonds is providing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan an unexpected gift: Falling borrowing costs are starting to provide the benefits of lower interest rates without him actually having to ease monetary policy.
The bond rally - and the lower yields that result - comes as the consumer price index eased to 6.46 per cent in September.
That was the lowest since the series was introduced in January 2012 - a major morale boost for the fixed-income market and its legendary fear of inflation.
Investors are also more confident on the economy after a sharp turnaround in the rupee, the best Asian performer so far in 2014, gaining about 0.7 per cent to 61.53 to the dollar, and bucking a falling trend among its peers.
Despite no change in interest rates, India's largest lender, State Bank of India, last week became among the latest to lower deposit rates, often a precursor to lower lending rates, something some banks have already done for certain consumer loans.
Corporate bond yields have fallen sharply, making it 55 basis points (bps) cheaper for companies to issue bonds than a couple of months ago, bankers said. A 10-year AAA corporate bond is trading at around 8.75 per cent compared with 9.30 per cent just a few months ago.
That is working in Rajan's favour, easing pressure on the RBI to immediately cut rates and allowing him to uphold his hawkish reputation on inflation.
"There is an anticipation of easing by RBI materialising earlier than later and that is triggering the rate cuts by banks and softening in market yields," said Siddhartha Sanyal, India economist at Barclays in Mumbai.
Bond markets are now pricing in a cut in the key repo rate to 8 per cent as early as the RBI's next meeting on December 2 or in February - whereas previously expectations were for an easing in the second quarter of 2015.
As a result, the 10-year bond yield hit this week a 15-month low of 8.19 per cent. The one-year interest rate swap - an indicator of policy rates - fell nearly 37 bps last month, the biggest monthly fall in a year and is now trading at 7.96 per cent.
Meanwhile, cash conditions remain loose, allowing lenders to lower deposit and lending rates because they can access short-term funds more cheaply.
State Bank of India last week lowered some of its deposit rates by 100 bps, having already cut its home loan rates by about 15 bps in August.
CAUTION
For market borrowing costs to fall before a cut in official rates is a marked change in a country where banks often take months to react to changes in official rates.
This shift means any RBI rate cut would be passed through to the domestic economy much faster this time around.
That is critical, given that boosting credit growth, which touched a 13-year low in September, is a key plank in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to revive investment. Lower market borrowing costs also reduce pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates at a time when the economy has suffered from two consecutive years of below 5 per cent growth, a relatively low pace for India.
Rajan has argued repeatedly that economic growth can only revive by defeating inflation. The former International Monetary Fund economist has tried to do that by raising interest rates three times since September.
"Lower interest rates are good for growth. If the reform process by the government, which has already started, continues and is accompanied by lower policy interest rates, then the combination will help growth pick up faster," said Sanjay Mathur, head of economic research for non-Japan Asia at Royal Bank of Scotland in Singapore.
Union Bank of India Ltd, for example, said it was already prepared to lower lending rates after recently reducing deposit rates by 25-30 bps for some maturities to 8.75 per cent.
"Once RBI cuts the repo rate, banks are likely to follow with base rate cuts to push credit," said Arun Tiwari, chairman and managing director at Union Bank of India.
The worry for markets is an unexpected pick-up in inflation, such as via a sudden surge in crude oil prices, that would keep interest rates high for much longer than currently expected, given Rajan's intent to get CPI to 6 per cent by January 2016.
The RBI said after its September 30 policy meeting that it expects inflation to pick up by year-end as the base effect wanes. Food prices also typically rise in the run-up to the monsoon months.
"In India we have seen this play out several times: policy tightens, inflation declines, policy is loosened in response which spikes inflation. I think RBI wants to avoid repeating this mistake," said Jahangir Aziz, chief emerging-Asia economist at JP Morgan.

Speeding up key trade pact on PM Modi agenda in AustraliaSpeeding up key trade pact, sporting links on PM Modi agenda in Australia

Speeding up negotiations on a major economic cooperation pact to give a fillip to bilateral trade and cooperation agreements in the field of sports are on the anvil during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bilateral talks in Australia from November 16-18.
Modi is seeking to make up for lost time as the first Indian prime minister to visit Australia after over a quarter of a century.
Modi, who embarks on a 10-day three-nation tour on Tuesday, will arrive in Australia on November 14 evening from Myanmar, where he would attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-India and East Asia Summit on November 12 and 13.
After the November 15-16 G20 summit in Brisbane, Modi will engage in bilateral talks with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott , who visited India in September during which the two sides inked a landmark deal for Australia to sell uranium to India.
During their talks in Canberra, both sides would seek to speed up talks on the bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), also known as the free trade agreement (FTA) to boost bilateral trade. Talks were first started for the CECA in 2011 and so far five rounds of negotiations have been held.
The CECA aims to further liberalise and broaden the base of merchandise trade, remove non-tariff barriers and encourage investments.
Both sides would seek to step up negotiations on the trade pact with an aim for greater convergence between their exports and imports. The two-way trade has grown from $5.1 billion in 2003 to $15.2 billion in 2013, with Indian exports amounting to just over $3 billion.
Ahead of Abbott's visit to India, the Australia India Business Council and the Australia India Institute released a white paper seeking early inking of the CECA to arrest dwindling trade. Between 2009 and 2013, trade between the two countries plummeted 26 per cent.
Modi, who is to be hosted by Abbott at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds November 18, would be seeking to tap Australia's expertise in sports, including in capacity building and sports medicine.
Sports is a national obsession with Australia, which has won gold medals in almost every Olympics event, and has a gold medals tally of 142 so far. In India, it is known more as a cricketing power and most Australian cricket stars are household names in the country.
Prime Minister Abbott is himself a cycling enthusiast and has tweeted photographs of him cycling along with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte in Canberra last week.
Modi told Asian Games medallists during a meeting last month that all their needs would be taken care of leading up to the 2016 Rio Olympics. He promised to bring back the "golden days of Indian sports" and build more facilities in the country.
The last Indian prime minister to visit Australia was Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.

Sunil Mittal demands  respect  from govt  wants support for India Inc to counter China abroadEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Indian companies will need active help from the new government in expanding overseas, but such support has been lacking in the past as against China which has always put its might behind its enterprises, leading industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal said today.
“We are facing might of Chinese state wherever we go abroad,” said Mittal, who heads telecom-to-retail conglomerate Bharti group.
Sharing his experiences from the past, Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of USD 100 million for a project.
“I conveyed it in MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and officers in PMO (Prime Minister Office) but nothing moved after that. I could only convey. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of $1 billion to Sri Lanka which helped its companies,” Mittal said at the India Global Forum here.
He said Indian companies started venturing abroad and investing big after Tata acquired European steel firm Corus in 2006 and soon it was followed by acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.
“Indian companies are making big investments abroad. Some of them are extremely successful, some moderate and some are in the process. In Africa, I have seen good amount of goodwill for India. Though we cannot match the amount of money they (China) commit in Africa but government can support Indian businesses there,” Mittal said.
Airtel acquired African telecom operator Zain in 2010 for $10.7 billion. The telecom major operates in 17 African countries but is yet to register profit.
At the same event, Wockhardt Chairman and Group CEO Habil Khorakiwala said that Indian companies have brought down price of HIV drugs by about 98 per cent in Africa which was earlier unaffordable for people there.
Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the new government but more needs to be done.
“PM (Narendra Modi) is now making bold moves overseas. He asked us to introduce ourself in Japan,” Mittal said.
But unlike foreign businessmen who are made part of delegation when their ministers visit overseas, Indian businessmen are given a badge which says “coinciding with visit of Prime Minister”, he added.
“I have asked senior officials to at least make ‘accompanying’ if not call it delegates. We deserve some respect,” Mittal said.
Bharti Enterprise chairman recalled a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin where Russian conglomerate Sistema’s chairman Yevtushenkov was present during the meeting between heads of the two states.
Mittal said, “A PMO official after the meeting asked me who is Yevtushenkov and said Putin was asking PM why don’t you give a telecom licence to him.
“I said you should have taken me along with you and I could have also asked for licence in Russia.”
Indian businesses can play key role in helping the government build good relationship overseas but states also need to support them, he said.
US companies like Google, Facebook, Apple get tremendous support from their governments, he added.

UP Gov approves Usmanis name forCICPrint
Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:47 am
Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik Monday approved the name of former chief secretary and serving IAS officer Jawed Usmani for appointment as next Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), five days after he had returned returned the file for the same asking the state government to submit vigilance clearance.
The vigilance report was sent to Raj Bhawan Friday. The Governor, who had sought clearance from Central Vigilance Commission as well, took the opinion of legal experts before clearing Usmani’s name and sent the file for further action by the department concerned.
With Governor clearing his name, Usmani, a 1978-batch officer, would have to take voluntary retirement from service before taking charge as CIC. As per the rules laid for appointment of CIC, no one serving on any post in the government can take up charge of the post. Usmani, 58, is due to retire in January 2016.
“I will apply for the voluntary retirement after government notification,” Usmani said speaking to The Indian Express.
Asked about his new role, Usmani said, “My first endeavour would be to ensure transparency in working of the government through proper implementation of the Right to Information Act.”

Three held for bomb hoax SMS to BangaloreairportPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:45 am
Police have arrested three persons from Channapatna town, nearly 60 km from Bangalore, after they allegedly sent a bomb hoax SMS to an official of Bangalore airport on Sunday.
The trio were arrested after the SIM card used to send the message was tracked. The SMS was sent to a terminal manager of the airport at 9.30pm Saturday, said police. It said a bomb was planted in an aircraft bound to fly at 11.30am Sunday.
The accused have been identified as Shivananda his cousin Ningegowda and a mobile shop owner Yogesh. Investigations have revealed that the SIM bought in Shivananda’s name was used by Ningegowda to send the SMS.
Shivananda initially told the police that he had not sent any threat SMSes. Police then tracked the sale of the SIM card to Yogesh’s store and learned that Ningegowda bought the SIM in his cousin’s name.
Police also said that Shivananda was changing his story. First, he claimed Ningegowda sent the SMS to frame him. Then, he said his cousin was a contractor whose bills were not cleared by the CEO of the Ramanagara Zilla Panchayat. The CEO was scheduled to leave for an official trip on Sunday and Shivananda said he sent the SMS on his cousins’s directive to sink the CEO’s trip, said police.

There is an attempt to create a chilling effect: Greenpeace chiefThe Hindu Executive Director of Greenpeace International, Kumi Naidoo in New Delhi on Saturda. Photo Rajeev Bhatt

Interview with Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International
As a young man growing up in South Africa, Kumi Naidoo looked to India for inspiration. Now there is a twinge of disappointment. Mr. Naidoo, the executive director of Greenpeace International, is puzzled at how the government came to freeze the organisation’s bank accounts in India without giving a reason. Though the Delhi High Court sent a notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs directing it to unblock Greenpeace India’s foreign funds, there is no respite with the Ministry asking for more details on remittances from abroad. Mr Naidoo is in India to discuss the role of civil society in the context of certain individual and non-governmental organisations (NGO) being targeted for being “anti-national".
In interview to The Hindu on Saturday, he said, “Thankfully Greenpeace India is quintessentially an Indian entity, with 60 per cent of our resources coming from individual Indian citizens and 40 per cent from Greenpeace International.”
After the government’s move, Mr. Naidoo sought solace in Mahatma Gandhi. “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win. We are not panicking because of Gandhiji. We take comfort in this that we are being fought and we are one step away from winning the argument for a different development model which includes sustainable meaning for growth,” he said. Mr Naidoo has asked for a meeting with the Home department and the Environment Minister.
It’s a bit disappointing for me to see what’s happening in India. As a young person growing up in South Africa, we looked to India as a bastion of democracy- no country supported us as much as India politically and in terms of skills development. I first came in 1989 first time to India as part of an African National Congress (ANC) delegation. I see India as a vibrant civil society, with its diversity of trade unions, social movements. It is troubling to see an attempt to create a chilling effect,” he said. Any half-intelligent person can see through that, he pointed out, adding that Essar had sued Greenpeace for Rs 500 crore after their protest.
Accusing Greenpeace of acting in foreign interests because it was accepting foreign funds was as absurd as saying that the Indian government was acting on a foreign agenda because it was getting aid from abroad. “We don’t take a single paisa from government or business – all our resources are raised through individual citizens, a small proportion of our resources come from a select number of trusts and foundations which meet certain ethical criteria. We are completely transparent about everything- we are not hiding anything- we have annual report and no attempt to conceal our work,” he clarified.

South Korean troops fired warning shots Monday after North Korean soldiers approached too close to the border separating the rival countries, Seoul defense officials said.
About 10 North Korean soldiers retreated without returning fire after South Korean troops fired 20 rounds of warning shots, the officials said on condition of anonymity, in line with office policy. There were no reports of casualties.
The incident happened near the military demarcation line inside the 4-kilometer-wide (2.5-mile-wide) Demilitarized Zone that was created when the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice.
Tensions between the Koreas remain high following two incidents last month involving exchanges of gunfire, though no casualties were reported in either one.
In the first incident, troops from the two countries traded gunfire over propaganda leaflets South Korean activists floated across the border. In the second, North Korean soldiers were seen too close to the border, triggering a gunfire exchange. The North said its soldiers were engaging in routine patrol missions.
At the center of their recent animosities is North Korea’s demand that South Korea ban activists from launching the anti-Pyongyang leaflets. South Korea has said it cannot do so, citing freedom of speech.
The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the Korean War armistice has not been converted to a peace treaty.

Improved volumes in its Indian operations and better realisations in its North American operations saw Tata Chemicals report a 91 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 257 crore for the second quarter of 2014-15 ended September 2014.
The company’s consolidated revenue rose 11 per cent to Rs 4,803 crore and consolidated profit from operations rose 14 per cent to Rs 653 crore.
R. Mukundan, MD, Tata Chemicals told a press conference that the company’s European and Kenyan business restructuring were in progress.
In its Indian operations, Tata Chemicals’ net profit rose 96 per cent to Rs 209 crore and revenues rose 21 per cent to Rs 2,843 crore. It has a 69 per cent share in the national branded salt market.
Tata Chemicals’ gross debt was at Rs 8,300 crore with net debt at around Rs 6,000 crore of which the Indian operations’ gross debt was Rs 3,000 crore and net debt was at Rs 1,800 crore. It expects to reduce debt by half over the next five years. P.K.Ghose, CFO, Tata Chemicals, said “In 2017, a major debt repayment coming up and thereafter, the net debt in India should come down to negligible levels.’’
Mr. Mukundan expected soda ash prices to remain stable. “The government must table the urea policy. Our pulses business reported Rs 100 crore turnover in the first-half of the year and we expect it to close the financial year with a Rs 200 crore turnover. Tata Spices, including chili, turmeric, coriander and masalas, launched in Punjab during the quarter. The focus is on the north Indian markets for now.’’
“As we continue to focus on reshaping the portfolio to enhance share of consumer product business and non-subsidised farm inputs business, we will also simultaneously be concentrating on improving our balance sheet by regularly reviewing non-performing and non-core investments,’’ Mr. Mukundan said, adding that the demand environment was positive for the second-half of the year.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Tata Chemicals rose 1.18 per cent to close trading at Rs 423.5.

Israeli soldier and woman stabbed to death byPalestiniansParamedics treat an Israeli soldier after he was stabbed in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday. (Source: AP photo)

An Israeli soldier and a woman were stabbed to death by Palestinians in Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank on Monday, extending a surge in violence fuelled by strife over access to Jerusalem’s holiest site.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to crush “terror being directed at all parts of the country” – remarks appearing to clash with Israeli security chiefs’ assertions that the tumult did not yet spell a new Intifada, or Palestinian revolt.
The soldier’s stabbing at a train station in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial capital, brought bloodshed to a city that has largely been spared since the last uprising died down in 2005. Police identified the suspected assailant, who was arrested, as a West Bank resident who was in Israel illegally and had no criminal record there.
Hours later, a Palestinian stormed out of a car to stab an Israeli woman to death and wound two other people outside the Jewish settlement of Alon Shvut in the West Bank, police said.

The attacker was shot and wounded by a guard, they added. The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed him as one of its own and an Israeli security official said he had been jailed between 2000 and 2005 for a petrol bomb attack.
Tension has risen anew over Israeli-controlled access to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam’s third holiest site, where biblical Jewish temples once stood.
Stone-throwing protests have erupted in several Arab towns in Israel since Saturday, when police killed an Arab youth who assaulted them. Last week, a Palestinian rammed his car into pedestrians in central Jerusalem, the second such incident in as many weeks, killing two Israelis. Police shot the driver dead.
There was no immediate comment on Monday’s stabbings from the U.S.-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which is based in the West Bank, whose peace talks with the Netanyahu government collapsed in April.
Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group with de facto control over the Gaza Strip, where it fought a war with Israeli forces in July and August, hailed the attacks as “a response to crimes conducted by the occupation (Israel) in Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa”.
Israel refers to the Al-Aqsa compound as the Temple Mount and some Jewish nationalists have been stepping up demands to pray there, infuriating Palestinians despite Netanyahu’s repeated vow to maintain a decades-old arrangement with Jordan – the compound’s custodian since 1924 – that only Muslims may worship there.
Speaking in parliament, Netanyahu said “terror … is being directed at all parts continued…

China publishes photos of Earth  Moon taken by lunarorbiterBy: Press Trust of India | Beijing | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:24 am
China on Monday published photographs of the Earth and Moon together taken by the orbiting service module of the country’s first unmanned lunar orbiter, which returned to Earth earlier this month.
The photos were taken by the service module at a point 540,000 km from the Earth and 920,000 km from the moon after it was separated from the return capsule of test lunar orbiter on November 1, ending its eight-day mission.
It was the world’s first mission to the moon and back in about 40 years, with China becoming the third country in the world to do so after the former Soviet Union and the US.
The service module went back into orbit and conducted more tests after the November 1 separation, about 5,000 km above the Earth, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, which released the photos, said in a statement.
Launched on October 24, the orbiter traversed 840,000 km in eight days in a mission that saw it go around the far side of the moon.
One of the biggest challenges was a “bounce” during the orbiter’s re-entry as it made its way home, as it must enter the atmosphere at a very precise angle.
An error of 0.2 degrees would have rendered the mission a failure.
The program is a test run for the final chapter of the country’s three-step lunar program, which includes orbiting, landing and returning.
The latest mission is to obtain data and validate re-entry technology such as the heat shield and trajectory design for a future landing on the moon as part of the Chang’e-5 mission, expected to be launched around 2017 to collect lunar samples and return to Earth.
If successful, China will become the third nation to do so, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

United Nations | Posted: November 11, 2014 10:08 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 11:11 am
An eminent Indian official has been named on a UN inquiry panel set up by the world body’s chief Ban Ki-moon to probe the presence of arms in UN premises in the Gaza strip and the damage to its facilities during the conflict between Israel and Palestinian factions.
K C Reddy, a former UN security advisor for Syria, has been named to the internal and independent United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry that will be chaired by Patrick Cammaert of The Netherlands.
The formation of the inquiry board by the UN Secretary-General is aimed at reviewing “certain incidents that occurred in the Gaza Strip between July 8 and August 26,” Ban’s deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters here on Monday.
The board would include Maria Vicien-Milburn of Argentina, Lee O’Brien of the United States and Pierre Lemelin of Canada.
The board would review and investigate a number of specific incidents in which death or injuries occurred at and damage was done to United Nations premises.
The board would also review and investigate incidents in which weapons were found to be present on UN premises.
“The Secretary-General expects that the Board will enjoy the full cooperation of all parties concerned,” Haq said.
During his visit last month to the war-ravaged enclave, Ban had called for a thorough investigation into incidents where UN facilities –- including schools run by the UN agency tasked with assisting Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) –-sustained hits resulting in the deaths of numerous innocent civilians and UN staff members.
The fighting –- which raged from July 8 to August 26 –-saw entire neighbourhoods in the Gaza strip flattened, and almost one-third of the area’s population uprooted.
The violence killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, including more than 500 children, and more than 70 Israelis while also damaging or destroying over 100,000 homes.
In Gaza last month, Ban voiced horror at the extent of the destruction, stating that “nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed.”
In July, Ban had expressed outrage over rockets being  found in a UN-administered school in Gaza and had called for a full review of the incident.
Rockets found in the UNRWA school subsequently went missing.
Ban had demanded that militants groups, who were responsible must stop such actions and should be held accountable for endangering the lives of civilians.
The UN Chief had said that by placing weapons in schools, “those responsible are turning schools into potential military targets, and endangering the lives of innocent children, UN employees working in such facilities and anyone using the UN schools as shelter.”

Coal scam: CBI files revised final closure report in case against K M BirlaCoal scam: CBI files revised final closure report in case against K M Birla

New Delhi, Oct 21:  
The Central Bureau of Investigation today filed a “detailed and comprehensive” revised final closure report before a special court in a coal block allocation scam case involving top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, former coal secretary P C Parakh and others.
The agency filed the report before Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar and said that it contains a detailed report of investigation being carried out in the case.
“Investigating Officer (IO) DSP K L Moses has filed a revised final report which is stated to be detailed and comprehensive....the final report is also in the nature of a closure report. Special Public Prosecutor R S Cheema seeks some time to advance arguments...Put up for November 10,” the judge said.
During the hearing, the investigating officer told the court that as directed earlier, that they are filing all the documents related to the case before the court.
CBI also filed certain additional documents which were seized during the investigation before the court.
During the hearing, the judge asked CBI that if he will take cognisance of the final report filed by the agency, then how it will provide the list of witnesses and documents to the court.
Responding to this, Cheema said, “Now we are taking precaution” and the agency will see that each and every document is filed in the court.
Cheema also told the court that the final revised closure report filed today deals with everything collected by the agency during the investigation.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others. CBI had on August 28 filed a closure report in the case.
The FIR against Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours”.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III “citing valid reasons”.

Hot travel tips from AirAsia India CEO Mittu ChandilyaStory
Travel light, be adventurous
Don't let the horizon limit your travels, says AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya. Hot travel tips from the hottest new face in the aviation industry.
   Edition: Oct 26, 2014
Travel light, be adventurous
At 33, Airasia india's Mittu Chandilya is the youngest CEO in the aviation industry. "I became the head of AirAsia India last year. But then, I have always been the youngest at most accomplishments in my life," he says. "I am an entrepreneur at heart with a professional athlete's mentality. There is absolutely no compromising on hard work - prep, prep and more prep; it's never wasted."
"I am a regular at the gym.I used to play football at university, so I feel sluggish if I don't work out."
And when it comes to travel, who better to ask than the man responsible for orchestrating the latest revolution in the Indian aviation industry? We quiz Mittu Chandilya on his travel experiences across the world, and gather some valuable information on how to organise our own getaways.
Check, double check
I always plan ahead for my trips; it can make a great difference even if you are a frequent flier. Now, this may sound simple, but I can't stress enough on the need to not leave your passport behind. Pack your bags in advance, so you do not forget anything at the last moment. Keep a digital copy of your itinerary at all times, and if you're going through a smaller airport, a hard copy would be a good idea. Most importantly, be at the check-in counter at least two hours before departure time.
Do your research
You can do a whole lot before you actually reach the airport. Go online, block your seats and pick any preference you may have (do this at least four hours before your flight takes off, especially if you are a picky eater and want to fix meal preferences). Research your destination too. Check on immigration and immunisation requirements, book your hotel room, and ensure that you have a prepaid cab at your beck and call.
Travel light
That's what I prefer, anyway. I usually take just my carry on bag, and the essentials are a couple of white shirts, running shoes, gym wear, a couple of ties, a suit and a navy blue sports jacket, a pair of trousers, jeans, sunglasses and - well - cosmetics. As I'm no fan of airline food on domestic flights, unless it is AirAsia (wink), I pack a bag of nuts and raisins or protein cookies to curb those hunger pangs.
My gadgets
Some things that are absolutely critical for all my trips are my laptop or iPad , and enough juice (in the form of battery packs and power adapters) to keep them going through the worst of times. I find my iPad quite convenient, for documentation as well as carrying around. But, that said, my phone is number one on the list because it provides me updates on our operations, safety factors and service every minute of the day. What's more, it keeps me connected with the social media too. Last on my list, but definitely not the least, are my noise-cancellation headphones (Bose Q15, Bowers & Wilkins P5 or my wireless Parrot Zik). They create a distraction-free environment when I need to work out, snooze or work onboard.
Fitness on the go
For me, good health starts with diet. Half the battle is won when you watch what you eat. Focus on nutrition, ensure that you are get what your body needs, and cut out what is harmful for your body. However, I am not one of those who counts every calorie he eats; I depend more on working out. I usually play a lot of football. On days I have to travel, I pack my running shoes and gym clothes. If I am supposed to be gone all day, I wake up early and hit the gym.
Be adventurous
Rather than stick to conventional tourist hotspots at a holiday destination, I prefer finding places on my own. I usually never take maps or guidebooks; instead, I walk down the street and talk to local folks about the place. You get a much more genuine, unabridged and rich flavour of the place when you do this. While such a course of action is not without its risks, it's definitely a more adventurous option.

Landmark HK-China stock trading scheme to start on Nov 17Landmark HK-China stock trading scheme to start on Nov 17

Reuters A banner introducing the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect is displayed in front of a panel showing the closing blue-chip Hang Seng Index at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Hong Kong November 10, 2014. Hong Kong and Shanghai will link their stock exchanges on November 17, regulators said on Monday, in a move that will grant foreign investors unprecedented access to China's $3.9 trillion stock market and create the world's third-largest equity market.
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 10:  
A long-awaited trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai will launch on November 17, a crucial step towards opening China's capital markets that will give foreign and Chinese individual investors unprecedented access to each others' stock exchanges.
The announcement by Hong Kong and Chinese regulators on Monday comes as China is making a big push to widen the use of the yuan, with Canada and Malaysia becoming the latest addition to a growing list of trading hubs for the currency.
Snapshot
Link allows foreigners to buy more China stocks
Could create world's third largest equity market
Launch of scheme was expected late October
Move is milestone in opening-up of China capital markets
Chinese retail investors can buy foreign shares directly for first time
The so-called Stock Connect trading scheme could boost the average daily value of stock trading in Hong Kong by about 38 percent by 2015, French bank BNP Paribas estimates, and may ultimately lead to the creation of the world's third largest stock exchange.
The project will at the same time provide a channel for Chinese savers to start moving some of the $8 trillion of private wealth currently in deposits into overseas stocks.
"This marks an important milestone in the liberalisation of the mainland's capital account," said Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Norman Chan. "It will also propel the development of offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong to new heights."
Chinese markets rallied as the launch date was announced.
The Stock Connect programme was originally expected to launch on October 27, but that unofficial deadline passed, leading to speculation that the programme might be held up by technical or political hurdles.
Hong Kong's leader CY Leung hinted last week the recent pro-democracy protests in the city had played a role in the delay.
Industry participants had also said uncertainty over the taxation of capital gains was a possible sticking point.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. CEO Charles Li said on Monday the tax regime for the trading link would be announced before the launch next week. "I wouldn't waste time agonising about it," he told reporters.
If the two stock markets become further integrated, they would form the world's third-largest equity market with a $5.6 trillion capitalisation, according to Allianz Global Investors.
China already operates several cross-border investment schemes but these are restricted to specific firms that must apply for a license to participate.
Giving foreigners easier access to Chinese stocks could provide support for an ongoing stock market rally and liquidity to upcoming Chinese stock market listings.
Chinese stocks have been among the world's worst-performing in recent years, down nearly 25 percent from five years ago. But they have been rallying since summer and look set to post their best annual performance since 2009.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Monday regulators are ready to experiment with resuming same-day settlement for stocks after a long freeze, a move that would put Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges on the same settlement regime and eliminate a big operational mismatch.

Sensex  Nifty pare gains  end flat on profit bookingMarket update: Sensex, Nifty end flat on profit booking after logging record highs in early trade

After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark Sensex on Monday ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share BSE Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75.
It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Hind Unilever, Coal India , Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet , lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 20:39 IST
Indian Inc expects a 23 per cent increase in hiring next year, according to a survey.
Indian employers across the major sectors forecast an overall increase of 23 per cent in hiring outlook for the next year, said 'India Skills Report 2015', released at the Confederation of Indian Industries' (CII) Sixth Global Summit On Skill Development.
The report is jointly prepared by global talent assessment company Wheebox, India's platform based multi-process HR outsourcing and recruitment company PeopleStrong and the world's largest professional online network Linkedin and CII.
Hospitality and travel sectors lead the way with an increase of over 50 per cent in recruitment numbers in the coming year, the study said. These two sectors are closely followed by banking, financial services and insurance and core segments.
The lowest growth in hiring is expected in manufacturing, telecom and pharma which seem to be directly correlated with the growth that companies in these sectors target, the study said. It also said New Delhi and Mumbai are among the most preferred locations to operate. Apart from these two, Karnataka and Gujarat seem to rank higher as preferred locations, the study said. These two states are amongst the few states reforming policies to make it easier for corporates to set up operations, the report said.

Alarming! 50% Indian youths have experienced cyberbullyingThis behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 9:38 pm
According to a study conducted by McAfee, part of Intel Security, half (50%) of the youth in India have had some experience with cyber-bullying (been cyberbullied online or witnessed others being cyberbullied), out of which one-third (36%) have been cyberbullied themselves. The McAfee study aims to educate on the impact that risky behaviour has on their privacy, reputation and social media experiences.
This behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact. The study highlights how risky online activity can possibly make them even more susceptible to cyberbullying, substantiated through some of the following statistics.
An eye-opening trend is that half (52%) of India’s youth even access their social media accounts while at school, with tweens (57%) being more connected during school hours than teens (47%). Even though the minimum age to register to on social networking sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tinder, Tumblr, and Vine is 13, 10-12 year olds report higher daily access to than their teen counterparts.
Oversharing of risky information: Despite a majority (80%) of Indian youth being aware that their online activity can affect their identity, 92% have done or posted something risky online. An added fact is that of these, 70% have posted their contact details like email, phone and home address.
Youth are increasingly trusting unknown people in the virtual world, in spite of being aware that it is risky. 53% have met someone in person that they first met online. 63% of youth do not turn off their location or GPS services across apps, leaving their locations visible to strangers.
Another critical concern stemming from peer pressure is youth feeling compelled to portray an untrue image of themselves online. 64% even admit to trying  to reinvent their online personas making themselves appear older, creating fake profiles or posting photos that are not their own. Moreover, 46% say they would put themselves in danger to see more engagement/ activity on their posts (e.g., more likes, comments, shares or retweets).
The most surprising finding was that most parents in India simply don’t care about even having a conversation with their children on online safety.

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
The state owned helicopter operator, Pawan Hans Helicopter Limited (PHHL) and airport operator, Airports Authority of India (AAI) are to be listed on the stock exchange, Minister for Civil Aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju, said on Monday. Set up in 1985, PHHL is currently the largest helicopter operator in the country.
A senior Ministry official told newspersons that no time frame has yet been fixed by when the two entities will be listed or what percentage of the Government’s holdings in the companies will be shed.
“It will be easier to list PHHL because it is already a registered company. It could take up to six months for listing PHHL. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment as it is the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of the two entities,” the official who declined to be identified said.
Briefing newspersons after releasing the draft Civil Aviation policy, the Minister also said that an expert committee will be set up to draw up a future road map for Air India which will help it achieve its full potential.
International hubs
The draft policy, which is now available in the public domain for greater participation from stakeholders, proposes enhancing regional air connectivity, developing six major metro airports as international hubs, creating more airports through PPP mode, rationalising jet fuel costs, promoting air cargo, starting Maintenance Repair and Overhaul services and helicopter operations apart from stressing on improving passenger facilitation.
The Minister expressed the hope that the draft policy will be finalised by January next year.
Air India privatisation
The Minister also hinted at the eventual divestment of Air India pointing out that there were several suggestions made by different sections including some saying that privatisation is a solution while others felt it should remain a public entity.
Pointing out that there were several issues which had been mentioned in the draft policy but for which the Cabinet will not will be required including doing away with the five year and 20 aircraft rule for allowing domestic airlines to start international operations. The Minister added that the 5/20 rule did not make sense.

Enough evidence to proceed against Birla  others in coal block case: CBIEnough evidence to proceed against Birla, others in coal block case: CBI
PTI

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
In an apparent U-turn, CBI, which had filed a closure report in a coal blocks case involving industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, former coal secretary P C Parakh and others, today told a special court there was enough evidence against the accused to take cognisance of offences.
The Supreme Court appointed-special public prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema submitted before Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the court can take cognisance on the closure report filed by it on October 21 as there was prima facie “evidence against the accused to show their involvement’’.
The court after hearing the submissions advanced by Cheema and CBI prosecutors V K Sharma and A P Singh fixed the matter for November 25 for consideration of the agency’s closure report.
“SPP states that under the facts and circumstances of the case, prima facie there is enough material to take cognisance of the offences against private parties and some of the government officials involved in the process of coal blocks allocation. Put up for consideration on the closure report on November 25,” the judge said.
The CBI also placed on record a compilation of relevant documents relating to the case.
During the hearing, Cheema said, “We are asking for cognisance on the closure report as there was evidence against the accused to show their involvement.”
The judge asked the prosecutor that if the court decides to take cognisance of the offences, will the agency be ready with its documents? To this, Cheema said some further investigation was required in the matter.
Earlier, on October 21, CBI had filed a “detailed and comprehensive” revised final closure report before the court.
The FIR against Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours’’.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.

Bilaspur: 8 women dead  20 others in a serious condition after faulty sterilisationcampA woman being taken to hospital on Monday. (Source: Express photo)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Bilaspur | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:10 am | Updated: November 12, 2014 9:11 am
As the death toll rose to 12 on Tuesday, three days after the sterilisation camp organised by the state government in Takhatpur block of Bilaspur district on Saturday, enquiries revealed that besides medical negligence, guidelines and procedures outlined for such operations were also seemingly violated.
Of the 83 women who underwent laparoscopic tubectomies, over 50 are still in hospital. Twenty-five of them are reported to be critical.
According to the central government’s guidelines, a medical team cannot conduct more than 30 laparoscopic tubectomies in a day, with three separate laparoscopes — that means not more than 10 tubectomies with a single instrument, as each instrument needs to be properly sterilised after every operation.
The guidelines state that if there are additional surgeons, instruments and supplies, the number of operations per team can be increased, but in no case should it exceed 50. Even then, it puts a cap of 10 operations by a single surgeon with a single instrument.
The hospital where camp was held has been sealed
But in Bilaspur, just one doctor, Dr R K Gupta, conducted 83 operations with one instrument in five hours — less than four minutes per operation. Dr Gupta is considered an expert in such cases, and was awarded by Chief Minister Raman Singh on January 26 this year for conducting 50,000 laparoscopic tubectomies.
The government’s guidelines also state that all sterilisation camps must be organised only at “established healthcare facilities” recognised by the Government of India. However, the Bilaspur operations were conducted at a private charitable hospital in Pendri village which has remained closed, almost abandoned, for about a year now.
A health worker who was present at the camp said one room of the hospital was opened, and all the women were made to lie down on the floor for the tubectomies. Though the government claimed to have sealed the hospital yesterday, many people visited it today.
While State Health Minister Amar Agarwal denied pressure to meet targets set under the central government’s family planning scheme, health officials pointed at the data to indicate that they face routine pressure to hurriedly meet the targets.
According to the available records, this was not the first time that so many tubectomies were conducted in a single day. Officers of the family planning department noted that there has not been a single instance in the last several years when the number of laparoscopic tubectomies conducted at a camp by a doctor in a day was less than the prescribed ten. “This figure often crosses 100,” said an official.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Tuesday and is learnt to have taken strong exception to the incident. “The PM has asked Singh to ensure a thorough continued…

Nov 11:  
General Electric Co Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt will personally profit if the US conglomerate reaches certain cash and operating profit margin targets over the next three years.
According to a US securities filing on Monday, the compensation committee of GE's board granted Immelt 200,000 “performance share units,” or PSUs, that will convert into GE stock at the end of three years based on two equally weighted goals.
The first goal is total cash, including GE cash from operating activities and net gains from dispositions. Immelt earns half of the targeted amount of PSUs, if the company reaches $50 billion through 2016, and the full amount if it reaches $55 billion.
The second goal is operating margins. If GE's operating margin is 16.5 per cent by 2016, Immelt earns half, while he earns the full amount if the margin reaches 17 per cent.
The profit margin goal is in line with what Immelt has outlined already for the company. GE has said it is targeting 17 per cent profit margins for its industrial businesses by 2016, up from 15.7 per cent last year.
In addition, the compensation committee granted Immelt 500,000 stock options, consistent with a long-term incentive plan, according to the filing.
The company plans to provide similar incentives to other top GE executives, according to the filing.
Immelt's salary in 2013 was $3.47 million, his bonus was $5 million and his total compensation was $19.8 million.

Crude oil extends lossesTweet
Singapore, Nov 11:  
Crude oil prices extended losses in Asia today as the prospects of a production cut by the OPEC oil cartel dimmed, despite a global supply glut, analysts said.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for December delivery fell 11 cents to $77.29, while Brent crude for December delivery eased 22 cents to $82.12 in mid-morning trade.
No output cut
WTI crude tumbled $1.25 in New York yesterday after Kuwait said the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to cut output when it meets in Vienna on November 27.
Brent crude fell $1.05 in London to its lowest settlement price since October 2010.
“I do not expect OPEC to make any production cut. A decision like this will be very difficult,” Kuwaiti oil minister Ali al-Omair had said on Monday at a conference in Abu Dhabi, cited by the official KUNA news agency.
Bearish market
Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said the comments added pressure to an already bearish crude market.
“The weakness in prices reflects a realisation among investors on the difficulty of OPEC getting through an agreement on cutting output to deal with global oversupply,” McCarthy told AFP.
“It is quite clear that a number of OPEC countries would prefer a cut, but there will be considerable resistance from Saudi Arabia,” he added.
Multi-year lows
Oil prices plunged to multi-year lows last week after Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s kingpin and the world’s top producer, cut its prices for crude sold to the US market.
Analysts interpreted the move as an effort to maintain market share as it faces competition from cheaper oil from US shale fields.
OPEC pumps about a third of global crude and is currently producing just under 31 million barrels per day, around one million higher than its ceiling.
Ukraine crisis
Investors are also monitoring the situation in east Ukraine as fears increase of a resumption of all-out fighting between government forces and pro-Russian rebels in violation of a ceasefire agreement.
Ukraine is a key conduit for Russian natural gas exports to Europe.

Kin of dead US soldiers sue 5 banks over Iran dealingsKin of dead US soldiers sue 5 banks over Iran dealings
PTI
Tweet
New York, Nov 11:  
Families of US soldiers killed in Iraq and soldiers wounded there in attacks linked to Iran have sued five European banks, alleging their business with Iran helped finance the attacks.
HSBC, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Barclays Bank were sued in the federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, over their already admitted banking business with Iran in violation of US sanctions.
RBS was accused over activities of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank taken over by RBS in 2008.
The plaintiffs, including the families of dozens of US soldiers who died in Iraq, allege that by tapping into the global financial system via those banks, Iran was able to finance “hundreds” of attacks in Iraq via the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and its own Revolutionary Guards between 2003 and 2011.
“Iran used and continues to use the global banking system to purposefully circumvent US and other sanctions regimes to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Osen LLC, the law firm working for the plaintiffs yesterday.
“In order to evade detection, Iranian banks enlisted many of the world’s largest financial institutions to help Iran cover up its web of transactions in support of its terrorist activities.”
The suit is based on a 1992 US law that makes it possible for people injured in terror attacks, or the families of those killed, to sue anyone culpable in the attacks for financial damages.
All five of the banks have been heavily fined by US banking regulators for handling international financial transactions for Iranian entities in violation of the sanctions, and trying to hide the transactions.
But the suit goes a step farther.
It alleges that the banks knowingly took part in Iran’s “conspiracy” to evade financial sanctions.
In addition, it alleges that they “also committed further acts of international terrorism... by knowingly (or with reason to know) facilitating financial transactions with Iran, which each such defendant knew was a designated State Sponsor of Terrorism.”

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
India's top business school, IIM Ahmedabad, recently hosted its annual knowledge summit ConneXions 2014, a flagship event of the PGPX batch at the business school. The central theme of the summit this year was 'Resurgent India: Tapping Infinite Potential'.
Panel discussions
First day of the event kicked-off with three panel discussions on the theme 'New Age Banking' which was attended by a number of industry stalwarts and IIM-A alumni.
The first panel discussion was on financial inclusion and covered various issues including the Jan Dhan Yojana for brick and mortar branches and the importance of mobile banking. Professor Charan Singh, RBI Chair Professor of Economics Social Sciences at IIM Bangalore, moderated the panel discussion.
The second discussion was based on 'Integrating India into the Global Supply Chain'. India needs to address issues such as congestion at ports, poor railroad connectivity and complex taxation, said the panellists. They also stressed on the importance of growing the manufacturing sector in India.
The third panel discussion focused on 'Brick and Mortar vs. E-Commerce'. All the panellists agreed that customers are multi-dimensional and that the role of retailers was to serve customers the way they want to be served.
ConneXions
Second day of ConneXions started with an address by Kumud Srinivasan, President, Intel India.
In a stimulating discussion, Srinivasan spoke about how over 85 per cent of deployed electronic systems today were unconnected with each other or the larger cloud. She urged the audience to think about how if we could add connectivity to this equation, the potential would be enormous.
The panel discussions on the day focussed on vision for a digital India and the challenges faced. Some of the industry experts who participated in the discussions include Ambarish Dasgupta - Head of Management consulting at KPMG; Venkatesh Krishnan - Vice President Technology Business at Oracle India; Nalinikanth Gollagunta - MD, Commercial Sales for Cisco India and SAARC; Sudipta Ghosh - India Data and Analytics Partner at PWC India; and Ganesh Ramamoorthy - Research VP at Gartner India.
A 10 km and 5 km run called 'IIMA Run for a Cause' marked the commencement of the third day at ConneXions. About 200 runners, including around 100 participants from the IIMA fraternity, also participated in the run, which started from IIMA's New Campus to Panjarapol.
The two runs were organised to generate funds for the philanthropic arm of IIMA - Prayaas. The initiative helps underprivileged children from and around the Vastrapur area to get an opportunity to learn in schools.

Rupee trading weak at 61.55Rupee closes lower at 61.55 vs dollar
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 11:  
The rupee weakened for the fourth trading session Tuesday to end 5 paise lower at 61.55 against the dollar. The dollar strengthened and banks bought dollars to limit sharp depreciation in the Indian unit.
The unit had closed at 61.50 on Monday.
It opened a tad weaker at 61.60 against the dollar due to slower inflow of funds from foreign investors. It gained to 61.52 as capital inflows continued into the domestic equity markets.
However, the American dollar climbed to a 7-year high against the yen after reports of a likely to delay in the planned sales tax increase by Japan. In addition, banks bought dollars likely on behalf of the RBI, in order to limit sharp fall in the rupee. This pulled the rupee to a day’s low of 61.64.
Later, stable capital flows helped the rupee recover to 61.55 at day’s close.
On Wednesday, the bank union strike may impact volumes of the trading session.
Call rates, bond yields
The inter-bank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from one another, ended higher at 8.90 per cent from Monday’s close of 7.80 per cent.
Yield on the 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, hardened a tad to 8.18 per cent from the previous close of 8.17 per cent. The price of the bond fell to Rs 101.39 from Rs 101.45.

McDonalds recalls Happy Meal toy for choking riskMcDonald’s recalls Happy Meal toy for choking risk

Washington, Nov 11:  
McDonald’s is recalling a Hello Kitty-themed whistle given to children in Happy Meals, citing a chance that they could choke on some of its parts.
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission had said yesterday that two children have reportedly coughed out pieces of the whistle that they had sucked into their mouths, including one child who received medical attention.
The safety agency said that parts of the three-inch-tall “Hello Kitty Birthday Lollipop” whistle can detach and be inhaled, posing a risk to small children.
McDonald’s said about 2.5 million whistles were manufactured but the majority were not sent to restaurants.
The toys that were handed out in the US and Canada in October and November were in Happy Meals and Mighty Kids Meals.
The fast-food chain said it has recovered about 1.6 million whistles.
Consumers should return the whistle to any McDonald’s for a free replacement toy.

Washington, Nov 11:  
CNN has said that it is suspending broadcasting in Russia “in light of recent changes in Russian media legislation’’, which aim to tighten the control on independent news media.
A statement from CNN International parent Turner International, which is part of the Time Warner conglomerate, offered no specific timetable, but the Tass news agency reported earlier that broadcasts would cease as of December 31.
“Turner International is assessing its distribution options for CNN in Russia in light of recent changes in Russian media legislation,” the Turner statement had said yesterday.
“We are bringing our existing distribution relationships to an end while we do that. We hope to re-enter the market in due course, and will notify our partners of any update about resuming these services.”
The statement noted that the CNN Moscow bureau operation, which covers Russia for the cable news operation, was “unaffected’’.
Ukraine crisis
The move comes with Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly at odds with independent news media, especially over coverage of the Ukraine crisis.
A new law limits foreign ownership of media to 20 per cent, threatening some of the country’s most respected independent media outlets.
The largest media organisations in Russia are owned by the state or controlled by Putin associates.
CNN is seen through cable and satellite firms in Russia.

Infosys stock outperformed NSE IT index since Vishal Sikka joined company as CEO
Varun Sood, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 07.03AM IST

first non-founder chief executive
(It is the world’s most…)
BENGALURU: Last week, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, along with the company's senior managers, interacted with about 100 analysts at a five-star hotel over a three-day event in Orlando, making Ray Wang of Constellation Research remark that the newly-appointed boss was "inviting, not defensive", "forward thinking", "not retrospective" and "authentic not forced." His colleague Alan Lepofsky observed that this meeting had "more suits and ties" than any other conference he had been to this year.
Lepofsky is right, for an event by Infosys does manage to have the largest confluence of analysts. It is the world's most scrutinised company, with more than 57 analysts worldwide tracking a company that posted revenue of more than $8.2 billion last fiscal.
So what exactly has Sikka been up to in the 100 days since taking over as the first non-founder chief executive at the company?
To start with, he's attempting to bring about a cultural shift in mindset. "If we do the work of a drone, expect to be replaced," Sikka told the gathering. This cultural shift is largely being pushed by bringing in Design Thinking, a user-centric, problem-solving approach to help engineers make simple, wellwritten code. Already, the company has trained 5,238 employees and aims to have more than 30,000 engineers undergo the process at its Mysore facility.
The company has started placing a team of specialists across service lines who can solve what it believes are some of the challenging business problems enterprises face. The team of Value Ninjas is intended to help the company get more business from existing clients. Sikka's new team of seven former SAP executives, including five senior vice-presidents, will help drive this initiative, which requires a "product centric" background, said a senior company executive.
"Data analytics is the key for this will help customers as they seek faster innovation," according to the executive. This is validated by the company's decision to beef up hiring in its data analytics team, with 300 of the 2,100 professionals the company will hire in the US in the coming 12 months to join this group.
"The new Infosys is here," said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice-president at Constellation Research. "Infosys has been focused on product IP before, but there can be no doubt that the product focus has been renewed and reenforced with his appointment."
But are any of the 912 customers buying into Infosys's transformational exercise? Most importantly, has Infosys managed to win new accounts since Sikka's arrival? To be sure, the company posted better-than-expected second quarter results as revenue grew 3.2% over the April-June period to $2,201 million.
The event was attended by eight of Infosys' large clients, including Sean McCormack, chief technology officer at Harley Davidson, the US-based motorcycle maker. On the company's recently spunoff products, platforms and solutions business, which accounts for less than 5% of total revenues, Infosys management shared some early insights.
  Sanjay Purohit, boss of Edge-Verve, outlined six focus areas to scale up the division. The six scope areas are digital marketing, commerce, customer service, distribution (with TradeEdge), ecosystem management and procurement. "Purohit was pretty clear this is a real product offering, with the source code only available to his team," one of the analysts told ET.
Sikka is also focusing on a partnership model, with Infosys forging alliances with companies and universities. Internally too, the change of leadership at the top has brought in a renewed confidence and buzz among the employees. "In my sense, it (attrition) should come down to 13-15% in the next two to three quarters," UB Pravin Rao, chief operating officer, told ET in an interview last month. The 1,65,000-strong Infosys reported an attrition rate of 20.1% for the second quarter ended September.
Investors have been buoyant:
Since Sikka took over as chief executive on August 1, the stock has outperformed the broader National Stock Exchange IT index, up 24.3% versus 12.2%.

PepsiCo elevates its executives as CEO bench strength dwindles

(While none of the execes…)
By Duane D Stanford
ATLANTA: PepsiCo recently elevated three executives into bigger roles, marking the next wave of leadership at a company that has lost talent at the very top. Oswald Barckhahn, president of nutrition in North America; Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of foods in Latin America; and Mike Spanos, CEO of the greater China region, all were promoted in September.
While none of the executives is yet seen as a successor to CEO Indra Nooyi , the company is trying to replenish its talent pool after a number of high-level departures. The most recent loss came this week, when PepsiCo disclosed that president Zein Abdalla , who'd been considered a contender to succeed Nooyi, will retire at the end of the year.Barckhahn, who previously served as senior vice-president of Tropicana North America and general manager for Central Europe, is now responsible for Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana and Naked Emerging Brands.
Narasimhan is now in charge of Pepsi-Co's food brands in Mexico, Brazil, Central and South America as well as the Caribbean , reporting directly to Nooyi.
Spanos, who's been with PepsiCo for about 20 years, now leads the company's food, beverages and dairy businesses in China. He most recently was senior VP and chief customer officer for PepsiCo North America Beverages. Abdalla, 56, managed Pepsi-Co's European unit before being named president in September 2012, one of the company's highest posts. CFO Hugh Johnston also is considered a potential successor to 59-year-old Nooyi, who became CEO in October 2006 and hasn't said how long she intends to continue.
PepsiCo has lost at least two other highprofile executives this year. Brian Cornell , who had run the company's Americas Foods unit, became discount retailer Target Corp.'s CEO in August. Debra A Crew , who was president of PepsiCo North America Nutrition , became president and chief commercial officer of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. last month. The world's largest snack maker and secondbiggest beverage maker didn't give a reason for Abdalla's decision, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing.

Web & mobile-driven sales at McDonald’s, KFC on the rise, helping them cut costs by half
Ratna Bhushan, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 06.52AM IST
(The restaurant chains add…)
NEW DELHI: Hungry? If you have a smartphone, you can order a burger online and be rest assured McDonald's is lovin' it. But that's not the only chain that likes online orders. Domino's, KFC, restaurants like Mainland China and Punjab Grill and even local outfits such as Biryani Zone are pushing this route aggressively in an environment that continues to see sales and profits under pressure.
Why? Online orders slash the cost of restaurant chains by half because they reduce the dependence on call centres as these are routed directly from the website to the relevant outlet. They are also more convenient as they allow customers to order from anywhere — on the move or unable to make a phone call. The restaurant chains add that orders through apps help them inform customers about offers, promotions and new menu items, not always possible when an order is placed by phone and is dependent on how effectively the call centre operator can communicate.
"Sheer convenience is driving online ordering numbers," said Harneet Singh Rajpal, senior VP, marketing, at Jubilant FoodWorks. The company said its mobile ordering app has crossed 2 million downloads across smartphones, with the online contribution to delivery sales in the July-September quarter touching 27%, compared with 18% in the year earlier.
"People downloading apps on their mobiles or through their iPads or computer screens is not only a personalised way to order, it also saves us time and costs since the orders are flashed directly on kitchen screens of the concerned restaurants," Rajpal added. Jubilant reported a 5.3% decline in same-store sales compared with 6.6% in the year-ago quarter and a 12.7% decline in standalone net profit to .`29 crore in the July-September quarter.
In global markets such as the US, web and mobile ordering contributes more than 50-60% to sales of restaurants. In India, the trend is gaining ground very rapidly, said experts. Harminder Sahni, founder of consulting firm Wazir Advisors, said: "Online ordering can bring down cost by up to 40-50%... There is a direct correlation as the firms save on maintenance of call centre costs which reduces pressure on profitability."
McDonald's west and south region operator Hardcastle Restaurants revamped its online delivery business this January in recognition of the trend. "Ever since, contribution of our online delivery business has gone up from 5% to about 30% now," said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of Hardcastle, which runs 192 restaurants across the region. "With web and mobile ordering, it is very rewarding to report positive results in an intensely competitive market, even though we expect economic challenges to persist in the near term," Jatia added.
Harcastle reported a 7.9% decline in same store sales in the July-September compared with 5.5% in corresponding year-ago quarter. For KFC, Yum Restaurants' fastest-growing restaurant chain in India, online orders are almost a fourth of its delivery sales, a spokesperson said. Yum's India division system sales for the July-September quarter were down 4%.
Online food ordering platform foodpanda. in, which connects 4,000 restaurants in 100 cities and operates in 40-plus countries, said its mobile app has now crossed 5 million downloads. Foodpanda.in co-founder Rohit Chadda said even fine-dining restaurants such as Mainland China and Punjab Grill are getting traction on online orders. "While a combination of orders placed through computers and mobile apps is driving sales, there is a clear emerging preference towards using mobile apps for online ordering, ahead of computers or tablets." Chadda said.

Every November, the sleepy town of Pushkar slips into a frenzy that lasts a week. It is that time of the year when crowds from afar descend on the town and along with costumed troupes in vibrant colours throng the narrow lanes and bylanes that lead into one of the biggest bovine fairs in India.
The town is surrounded by small hills with patches of green. To catch a breathtaking view of the Pushkar Lake and the fair, one has to reach Savitri Temple, which thankfully is only a stone's throw away. Pushkar also boasts the only Brahma temple in the world.
Little surprise that Pushkar is a magnet for both godmen and shutterbugs. Pushkar organizes contests between locals and visitors, including a tug of war, for the occasion.

Google in race with Facebook, Microsoft for a slice of digital India

(US technology giants are…)
NEW DELHI: Drones, balloons or white spaces - what's best for highspeed Internet access in rural India? That's the choice that the government may be faced with.
US technology giants are tripping over each other to get a slice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India and Smart Cities projects. In less than three months, Google and Hewlett-Packard have followed Facebook and Microsoft to queue up in government office corridors to show off their technology wares, highlighting renewed foreign investor interest as India's economy recovers.
Google, the owner of the world's largest search engine, has sounded out the telecom department about providing 'inexpensive' Internet access across India through a network of helium-filled balloons, currently being tested for efficacy under 'Project Loon.' The solarpowered balloons are being run as pilot projects in New Zealand, California and Brazil and are Google's answer to arch-rival Facebook's solar-powered drones.
"Sundar Pichai wanted to meet telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and discuss the matter personally but their travel dates clashed on Pichai's recent visit to India," a person familiar with the company's plans told ET. Prasad was in Germany during the visit by Indian-origin Pichai, a senior vicepresident at Google, who is widely seen as the second-most important man in the company after Chief Executive Larry Page.
As a result, Google executives had met senior officials of the department, including telecom secretary Rakesh Garg. When contacted, the company said it didn't comment on market speculation.
Google, along with Facebook and Microsoft, are vying to deploy their alternative technologies to offer 'last-mile' broadband connections in remote and inaccessible parts of India to provide access to high-speed Internet. Under an ambitious Rs 1.13 lakh-crore 'Digital India' initiative, the government plans use the national optic fibre network project to deliver e-services in areas such as health, education to every nook and corner of the country.
The network, which is positioned to form the backbone of the Digital India programme, will be deployed only at the gram panchayat level. Reaching the end consumer - homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions - may require wireless technology, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Google's balloons, Facebook's drones and Microsoft's TV white space technology could fill this gap. Google's Project Loon uses balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 32 km to create an aerial wireless network that could provide Internet access at up to 3G-like speeds (see graphic).
DIGITAL RIVALRY
The competitive edge between the US behemoths came to the fore when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg recently played down the effectiveness of Google's balloons, saying they have a shorter life than drones and can't survive the rigour of weather patterns in the troposphere, which lies below the stratosphere, apart from lacking the precision and control offered by drones.
India, which has seen renewed interest from foreign investors after going through an image crisis post the Vodafone retrospective tax episode and the 2G telecom scam, seems to be the latest battleground for these US giants, which are focused on this hot investment destination.
The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government has tried to assuage foreign investors by terming the tax move - initiated under the previous United Progressive Alliance-II government -- as a bad idea and has taken steps to attract overseas funds by opening up new sectors such as defence manufacturing for overseas investment. Inflation is easing and economic indicators are off lows. The stock markets are at an all-time high, boosted by foreign portfolio investments, reflecting new-found confidence in the Indian economy.
Modi's trip to the US was a roaring success and was followed by high- profile visits of top honchos from the US corporate world, including Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Zuckerberg, and also that of Masayoshi Son, Softbank's billionaire founder and Japan's wealthiest businessman, all pointing towards an increased investor confidence.
  The queue of American technology giants seeking to collaborate in the Digital India drive reflects the growing confidence in investor sentiment in India, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
"There is a lot of excitement among global technology firms who want to partner in the multibillion dollar projects under the Digital India project and in building smart cities," Banerjee said, adding that while it was a significant opportunity for the technology companies, it would also benefit end users as India would become digitally connected.
HP KEEN ON SMART CITIES
IT giant HP is discussing ways it can work with the government in building smart cities, Howard Bowland, Vice President & General Manger TS support, Enterprise Group in the Asia Pacific region, told ET.

Maybe  it is time to buy your dream carPrices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
MUMBAI: Price hikes are around the corner, but for now, it's raining discounts for car buyers.
With no clarity on an extension of excise duty cuts beyond December 31, and cost pressures mounting, auto makers are expected to increase prices in January - in fact, some popular models may see a hike in prices over the next few weeks. Withdrawal of the tax benefits announced in February alone could make caRs costlier by 4-6%. Ahead of that, carmakers have sweetened the offers to push sales, as the all-important festival season has turned out to be one of disappointment.
According to industry executives and based on various offers from auto makers , the level of discounts and benefits has peaked to a record high of 10-15% of the cost of vehicles. The offers include cash discounts, free insurance and exchange bonus. In the luxury end of the market, manufactures are adding attractive finance packages to make the brands more easily accessible.
The year-end is approaching, too. Auto makers traditionally offer higher discounts during this period and in March to entice buyers who may otherwise wait for the New Year, calendar or fiscal, to make the purchase.
"Without exception, the year-end tends to offer the best deal to the customers," said Anuraag Mehrotra, executive director for marketing, sales and service at the Indian unit of Ford Motor . "The uptick in the industry has not been to the extent expected. However, consumer sentiment is still strong, so everyone wants to cash in on it," Mehrotra said.
In the mainstream market for cars costing up to Rs 15 lakh, the offers range from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1.1 lakh. For models costing more, they could be from Rs 1.5 lakh to as high as Rs 10 lakh.
The top two players in the local market, Maruti Suzuki and the Indian unit of Hyundai Motor, expanded their offers by 8-10% in November compared with the festival season. Others too have packaged attractive deals to close the year on a positive note, which so far has been a tough one for many.
"Consumer promotions are generally highest during these months. For the first time, diesel products are also available on discount during this period," said Rakesh Srivastava, senior vice-president for sales and marketing at Hyundai Motor India. Being the year-end, lot of used caRs are exchanged for new ones. So, carmakers have increased incentive on exchanges further for November and December.
In Mumbai discounts on the Wagon R Stingray and the diesel variants of the Dzire and Ertiga have increased by about Rs 5,000-20,000 since the beginning of this month. The Stingray is available with a discount of as much as Rs 80,000. Maruti offeRs heavy discounts on several other models as well.
"Discounts continue to be at an alltime high level. We won't be able to take them off so soon. Industry growth is not broad-based, it's more sentiment driven," a Maruti senior executive said recently while talking to analysts during its second-quarter earnings call.
In Delhi, Hyundai has introduced what it called a special price on the Eon small car. At Rs 2.45 lakh, it is Rs 43,000 cheaper than the earlier price. For the longstanding Santro hatchback, it offeRs a discount of Rs 38,500. Its discounts range from Rs 20,000 on the i10 Grand LPG to Rs 80,000 for the Sonata.
With major facelifts hitting the market, dealers who are saddled with prefacelift models of the Fiat Punto (Rs 80,000), Maruti Swift (Rs 25,000) and Mahindra Scorpio (Rs 50,000) are liquidating them at attractive prices.
But the offers aren't limited to old models. Renault's four-wheel-drive version of the Duster SUV, launched in this festival season, is already available at a special price of Rs 11.29 lakh, which is Rs 60,000 lower than its launch price.
Among luxury brands, Mercedes-Benz's E Class sedan is available with benefits worth Rs 3 lakh, while the offers on the Audi A3 , A4 and A6 range from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5.5 lakh. In the SUV space, Audi's Q3, Q5 and Q7 are available with benefits of Rs 60,000 to Rs 4.6 lakh. BMW is also making competitive offers.
November and December, which used be lean months for car sales, have started ringing in higher retails over the last few years. Carmakers too have started preparing their stock situation accordingly, said a senior executive at an MNC.

(Drivers interested in partnering…)
BENGALURU: Taxi hailing app Uber is partnering with financial services firms and automobile manufacturers to launch a vehicle financing program for Indian cab drivers, intensifying competition in the taxi services aggregation market where its rivals already offer such schemes.
Uber has partnered with lending companies including AU Financiers, Shriram Transport Finance and Toyota Financial Services, as well as automobile manufacturers like Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki , Tata Motors and Toyota.
"With this programme drivers can own their own car in just a couple of days," said Allen Penn who heads the Asian operations at Uber. "By removing barriers to owning a car and providing affordable financing and approvals in a speedy manner, we anticipate to create thousands of jobs in India."
Drivers interested in partnering with Uber can purchase vehicles with a down payment of as low as Rs 60,000 and at subsidised interest rates and financing terms. Uber said the drivers will need to be active partners on its platform with no other clauses attached to the scheme. "The drivers will continue to function as entrepreneurs and flexibility of working hours will continue, " said Penn.
Companies like Uber do not operate their own taxis but provide the technology platform that links taxi owners with passengers. "Since Uber ensures enough business to these drivers so that their vehicles are fully utilized, we are assured of our EMI payments," said Umesh Revankar, CEO, Shriram Transport Finance. However, Uber is not the first aggregator to make this move in India. Rival Ola and radio-taxi operator Meru have been actively helping drivers get cheaper rates on new cars and insurance since the last two years.
"We foster micro-entrepreneurship amongst drivers and over twothirds of our drivers are owners of their cars," said Pranay Jivrajka, vice president of operations at Ola. The aggregator, which bagged $210 million in funding led by Japan's SoftBank last month has set aside.`100 crore this financial year to foster entrepreneurship at the driver level. Ola claims its has helped more than 10,000 drivers in its network own their cars since it began a scheme for them two years back.
"The key motive behind the move is to bring loyal drivers under the fold," said Jaspal Singh, co-founder of Valoriser Consultants, which provides market research services for transportation companies. "This will surely help the ecosystem as some of the drivers are not eligible for a loan directly," he added.
Uber provides several incentives including minimum income guarantee for certain hours, reference bonus and incentive per trip to lure drivers to clock in more hours. "Long term strategy is to expand the market size by constantly increasing supply of good quality drivers. This is the major challenge for all aggregators," Singh said. At Meru, in addition to getting best prices on cars, drivers also get subsidised insurance rates and special discounts with dealers on spare parts.

Ferrari  Maserati to soon have their sales setups in IndiaTweet
Maserati plans to open a national sales company in India and is in the process of appointing an eight-member team.
MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Ferrari and Maserati will soon have their marketing and sales setups in place in India, as their Italian-American parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) Group wants to bring back these marquee brands that offer big opportunities in a market where the number of superrich is fast expanding.
Maserati plans to open a national sales company in India and is in the process of appointing an eight-member team, say people with knowledge of the matter. After that, it would decide on a dealership and, according to current plans, will start selling cars from the second half of 2015.
Ferrari, which will manage its Indian operations from Dubai , is in discussions with Yadur Kapur , who is associated with Aston Martin , Lamborghini and Rolls Royce , to appoint him as its principal dealer in Delhi. In Mumbai, it is talking to Navnit Motors, which sells brands such as BMW, Land Rover , and Rolls Royce. The plan is to offer cars from the first quarter of 2015.
"A high-level Ferrari team was in India last month to finalise sales of its high-end cars with new dealers," a person close the matter said. People associated with Kapur and Navnit Motors confirmed the talks.
A spokesperson for the local unit of Fiat said as part of Maserati's growth strategy, the group is constantly evaluating market opportunities, including in India. "We consider India as one of the key growth markets for the automotive industry worldwide. While we can confirm that we are planning to enter the Indian market in the medium term, it is too early to confirm details in terms of structure, setup and cooperation with other FCA Group brands.
We will make an announcement as soon as possible," the spokesperson said in an email. In August, FCA India president and MD Nagesh Basavanhalli had said the parent wanted to bring the marquee brands to India.
The market for super luxury cars in India isn't in a good shape, primarily because of high import tax. Fully-built imported cars attract taxes and other levies totaling 170% on the original price making them too expensive for local buyers. Still, the growing club of rich Indians is giving confidence to luxury carmakers to bring their products here. And, India still is one of the largest markets in the Asia Oceania region for cars costing more than Rs 2 crore.
"India has emerged perhaps as one of the hottest destinations for super luxury carmakers, thanks to its rapidly increasing number of billionaires coupled with the expanding base of passionate drivers," says Amit Kaushik, principal analyst, autos, at consultancy firm IHS .
Ferrari is likely to bring its models such as the California T convertible, V-12 FF, 458 Italia, F12 Berlinetta, 458 Spider and the La Ferrari to India, say people with knowledge of the matter. These models cost between Rs 3.5 crore and Rs 7 crore in India after taxes. Ferrari and Maserati previously had marketing arrangements in India. In 2011, Fiat appointed the Shreyans Group as the official importer for Ferrari in India. They had a separate deal for handling the Maserati brand. The arrangements fell through with the end of the Ferrari franchise earlier this year. The Maserati deal was terminated in 2012-13.

Bouncer cracks Shehzad s head openTweet

 Dashing Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad's career-best 176 was tinged with red on Monday as he was hospitalized after being struck by a Corey Anderson bouncer.
The incident happened when the young dasher attempted to hook a bouncer but was beaten by the slowness of the delivery. The ball thudded into the side of his helmet, flooring Shenzad, even as his bat fell on the stumps. The batsman was declared out hit wicket.
Watling and Anderson immediately curbed their celebration of what was only the Kiwis' second wicket across 115 overs to assist the injured batsman, who was in obvious agony on the pitch,
Shehzad was later diagnosed with a minor skull fracture and will require at least 48 hours to recover.

ONGCs idle fields to go on the blockEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
The government has decided to take back several of ONGC’s small and marginal hydrocarbon fields where it has made little headway and auction them afresh with attractive incentives, in keeping with its plan to pick low-hanging fruit for increasing the country’s oil and gas output.
While ONGC has 165 marginal fields (86 onshore and 79 offshore), only 74 are currently under production. As many as 26 are lying idle while another 65 are said to be at various stages of development. These marginal fields have estimated total reserves of 1,510 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe). Of this, nearly 340 mtoe is recoverable hydrocarbon.
The proposal to auction all the 26 idle fields and the majority of fields yet to be fully developed would be separate from the tenth round of bidding under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), a senior official told FE.
“The ministry is preparing a package of fiscal incentives to make these small oil and gas fields viable. Once the Cabinet clears the policy, the blocks would be auctioned,” the official added.
The process of identifying the blocks for re-auctioning has already started and would be finalised once ONGC surrenders them.
In FY14, only 7.19% of ONGC’s standalone crude oil production and 13.74% of its gas output came from marginal fields.
Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan targets to up hydrocarbon output from domestic fields by exploiting the marginal fields, a strategy he believes would yield immediate results.
The Maharatna explorer is finding it difficult to put these acreages under production since they are ‘not economically viable’ at the prevailing hydrocarbon price.
DK Sarraf, chairman and managing director of ONGC, refused to comment.
According to industry watchers, the gas drilled from marginal fields not connected to the pipeline network could be filled into cylinders and transported. The life of these fields would be less than a decade and, of this, four-five years would yield higher production.
Earlier, ONGC had sought a market-driven price for the hydrocarbon produced from its marginal fields. This means the company wants these fields to be exempted while forking out subsidy for compensating oil-marketing companies.
The ONGC board, under former chairman and managing director Sudhir Vasudeva, had decided to bid out 26 marginal fields comprising six in KG onshore, seven in Western onshore and 13 fields in Western offshore to private explorers as ‘service contracts’ under a fixed international pricing model. However, fluctuations in net realisation because of the higher subsidy burden did not allow the government firm a go-ahead.
In FY14, ONGC saw its highest-ever oil subsidy bill of Rs 56,384 crore. In the last fiscal, the Maharatna firm sold every barrel of crude oil for $106.72. However, it has to bear a subsidy of $65.75/barrel to compensate state-owned oil marketing companies, leading to a net realisation of just $40.97 a barrel.
India’s biggest exploration company saw its standalone crude oil output fall from 24.67 million tonne in FY10 to 22.25 million tonne in FY14. Similarly, gas output has increased marginally from 23.11 billion cubic metres in FY10 to 23.28 billion cubic metres in FY14.

Opinion poll: Delhiites want Kejriwal as CM  but BJP to get majorityLetters to  the editor
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will get absolute majority bagging around 46 seats in Delhi Assembly polls, riding on the ‘Modi wave’, while AAP is likely to win in 18 constituencies, an opinion poll said today.
As per the ABP News-Nielsen poll, Arvind Kejriwal is the most suitable candidate for the position of Chief Minister with 39 per cent of the respondents preferring him.
BJP’s Harsh Vardhan is a close second with 38 per cent while Sheila Dikshit has got support of 7 per cent respondents followed by Jagdish Mukhi who was preferred by 5 per cent.
The poll said BJP will have a vote share of 38 per cent as against AAP’s 26 per cent.
Congress will win in five constituencies with a further decline of three seats from eight it had won in Assembly polls in December last year, it said.
AAP had bagged 28 seats in the polls last year. The opinion poll said the Kejriwal-led party will get 10 seats less this time. The half-way mark in the 70-member Assembly is 36.
About two-third of the respondents said that they were satisfied with the work done by Kejriwal in his 49-day tenure.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the most popular leader amongst the respondents surveyed, leading with a huge margin of 63 per cent.
Kejriwal is the second-most popular leader with 25 per cent support. Rahul Gandhi trails behind with 12 per cent backing, the survey said.
The opinion poll was conducted among 6,528 respondents in 35 Assembly constituencies between November 5 and 7.

China publishes photos of Earth  Moon taken by lunar orbiterBy: Press Trust of India | Beijing | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:24 am
China on Monday published photographs of the Earth and Moon together taken by the orbiting service module of the country’s first unmanned lunar orbiter, which returned to Earth earlier this month.
The photos were taken by the service module at a point 540,000 km from the Earth and 920,000 km from the moon after it was separated from the return capsule of test lunar orbiter on November 1, ending its eight-day mission.
It was the world’s first mission to the moon and back in about 40 years, with China becoming the third country in the world to do so after the former Soviet Union and the US.
The service module went back into orbit and conducted more tests after the November 1 separation, about 5,000 km above the Earth, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, which released the photos, said in a statement.
Launched on October 24, the orbiter traversed 840,000 km in eight days in a mission that saw it go around the far side of the moon.
One of the biggest challenges was a “bounce” during the orbiter’s re-entry as it made its way home, as it must enter the atmosphere at a very precise angle.
An error of 0.2 degrees would have rendered the mission a failure.
The program is a test run for the final chapter of the country’s three-step lunar program, which includes orbiting, landing and returning.
The latest mission is to obtain data and validate re-entry technology such as the heat shield and trajectory design for a future landing on the moon as part of the Chang’e-5 mission, expected to be launched around 2017 to collect lunar samples and return to Earth.
If successful, China will become the third nation to do so, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China’s Trina Solar heeds PM Narendra Modi’s call, plans to ‘make in India’

Company Expansion
(Officials of the company,…)
NEW DELHI: Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to global manufacturers, Chinese company Trina Solar is planning to set up a facility over the next few years to "make in India, supply in India and even export from India".
Officials of the company, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) modules, participated in the World Economic Forum held in Delhi last week to actively look for a joint venture partner and assess the Indian market.
"As far as 'make in India' is concerned, maybe we can make in India, supply in India and even export from India. We want globalised manufacturing, not only 'make in China'," Zhiguo Zhu , senior vice president of Trina Solar and the president of its module business unit told ET. Zhu added that from next year the company would start expanding outside China. "We want 20-30% of our production to take place outside of China.
India is one of the places we are exploring to do this," he said adding that the company expected to double its revenue share from India to 10%.
In India, where it has been operating for three years, Trina Solar has a market share of over 10%. Of the total 2,700 Mw solar power capacity in the country, it has supplied solar power to projects with 280 Mw capacity.
Zhu exhorted the government to sort out a few issues that he said would make India more conducive for business and attractive to foreign investors, even as he expressed confidence in the India growth story.
"We don't see India as one country because there are too many provinces and that makes doing business very complicated. We have to spend a lot of time to understand this. We want the government to make the process simple.
Then more people will come here for investment," he said. Zhu also spoke of the need for special incentives such as land and infrastructure to foreign companies to facilitate investments. India also needs a simplified taxation structure to create a better business environment, he added.
The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE )-listed Trina Solar announced net revenues of $519.4 million for the second quarter of 2014. Its total shipments during this period stood at 943.3 Mw. In the third quarter, the company plans to report shipments of 1,060-1,120 Mw of PV modules.

BJPs strong message to alliesNew Delhi, November 10, 2014

MODI CABINET EXPANSION
BJP’s strong message to allies
Smita Gupta
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and (right) leaders of BJP allies Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), Ram Vilas Paswan (LJP) and Parkash Singh Badal (SAD). File pictures.
TOPICS
national politics
The BJP is clearly working towards a situation where it can dispense with coalition partners.
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s hardball tactics with the Shiv Sena, its ally of 25 years, refusing to give in to the latter’s demands on its choice of ministerial berths in Maharashtra, and at the Centre, while swearing in Sena rebel —now newly anointed BJP member — Suresh Prabhu as a Cabinet Minister on Sunday has sent out a strong message to all NDA allies: it can stay on in the coalition, but on the BJP’s terms.
The recent Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana presaged this approach: ahead of the elections, the BJP broke with the Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana and contested alone in both States. In Maharashtra, it won twice as many seats as the Sena and emerged as the single largest party, reversing their roles in the State; in Haryana, it won a majority. And in both States, the BJP formed the government, replacing the Congress.
In Punjab the BJP is the junior partner in the Shiromani Akali Dal government. Earlier this week, Ram Shankar Katheria, the BJP’s newly appointed Punjab affairs in-charge (who was inducted into the Union Council of Ministers on Sunday) spoke of the party contesting the Punjab Assembly polls due in 2017 on its own, in case “a favourable scenario develops in the State”: the BJP feels that this will help it disassociate itself from the anti-incumbency that the SAD government will be burdened with.
In the recent Haryana polls, anticipating that the BJP planned in the near future to cut ties with it, the SAD campaigned for the Indian National Lok Dal against the BJP.
However, sources in the TDP — that already had a Cabinet berth at the Centre and acquired an MoS in industrialist-turned-politician and TDP Rajya Sabha MP Y.S. Chowdary on Sunday — said Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and party supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu’s focus is on pushing the Centre to part with the resources necessary to help build a new capital for the newly created State. So, that alliance will remain intact for the moment; moreover, the next Assembly elections in the State are five years away. Besides, the BJP will take a while to build its party organisation in the State.
Two NDA allies in Bihar, the Lok Janshakti Party and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, already had representation in the Union Cabinet. But the LJP’s Ram Vilas Paswan who has held very senior portfolios at the Centre, including the Railways, at the Centre in the past only managed to get Food and Public Distribution when the government was first formed, a reflection of his party’s reduced bargaining power.
On the other hand, in Jammu and Kashmir that will be going to the polls later this month, if the BJP performs well, it may well be forced to form a government with the People’s Democratic Party, tipped to do well in the valley. Meanwhile, on Sunday to strengthen itself in the Jammu region, it inducted the National Conference’s Ajatshatru Singh, senior Congress leader Karan Singh’s son.
The dramatic turn of events on Sunday, when the BJP swiftly enrolled Mr. Prabhu as a member of the party and made him a Minister reflects the style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah — swift and decisive. Having won an overwhelming mandate in the general elections earlier this year, the BJP is clearly working towards a situation where it can dispense with allies — and Sunday’s expansion of the Council of Ministers is a pointer in that direction.

Travel snacks: Munch on these super-healthy snacks while travelling
You can easily avoid the convenience store staples like chips, soda and candy, which are little more than empty calories while travelling. Here are some interesting travel snacks. (Text: IANS)
Bite-sized dry fruits: Pep up your boring snacking options with loads of dried fruits like prunes, apricots and dates, which are nutritious energy boosters. Dried fruits are some of the healthiest alternatives to refined sugar, while also adequately satisfying a craving for sweets. Eating dried fruits while travelling is a great way to get the needed vitamins and nutrients. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Trail mix: This is an easy-to-make snacking option which you can store in an air-tight container while on the move. Combine raw nuts and seeds, and dried cranberries for a basic trail mix. Give it a glint of sweetness with dark chocolate chips, or if you want something with both crunch and spice, try adding wasabi peas. And don't forget the trail mix classic: raisins and peanuts. Change that up a bit, by mixing 2 tablespoons of dried cranberries and 1 tablespoon of peanuts and you have a single-serving, 100-calorie snack!  (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Flipkart may raise $1.5 bln in another fund-raising roundAmazon
(The company has raised a…)
BENGALURU: India's largest online retailer, Flipkart, could begin another round of mega fund-raising as it expands its product range catering to a widening base of customers. The Bengaluru-based firm will seek funding of about $1.5 billion and has begun shortlisting potential investors, according to two people with direct knowledge of the developments. "Talks haven't begun yet and Flipkart is looking to target only a few investors that they want on board," said one of the two persons directly involved in the process. "The fund-raising process is expected to begin in January 2015."
Flipkart, when contacted, declined comment on its fund-raising and investment plans. The company has raised a total of $1.2 billion this year and has just completed a round of festival sales marked by steep discounts. "At the pace at which it is making investments, Flipkart will deploy most of the funds it has raised by around mid-next year," said the source.
Discounting still accounts for a chunk of Flipkart's monthly costs, with promotions costing it at least Rs 70 crore each month, according to a person who works with Flipkart at a strategic level.
The company has also identified very specific areas to pump in money to ensure its goal of doubling in size by next year.
Post the blockbuster festive season sales of October, when the company shipped around 80 lakh items versus 50 lakh on average, the company has revised its internal targets to reach sales of $4 billion by the end of the current fiscal, according to sources.
A major area of focus is increasing the categories in which they have leadership. "It has built a lead in fashion with the Myntra acquisition. The same push needs to happen across categories," said Manish Saigal , managing director at advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal.
"Furniture and packaged food will be launched very soon," said a person directly involved in the process. The teams are being built for these product categories.
Rival Amazon India recently launched its gourmet and specialty foods category with over 155 Indian and imported brands. Amazon is yet to launch furniture. Snapdeal, on the other hand, already has a presence in these segments.
"There are aggressive existing competitors and large offline players could come in very soon. It makes sense to extend its leadership now," said Arvind Singhal , chairman of retail advisory Technopak.
The seven-year-old company will launch a wider range of lifestyle products and consumer durables. It already has its range of tablets and digital accessories (Digiflip), apparel (Flippd) and home appliances and personal healthcare products such as sandwich makers and hair dryers (Citron).
According to a person directly involved with the process, Flipkart will put more marketing muscle behind in-house brands.
"We have seen how Myntra's inhouse brands have performed and scaled. That is what will be done with the new brands."
For Myntra, its portfolio of about 10 in-house brands accounts for about 20% of overall sales. Its biker brand Roadster is already a Rs 100-crore brand.
Flipkart's stake acquisition in consumer appliances service provider Jeeves Consumer Services should be seen in this light. "When they have their own brand of appliances, they will have to handle servicing, warranties and other such issues.
They can't do this all on their own," said one of the persons who spoke to ET on this matter. A Flipkart spokesperson said through this (strategic) partnership, Jeeves will provide exclusive value-added services in ecommerce to Flipkart customers across India.
"Flipkart and other marketplaces will have to invest humungous amounts into logistics and fulfilment if they want to cover even rural areas," said Technopak's Singhal. Flipkart has a delivery network of about 300 locations and is intending to expand its reach to even small towns.
In each of these areas, Flipkart is also looking at acquisitions.
When Flipkart appointed former Canaan Partners associate Nishant Verman as its M&A head earlier this year, its HR head Mekin Maheshwari said inorganic growth is a strong component of the vision to make Flipkart a $100-billion company. Snapdeal and Amazon have also made their intentions clear to acquire companies in areas ranging from mobile technology to payments.
"The over-arching theme will be acquisitions as they try to bridge existing gaps and scale up faster," said Alvarez and Marsal's Saigal.

Xiaomi set to raise $1.5 billion in latest funding boost: ReportApple

BEIJING: Xioami, currently the world's third-largest smartphone maker, is now planning to raise about $1.5 billion in its fifth round of financing, media reports said.
The company which has dominated China's smartphone market is talking to investors and banks to roughly raise about $1.5 billion, which would be the largest investment (excluding IPO) raised by any Chinese company backed by venture capital , financial news website Jiemian of the Shanghai United Media Group reported.
"Xiaomi shipped 18 million smartphones in the third quarter, an increase of 18 percent from the previous quarter. For the first nine months, Xiaomi, whose name means "millet" in Chinese, shipped a total of 44 million units, Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun said.
Xiaomi, currently the world's third-largest smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple , will use $1 billion to expand its own TV content for which they have hired Chen Tong , former editor-in-chief of popular news portal Sina.com , to revamp its Internet video business, Xinhua news agency reported.
One of the investors is said to be DST Global, a London-based investment firm that focuses on Internet companies, Jiemian reported.
"Xiaomi, one of the large Chinese technology companies, valued at $50 billion would tap the IPO market next year," Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
The company is seen by investors as the most likely candidate to become the next "Chinese IT legend" after Alibaba, which completed a $25 billion IPO in the United States in September.
According to International Data Corporation , Xiaomi's global market share stood at 5.3 per cent, following Samsung's 23.8 per cent and Apple's 12 per cent in the third quarter of this year, bringing it on number 3 position onto the list of top 5 manufacturers for the first time.
Xiaomi was founded in April 2010 by Lei and his friends in Zhongguancun, Beijing's technology hub, which has been called China's Silicon Valley , their first smartphone debuted on August 16, 2011.

Indian-origin teenager gets Intel funding for Braille printer
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 02.07AM IST
(Shubham Banerjee had…)
HOUSTON: A 13-year-old Indian-origin boy has received a huge investment from Intel for developing a low-cost printer for the blind, making him the youngest tech entrepreneur funded by a venture capital firm.
Shubham Banerjee, CEO of the Braille printer maker Braigo Labs, had closed an early round funding with Intel Capital, the company's venture capital arm, last month to develop a prototype of low-cost Braille printer.
Till last year, California-based Shubham had no idea what Braille was and it was only when he came across a fundraising flyer for the visually impaired that he started to wonder how blind people read.
So, like any other 7th grader would do, he asked his parents. His father's response: "Go Google it".
While googling, Shubham discovered the high cost of Braille printers, which usually cost more than USD 2,000.
"When I found out the cost of a Braille printer, I was shocked," Shubham said in a recent media report. "I just wanted to help the visually impaired. I had a Lego Robotics kit, so I asked, 'Why not just try that?'"
Built out of Lego's Mindstorms EV3blocks and little pieces from Home Depot Braigo Lab's printer turned out to function quite well. It earned Shubham a lot of recognition too, including 'The Tech Awards' 2014 and an invitation to the White House Maker Faire, an event that awards student entrepreneurs and innovators.
Shubham believes it could solve a decades-long problem that's been holding back so many visually impaired people around the world -- the high cost of Braille printers.
Shubham says his printer could significantly cut down the price of Braille printers to less than USD 500. According to his website, there are 285 million visually impaired people worldwide, and 90 per cent of them live in developing countries.
It's not easy to drop a couple grand on a printer, even by a developed country's standards.
Impressed by his product and vision, Intel came calling last September and told him it would invest in his company.
And last week, the investment was made official at the Intel Capital Global Summit, when Braigo Labs was mentioned as one of the 16 tech startups Intel's investing in this year.
The exact amount of the investment was not disclosed, it's reported to be a few hundred thousand dollars, making Shubham the youngest tech entrepreneur ever funded by a venture capital firm.
With Intel's funding, Braigo Labs plans to build a new prototype that more resembles a regular printer, and bring it to market by next year.
Shubham says he has no plans to expand into other product categories at this point, but Braille printers seem to be just a part of a bigger dream he has in mind.
"I want to do engineering in the medical area when I grow up," he says. "And I want to finish college."

Retire rich: Supplement your PF with profitable optionsAllianz
(To ensure a comfortable…)
If you dream about a comfortable retirement but are planning to depend solely on your Provident Fund (PF) to meet your needs, be ready for a shock. The PF can be an important pillar in a retirement plan, but the corpus of the average subscriber is likely to fall woefully short of his requirement. One needs to make additional investments to build a corpus big enough to sustain one's expenses for 20-odd years after retiring.
To be fair, the Provident Fund's design makes it the most effective way to save for retirement. You start contributing from the very month you start earning, and since it is a compulsory saving, you can't avoid it. Besides, your contribution is linked to your income and rises with every increment in your salary. If a person takes up a job at the age of 25, even a modest contribution of Rs 5,000 a month and a matching contribution by his employer can build up a massive corpus of Rs 6.89 crore over 35 years. This calculation assumes that his income (and, therefore, the contribution) will rise by 8% every year and the PF will give 8.5% returns.
While the figure of Rs 6.89 crore may appear huge, it may not be enough. If you need Rs 50,000 a month for living expenses today, a 7% inflation would push up the requirement to roughly Rs 5.34 lakh a month in 35 years. When you are 60, you would need a corpus of Rs 10.52 crore to sustain inflation-adjusted withdrawals for the next 20 years (see table). Assuming a post-tax return of 8.5% and 7% inflation, the Rs 6.89 crore from the PF would be completely wiped out in a little over 12 years. This could mean having no money in your retirement account at the age of 72.
  There's another problem. To make your PF work for you, you must remain invested for the long term. However, a lot of people withdraw their PF when they change jobs, thus losing out on the power of compounding. "In India, the PF is often used for other purposes, particularly when people change jobs. They end up withdrawing this accumulated corpus to buy expensive gadgets or go on a holiday, forgetting that the purpose was retirement planning," says Arvind Usretay, India Retirement Business Leader, Mercer. A recent global survey by Mercer has ranked India's retirement system the lowest among the 25 countries surveyed. "What continues to hold India back is the lack of retirement coverage for the informal sector and less than adequate retirement income expected to be generated from contributions made to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and gratuity benefits," notes the Mercer study.
Another global study by Towers Watson points out that a significant majority of employees sees their employer retirement plans as the most important source of income in retirement. "Employers must educate their employees on the need for retirement planning and provide them the tools to help them save adequately," says Anuradha Sriram, director, benefits, Towers Watson, India.
To ensure a comfortable life in retirement, one needs to make additional investments to build a corpus big enough to sustain one's expenses for nearly 20 years in retirement. Here are a few options you can consider.
Mutual funds
Mutual funds are, perhaps, the best way to supplement your retirement savings. Among these, equity mutual funds have the potential to give very high returns, but also carry high risk. They are best suited to younger investors who can withstand short-term volatility to earn long-term gains. "Equity funds should be the instrument of choice for young investors who have 25-30 years to build a retirement kitty," says Suresh Sadagopan, founder of Ladder7 Financial Advisories. An additional advantage of investing in equity funds is that the gains are tax-free.
If you are averse to taking risks, consider a balanced fund, where the equity exposure is lower. Ultra cautious investors can go for MIPs of mutual funds that invest only 15-20% of their corpus in stocks and put the rest in bonds. However, the returns of MIPs will not be able to match those of equity and balanced funds.
Ulips
Ulips have earned a bad name because of the rampant misselling in the past. However, this much reviled product can be a good option for retirement planning. In recent months, insurance companies have come out with online plans that levy very low charges. The Click2Protect plan from HDFC Life charges an annual fund management fee of 1.35%, which is less than the direct mutual fund charges. The Bajaj Allianz Future Gain plan does not levy premium allocation charges if the annual investment is Rs 2 lakh and above. The Edelweiss Tokio Wealth Accumulation Plan doesn't have policy administration charges. Some Ulips, such as Aviva i-Growth and ICICI Prudential Elite Life II, don't have lower charges but compensate long-term investors with 'loyalty additions'. The best part in a Ulip is that one can shift money from debt to equity, and vice versa, without incurring any tax liability. The corpus is also taxfree on maturity.

Do mutual fund colour codes depict your risk profileDo mutual fund colour codes depict your risk profile?

("Colour coding is a step…)
In the past five years, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has made a host of regulatory changes keeping in mind the investors' benefit as well as the growth of the mutual funds industry. One such initiative has been the introduction of a colour coding mechanism to help identify the risk levels of mutual fund schemes.
However, since its much-hyped launch on 1 July 2013, the mechanism has not yielded the desired results, say industry experts. "Colour coding is a step in the right direction, but we need more standardisation," says Gaurav Mashruwala, a Mumbai-based financial planner. Sebi had allotted three colours—blue, indicating low risk, yellow for medium risk, and brown identifying schemes with high risk. The demand for a more comprehensive colour coding system has now prompted Sebi to revisit the product labelling initiative. What must the stock market regulator do? What must the stock market regulator do? The challenge is to create a system that will not only have an impact on investor behaviour, but also make it more relevant for them when it comes to investment decisions. Says Jaya K Nagarmat, managing director, Investor Shoppe: "Most people still relate to mutual funds as equity. They don't know that these schemes also invest in other asset classes, including debt and gold."
Though the fund houses were quick to display the colour coding prominently on their application forms and scheme pamphlets according to the mandatory guidelines by Sebi, few investors were aware of what it represented. So, apart from revamping the mechanism, the regulator must also ensure that mutual fund investors are privy to the system.
Second, three colours are not enough to capture the entire mutual fund universe. It is all right to paint liquid funds, fixed maturity plans (FMPs), arbitrage funds, short-term debt funds and floating rate funds with blue because the risk to the principal amount for all these schemes is low. However, long-term gilt funds should not fall in this category because they take significant amount of interest rate risk and, therefore, the principal can erode with a jump in interest rates. Similarly, long-term debt funds cannot be classified as a low-risk investment because in addition to the interest rate risk, they also have a default risk.
The same holds true for all equity schemes, index funds, large-cap funds, mid-cap funds and sectoral funds, that were colour coded brown. In this high-risk category, sectoral funds have the highest risk, while index funds are the least risky, and should not be clubbed under the same category. Even balanced funds, which can invest only up to 75 per cent in equity, have been marked brown.
The other challenge and, perhaps, the most defining reason for the initiative's failure is the lack of a standardised approach to colour coding of schemes. In the past year, fund houses have used their own method to arrive at risk levels for their schemes. For example, while most gilt funds were labelled blue, L&T Gilt Fund used a yellow marking, and while arbitrage funds were categorised blue, exceptions like ICICI Pru Equity Arbitrage Fund and ICICI Blended Plan A were marked in yellow. Similarly, most equity-oriented balanced funds were labelled brown, but a few schemes, such as Principal Balanced Fund, JM Balanced Fund, LIC Nomura Balanced Fund, were labelled yellow. The industry division is almost vertical when it comes to capital protectionoriented funds. While 50per cent of the schemes have a yellow rating, others are rated blue.
 
Sebi not only needs to set up a clear structure to segregate schemes into specified colour codes, but may have to introduce a system that will help represent different risk levels of equity funds. "Adding too many colours may not be the best option because it will confuse the investors more," says Nagarmat.
Some experts are of the opinion that the introduction of a few more colours would help. For example, liquid funds and ultra short-term debt funds, which are almost a risk-free product, could be marked green, while long-term debt funds having medium risk could stick with the blue band. Similarly, equity-oriented balanced funds and index funds, which are high-risk products, can be assigned the brown label, while mid-cap equity funds or sectoral funds in the very high-risk category can be colour coded red. Finally, these colour codes should represent all schemes of a certain category irrespective of the fund house.
Moreover, investors should understand that the colour coding mechanism is just a starting point and not the ultimate risk assessment tool. Says Mashruwala: "The problem arises because we expect too much from colour coding." Experts say colour coding of mutual fund schemes should have a broadbased approach, much like the ones used for food products, say, to segregate vegetarian from non-vegetarian. To know more about the product, one goes through the list of ingredients. Similarly, investors should use colour coding only as a first step and should read the offer documents to understand the products better.

(Parents typically delay…)
Parents typically delay fostering good financial habits in kids. As a result, the child grows up with poor money personality and is prone to taking wrong saving and investing decisions. Take this quiz to identify your kid's financial leanings and how you can nudge him in the right direction, says Riju Dave.
What is your child's monetary status at the end of the month?
a) He may ask for help, but returns the money the next month.
b) He never needs to be bailed out.
c) He almost always needs money.
d) Sometimes he hasn't spent anything and sometimes he isn't left with any money.
The moment your child is given money, what does she do with it?
a) Keeps it in a safe place and later decides what to do with it.
b) Puts it in the piggy bank and doesn't take it out again.
c) Spends it at once.
d) Keeps it anywhere and forgets.
Has your child ever lost money?
a) Never.
Does your child set goals and save pocket money to buy valuable items?
a) Very often.
When you go to a child store, how does she behave?
a) Wants you to buy something for her only if she needs it.
b) Doesn't bother you much.
c) Throws a tantrum and insists you buy something for her.
d) Is indifferent

b) Money.
 
Mostly 'A's: Balanced
What he may grow up to be: You are lucky to have a kid who is not swayed by emotion. He values money and knows how to use it optimally. As an adult, he is likely to save money without being frugal, invest it properly to generate enough income and achieve his goals.
How to guide him
Encourage his saving habit and invest the money in growth instruments.
Make him aware of all the investment avenues, listing out the pros and cons of each.
Help him set medium- and long-term goals. Let him make his own spending decisions so that he learns early from his mistakes.
Mostly 'B's: Saver
What he may grow up to be: Your child loves money and wants to preserve it, but lacks financial perspective and may fail to make his money work or meet his goals. This is because if the money lies idle and is not invested well, it will not grow or beat inflation.
How to guide him
Help the kid invest money where he can see it grow, say, a bank account to start with.
Show your child the benefit of consistent saving, instead of mindless hoarding, say, in a recurring deposit or mutual fund SIPs.
Help him spend, pointing out that balanced spending need not affect fulfilment of goals.
Mostly 'C's: Spender
What he may grow up to be: Your child doesn't understand the value of money or the importance of saving it. Since he is impulsive, he may never be able to save for goals or have money when he needs it. He is also likely to fall in a debt trap if he spends more than he earns.
How to guide him
If you give pocket money, make it mandatory for him to save a part of it.
Delay gratification when it comes to purchases. If he wants a toy/gadget, don't buy it instantly, or make him buy with his own pocket money.
Pay him for errands that require physical or mental labour so he learns the value of money.
Mostly 'D's: Slacker
What he may grow up to be: Since your child is indifferent to money, he doesn't value it. So, while he may handle it well, he could also live from crisis to crisis or be constantly in debt. As he spends impulsively and is not interested in knowing what becomes of the money, he is unlikely to meet his goals comfortably.
How to guide him
Inculcate financial discipline by developing patterns and habits. Have a fixed place to put his money and make it compulsory to save a part of it. Punish loss by cutting out his favourite activity.
Make him earn money and buy with his own pocket money the toys/gadgets that he likes.

Ten steps for young couples to help them lead a financially stable life
ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 08.00AM IST

Asset allocation
(Medical insurance is a must.…)
With high disposable incomes, fewer liabilities and time on their side, young working couples have a great opportunity to build wealth. Here are a few tips for young couples to help them make wise choices:
Discuss finances jointly
It's important for both partners to be on the same page when it comes to money matters. One needs to keep the other informed about insurance policies, mutual funds and other investments. Ensure you assign your spouse as nominee in all investments.
Avoid splurging
With two incomes and enough disposable money, one might be tempted to buy the latest gadget or upgrade to a bigger car, but do not be impulsive. Buy only what you actually need and can afford. Buy a car that fits your budget. Your car loan EMI should not exceed 10% of your monthly net takehome pay. Ensure that you have made your savings before you spend your salary
Don't ignore retirement
It's easy to lose track of retirement planning when you are young. Put away at least 10% of your income for retirement savings. Go for equity funds because you have time on your side. The ultra cautious can go for the PPF, though the returns will not be spectacular
Set up an emergency fund
Always be financially prepared for emergencies. Have at least 3-6 months' expenses kept aside as an emergency fund. This should include your living expenses, lifestyle expenses and EMIs. It's a good idea to open a joint account, so that both can have access to the funds in case of an emergency
Buy sufficient life cover
Buy a life insurance cover big enough to replace your income as well as repay outstanding loans. The cover should be at least 8-10 times your annual income plus debt obligations. A term insurance policy is the best form of life cover. Buy online to save on costs.
Get the right health plan
Medical insurance is a must. Get a family floater cover of at least Rs 5 lakh for medical needs over and above the medical insurance provided by your employer. Buy a top-up plan to save on costs.
Get your investment mix right
Choose a good mix of debt and equity products. If you are too risk-averse when you are young, you might miss the opportunity to create wealth. Invest in equity funds because you are young. Age-based asset allocation is a good strategy. To arrive at the equity exposure in your portfolio, subtract your age from 100.
Don't take debt
One of the biggest temptations for young couples is to buy things on credit. Do not take a loan to spend recklessly on exotic vacations, expensive health clubs and latest gizmos. If you use a credit card, ensure you don't roll over the credit or pay only the minimum amount due. In no time, the debt may become too big to handle.
Buy a house if emi below 40% of income
Don't rush into buying. Choose the property after due diligence and if it's within your budget. If your home loan EMI is more than 40% of your net take home pay it is beyond your budget. Buy the home jointly so that both partners can avail of the tax benefits on the home loan.
Start saving for child
Ideally, you should start planning your finances for your little bundle of joy a year or two in advance. Most employers offer maternity benefits as part of their group insurance policy. But, it's good to build a small corpus over a period of one or two years especially for post-delivery expenses

How young working couples can build wealth without compromising on lifestyles

( If your investment horizon…)
By Bindisha Sarang
Life can be carefree for young working couples. They have more money and not too many financial responsibilities. But they also have more ways to spend the money. Meet Visakhapatnam-based architect Ananth Domatoti, 31, and his wife Anita Patnaik, 30. They have a combined annual income of almost Rs 22 lakh, but are not able to save even 5% of that. "I struggle to keep my expenses under control," admits Ananth.
In Mumbai, Vishal Nalawade, 30, and his wife Shraddha, 29, are facing a different problem. They have good jobs, spend carefully and save 60% of their net income every month. Yet, their finances are not really going places. In fact, their entire savings of Rs 5 lakh is idling in a bank account, earning a piffling 4% even as inflation eats into its purchasing power. Financial planners would baulk at this. "It's not very smart to keep so much money in a savings bank account. A balance of Rs 1 lakh for emergencies is more than enough," says Mumbai-based financial planner Suresh Sadagopan.
Young working couples such as the Domatotis and the Nalawades are frittering away a terrific opportunity. If they are careful in the way they save, invest and spend their money, they can transform their financial future. Apart from high incomes and few financial responsibilities, these double-income couples have time on their side. With almost 25-30 years of working life ahead of them, they can amass a huge amount using the power of compounding.
This week's cover story looks at how young couples can capitalise on the advantages to build substantial wealth without compromising too much on their lifestyles. We look at the most common mistakes that young couples are likely to make and also list out the essential steps they must take in these formative years.
When you are young and earning well, savings and investing often take a back seat. The double-income comfort tricks many couples into thinking that their saving plans can be postponed by a few years. delaying investments can be a costly mistake because the investor loses out on the power of compounding. We all know that compounding can work wonders but here's an eye opener: If one starts saving Rs 5,000 a month at the age of 30 and earns 10% compounded returns, he would have Rs 1.13 crore at the age of 60. If he delays the investment by 10 years and starts at 40, he will manage to save only Rs 38 lakh. "The sooner you begin, the bigger is the corpus. Young couples should start putting away in the initial years itself," advises Pankaj Mathpal, a Mumbai-based financial planner.
Don't save, invest
Saving alone is not enough. The Nalawades have been saving for more than one year, but instead of growing, their money has shrunk in value in real terms. Wholesale inflation may be down but consumer inflation is still raging at around 7%. If you assume an inflation rate of 7%, the 4% return on their savings idling in the bank account actually means a loss of 3%.
"I am not very clued in to financial matters so could not decide where to invest," explains Vishal, almost embarrassed about the loss in purchasing power. For young investors like him, equity mutual funds should be the instrument of choice. Identifying a good fund is not rocket science. The couple should start investing a small amount in any five-star diversified equity fund.
If the Nalawades have not deployed their money because they lack knowledge, Bengaluru-based IT professionals Aditya Vajha and his wife Sonia Kakodkar have stayed away from equities because of their past experience with the asset class. They are not even 30 but have the risk profile that even a retiree would find too conservative.
  Understanding your risk profile is very important. Young people often make the mistake of taking too little risk even though they can withstand some volatility. If your investment horizon is more than 5-6 years, there is no reason why you should be investing in debt instruments that offer very low yields. The Domatotis are putting away their entire investible surplus in recurring deposits. They should consider equity funds which can give them better returns. Of course, they should do this in a graded manner.
This approach will especially be suitable for Vajha and Kakodkar, who have vowed to stay away from equities due to past losses. Instead of investing and saving for their other goals, they are aggressively paying down their home loan. Apart from the EMI of Rs 37,000, they put their entire monthly surplus of Rs 50,000 in a home saver account to prepay the home loan. "It's good to be debt free but in their bid to prepay their home loan they may be compromising their future," says Parag Paranjpe, a financial planner. At least Rs 10,000 should be diverted to an SIP in a good diversified equity fund. If they are still fearful, they could consider a balanced fund.
Separate wants from needs

Stock advice: Shares that can gain from a fall in yen and euroeuro
(The huge stimulus from the…)
The recent unwinding of the US quantitative easing programme, a long-time liquidity boosting measure by the US central bank, was expected to leave the other markets gasping. Instead, the withdrawal of the prolonged stimulus has been cast aside in a perfunctory manner. The reason is the simultaneous rollout of a massive stimulus by the central banks of Europe and Japan. A couple of weeks ago, the Bank of Japan sprung a surprise on global markets by ramping up its stimulus programme. It announced its intention to accelerate its buying of government bonds, while tripling its purchases of exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts. Meanwhile, in Europe, the European Central Bank has been stepping up its own stimulus measures to revive the stuttering euro-area economy. It has already outlined its intention to spend 1 trillion as part of its asset purchase programme. This is likely to ensure that global markets remain flush with liquidity. These actions are likely to boost FII interest in Indian equities as a whole, and could benefit certain companies in particular.
Currency play
Whenever there is an oversupply of money in any economy, the local currency loses some of its value. This is playing out in both Europe and Japan at the moment. The unexpected push by the Japanese central bank has led the yen to slump to a nearly sevenyear low against the dollar. Similarly, the euro recently slipped to a two-year low against the dollar. With both the economies likely to keep pumping money for some time, the respective currencies are also expected to exhibit continued weakness. Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP, institutional equities, Bonanza Portfolio, says, "The unprecedented stimulus by Japan has caught everyone by surprise. We expect the yen to depreciate further amid high volatility. Meanwhile, Europe has no other option but to continue the stimulus measures to prop up the ailing region. So, the euro will also continue to slide." This has a direct impact on some stocks that are linked to these currencies and has already sparked off a rally in these stocks.
There are several India-based subsidiaries of Japanese companies which could enjoy some spillover effects. These companies are expected to benefit from lower cost of raw material imports from the country as well as a lower royalty outgo in some cases. India's premier auto-maker, Maruti Suzuki, is the best example. With a yen exposure of nearly 20% of its revenues, any movement in the Japanese currency influences its earnings. Even a 1% weakness in the yen against the dollar helps boost Maruti Suzuki's earnings by around 4%. In India, the rupee has gained nearly 8% against the yen in the past fortnight.
Not surprisingly, analysts say, a weak yen outlook augurs well for Maruti's profitability. "The EBITDA margin should expand in the second half on lagged currency gains," says Morgan Stanley. Maruti Suzuki's stock has already jumped 12% over the past month. However, the yen weakness will not soften Maruti's massive royalty outgo towards its parent Suzuki for long. This is because Maruti has decided that to limit risks from foreign exchange fluctuations for all future models, it will make royalty payments to its parent, Suzuki Motor Corp, in rupee instead of yen. The company paid Rs 2,486 crore, or nearly 6% of its net sales, as royalty to Suzuki for the last financial year.
  Besides Maruti, Ricoh India, Honda Siel Power, Lumax Industries, Hitachi Home Appliances and Sharp India, among others, stand to gain from a weakened yen. The currency depreciation means that these companies will have to shell out lower in rupee terms for their raw material purchases and also towards royalty payments to their Japanese parent. Analysts say the positive effect of currency depreciation is likely to start reflecting in the next quarter financials. Vikas Gupta, executive vice-president, Arthveda Fund Management, says, "The yen weakness does throw up opportunities for some of the Japanese companies in the near term." There are also companies with no linkage to Japanese firms that stand to gain from a weaker yen. These are the ones that have borrowings in yen. These include Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Power Finance Corporation and NHPC, among others.
As the yen weakens, the borrowing company has to pay back fewer rupees for every borrowed yen. This will improve the profitability of these companies as the interest outgo will come down. Nagaonkar points out, "The actual benefit to these companies will depend on how much of their borrowings have been hedged. If a major chunk is left unhedged, it will surely boost profitability in the near term."

Airlines stocks rise on new draft civil aviation policyAirlines stocks rise on new draft civil aviation policy
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:15 IST
Stocks of Jet Airways and SpiceJet surged up to 7 per cent on Monday after the government unveiled draft civil aviation policy which proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, rationalise jet fuel cost, among others.
Shares of Jet Airways advanced by 6.82 per cent to settle at Rs 268.60, while SpiceJet surged 5.02 per cent to end at Rs 15.68 on the BSE.
Terming UPA's aviation policy as "opaque", the government on Monday brought in a fresh draft recommending listing of state-run Airports Authority of India and chopper firm Pawan Hans on stock exchanges and steps to beef up Air India operations, hinting at its stake sale too.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju unveiled the draft civil aviation policy which also proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, MRO and helicopter operations and improve passenger facilitation.
The draft would now be open for wider consultation with all stakeholders, with the Minister saying he hoped to finalise and implement it by January next year.
On high taxes on jet fuel, Raju said the Centre has been requesting states to lower the taxes as fuel costs are close to 40-45 per cent of an airline's total operational cost.

With 63 members in the Maharashtra Assembly, the Sena had declared that it would prefer to sit in the Opposition if the BJP `seeks’ NCP's support.
Hours before the commencement of the first session of the newly-constituted Maharashtra Assembly, the Shiv Sena, which was downcast on Sunday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to make its nominee, Anil Desai, a Cabinet Minister, pretended as if it never had any issue with the BJP.
The three-day assembly session is crucial to the BJP-led minority Government in the State as Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has to pass the floor test by ensuring that his trust vote motion is carried by the House.
The BJP needs at least 23 MLAs more to reach the magic number of 145 in the event of a trust vote. Sena which has 63 members on Sunday had declared that it would prefer to sit in the opposition if the BJP `seeks’ support of Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which has 41 members.
The NCP has already given its unconditional support to the government and further said that it would vote in support of the trust motion in the interest of `political stability’ in the State. The BJP has neither welcomed nor opposed the NCP support. In other words it need not explicitly reach out to Pawar’s party to make up for its number deficit in the house.
The blow hot and cold approach of the Sena towards the BJP boils down to its role in the Narendra Modi government at the centre and the Fadvanis government in the state. The Sena wants to be recognised as an influential partner in the NDA with more and heavy weight portfolios in the governments.
Ties between the Sena and the BJP came under strain in the last week of September after their failure to arrive at seat-sharing arrangement in the recently held state assembly elections. Due to the disagreement they fought the assembly poll on their own. The BJP emerged as the single largest party though short of numbers leaving the Sena a distinct second.
Despite the strained relations, neither of the two had called it quits. The Sena representative Anant Geete continues to be a cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi government. The Sena and the BJP combine rule the cash rich Mumbai Municipal Corporation along with several other municipalities in the state.
Last week the NCP chief Sharad Pawar declared that his party if necessary would vote in favour of the trust motion to be moved by the newly elected first ever BJP Chief Minister in the state Devendra Fadnavis. The announcement by Mr. Pawar, whose party has 41 members in the new assembly, has weakened the bargaining power of the Sena which has 63 members in the house.
Developments on Sunday added to the woes of the Sena. Its nominee Anil Desai was denied a cabinet berth but instead offered status of minister of state. Another provocation came when its no longer prominent face in the party Suresh Prabhu was formally admitted into the BJP and made a cabinet minister by the Prime Minister.
Ducking questions on the possible future course of his party Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday had said if the BJP seeks support of an anti-Hindus party like NCP support, his party leader Eknath Shinde will be Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly.
He declined to answer a question on whether the Sena would pull out Anant Geete out of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. "I will decide at the right time," was all he would say.

Assad says ready to study UN plan to  freeze  Aleppo fightingBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 10, 2014 7:31 pm
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said today he was ready to study a UN plan to “freeze” fighting in the northern city of Aleppo, a statement from his office said.
“President Assad has been informed by (UN envoy Staffan) de Mistura of the main points of his initiative,” said the statement issued after the two men held talks in Damascus.
“(Assad) said it was worthy of study and that work on it is needed… in order to re-establish security in Aleppo,” it added.
It is De Mistura’s second visit to Syria since he was appointed peace envoy in July.
On October 30, De Mistura put forward an “action plan” for Syria that proposed to “freeze” fighting in local areas to allow for aid deliveries and to lay the groundwork for peace talks.
According to the Syrian presidency Facebook page, Assad emphasised “the importance of Aleppo”, which rebels and the army have been fighting over since July 2012.
State news agency SANA, meanwhile, quoted De Mistura as saying he was determined to ensure that his mission succeeds.
De Mistura had previously said Aleppo would be a “good candidate” to become a “freeze” zone.
The city has been split into rebel- and army-held areas since a major insurgent offensive began there.
Since December 2013, regime warplanes have carried out near daily air raids targeting rebel-held districts of what was once Syria’s economic capital, reportedly killing mostly civilians, defying a UN Security Council ban on such strikes.

Parrikar, who met with Defence Secretary RK Mathur and all the three Services Chiefs soon after he took charge here on Monday, echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ slogan and said the country should manufacture “as much as possible” domestically. Replying to a question from media persons on the delay in Defence acquisitions and deals getting mired in corruption, Parrikar said, “It’s very unfortunate.”

Singles Day shoppers spend $6 billion on Alibaba

Alibaba
(The ecommerce giant said…)
HANGZHOU: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said more than $6 billion of goods have been sold so far during its annual Singles' Day online shopping frenzy, as customers jumped on heavily discounted goods to send sales surging past 2013's record high.
More than 39 billion yuan ($6.4 billion) worth of goods was sold on the e-commerce giant's websites 15 hours into the event on Tuesday, with another nine to go.
Less than eight weeks after its public share listing in New York , which set its own $25 billion record, expectations for this year are high.
Alibaba did 35 billion yuan in business during last year's festival, and Tech research firm IDC predicts this year's total gross merchandise volume (GMV) will reach $8.62 billion.
Less than 18 minutes into this year's "11.11 Shopping Festival", GMV had already hit $1 billion, the company said.
The numbers are boosted by Alibaba's "pre-sales initiative". Merchants advertised Singles' Day prices as early as Oct. 15, taking deposits for the items but only processing full payments and shipping the goods on Singles' Day itself.
Though the 27,000 vendors that take part can boost their sales and gain customers by being featured on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping sites, some have also complained the sharp discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits.
Chinese e-commerce rival JD.com Inc said on its official Twitter account that orders in the first 10 hours of Singles' Day had more than doubled compared with last year, up 140 percent.
China's Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd, the world's third-largest smartphone maker, which also uses the Singles' Day festival to boost turnover, said on its official Weibo account its sales had so far surpassed 1.2 billion yuan, selling more than 853,000 phones.
The "11.11 Shopping Festival", which Alibaba says is the world's biggest 24-hour online sale, began in 2009 when just 27 merchants on the company's Tmall.com site offered deep discounts to boost sales during an otherwise slack period.
This year's festival is global, reaching shoppers in more than 200 countries, the company said.

Govt on misson impossible  set to ban porn s...Government asks internet service companies to block pornography sites, upgrade systems

(Prasad said porn is legal…)
BENGALURU | DELHI: Blocking Internet porn may be next to impossible. But the Indian government is going to try anyhow.
The plan is to begin by creating a list of pornography sites, especially those hosting child porn, and provide that to Internet service providers (ISPs) to block. And then, to ensure that largescale blocking does not slow Internet access, service providers will be asked to upgrade their infrastructure. The Internet and Mobile Association of India has been asked to curate the list.
At a meeting chaired by Telecom & IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and attended by top government officials in September, the "problem of porn" was discussed and the minister directed the departments of IT and telecom to work together to improve "blocking infrastructure" at the ISP level.
Prasad said although porn is legal in other countries, it needs to be viewed in the "context of Indian culture and moral obligation towards society".
The meeting of the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee was triggered by a recent directive from the Supreme Court , which asked the government to place the issue before the committee. The committee has convened just five times since it was formed in 2000. The apex court is hearing a petition filed by lawyer Kamlesh Vasvani , seeking to ban porn as it leads to "activities like rape, harassment, molestations of women". At the last hearing, held on August 29, the government said that filtering porn was not practical.
The department of telecom had said large-scale blocking of websites could slow the Internet down, unless services providers upgrade their infrastructure.
"The problem is that you are veering down a slippery ground if you try to do this, installing filters and all," said Prasanth Sugathan, counsel for the Software Freedom Law Centre. Such blocks have been ineffective in countries such as the UK. However, in China, where the ban on online pornography is strictly enforced, it is another story, as that country has people dedicated to monitoring content, he said.
An extreme step would be to follow what countries such as North Korea do. Internet is regulated heavily and domestic Internet users are served by a sole provider with limited access to the global Internet. "But the question is, should we be moving towards that or we should be respecting Internet freedom," said Sugathan.
Blocking porn will not be an easy task by any means. According to one estimate by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, there are more than 40 million porn websites around the world and most of them operate outside India where porn is legal. Moreover, there are many ways including the use of proxies to get around to blocked websites.
For instance, in 2009, the Indian government banned a website which hosted porn-toon portraying the sexual adventures of a housewife. Content from the site is still widely accessible.
The use of the "https" protocol, which encrypts data transmission, makes it tough to block pornography. At the meeting in September, the IT department suggested the government start with a list of child pornography sites that can be obtained from other countries where it is blocked strictly.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also wants the government to take steps to block Internet pornography.
"A solution may need to be worked out to prevent availability of pornography on the Internet considering the cultural sensitivities of the country," Arvind Gupta, head of BJP's information technology cell, conveyed to the committee, according to the minutes of the meeting reviewed by ET.
Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg pointed out at the meeting that the latency of Internet access would go up if a large number of websites are blocked. India already has the lowest average Internet speed among most countries. Garg said the ISP infrastructure needs to be upgraded to deal with large-scale website blocking.
The committee comprises the minister for information technology and top officials from the ministries of legal affairs, commerce, home affairs, defence, the Central Bureau of Investigation as well as representatives from non-government bodies such as Nasscom , Confederation of Indian Industry and Federation of the Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry.
Legally, viewing pornography in private is allowed in India although hosting and transmitting porn is punishable. Further, according to the Information Technology Act, browsing, downloading, creation and publication of child porn is illegal.
"Child pornography and pornography cannot be said in the same breath. The government has very firm legislation against it," said Vidya Reddy, director of Tulir-Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse.
The government also suggested that NGOs will have to play a big role in creating awareness and sensitising the ill-effects of porn.

Obama wants more regulation of Internet prov...President Barack Obama wants more regulation of Internet providers

Barack Obama
(The president also suggested…)
WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama on Monday embraced a radical change in how the government treats Internet service, coming down on the side of consumer activists who fear slower download speeds and higher costs but angering US cable giants who say the plan would kill jobs.
Obama called on the Federal Communications Commission to more heavily regulate Internet providers and treat broadband much as it would any other public utility. He said the FCC should explicitly prohibit Internet providers like Verizon and AT&T from charging data hogs like Netflix extra to move their content more quickly. The announcement sent cable stocks tumbling.
The FCC, an independent regulatory body led by political appointees, is nearing a decision on whether broadband providers should be allowed to cut deals with the content providers but is stumbling over the legal complexities.
"We are stunned the president would abandon the longstanding, bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the Internet and calling for extreme" regulation, said Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the primary lobbying arm of the cable industry, which supplies much of the nation's Internet access.
This "tectonic shift in national policy, should it be adopted, would create devastating results," added Powell, who chaired the FCC during the Bush administration until 2005.
Netflix swung behind Obama, posting to its Facebook page that "consumers should pick winners and losers on the Internet, not broadband gatekeepers."
"Net neutrality" is the idea that Internet service providers shouldn't block, slow or manipulate data moving across its networks. As long as content isn't against the law, such as child pornography or pirated music, a file or video posted on one site will load generally at the same speed as a similarly sized file or video on another site.
In 2010, the FCC embraced the concept in a rule. But last January, a federal appeals court struck down the regulation because the court said the FCC didn't technically have the legal authority to tell broadband providers how to manage their networks.
Obama said the FCC should explicitly ban any "paid prioritization" on the Internet. The president also suggested that the FCC reclassify consumer broadband as a public utility under the 1934 Communications Act. That would mean the Internet would be regulated more heavily in the way phone service is.
This approach is exactly what industry lobbyists have spent months fighting against. While Internet providers say they support the concept of an open Internet they want flexibility to think up new ways to package and sell Internet services. And, given the billions of dollars spent to improve network infrastructure, some officials say it's only fair to make data hogs like Netflix bear some of the costs of handling heavy traffic.
  AT&T on Monday threatened legal action if the FCC adopted Obama's plan, while Comcast Corp. said reclassifying broadband regulation would be "a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation, as today's immediate stock market reaction demonstrates." Similar statements were released by Time Warner Cable Inc., Cox Communications and several industry groups including CTIA-The Wireless Association, USTelecom, the Telecommunications Industry Association and Broadband for America.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest, traveling with Obama in China, said the president "felt this was an appropriate time" to make his views known because of the FCC's regulatory timeline, and that the timing wasn't related to Obama's trip this week to Asia and Australia.
Asked whether Comcast had been consulted on the issue, Earnest said only that the White House had been in touch with the business community on a variety of issues.
"There are members of Congress on both sides of this," he added.
Many Republicans including House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell swung behind industry in denouncing the plan as government overreach.
The Internet Association, which represents many content providers like Netflix, Twitter, eBay and Google, applauded Obama's proposal.
On Monday, as the Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up slightly, stock prices fell for big cable companies, including Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Cablevision and Charter Communications.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a former industry lobbyist and venture capitalist, said he welcomed the president's comments, but suggested that his proposal was easier said than done.
"The more deeply we examined the issues around the various legal options, the more it has become plain that there is more work to do," Wheeler said.
The FCC isn't under a deadline to make a decision.

Dollar steadies from payrolls wobble  Aussie firmer on house data0
Short-term Treasury yields shot higher, widening the premium paid by U.S. two-year paper to 65 basis points over bunds and near the widest since early 2007.
As a result, the dollar soared against its peers to highs not seen since March 2009. The dollar index traded at 89.357, flirting with the 2009 peak of 89.624. A break above would take the index back near decade highs.
Against the yen, the greenback hovered just below Friday's seven-year peak of 121.69. The euro, on the other hand, languished near a two-year trough of $1.2270.
Not helping sentiment for the common currency, Standard & Poor's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above junk.
For some analysts, the upbeat U.S. jobs report added to the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. In stark contrast, the European Central Bank is under pressure to expand its asset-buying stimulus program.
While the ECB disappointed some by its inaction last week, President Mario Draghi gave his clearest signal yet that quantitative easing may be on the cards early in 2015.
Draghi received support from fellow policy maker Ewald Nowotny on Friday even as Germany firmly maintained its opposition to buying sovereign bonds.
"EUR/USD is on its way to below 1.20 for the first time in a decade," analysts at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients, adding the greenback "still has plenty of room to the upside, and will be supported in 2015 by a sharp divergence in monetary policy."
Indeed, investors bought the greenback against all of its peers in the wake of the payrolls report, driving it to multi-year highs versus the Canadian and Australian dollars and a 15-month high on sterling.
The Aussie dipped below 83 U.S. cents for the first time in over four years, reaching a low of $0.8288. It could face further pressure if trade data out of China, Australia's biggest export market, were to disappoint.

Many a times parents overlook other goals as they are too busy focusing on just one goal, that is on their child's education. They are too emotionally involved in achieving this particular goal that they forget planning for their retirement and saving for other emergencies.

Researchers: Apple iOS bug makes most devices vulnerable to attackFile photo of the presentation of an iPad at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California. - Reuters
Boston, Nov 11:  
Cybersecurity researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc's iOS operating system makes most iPhones and iPads vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access their devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, e-mails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple's App Store, including e-mail and banking programmes, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed ‘Masque Attack’.
These attacks can be used to steal banking and e-mail login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
"It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit," FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Officials with Apple could not be reached for comment.
Wei said that FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and that representatives with the company have said they were working to fix the bug.
News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on specialised Web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on Apple bugs, Wei said.
Wei said that FireEye decided to go public with its findings after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability, a new family of malicious software known as WireLurker that infects both Mac computers and iOS.
FireEye does not know of other attacks that exploit the bug, Wei said.
"Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see more," he said.
FireEye advises iOS users to refrain from installing apps from sources other than Apple's official App Store and to not click "instal" on a pop-up from a third-party web page.
The security firm said it verified this vulnerability on iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.1.1 beta, for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices.

Digvijay Singh  Nitin Gadkari face-off in court over Ajay Sancheti caseLetters to  the editor
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Digvijay Singh traded charges in a Delhi court which was hearing a defamation complaint filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader against the veteran Congressman who stood by his statement.
The proceedings began with Gadkari ruling out any possibility of reaching any compromise with Singh, saying he would not withdraw his complaint unless the Congress leader takes back his statement of 2012 on his alleged business links with the then MP Ajay Sancheti.
“I have nothing to do with Sancheti. If he (Singh) knows anything about it and gives any proof, I am ready to give all my shares to him. Otherwise he should take his statement back.
“My reputation is very high. Credibility is the biggest strength of a politician,” Gadkari told Metropolitan Magistrate Gomati Manocha on being asked if there was any possibility for compromise in the matter.
Sticking to his stand, Singh, who has been summoned as an accused in the case, said, “In my life I have never withdrawn my statement”.
The criminal defamation complaint was filed by Gadkari in 2012 against Singh, who had alleged that the former BJP chief had business links with the then MP Ajay Sancheti.
The magistrate had earlier issued bailable warrant against Singh for his failure to appear before it but later on cancelled it after he turned up and gave an undertaking to remain present in the court today.
It had also asked Gadkari to remain present in the court, saying otherwise it would dismiss his complaint.
Suggesting that the two politicians settle the matter, the magistrate said in public life one should rise above all this.
“You should rise above all this otherwise for how long will this go on,” the magistrate said, adding that if they do not want to compromise, the court will proceed with framing notice against the accused.
To this Singh said, the court can go ahead with its proceedings.
During the hearing, Gadkari claimed that not even a single kg of coal has been extracted from the mine so where is the point of earning any profit by Sancheti.
“He (Singh) is talking non-sense,” Gadkari said.
To this Singh asked, “Is (Gadkari) he defending Sancheti? I stand by my statement made earlier.”
The court fixed November 24 for hearing further arguments on the point of framing notice.
During the hearing, senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, who appeared for Singh, argued that no charge was made out against his client as Gadkari had not stated in his statement recorded earlier in the court that he was present in the press conference when such averment was made.
“Gadkari does not say that the statement was made in his presence. No witness and reporter was produced in the court to say that they had heard Singh making such statement or that they recorded it,” the counsel said, adding that the media reports were inadmissible.
Senior advocate Pinky Anand, who appeared for Gadkari, said if Singh says he has not made any statement against the BJP leader, the client would withdraw the complaint.
Singh was earlier granted bail in the case by the court which, after finding “prima facie” evidence against him, had directed him to appear before it as accused for the offence punishable under section 499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the IPC.
It was also alleged in the complaint that Singh had accused Gadkari of pocketing sum to the tune of Rs 490 crore in the coal block allocation to Sancheti.
Gadkari, in his statement recorded in the court, had denied having any business ties with Sancheti and had said that Singh levelled “totally false and defamatory” allegations against him to “give the impression that I have been responsible for allocation of the coal mines” to Sancheti.
The BJP leader, in his petition, had sought Singh’s prosecution under sections 499 and 500 of the IPC.
In his petition, Gadkari had alleged that Singh had levelled defamatory allegations against him to lower his dignity and to malign and tarnish his image.

Chidambaram attacked over 2G scam caseLetters to  the editor
Senior Congress leader H R Bharadwaj attacked former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for blaming ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the 2G spectrum issue and instead accused him of being “solely responsible”.
A former Union Minister and a Governor, he disputed Chidambaram’s contentions on the 2G issue and said that if he had defended the treasury well as Finance Minister, then this scam would not have happened.
“I don’t think what Chidambaram is saying is the correct thing. It’s absolutely to the contrary. The Prime Minister had indicated to all the ministers that the 2G matter should be dealt with transparency.
“He (Manmohan) has done meticulous service to the country. Chidambaram is no match for him. His honesty, integrity is internationally recognised,” Bharadwaj said.
Bharadwaj, who had been at one time a Union Minister along with Chidambaram, even claimed that the latter was never a Congress man.
“Tell me when was he (a Congressman)? He has always been changing parties. To make him the Finance Minister, every person used to bring him to the forefront,” he said.
“Chidambaram used to browbeat everyone on the basis of his language and education. I have seen his performance everywhere. In 2G, he is solely responsible,” he claimed.
Replying to a question whether Priyanka Gandhi should be brought forward to revive the party, he said “I request the Congress leadership to bring her forward immediately.”
Earlier, Chidambaram had said the UPA government could have handled the 2G spectrum allocation case better.
“The CAG report on 2G and other issues,” Chidambaram had said, “clearly …hurt the Congress party. I think 2G could have been handled differently in the sense that the Prime Minister could have put his foot down and said I am sorry, I will not let you go forward with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) route.
“Or after licences had been granted and issue was brought up, he could have said cancel licences without waiting for the judgement. It hurt us. My personal view was once this came out as a scandal of bandwidth allotment, the government should have cancelled all the licences without waiting for the Supreme Court (judgement),” Chidambaram had said.

NEW DELHI: AirAsia India today joined the domestic fare war launching a week-long sale offer for its entire network with one-way tickets with prices as low as Rs 699 including taxes.
The move came as part of its Malaysian parent company AirAsia presenting a 'Big Sale' with three million promotional seats on its network from Kuala Lumpur, with a starting fare of Rs 2,599 for international flights operated by AirAsia Berhad and Thai AirAsia , the airline said in a release.
The Indian carrier is offering "an all inclusive one way fare" starting from as low as Rs 699 for flights from Bengaluru to Chennai, Kochi , Goa, Jaipur and Chandigarh and vice versa.

Government to privatise Jaipur & Ahmedabad airports instead of six planned

Airports Authority of India
(Kolkata and Chennai airports…)
The government is going ahead with the privatisation of only two airports - Ahmedabad and Jaipur - instead of the six originally planned.
According to the civil aviation policy to be announced on Monday, the Kolkata and Chennai airports will be operated on management contracts awarded to private parties, while the privatisation of Guwahati and Lucknow airports has been put on hold. "In the policy, we are announcing our airport privatisation plans. Since the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has invested a lot of money in upgrading airports at Kolkata and Chennai they will be awarded on management contract," a civil aviation ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
The official said the policy would state that the airports in Jaipur and Ahmedabad will be awarded on public-private partnership. "The airports in Guwahati and Lucknow have been put off the list for the time being. We may decide to take it up at a later stage," the official said.
The process of privatising the six airports had been initiated by the previous United Progressive Alliance government and could not be completed before the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year.
Analysts say that prima facie, awarding large airports on a management contract may be politically correct but operationally sub-optimal.
"Private airport operators can bring in innovation, efficiency, customer focus and discipline only if they get complete control of an airport. Handling unionised AAI staff, interference from the government and lack of complete freedom on non-aero revenue may turn out to be a dampener," said Amber Dubey, partner and India head of aerospace and defence at global consultancy KPMG . "It may be better to hold back the privatisation of Chennai and Kolkata till full PPP is implemented at these airports."
A source in a private airport also echoed concerns over AAI staff. "While management contract is something that can be considered, managing AAI staff will be a difficult task. All these aspects need to be seen and a final decision can only be taken only after the policy is defined," he said.
The civil aviation policy proposed to give a push to air cargo operations in by creating enabling infrastructure. "The policy talks of having air freight stations to enable the movement of air cargo swiftly," said the official. He said the policy is also focused on improving regional connectivity by enabling small-aircraft operations in the country.

Arun Jaitley pledges  rational  tax policyArun Jaitley pledges ‘rational’ tax policy, changes in labour laws, fuel price deregulation and natural resources auctions

(“Aggressive reforms…)
NEW DELHI: India will pursue an aggressive reforms agenda over the next few months to help get the country back to a high-growth trajectory and on the radar of investors, finance minister Arun Jaitley said, promising a reasonable and rational tax policy that will not be "ultra-aggressive" to help further improve sentiment.
"Government has its plate full with respect to reforms for the next few months," Jaitley said in Delhi on Sunday. "Aggressive reforms will help India to grow faster... Hope India will get back on the investors' radar."
The government is looking to alter the land acquisition law as part of reform efforts and is in the last stages of discussions with states on changes to the constitutional amendment bill required for the long-awaited goods and services tax to become a reality.
The government has already embarked on changes in labour policy, fuel price deregulation and natural resources auctions among others.
Jaitley exuded optimism that the insurance bill, seeking to raise the foreign direct investment cap, will be passed in the upcoming session of Parliament.
Speaking at the India Global Forum organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the minister said the Indian economy faces challenges but expects growth to improve next year.
"Economy was and is in a challenging situation and one of the principal challenges before us is to restore the confidence in the Indian economy, to expand economic activity and move towards increasing the growth rate," he said, adding that growth next year will be a "little better". If the trend continues, India could well be restored to a high-growth path.
Streamlining the tax regime and ending uncertainty is a critical part of making India more attractive to investors."We have seen the challenges before the economy. A reasonable and rational tax policy (is needed), it can't be ultra aggressive with tax payers," the minister said. The tax department now follows the principle that those who have to pay tax should do so and those who don't have to should not be harassed for non-payment, he said. He also spoke of the rationale behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make In India manufacturing initiative.
"We have realised that one of the greatest challenges we have is the manufacturing sector. The economy had touched a new low and therefore the manufacturing sector is itself is delicately poised in India. We have to eventually try and make India a hub of low-cost manufacturing," he added.
He also said the government will amend the tough land acquisition law as it looks to restore confidence in the economy. "Some changes may be necessary. We will first try to reach a consensus and if that is not possible we will go ahead and take the decision." The Land Acquisition Bill has been widely criticised by industry as also state governments and central departments for stalling project development. Jaitley said that "obstacles" to land laws would have to be first removed in order to implement the concept of smart cities in India. Alluding to recent reform measures including the coal ordinance, he said the government is giving finishing touches to a reworked mining law.
He said there is a need to follow the e-auction route for the allocation of natural resources to make the process transparent and eliminate corruption.
Allaying skepticism about disinvestment remaining on track, the finance minister said the programme will "unfold" in the next few days. He added that the government aims to lower its equity in public sector banks to 52%.

India to support global meet on exchange of informationIndia to support global meet on exchange of information

(Modi “will express support…)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will extend India's support to the global convention on automatic exchange of information at the forthcoming G20 summit in Brisbane, sending a clear signal that New Delhi may have skipped formally inking the proposal last month but isn't wavering on backing it. Modi "will express support for the convention at the G20 summit... India remains committed to it," said a senior government official.
The new OECD-G20 standard on automatic exchange of information was endorsed last week by member nations of both groupings as well as major financial centres at the annual meeting of Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes in Berlin. OECD is the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
A status report on so-called committed and not committed jurisdictions will be presented to G20 leaders during the Brisbane summit on November 15-16. Modi is expected to explain India's position— that it's not opposed to the agreement and will sign it as soon as there is clarity on the issue at home.
India has led the fight against bank secrecy and spearheaded the setting up of the new protocol. Its officials didn't attend the Berlin meeting at which the multilateral competent authority (MCA) agreement and intended first information exchange date was agreed on October 29. Countries signing the MCA have to commit themselves to keeping data shared under the protocol confidential.
The Indian government has sought clarity from the Supreme Court on the presence of such clauses in international treaties following a recent ruling by it. The court had insisted on being given information regarding overseas account holders in a case related to uncovering black money despite the government's reservations about secrecy rules being breached. Such information is typically made public only if there is enough evidence to warrant prosecution.
A finance ministry official said India hasn't refused to sign the agreement but has deferred it for now. The official said India will have to enter into bilateral memoranda of understanding as a followup to signing the convention.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has already written to the German finance minister conveying India's support for the agreement and explaining how India could not sign it due to certain domestic procedural compulsions.
Nearly 80 countries have signed the OECD agreement to share financial data, which will boost efforts to crack down tax evasion.

WTO to take up Indias demand for permanent food security solutionWTO to take up India’s demand for permanent food security solution
Dilasha Seth, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 04.20AM IST

Australia
NEW DELHI: The World Trade Organisation is likely to begin deliberations on India's key demand of a permanent solution for food security this week, marking a step forward in multilateral trade talks after the country indicated that it was ready to accept permanent peace clause offered by the United States and start work on trade facilitation.
The matter is likely to be discussed at the global trade body's committee of agriculture on Thursday, at its first meeting after India made its domestic agricultural support disclosure at the WTO in September after a decade that showed it was close to breaching the minimum permitted subsidy limit for rice.
The US, Australia, Canada, Japan and Thailand have asked India to make disclosures of the support it gives to its farmers for all 25 crops.
India refused to ratify the trade facilitation deal in July, seeking a simultaneous permanent solution on public procurement for food security. Officials said India is now willing to accept the US' offer of an indefinite peace clause instead of a four-year window under which no country can be penalised for breaching the farm subsidy cap.
"The meeting of the committee of agriculture is a crucial one and may give a direction in which the talks of permanent solution for public stockholding are headed. Now since India is willing to pave the way for trade facilitation, other countries may like to seriously discuss amendment of agreement on agriculture," said a government official.
At the last meeting of the committee in September, some members took the stand that unless trade facilitation issue was resolved, work on implementing the remaining measures agreed at the ministerial meet in Bali would not be taken up.
On Thursday, the committee may discuss India's proposal to amend the outdated WTO norms for calculation of farm subsidies, which are based on 1986-88 prices even though global food prices have increased manifold since then. Inflation in India has soared 650% since then.
The current WTO norms cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of total production of a particular food crop, based on prices prevalent in 1986-88. India's proposal of amendment by either revising the base to a more recent year or the incorporation of inflation over the years to calculate the cap will allow developing countries to continue to procure foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price and sell them to poor at cheaper rates without violating the norms.
  India has already reached 7% value of production for rice in 2010-11, not far from the 10% mark that could be reached by 2017. In case of wheat, the administered price is lower than the fixed price of 1986-88, the base on which the minimum subsidy limit is calculated.
As per the 27-page notification document, India spent $51.1 billion on support for farmers in 2010-2011.
Australia, Japan and the European Union have questioned that while India had minimum support prices in place for 25 crops in 2004-13 (including rice, wheat, cotton, soyabean, sugarcane, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, nuts, sunflower seeds, sesamum, nigerseed, barley, gram, lentil, rape seed, safflower, toria, copra, and jute), it notified prices for only 12 crops in 2004-05 and just three for 2010-11.
Countries including Japan and those in the EU wanted to know why India changed the currency to make its subsidy notification from Indian rupee to US dollars when it gave out subsidies in rupees. Rich countries have shown keenness to know whether India exported from the public stocks at subsidised prices.
Australia has once again questioned India's sugar export subsidies, saying these were inconsistent with the WTO rules. The subsidies "introduced under the Sugar Development Fund (Amendment) Rules 2014, are inconsistent with India's WTO obligations and are contrary to the spirit and letter of the Ministerial Declaration on Export Competition agreed at Bali by all ministers in 2013", Australia said.

Govt to list AAI  Pawan Hans on stock exchangesAAI, Pawan Hans to be listed on bourses; AI privatisation not now, says Civil Aviation Minister
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:01 IST

State-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday.
The Minister also said that privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future and there have been suggestions from various quarters in this regard.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy, released by Raju in New Delhi.
Raju said that an expert committee will be constituted to develop the future roadmap for Air India.
"It is essential to ensure that the national carrier achieves its full potential," the Minister said, while adding that a Mission Mode project will also be set up to ensure that all organisations under the Ministry are competitive in terms of cost and efficiency.
"AAI will be corporatised followed by its listing on the stock exchanges to improve efficiency and transparency," Raju said, adding that listing of Pawan Hans would also be undertaken with the same objective.
AAI, a Miniratna Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 International, 81 domestic and eight Customs Airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
It has entered into Joint Ventures at Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Nagpur Airports to upgrade them.
AAI also provides Air Traffic Management Services over entire Indian Air Space and adjoining oceanic areas with ground installations at airports and other locations.
Pawan Hans was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51 per cent with the Government of India and 49 per cent with state-run ONGC .
It was incorporated with the primary objective of providing helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations, services in remote and hilly areas and charter services for promotion of tourism.
Over the years, it has grown into one of Asia's largest helicopter company and has a fleet of 47 helicopters.

Economy to Cross 6% Growth in 2015-16: Jayant SinhaMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Expressing confidence that India will cross 6 per cent GDP growth in fiscal year 2015-16, the new Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said on Monday that the government's priority will be job creation and inflation management.
"We are expecting the growth to pick up and be on the accelerating trajectory. Hopefully we will cross 6-6.5 per cent next year," Mr Sinha told reporters soon after taking charge.
He further said the economy will return to 7-8 per cent sustainable growth trajectory in the coming years.
The economic growth slumped to 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 and is estimated to be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent in current fiscal year.
The 51-year old Mr Sinha, an IIT-Delhi and Harvard alumnus, was inducted as the Minister of State during the expansion of Union Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.
Mr Sinha also expressed hope that the government will be able to push the Insurance Bill and the Constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) during the Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 24.
Referring to the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, he said, "When it comes to Parliament we are confident that we will get the support that we require".
As regards GST, he said, "That itself has gone through years and years of preparation and consensus building... We are sure will be able to show some positive results in this session."
On fiscal situation, he said it was well in hand and the government was monitoring the situation very closely with respect to tax collections.
Referring to the priorities of the government, he said they have already been articulated by the Prime minister and the Finance Minister.
"First, creating jobs is very important for us and for the economy. The second area that we have emphasised and we have done well on is obviously managing inflation and price rise, which has been a major election issue and I think we have done remarkably well on that," Mr Sinha said, adding that it was necessary to get the investment cycle moving.
Earlier, he was briefed by senior officials in the ministry soon after taking charge. He assumes office at a time when the ministry is preparing the Budget for 2015-16.
"We have been fortunate to have tailwinds of lower oil prices which are going to help on the expenditure side. So when we take into account we are very confident that we will be able to achieve our fiscal targets," he said.
Mr Sinha was elected to the Lok Sabha in May this year from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand. His career has seen him work as an investment fund manager and management consultant.

Moody s sees robust GDP growth in next two yrsMoody's sees robust growth in India in next two years
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 21:10 IST
International ratings agency Moody's on Monday said it expects India to witness sustained robust growth over the next two years.
"We expect sustained robust growth in the US, Britain and India over the next two years," Moody's Investors Service said in its quarterly Global Macro Outlook report issued in London.
The agency has a Baa3 rating with a stable outlook on India, which is the lowest in the investment grade.
Its peers S&P and Fitch had flagged concerns over falling growth, high inflation, the high fiscal and current account deficits and a sense of 'political paralysis', among other factors and had also threatened to downgrade the country to junk status.
However, with the economic conditions improving, the country has been able to convince all the rating agencies' concerns and both S&P and Fitch have upgraded their respective outlooks now.
In an earlier note, Moody's had said it expected GDP growth to touch 5 per cent in 2014 and accelerate in 2015. The country had two consecutive fiscals of sub-5 per cent growth, and the prospects have been looking up since the June quarter, when GDP growth accelerated to 5.7 per cent.
However, there are concerns that the number will slip to around 5 per cent due to weak industrial growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had called the process of recovery as uneven. At the global level, Moody's said the US growth was likely to accelerate as pent-up consumer and investment demand is realised. For the G-20 economies, it is expecting a GDP growth of around 3 per cent in 2015 and 2016, after notching up 2.8 per cent in 2014.

Microsoft is trying to expand its small market share worldwide with cheaper devices. To do that, it has cut manufacturing costs.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Microsoft has unveiled a cheaper smartphone, costing about 110 euros ($135), as it eyes emerging and other low-cost markets for growth.
The new model is the first Lumia smartphone under Microsoft's own brand name. The company has released a few Lumia models since it bought Nokia's phone business this year, but those models still carried the Nokia brand.
The Lumia 535 Windows smartphone will have a 5-inch screen, as measured diagonally. It comes with 5-megapixel front and rear cameras, which should snap sharper selfies than typical smartphones.
Microsoft is trying to expand its small market share worldwide with cheaper devices. To do that, it has cut manufacturing costs. For instance, camera and control buttons on many models can now be tapped on the screen rather than being physical buttons on the frame.
Despite the low cost, Microsoft said the new phone will offer the same Microsoft services that high-end phones do. That includes Skype video calls, Office apps and the virtual assistant Cortana.
As is common with phones for emerging markets, Microsoft is making a version with slots for two SIM cards so that people can switch between service providers more easily. In such markets, rates vary so much that many people have multiple accounts to take advantage of the best deals.
The Lumia 535 is expected to go on sale this month. Microsoft didn't announce any U.S. plans.

Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) has raised National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty's target to 9,600 for 2015 from its 2014 target of 8,000 and said that macroeconomic data and earnings should lift markets.
Consensus earnings growth estimates of 15 per cent for FY16 and FY17 will be met, UBS said in a note.
The global financial services company expects lower rates and reforms to drive growth recovery.
UBS economists see 10-year bond yield at 6.5 per cent by end-FY16, down from 8.2 per cent currently.
UBS remains 'overweight' on banks, oil and gas, power, telecom and media stocks. It has upgraded consumer discretionary and pharmaceuticals to "neutral" from "underweight"
However, the banking services company has downgraded small and mid-caps to 'neutral' from 'overweight' and has cut IT services to 'underweight' from 'neutral'.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
A seven-day breakdown at its Dolvi plant pulled JSW Steel’s crude steel production down by 2 per cent to 10.46 lakh tonnes in October.
The company, India’s third largest steel maker, had produced 10.62 lakh tonne crude steel in the same month a year ago, JSW Steel said in a statement today.
“The crude steel production was lower due to planned shutdown of blast furnace at Dolvi for about seven days during October 2014,” the company said.
The Sajjan Jindal-led firm has steel plants in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra with a combined installed capacity of 143 lakh tonnes a year. Dolvi plant in Maharashtra has an annual steel production capacity of 33 lakh tonnes.
During October, the production of flat products, used mainly into automotive sector, was down by 5 per cent to 8.28 lakh tonnes from 8.67 lakh tonnes in October last year.
Production of long products, used in the construction sector, however, rose 3 per cent to 1.53 lakh tonnes from 1.49 lakh tonnes a year earlier.

HCC shares soar 12% as Lavasa gets go-ahead for Rs 750-cr IPOHCC shares soar 12% as Lavasa gets go-ahead for Rs 750-cr IPO
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 11:  
Shares of Hindustan Construction Company today soared over 12 per cent after its realty arm Lavasa Corporation got a go-ahead for market regulator SEBI for raising Rs 750 crore through an IPO.
Lavasa had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in July this year for the proposed initial public offer.
SEBI issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. SEBI’s observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Reacting to the IPO go-ahead, HCC shares today rose to a high of Rs 38.25 in early morning trade, with a gain of 12.2 per cent from its previous close. It was trading at Rs 37.35 at the BSE in mid-day trade.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares of land in ‘Lavasa’ near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money through IPO.
In November 2010, Lavasa had got the SEBI clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan at that time.
As per draft documents, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore.
The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company’s growth.
Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Gold prices fell 0.91 per cent to Rs 25,498 per ten grams at the futures trade today in line with weak overseas trend.
Gold prices fell Rs 235 or 0.91 per cent to trade at Rs 25,498 per 10 grams for delivery in December at the Multi Commodity Exchange in 851 lots.
Similarly, the far-month February contract dropped Rs 219 or 0.84 per cent to Rs 25,717 per 10 gram in 29 lots.
Analysts said weakness in the overseas market, where gold dipped to over four-year low as investment demand waned amid surging dollar, put pressure on the precious metal prices at the futures trade.
Globally, the yellow metal traded at $1,149.30 an ounce in Singapore from $1,151.47 in yesterday’s trade.

Canada announces quarantine measuresTweet
Toronto, Nov 11:  
The Canadian government announced that it is tightening restrictions on travellers from Ebola—affected countries in West Africa by imposing self—monitoring and quarantine measures.
High-risk travellers who have been in the three countries hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia will be required to self-isolate at home or at “a facility,” preferably near designated treatment centres in each province, for the 21-day incubation period. Travellers deemed low-risk who had no known exposure to Ebola would be required to self-monitor for 21 days, including twice-a-day temperature checks.
The policy statement by the Public Health Agency of Canada yesterday did not specify what kind of facility should handle high-risk travellers, or who would decide which of the options would apply to a particular case.
Gregory Taylor, Canada’s chief public health officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Rumours have circulated for some time that the federal government was considering strict quarantine rules that would apply for returning health—care workers but the idea reportedly met with considerable resistance from provincial governments.
Opponents expressed concern that applying strict quarantine restrictions on returning health care workers who did not show Ebola symptoms and had risked their lives would deter others from volunteering to help stem the outbreak in West Africa.
The new rules, which took effect day, create two classes of travellers from West Africa: high risk and low risk.
The rules apply to people who are not evidently ill when they arrive in Canada, but might be incubating the disease.
Anyone who is ill with symptoms consistent with Ebola would be isolated until tests determine if the person is infected.
Returning health-care workers will not be automatically slotted into the high-risk category. Instead, the guidelines say local public health authorities can decide on a case-by- case basis whether to require a returning medical worker to go into quarantine in their home or in a facility for 21 days.
The statement suggests that a health—care worker who had been exposed to Ebola after having a breach in their personal protective equipment may be considered high risk.
The policy applies to all travelers from Ebola—affected countries. But because Canada has already stopped issuing visas to residents and nationals of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, in reality the policy will mostly apply to returning health—care workers and people who work for humanitarian aid groups.

South Korean ferry captain gets 36 years inprisonPrint
Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, on the bus, arrives for verdict and sentence session at Gwangju District Court in Gwangju, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. South Korean prosecutors on Monday, Oct. 27, 2014, demanded the death penalty for the captain of the ferry that sank in April, killing more than 300 people, and life sentences to three key crew members, a court official said. (Source: AP)
By: Press Trust of India | Seoul | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:01 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:47 pm
A South Korean court on Tuesday handed a 36-year prison sentence to the captain of a sunken ferry, saying he was professionally negligent and abandoned his passengers during the disaster in April that killed more than 300 people. The chief engineer got 30 years, and 13 other crew members were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, Yonhap news agency and other South Korean media reported, citing the Gwangju District Court in southern South Korea.
Captain Lee Joon-seok and three other key crew members were earlier indicted by prosecutors on homicide and other charges. Eleven others faced less serious charges. Lee has apologized for abandoning the passengers, but said he didn’t know his action would lead to so many deaths.
The Sewol ferry sank off South Korea’s southern coast in April with a loss of more than 300 lives. (Source: Reuters)
The widely vilified Lee could have received a death sentence for the homicide charges. South Korea hasn’t executed anyone since late 1997, though its courts occasionally issue the punishment. Prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal, according to the court.
Court officials didn’t immediately answer calls seeking confirmation. The 15 crew members tasked with navigating the ferry Sewol have faced scathing public criticism because they escaped the sinking ship while many of their passengers were still trapped inside. A total of 476 people were aboard the ship and only 172 were rescued. Most of the dead were teenage students traveling to a resort island on a school trip.
Nearly seven months after the sinking, 295 bodies have been recovered but nine are still missing. South Korean officials said today they’ve ended searches for the missing because there was only a remote chance of finding more bodies while worries have grown over the safety of divers. Two civilian divers have died after falling unconscious during searches.

Seeking an ‘explicit ban’ on paid prioritisation on the web, President Barack Obama has said that Internet service providers shouldn't be allowed to cut deals with online services, so that no service is stuck in a ‘slow lane’ without paying a fee. The move experts said would ban companies from cutting deals for faster service.

With Shiv Sena poised to sit in opposition  will NCP save BJP in floor testWith Shiv Sena poised to sit in opposition, will NCP save BJP in floor test?
PTI Nov 9, 2014, 10.01PM IST

BJP
(It will be interesting to…)
MUMBAI: The next political move of the newly -installed BJP government in Maharashtra, slated to prove its majority in the Assembly in a special session beginning tomorrow, is keenly watched against the backdrop of its former ally Shiv Sena today warning BJP against taking support of NCP for survival.
However, with 121 MLAs in its fold, the BJP which emerged as the single largest party in the state elections, seems to be banking on the "outside" support offered by the Sharad Pawar-led party which has indicated that it may vote in favour of the minority government on the floor of the House instead of abstaining from vote as it had said earlier.
The NCP, with 41 MLAs, has assured its outside support, sans any condition, to the new government. The Shiv Sena has 63 MLAs, and is the second largest party in the 288-member House after BJP.
It will be interesting to see how BJP cobble up requisite strength to achieve the magic figure of 145 MLAs to survive the floor test on November 12.
Meanwhile, Congress which has 42 members in the House, today said it will stake claim for post of the Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly.
"As soon as the party high-command nominates our party group leader in the Assembly, we will stake claim to the post," MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre said here today.
The three-day special session of the Legislative Assembly will begin here tomorrow wherein state Governor C Vidyasagar Rao will administer oath to Jeeva Pandu Gavit as Pro-tem Speaker of the Assembly in Raj Bhavan at 10 AM, an official said.
Assembly proceedings will start at 11 AM and the first two days will see the members of the 13th Assembly take oath.
On November 12, the Speaker will be elected after which Fadnavis will move a trust vote. The session will conclude with the Governor's address to legislators.
Amid reports of Shiv Sena's demand for ministerial berths, Fadnavis had earlier said no minister will be sworn-in before the trust vote. The Cabinet expansion will happen only after the confidence vote, he had said.
The Sena has been reportedly trying to browbeat the BJP in extracting desirable portfolios for the party, however, BJP has not budged and reportedly asked Sena to first offer its support during the trust vote.

AirAsia India ups ante  offers tickets for Rs 699AirAsia India ups ante, offers one-way tickets for Rs 699
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 14:25 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
AirAsia India has launched a week-long sale offer for its entire network with one-way tickets at prices as low as Rs 699, including taxes.
The airline is offering an all inclusive one-way fare starting from Rs 699 for flights from Bengaluru to Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Jaipur and Chandigarh and vice versa.
Tickets can be booked on AirAsia's website till November 16, for travel period from June 10, 2015, to January 17, 2016.
The offer comes as part of the Malaysia-based parent company's 'Big Sale' with three million promotional seats on its network from Kuala Lumpur, with the starting fare of Rs 2,599 for international flights operated by AirAsia Berhad and Thai AirAsia, the airline said in a statement on Sunday.
AirAsia's offer of Rs 2,599 would be available on flights from Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Tiruchirappalli and Hyderabad to Kuala Lumpur operated by AirAsia Berhad and Chennai to Bangkok flown by Thai AirAsia, the release added.
"The 'Big Sale' offer would allow our guests to plan their travel early with extremely low fares," said AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya.

Either us or NCP in Maha: Shiv Sena tells BJPAnant Geete
("We will not participate…)
MUMBAI: The 25-year-old alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena teetered on the brink with the regional party declaring that it would sit in opposition in the Maharashtra assembly if the BJP takes direct or indirect support from the NCP to prove its majority in the house.
Addressing a press conference, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that Sena MP Anil Desai did not join the Union cabinet on Sunday because the BJP refused to divulge how it intended to win an upcoming vote of confidence in the Maharashtra assembly.
After Desai's boycott of the swearing-in ceremony, Thackeray summoned party MLAs and MPs for a meeting on Sunday evening, leading to speculation that he would announce the Shiv Sena's exit from the ruling NDA and make a categorical announcement that his party would not participate in the state government.
In the end, Thackeray appeared to have kept the door for rapprochement ajar, if only just, by declaring that Sena will sit in opposition only if BJP opts for support from Sharad Pawar's NCP. The Sena has 63 MLAs in the state assembly while the BJP has 123.
"We have been very cooperative and tried to be very patient with the BJP but the BJP is showing indications that it wants to take support from the NCP in Maharashtra Assembly. We will not participate in a state government that depends on NCP's support. Sharad Pawar always spoke against the BJP before elections. He also introduced terms like 'saffron terror' which are unacceptable to us. If the BJP wants to take support from such a party then we would prefer to sit in opposition," Uddhav said at the Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar, the headquarters of the party.
Elaborating on Desai's non-participation in the swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi, Thackeray said: "We have been insisting that BJP should first decide what we are going to do in Maharashtra. I want to know whether the BJP is going to depend on NCP or not. The BJP should make it clear who they want to go with. It has to be either NCP or Shiv Sena. I asked Anil (Desai) to return from Delhi airport because BJP was not willing to discuss anything about Maharashtra.
BJP must realise that Sharad Pawar was responsible for the collapse of Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998; if the BJP wants to take support from such a leader then I have nothing to say. BJP must make it clear if they are going to take support from NCP or not, only after they decide that we will announce if we will participate in the government or sit in opposition in the state assembly".
A Shiv Sena MP alleged that attempts by Thackeray to speak to PM Modi had failed.
"We were prepared to participate in the Union cabinet but the BJP has not kept its word. Yesterday Uddhavji tried to speak with the Prime Minister on phone but PM refused to take his call. Sena wanted to speak with the PM through (heavy industry minister) Anant Geete , but PM Modi refused to give an appointment to Geete. This is an insult. Certain things were promised to Uddhavji by the BJP earlier but talks have not moved in a positive direction so we decided not to participate in the swearing-in at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today," Shiv Sena MP Anand Adsul told ET.
The talks between BJP and Shiv Sena over power sharing in Maharashtra and the latter's participation in the Union cabinet had lingered on for three weeks. While the Shiv Sena insisted that one more cabinet berth should be given to the party in the Centre, the BJP continued to offer only a junior ministership (minister of state) position. Further, the Sena did not want Suresh Prabhu , a Sena nominee in the previous NDA government, to be included in the government while the BJP insisted that they wanted Prabhu.
Prabhu joined the BJP on Sunday before taking oath as a cabinet minister.

Prabhu s uneasy time in Sena: Was called  Alice in WonderlandBal Thackeray handpicked him as his man for the first, 13-day Vajpayee government of 1996 and got him elected on a Sena ticket from Rajapur, the party's stronghold in Konkan. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena gave exbanker and technocrat Suresh Prabhu a political position and a slot in the A B Vajpayee ministry, but once his graph started rising, his relationship with the party grew increasingly strained.
His very entry into the Sena in the mid-1990s ruffled feathers. He was initially resented by senior Sena leaders because he had Sena chief Bal Thackeray's ear and support, and later resented by Matoshree for his 'growing proximity' to the BJP. On Sunday, when his ties with the party finally broke, the Sena viewed the BJP again as the villain of the piece. Prabhu had joined the BJP government at the Centre (this time as a BJP nominee), causing acute discomfiture once more to the saffron outfit.
Bal Thackeray handpicked him as his man for the first, 13-day Vajpayee government of 1996 and got him elected on a Sena ticket from Rajapur, the party's stronghold in Konkan.
Thackeray was on the lookout for a sober and articulate face, the Sena having drawn criticism earlier for sending the 'wrong kind' of people to the Rajya Sabha , and Prabhu fit the bill. But the firsttime MP's inclusion in the Union Cabinet caused heartburn among veteran Sena leaders.
Thackeray ignored their protests but after Prabhu took charge of the ministry of environment and forests in the 1998 Vajpayee government and was given the chemicals and fertilizers portfolio in 1999, a chasm developed between Matoshree and the mild-mannered ex-head of Saraswat Co-op Bank. Prabhu was accused, first indirectly and then directly, of not looking after the party's interests.
As Prabhu's profile in New Delhi grew with Vajpayee giving him the plum power portfolio in 2000, the Sena leadership was more perturbed, sources said. Thackeray publicly heaped scorn on him, calling him 'Alice in Wonderland', ridiculed him for trying to project him self as 'Mr Clean', and criticized him for having failed to create a lobby in New Delhi to promote the cause of Maharashtra.
Thackeray's next step in 2002 was to ask for Prabhu's resignation. Sources said Vajpayee was reluctant to let him go, but Thackeray put his foot down.
The bitterness did not end there. Vajpayee made Prabhu chairperson of the task force for the interlinking of rivers project, the then PM's pet initiative. That riled the Sena leadership further. Prabhu, however, still did not make a clean break from the party. After he failed to win the LS poll from Ra japur for the fifth consecutive time in 2009, though, he remained only technically a Shiv Sena member, having cut himself off from all party affairs.
This time, Uddhav, like his father, made it clear to the BJP that he did not want Prabhu as Sena's nominee. Sources said the Sena planned to expel him after his swearing-in as a member of Modi's Cabinet. But the Sena was checkmated, political analysts said, as it has been right through the Maharashtra assembly poll season: Prabhu quit the party on Sunday morning and was given membership by the BJP. Expulsion was out of the question.

Citi Sees Conducive Clime for up to 1% Rate Cut by RBI in FY16
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 10, 2014 16:25 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Mumbai: After two years of sub-5 per cent growth and double digit inflation, India's growth inflation dynamics have improved with easing in prices faster than expected, leading to expectations of an up to 100 bps, or 1 per cent, cut in interest rates next fiscal year (2015-16), according to a report by Citigroup.
"We believe conditions conducive for easing are likely in coming months as base effect wears off, government efforts on food inflation continue and the Budget reinforces fiscal discipline. Accordingly, we now expect the Reserve Bank to cut repo rate by 100 bps (one percentage point) by FY16 with 75 bps by the end of 2015," Citigroup India chief economist Rohini Malkani said in a note today.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan will announce the fourth bimonthly monetary policy on December 2, amidst a rising call for rate cut.
She, however, cautioned that this position may change adversely if there is a substantial bounce-back in commodity prices, food prices spikes and if global market distorts further from what it is today. Any further expansion of quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and possibly the ECB could also pose challenges.
Explaining the rationale for a steep cut, the report said that although the global policy environment remains mixed, domestic factors are likely to be pre-dominant for policy decisions.
"Relative to growth, the normalisation in inflation has been faster than anticipated due to a sharp decline in commodity prices, continued supply-side efforts by government and RBI's anti-inflation stance," she said.
It can be noted that there was a 25 per cent drop in crude, while CPI inflation has dropped to 6.47 per cent in September which is likely to fall steeply to below 5 per cent in November. However, Q2 GDP growth may all come below 5 per cent against a 5.7 print in Q1, she warned.
She also commended the improvements in the macro space, with near normalisation in current account deficit (down from 4.7 per cent in FY13 to 1.7 per cent in FY14), and inflation down from 11.2 to 6.5 per cent.
On the impact of rate cuts on the bond yields, Ms Malkani also said this would see bonds softening towards 7.75 per cent by end-2015 and the rupee trading at its fair value of 60-62 against dollar.

Time we stop over-dependence on FIIs  says Deepak ParekhIt's time we stop over-dependence on 'fickle FIIs', says Deepak Parekh
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:16 IST

Raising concern about over-dependence of Indian capital markets on foreign institutional investors, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said that something needs to be done to change this pattern.
"There is too much dependence on foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and I think we have exported our capital markets abroad. We have to do something to change this pattern," Parekh told a capital markets meet organised by the ISB here over the weekend.
"Who is really benefitting from our well regulated equity markets? It is not the Indians, it is not our institutions, it is not our labour, it is not our retirees, but the FIIs," said Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.
FIIs' stakes in the Sensex companies hit an all-time high of over 27 per cent in June this year. Their holdings in the wider BSE 200 Index reached an all-time high at 24.5 per cent, as per BofA-ML's Jyotivardhan Jaipuria.
Incidentally, HDFC as also group firm HDFC Bank are among companies with very high FII holdings.
The companies where FIIs have exhausted their permissible investment limits include Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDFC, IndusInd Bank, Lupin, Maruti and Titan among others. The sectors where there is still some room comprise banks, cement, auto and consumer goods.
"We all know how fickle FIIs are. They move in and out of the markets effortlessly and there is a herd instinct. History is replete with examples of how sudden reversals in capital flows can cause extensive damage and volatility to a country's financial system," Parekh warned.
A vocal proponent of free market, Parekh also crticised the government for using the divestment as a tool to "plug the fiscal deficit," and said state-run firms like LIC should not take holdings in other PSUs as part of divestment programme.
He also expressed displeasure at no progress being made on the front as yet, saying bunching up of issues towards the end of the fiscal reduces market's absorption capacity.
He also said the government has been "hanging on senselessly" with equity in many public sector companies such as BSNL and Air India as private companies have done very well in their sectors.
Alleging that investigating arms of the government like the CAG or CVC have "little understanding of valuations", Parekh also came out strongly over action taken against civil servants under whose leaderships such stake sales happen.
He further blamed the investment bankers and promoters for being greedy and commanding higher valuations in FY08, which saw a record initial public offerings and said that this behaviour has waned investor interest later.
"The cardinal rule is that one has to leave something on the table for investors, otherwise they will completely back out of such funding," he said, adding the number of issuances have been few even though we are in the midst of a bull-run in the market at present.

Supreme Court adjourns spot-fixing hearing to FridayTweet
0
The day most Indian cricket fans were waiting for in trepidation is finally here as the Supreme Court on Monday takes up for hearing the final report filed by the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee on the involvement of sidelined BCCI President N. Srinivasan and 12 capped India players in betting and spot-fixing during IPL 2013.
What hangs in balance is the fate of Srinivasan (will he get a clean chit and return to the helm of BCCI affairs?), cricketers including captain M. S. Dhoni who is also believed to have been questioned, the future of IPL teams Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR), Srinivasan’s son-in-law and former CSK team principal Gurunath Meiyappan, and RR co-owner Raj Kundra.
Raju Ramachandran, the senior lawyer representing the Mudgal panel, had on November 3 filed the report in a sealed cover and a bench headed by Justice T. S. Thakur said confidentiality shall be maintained till the court takes up the report.
Justice A. K. Patnaik, who appointed the Mudgal panel in October 2013 and made several tough observations against BCCI and Srinivasan after the preliminary findings, retired on June 2 and the stand of the new bench headed by Justice Thakur will be keenly observed.
Justice Mudgal, who expressed satisfaction with the panel’s work, refused to divulge anything about the content of the report saying “the court has demanded confidentiality. It is up to the Supreme Court whether it finds our work satisfactory. We complied with the order. Now the court will decide the course of action.”
The panel had in its preliminary report in February this year put Srinivasan’s role and the conflict of interest aspect under close scrutiny, indicted Meiyappan and pointed fingers at the role of 12 “prominent names in cricket” including capped Indian players, following which the court ordered the committee to conduct a deeper investigation.
However, according to sources close to the panel, the final report has put the spotlight on Meiyappan and CSK’s role in the whole scandal. Also RR’s co-owner Kundra and his supposed involvement and Arun Pandey-owned Rhiti Sports’ functioning have also come under the scanner.
The panel has also suggested some steps which it thinks will curb the menace of spot-fixing and match-fixing.
“Firstly the emphasis is on CSK and Meiyappan. It is no secret that CSK also tried to hide Meiyappan’s involvement, and that could prompt the sternest punishment. Next in line is Kundra and his whole role in the fiasco. It could lead to Rajasthan Royals also suffering, but maybe not as much as CSK,” the source told MAIL TODAY.
“The committee has also decided to suggest ways to prevent such occurrences. Also on the radar is Rhiti’s business model. But one has to realise that these are all suggestions and the final verdict lies with the Supreme Court,” the source added.
The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) has confirmed that the voices of Meiyappan and actor Vindoo Dara Singh matched with those in the tapped telephonic conversation in which they were discussing betting. This is likely to add to the troubles for both of them.
The apex court in May asked Srinivasan to keep away from all BCCI affairs till the probe was over and he is cleared. The court had appointed former Test cricketer Shivlal Yadav as the working president of the Board.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare: A misstep in the acclaimed seriesBy Michael Thomsen November 10

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
Developer: Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, High Moon Studios
Publisher: Activision
Available On: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
The world always looks threatening when viewed through the crosshairs of a gun, and “The Call of Duty” series has earned a reputation for culling pleasure from this perspective, rendering the world as a permanently hostile landscape.
“Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,” released earlier this week, moves into the future, following a young soldier’s journey from Marine Corps private to a private military contractor trying to prevent a catastrophic attack on the United States. “Advanced Warfare” is the eleventh “Call of Duty” game in as many years, and while its visuals are a technical marvel, its sense of scripted action and split second reactions have become a restricting and over-familiar formula that has never felt less satisfying.
Actor Kevin Spacey in character. (Courtesy of Activision)
Advanced Warfare roots both story and new gameplay ideas in powered exoskeletons — robotic braces for a soldier’s arms, legs, and torso – which give machine-like powers to human bodies. The ‘Exo suit’ allows players to jump 20 feet at a time, turn themselves invisible, scale walls with magnetic gloves, and use a grappling hook to reach distant ledges. The narrative explanation for these new tools comes from Atlas Corporation, which runs the largest private army in the world and manufactures marvelous machinery to keep its troops outfitted. Kevin Spacey assumes the role of Jonathan Irons, Atlas’s CEO, and developer Sledgehammer Games takes every opportunity to inject Spacey’s declarative barks and insidious sneers.
The game opens in 2054 with players assuming the role of Jack Mitchell fighting against an invading North Korean force in Seoul alongside Irons’s son. When the opening battle takes a turn for the worse, the younger Irons is killed and Mitchell loses his left arm, effectively ending his Marine career. At his son’s funeral, the elder Irons invites Mitchell to join Atlas, promising him both a new robotic arm and the chance to continue his fighting career. Four years later, Mitchell is a star with Atlas hunting a terrorist organization called the KVA, whose only discernible goal is the eradication of technology.
The game whisks players around the globe, from Nigeria to Greece to Antarctica to Iraq. There is some excitement in seeing each new location for the first time, sitting in a cafe in Santorini, tumbling through an ice crevasse in Antarctica, or walking through the streets of a modernized Lagos. But the exploration of this new territory always devolves into a familiar string of shootouts, safe space melting into a haze of bullet traces, shattering windows, and haphazard explosions. And for all the vaunted future technology, most of the game is surprisingly retrograde in its approach to shooting. Most of the game’s missions feel interchangeable with any number of recent “Call of Duty” games.
The first few games in the series celebrated audiovisual chaos, piercing the layer of historical distance and dryness of World War II with a rendering of war as an incoherent shock corridor that one survives more than wins. It was a concept unique to videogames in the early 2000s, using the game to brutalize its players through every technical trick it could manage, from obscuring one’s vision with blood to overloading the speakers with gunfire, sounds of buildings collapsing, and screams of panic and rage.
Cast 40 years into the future and attached to a facile parable about a corporation trying to take over the world, this reverential depiction of war trauma feels almost farcical, a boilerplate that can be used to learn the same lesson from any political circumstance or time period.
Beneath every unbelievable set piece—jumping from moving bus rooftops on a freeway while shooting at a helicopter, or creeping through a Bulgarian forest with a suit that allows you to become invisible—there is an undercurrent of masochism and self-loathing. Everything seems to hate you in “Advanced Warfare.” Even your fellow squad mates spend most of their time screaming at you. Take the shot! Breach the door! Launch the drone!
In the game’s quietest moments, such as the funeral for Irons’s son wherein players are prompted to press the X button to “pay respects,” there is a sense that actions are taken, not because you want to but because there is no alternative. “Advanced Warfare” comes to feel like a simulation what life would be if most of the world wanted you dead, while those claiming to be your allies tolerated your presence only so long as you do what they say.
“Advanced Warfare” is at its purest and most nihilistic in its multiplayer modes. Like other “Call of Duty” games, “Advanced Warfare’s” multiplayer feels like trying to play full-court basketball in a maze while armed with automatic weaponry. Uplink, one of the new match types, has players rushing for a satellite device which players palm in their hands, and attempt to throw it into a small target area on either side of the map in order to score points. Another new mode, Exo Survival, has up to three human players fighting sequential waves of computer-controlled enemies, both human, robotic, and canine. Even man’s best friend doesn’t much like you in “Advanced Warfare.”
These multiplayer modes are designed to be a another world to retreat into, while earning experience points to unlock new guns, Exo suit abilities, and other combat perks You can customize and save personal loadouts, manipulate your character’s appearance, and track clan activity through a separate mobile app and online account registered through the game’s website.
(Courtesy of Activision)
The game can be played at incredibly high skill levels, involving deep thought about tactics, timing, and team work, but for most, the multiplayer is an adrenal tug of war between success and failure, that doses you with game currency no matter what the final outcome. Even if you’re not especially good, the experience system, unlocks, and wide variety of match types make it feel like there’s always something meaningful you could be working toward. Yet the experience always revolves around running somewhere, shooting as many people as you can find in the narrow corridors before being taken down from behind.
As sensory entertainment, “Advanced Warfare” is about as pleasant as licking a battery for eight hours while a crowd of angry men surround you and chant your name. As a parable about the dangers of corporatizing the military in the 21st Century, it feels like a massive failure. The story’s caricature of revolutionary movements is likewise facile, rendering the KVA as thoughtless zealots with no historical or cultural context other than a knee-jerk dislike for “technology.” “Call of Duty” games rarely tell interesting or plausible stories, but “Advanced Warfare” feels like the least imaginative of them all.
There are no heroes here, only survivors cut off from any conception of life that would make enduring these abuses worthwhile. This is both the beauty and tragedy of “Advanced Warfare.” Even without anything worth fighting for, we’re still only too happy to fight.

Vodafone Moves Court Over Delay in Signing of LicenceYou are here: Home Corporates
Vodafone Moves Court Over Delay in Signing of Licence
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 00:05 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Vodafone has moved the Delhi High Court alleging the Centre is indulging in "arm-twisting" and "coercive" tactics by refusing to sign its unified licence (UL) till the telecom major unconditionally accepts the "restrictive" clauses in the licence.
Vodafone contended in its plea on Monday that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) showed them a copy of the UL only on November 3 and the company had on November 5 written to the government to remove the "restrictive clauses" prohibiting the telecom major from entering into intra-circle roaming (ICR) pacts.
"However, petitioners (Vodafone) were surprised that instead of signing and executing the ULs, the respondent (DoT) wrongly, unreasonably and arbitrarily and at the last moment informed that the letter of November 5 is a conditional compliance and not acceptable."
"DoT also informed that petitioners' request for deletion of restrictive clauses in UL pertaining to roaming cannot be accepted. It is submitted that said restrictive clauses in the UL take away the rights already granted to petitioner and as upheld by TDSAT on April 29, 2014," the petition noted.
TDSAT had on April 29 overturned a government ban on offering 3G mobile services beyond their licensed zones through roaming pacts saying it was in national interest to allow better utilisation of scarce radio frequency.
It has sought orders declaring the "restrictive clauses" as illegal and their deletion from the UL.
The matter is likely to be heard on Tuesday.
The telecom major has accused DoT of "adopting coercive steps" saying "if UL is not signed in a timely manner, then the existing 22 million subscribers in three service areas - Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata - of the petitioners, being provided services under existing unified access service licence (UASL), will face disruption of services after November 29, 2014".
Vodafone's UASL for these service areas is set to expire on November 29.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that as it was in a "vulnerable" position, owing to impending expiry of its UASL, and DoT, being aware of consequences for the company "is arm-twisting, abusing its position/powers as a licensor to delay and deny" the telecom major's entitlement to use the spectrum obtained in the auctions.
Vodafone has contended that it bought/acquired spectrum in 2010 and 2014 at a total cost of around Rs 24,000 crore, of which Rs 12,000 crore has already been paid.
"Respondent, after taking such huge amounts paid towards spectrum, cannot now adopt coercive measure for signing UL with the petitioners," the petition has said.
According to Vodafone's plea, DoT has already accepted their applications, conveyed approvals and issued letters of intent (LoI) on August 28, September 15 and September 23 for Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi areas, respectively.
The company has claimed that it too has unequivocally and unconditionally accepted these letters on intent and has fulfilled each and every requisite condition thereunder through acceptance letters.
As per the new telecom policy, unified licences are to be given to telecom companies to use the spectrum acquired by them and provide mobile services to their subscribers.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that the UL of another telecom service provider was signed only after it moved the Bombay High Court.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular - the three biggest mobile service providers in the country - and Reliance Jio were among eight companies that bid a combined Rs 61,162 crore for spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands offered by the government during a 10-day auction that ended on February 13 this year.

Dena Bank Posts 51 Per Cent Fall in September Quarter Profit
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 10, 2014 23:37 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: Dena Bank on Monday reported an about 51 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 52 crore for the quarter ended September 2014 on account of higher provisions for bad assets.
The state-run lender had registered a net profit of Rs 107.38 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year (2013-14).
"Our profit was impacted by higher provisions of Rs 352 crore, which we made during the quarter for non-performing assets, against Rs 109 crore in the year ago period," chairman and managing director Ashwani Kumar told reporters here.
Asset quality worsened during the quarter under review with gross NPAs (non-performing assets) at 5.12 per cent, which includes a Rs 250-crore fixed deposits fraud at its Malabar Hill branch.
Net NPA stood at 3.59 per cent during the quarter. In the year ago period, gross bad loans ratio stood at 3 per cent, while net NPA stood at 2.02 per cent.
"The total income has increased from Rs 2,599.94 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 to Rs 2,885.22 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014," the bank said.
Earlier this year, the CBI had unearthed a Rs 250-crore fraud at the bank wherein the branch manager and a private person allegedly took loans using forged documents on behalf of seven private companies which had deposits in the bank.
Without the fraud, gross NPA would have been 4.83 per cent, Mr Kumar said, adding that the bank made a provision of Rs 42 crore for the Malabar Hill fraud case.
Fresh slippages rose to Rs 1,000 crore and with the Malabar Hill fraud case, the slippages totalled to Rs 1,200 crore.
Net interest margins declined to 2.32 per cent from 2.57 per cent a year ago. The bank is targeting its NIM to improve to 2.75-3 per cent by the end of March.
The bank said Rs 450 crore of restructured accounts slipped into NPAs during the period.
The biggest restructured account which slipped into NPA was telecom tower company GTL (worth Rs 180 crore). The bank also has exposure of Rs 60 crore to its subsidiary, GTL Infrastructure, but the account remains standard so far, he said.
Another big account which slipped into NPA was copper rods producer TDT Copper worth Rs 70 crore, the chairman said.
The bank restructured Rs 529 crore of advances during the second quarter (July-September) of 2014-15, and has a pipeline of Rs 300 crore in the third quarter, Mr Kumar added.
Two major accounts restructured during the quarter were BRG Iron and Steel (Rs 117 crore) and SEL Manufacturing (Rs 110 crore).
Recoveries and upgrades during the quarter were at Rs 450 crore.
Deposits increased to Rs 1,06,460 crore from Rs 93,669 crore, recording a growth of 13.66 per cent, while advances grew 14.78 per cent to Rs 75,367 crore from Rs 65,664 crore.
CASA deposits have increased 10.51 per cent on year to Rs 30,027.21 crore.
Mr Kumar also said the bank has a board mandate to raise Rs 2,300 crore from Tier I bond sale this fiscal year (2014-15).

Merck: 4-week Hepatitis C treatment too shortmerck: 4-week hepatitis c treatment too short
Madhu Koda files nomination to contest from MajhgaonPrint
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:16 am
In an indication of his growing confidence in the face of weakened cases against him, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda on Monday filed nomination papers to contest from Majhgaon, which votes on December 2.
Koda, who represented Singhbhum in the last Lok Sabha, had decided not to contest the general election and chose to field Jagannathpur MLA and wife Geeta Koda instead. She came a creditable second to BJP’s Laxman Gilua. Koda said his Jai Bharat Samanta Party will contest at least 17 seats this time. “We will contest five seats in the Palamu and 12 in Kolhan…. We had contested eight seats last time,” he said.
The former CM appeared confident as corruption cases against him look weak. Of the five cases initially registered against him, only three are effectively pending now.
The CBI had in November last year registered a closure report in the case alleging a representative of Koda received Rs 11.4 crore as kickbacks for a Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme tender. Earlier in March, the Jharkhand High Court had quashed a Vigilance case against him.
Koda, the first Independent legislator to become CM, is on bail in all the cases.

Sensex gains in early trade on sustained buyingMARKET UPDATE: Nifty ends at new high; Sensex rises 35 points
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 22:26 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The BSE Sensex on Tuesday gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data on Wednesday.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government's reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of $82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore on Monday, according to the stock exchanges' data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released on Wednesday, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy's, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.

Eyeing 8% growth  govt set for big reforms | Higher duty on petrolArun Jaitley
(The administration is well-placed…)
NEW DELHI: Having just completed a comprehensive round of ministerial and bureaucratic changes, the Narendra Modi government is set to embark on a series of economic reforms aimed at putting the country on track for 8% growth in the intermediate term and an even faster pace beyond that.
This will include ironing out the kinks in land acquisition, implementing the longawaited goods & services tax (GST), rapidly modernising the railway system to its fullest potential and fixing the seriously flawed agricultural produce marketing system. And where it sees the need for drastic, immediate change, the government won't be averse to taking the ordinance route, particularly with respect to the land acquisition law, seen as one of the biggest stumbling blocks to infrastructure development in the country.
The administration is well-placed to kick off its programme in the winter session of Parliament, when key economic Bills are expected to be introduced.
"Plate is full... focus areas are clear," said a senior government official. "All energies of the government will be directed towards this." A two-pronged approach to the reforms process will be followed — focusing on pushing key legislation and removing obstacles to procedures on the ground to improve governance, thereby lifting the curbs on growth and attracting greater levels of investment.
The government believed previously that changes in rules could help fix the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, that was moved by the UPA government, but it now believes an amendment will be needed. The law has stalled land acquisition because of the cumbersome procedures prescribed. The states have widely opposed it and the government is counting on that to get amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, where it doesn't have a majority. In case this proves difficult, the government may move an ordinance.
With Finance Minister Arun Jaitley shouldering a lighter administrative load after the reshuffle, negotiations on GST and talks with the Opposition on passing the insurance Bill to raise the foreign direct investment cap to 49% in the winter session will gather pace.
The government has already undertaken some big-ticket measures in the form of diesel price deregulation and an ordinance to sort out coal allocation. It is also expected to bite the bullet on rationalising other subsidies, including fertiliser, LPG and food, at the opportune time. The coal sector is expected to get a shakeup with a set of measures lined up.
Reforms in marketing and handling of farm produce through restructuring of the Food Corporation of India and changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act are expected to get a renewed push. In the light of court orders pertaining to coal mines and telecom spectrum, a cleanup of the allocation of natural resources by putting in place an e-auction system is being contemplated.
Road and railway projects are ready to be picked up by investors, which should help connect rural areas. This will also tie into the Digital India project to make sure more Indians get access to the Internet. People involved in the railway plan say the government is talking to unions to take them on board before selectively bringing in the private sector in areas such as running premium high-profit trains that can cross-subsidise general travel. The emphasis on rail has another dimension — its people connect.
Better trains, cleaner stations and baggage-handling facilities are in for special attention. Unlike other sectors, railways can absorb a great deal of investment without running into land or environment issues. On Sunday, Modi appointed trusted associate Suresh Prabhu as railway minister, seen as a statement of intent that it's of high priority for the prime minister .
"A lot is happening and the effect would be visible only in some time," said a senior government official. Economists said several steps are on the anvil but the effects will take a while to percolate through. "A number of things are happening and all of them will result in increase in efficiency in the economy. But how much quantum will this add to growth is difficult to say," said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
Handpicked officials have been placed in key ministries and the new ministers there could be much more visible than before. "Policy paralysis has been arrested," Joshi said. "They seem to be on the right track... From now till next budget we should watch for some big-ticket moves." Overall business sentiment that had soured in the past three years has turned around with the new government at the helm but investments are yet to pick up. Growth expanded by 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the fastest in two years, but revival is yet to take definitive hold.

G-20 Summit: Not Obama or Putin  but Modi emerges as most sought after leaderBarack Obama
(While Modi is expected to…)
NEW DELHI: It is not Barack Obama or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping or Shinzo Abe or Angela Merkel - leaders of the five most powerful countries of the world - who are most sought after at the East Asia and G-20 Summits. Instead it is Narendra Modi , elected to the high office only six months back, who has received maximum requests for bilateral meetings from his counterparts and heads of state on the sidelines of East Asia, ASEAN and G-20 Summits in Myanmar and Australia later this week.
South Block officials told ET that several slots have been reserved for Modi's bilateral interactions on the sidelines of the Summits in both Nay Pyi Taw and Brisbane following requests from several leaders who have expressed interest to meet the Indian PM. "As some of the leaders are common in East Asia Summit and G20, the schedule for Modi's meetings are being worked out depending on the itinerary of his counterparts," an official informed.
This is Modi's first outing in both East Asia and G20 Summit and understandably there's interest among other leaders to interact with him, sources claimed. "The interest is also due to the fact that these countries want to step up economic engagement with India and they sense an opportunity under the Modi government to increase trade and investments," an official indicated.
While Modi is expected to meet some leaders like Obama, Abe, Dilma Rouseff whom he had already met and Putin who is travelling to Delhi in December, the emphasis is on meeting leaders such as German Chancellor Merkel and former British PM Gordon Brown (in Brisbane) whom the PM has not met yet, sources indicated.
Besides, Modi could meet leaders of France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina and Nigeria in Brisbane on the sidelines of the G20 meet. Meeting with the Canadian PM, South Korean President and European Union leaders are also on the cards.
The bilateral meet with host Myanmarese President Thein Sein is expected on Tuesday after Modi's arrival in Nay Pyi Taw. This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh was there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar.

Bull market to continue  Nifty likely to hit 9 600 by December  15: UBSAdani Power Cipla Hero MotoCorp
(Nifty target of 9,600 is…)
NEW DELHI: Expressing its confidence in Indian equity markets for the year 2015, global investment bank, UBS in its latest report recommends a target of 9,600 on the Nifty by end-2015, which presents an upside of nearly 15 per cent from current levels.
"We remain bullish on Indian equities for the year 2015 the economic growth recovery is underway will likely sustain current valuations, especially if it starts manifesting in both macro (economic growth, inflation) and micro (corporate earnings) data points," said the global investment bank.
Unlike the last three years, UBS expects FY16 and FY17 earnings growth estimates of over 15 per cent to be met. Nifty target of 9,600 is based on top-down expectation of 15 per cent earnings growth in FY16E and 18 per cent growth in FY17E (on a base of 13% in FY15E), explains UBS.
If our expectations of the earnings growth recovery are not met (with only 10-12% growth in corporate earnings), and the market de-rates towards 14x one-year forward PE, the Nifty could decline to the 7,500 levels, said the report.
They expect only a gradual recovery from real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent in FY14 to 5.5 per cent in FY15E and 5.8 per cent in FY16E, vis-a-vis some of the more exuberant growth expectations among market participants.
UBS remains overweight on banks (private/PSU), oil and gas, power, telecom and media and is underweight on auto (2 wheeler) and consumer staples, while neutral on autos 4W and Cement.
We turn neutral on Consumer Discretionary and Pharmaceuticals (from UW), and on small- and mid-caps (from OW); and UW on IT Services (from neutral), said the report.
The most preferred stocks from UBS include names like Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank , LIC Housing Finance , Maruti Suzuki India, Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX), Oil & Natural Gas (ONGC), Power Grid, and Reliance Industries .
They least prefer Adani Power, Cipla, Hero MotoCorp , Hindustan Unilever, Infosys , Jubilant FoodWorks, and United Spirits.

Top telcos to retain credit profile despite ...4G-compatible handsets
(Fitch however warned that…)
NEW DELHI: The credit profiles of India's top four carriers - Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications - would remain intact in 2015, despite the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm, ratings agency Fitch said, adding six telcos would emerge from an expected industry shakeout.
A gradual rise in voice tariffs and improving regulatory environment stemming from industry consolidation will help incumbent operators maintain their respective positions, according to the report issued Tuesday.
The firm said that the likely entry of new Jio, which is a unit of Reliance Industries , in the first half of 2015 will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20%. The agency, however, said it does not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs.
Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents' core voice business, given a weak "voice-over-LTE" technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India, it added.
Fitch however warned that the outlook for private telcos could "turn negative should price-based competition return in the voice segment, which would narrow profitability," Fitch said.
The sector outlook could also turn negative if the Indian government auctions a smaller-than-expected quantity of telecom spectrum in 2015, which could lead to aggressive bidding by incumbents whose licences expire during 2015-2016. The government expects to auction airwaves in February 2015.
However, excluding the negatives, industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos' 2015 average operating margin will be mostly unchanged at 32% to 33% as compared to 32% in 2014 as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs.
The top four telcos will generate a minimal free cash flow (FCF) margin due to higher capex and flat EBITDA; the 2015 industry capex or revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investments, it said.
The outlook for nationally-owned telcos and weaker unprofitable telcos is negative due to their unviable business models, high cost structure, weak spectrum assets and large capex requirements. Weaker, unprofitable operators will seek mergers amid EBITDA losses, lack of 3G/4G spectrum assets, and likely relaxation of M&A restrictions.
Fitch said that six operators are likely to emerge from the industry shake-out, as 10 to 12 operators are unsustainable and expects the top four telcos to increase their revenue market share to around 83% as compared to 79% in 2014 of the $30-billion industry.
Fitch expects Bharti's 2015 funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage to improve due to an equity issue of $350-million by its tower subsidiary Bharti Infratel and its ability to generate $600 to-$700-mn in annual FCF .

Japanese shares outperform  crude oil continues to dropJapanese shares outperform, crude oil continues to drop
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Nov 11:  
Japanese shares outperformed in Asia on Tuesday, with the Nikkei stock average rising to a 7-year high as speculators snapped up futures and call options as they wagered that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may postpone a planned sales tax increase.
Some of that lustre, as well as fresh closing highs on Wall Street overnight for both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials, was seen rubbing off on European bourses.
“European equities are set to perk up on overnight gains in the US and Asia. Confidence in the US economy seems to be brushing off any domestic concerns and the bulls are running with it,’’ Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria said in a note.
Capital Spreads predicted Britain’s FTSE 100 would edge up 9 points or 0.1 per cent; France’s CAC 40 would open up 13 points or 0.3 per cent, and Germany’s DAX would open 20 points higher or 0.2 per cent.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan wavered between positive and negative territory and was last down about 0.2 per cent.
Nikkei stock average
Japan’s Nikkei stock average surged more than 2 per cent, brushing a 7-year high and extending gains as the yen turned lower in afternoon trade and futures jumped as investors pondered the possibility Abe may postpone a planned sales tax increase and call early elections.
Local media reported on Tuesday that Abe might call a snap vote before the end of the year if he decided to delay a planned hike in the national sales tax to 10 per cent from 8 per cent that is scheduled to take place in October 2015.
An April hike in the sales tax by three percentage points chilled consumption in the second quarter, driving the Japanese economy into its biggest slump since the global financial crisis.
Sentiment was also boosted by the Bank of Japan’s move on Monday to purchase ¥38 billion ($331.2 million) of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as part of its expanded economic stimulus steps. The news was announced after markets closed on Monday.
Current account surplus
Data released before the open showed Japan’s current account surplus rose more than expected in September from a year earlier, as income from investments overseas bolstered the balance of payments.
Chinese shares turned down 0.7 from a three-year high earlier in the session, a day after they surged 2.5 per cent on announcement of a deal that will give global investors easier access to China’s $3.9 trillion stock market.
Crude oil
Crude oil prices shrugged off concerns about conflicts in Libya and Ukraine and extended losses. Fears about a global supply glut and slowing growth have pushed oil prices down nearly 30 per cent since June. US crude shed about 0.4 percent to $77.10 per barrel, while Brent crude shed 0.3 percent to $82.08.
US Treasury prices slipped overnight, putting a solid floor under the dollar as yields ticked higher. US bond markets and government offices will be closed later on Tuesday in observance of the Veterans’ Day holiday, while other markets will trade.
The dollar added about 0.3 per cent on the day to 115.18 yen , moving back toward Friday's seven-year peak of 115.60.
The euro was steady on the day at $1.2424, holding above a two-year trough of $1.2358 touched on Friday, but strategists said the single currency remained vulnerable.
“Our global flows data showed selling by both hedge funds and real money accounts post ECB in near record amounts. With both sectors not yet approaching oversold territory, there should be further room for continued selling,’’ Citigroup's foreign exchange strategist Todd Elmer said in a note.
US payroll data
Investors had locked in gains on long dollar positions as Treasuries rose after headline US payroll figures on Friday fell short of high expectations. The report still provided evidence of solid improvement in employment conditions, and underscored the brighter US economic picture compared with Europe and Japan.
The Federal Reserve’s monthly labour market conditions index released on Monday showed an unchanged 4.0 level for October, which also allayed some concerns.
Diverging monetary policy outlooks between the Fed and both the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of Japan have lifted the dollar against its major rivals in recent weeks.
Spot gold was slightly higher at $1,151.25 an ounce after the previous session’s 2 per cent slide.

Victims seek $688 mn from Pakistan-based Mumbai attacks accusedVictims seek $688 mn from Pakistan-based Mumbai attacks accused
PTI

Washington, Nov 11:  
Nine American and Israeli victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks have demanded a compensation of $688 million from the Pakistan-based perpetrators of the terror assault, including JuD chief Hafiz Saeed.
In a re-submission before a New York court on October 30 and 31, the nine victims of the Mumbai attacks — from the US and Israel — argued for a “trial by jury” and “default judgement” against Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD)/ Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
They also argued for a “trial by jury” and “default judgement” against JuD chief Hafiz Saeed, LeT commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Sajid Majid, Azam Cheema and two other Pakistani nationals Major Iqbal and Major Sameer Ali.
According to their attorney, the request for “trial by jury”, “default judgement” and a “$688 million compensation” was filed before the Eastern District Court of New York after November 1, 2013, court summons were duly served to JuD/LeT and other defendants in Pakistan to which they did not respond.
The compensation has been sought by the family members of seven persons who were brutally killed by LeT terrorists and two others who were injured.
The 26/11 American and Israeli victims had first filed their case on November 19, 2010.
They had also sought action against ISI and its chief, but the court ruled that out after the US State Department told the court that they enjoyed diplomatic immunity as they were a part of a foreign government.
According to court papers, LeT, its leaders and other defendants were served with court summons and complaints.
But they have failed to answer or otherwise defend against this action, alleged the attorney on behalf of the 26/11 victims including Rabbi Shimon Rosenberg, father of Rifka Holtzberg who was murdered alongside her husband Rabbi Gabriel Holtzberg during the attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai.
Among others include Rabbi Nachman Holtzberg, father of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg who was killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.
Other plaintiffs are Moses Shvarzblat and Maribeth Jeswani on behalf of family members killed in the attacks.
Andreina Varagona, who survived after getting shot in her right arm and leg in the attack, sued on her own behalf.
As many as 166 people died and more than 300 were injured when 10 LeT terrorists carried out the attack on multiple locations in Mumbai, including the Oberoi Trident Hotel, the Taj Mahal Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, the Cama and Albless Hospital, the Metro Cinema, the CST Railway Station and the Chabad House.
In June, the US added LeT affiliates, including the JuD, to its list of designated terror organisations.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Crude oil futures fell 0.63 per cent to Rs 4,753 per barrel today as speculators trimmed positions amid a weak trend in Asian trade.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in November fell Rs 30 or 0.63 per cent to Rs 4,753 per barrel in 1,329 lots.
Besides, the oil for December delivery moved down by Rs 29 or 0.62 per cent to Rs 4,784 per barrel in 150 lots.
Analysts said the fall in crude oil prices at the futures trade was primarily after it ended losses in the Asian trade as the prospects of a production cut by the OPEC oil cartel dimmed, despite a global supply glut.
Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery shed 11 cents to $77.29, while Brent crude for December eased 22 cents to $82.12 a barrel in mid-morning trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

South Korean ferry captain gets 36-year prison sentencePrint
Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, on the bus, arrives for verdict and sentence session at Gwangju District Court in Gwangju, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. South Korean prosecutors on Monday, Oct. 27, 2014, demanded the death penalty for the captain of the ferry that sank in April, killing more than 300 people, and life sentences to three key crew members, a court official said. (Source: AP)
By: Press Trust of India | Seoul | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:01 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:47 pm
A South Korean court on Tuesday handed a 36-year prison sentence to the captain of a sunken ferry, saying he was professionally negligent and abandoned his passengers during the disaster in April that killed more than 300 people. The chief engineer got 30 years, and 13 other crew members were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, Yonhap news agency and other South Korean media reported, citing the Gwangju District Court in southern South Korea.
Captain Lee Joon-seok and three other key crew members were earlier indicted by prosecutors on homicide and other charges. Eleven others faced less serious charges. Lee has apologized for abandoning the passengers, but said he didn’t know his action would lead to so many deaths.
The Sewol ferry sank off South Korea’s southern coast in April with a loss of more than 300 lives. (Source: Reuters)
The widely vilified Lee could have received a death sentence for the homicide charges. South Korea hasn’t executed anyone since late 1997, though its courts occasionally issue the punishment. Prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal, according to the court.
Court officials didn’t immediately answer calls seeking confirmation. The 15 crew members tasked with navigating the ferry Sewol have faced scathing public criticism because they escaped the sinking ship while many of their passengers were still trapped inside. A total of 476 people were aboard the ship and only 172 were rescued. Most of the dead were teenage students traveling to a resort island on a school trip.
Nearly seven months after the sinking, 295 bodies have been recovered but nine are still missing. South Korean officials said today they’ve ended searches for the missing because there was only a remote chance of finding more bodies while worries have grown over the safety of divers. Two civilian divers have died after falling unconscious during searches.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
The German airline Lufthansa plans to start operating the world’s largest commercial aircraft, the Airbus A380, to Mumbai from summer next year.
In an informal chat with newspersons, Wolfgang Will, Director South Asia, said the airline plans to start flying the 380 between Mumbai and Frankfurt from July-August next year. The airline had earlier this week launched 380 flights between Frankfurt and Delhi.
The launch of the flight with the 380 to Delhi will see the airline offering 140 more seats a day from what was offered earlier. Similarly, the launch of the 380 to Mumbai will see the airline offer 170 more seats a day from what it offers at present.
Will also announced that the airline will offer premium economy seating to passengers flying between Bangalore and Frankfurt from November 22 this year. Premium economy is an upgraded economy class section, which Lufthansa launched globally this year.

RBI official: India on track to meeting inflation target of 8% by JanRBI official: India on track to meeting inflation target of 8% by Jan

Mumbai, Nov 11:  
India is well on track to meeting the central bank's inflation target of eight per cent by January 2015 and six per cent a year later, the RBI's Executive Director Deepak Mohanty said at a conference here this morning.
However, the Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to shift its focus from reining in prices until households' expectation of inflation falls, something which, Mohanty said, has not happened yet. He also said though the RBI had kept nominal rates sticky, real lending rates (after accounting for inflation) have remained low. Both factors make a rate cut in the RBI's monetary policy review in early December unlikely.
Low inflation is not an end in itself, Mohanty reiterated, and the central bank does intend to help the country on the path to sustainable growth. The bank's GDP growth expectation for the current fiscal year remains 5.5 per cent.

A well-conceived trade pact can open up opportunities for textile exporters'A well-conceived trade pact can open up opportunities for textile exporters'

Coimbatore, Nov 11:  
The Indian textile industry as well as the policy makers are too focused on export incentive scheme for export promotion. This does not augur well for the industry, particularly when WTO obligation will force India to phase out all its export incentives for the sector by end of 2015, notes corporate economic advisor - Ritesh Kumar Singh.
He spoke on the role of trade policy in pushing exports and safeguarding domestic markets threatened by ever-growing low priced imports from countries like Bangladesh and China.
Advising Texpreneurs (a forum formed by Tamil Nadu based textile entrepreneurs) against seeking such sops from the Government, Singh said “a well-conceived trade pact can open up opportunities on the textile export front, but a badly negotiated free trade pact can lead to unintended consequences,” citing SAFTA (Agreement on South Asia Free Trade Area).
Stating that the textile sector in India is a clear loser when it comes to trade with Bangladesh, he said: “it’s time India imposed some sourcing restrictions for permitting duty free import of garments from Bangladesh, as that country does not possess fabric manufacturing facilities. While this will help textile exports to Bangladesh, it will also check backdoor entry of Chinese fabrics to India via Bangladesh."
Highlighting the implication of Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) for textile export and import, he said “we are at a disadvantage with regard to tariff; notwithstanding this, exporters from TPP member countries such as Vietnam will get preferential access to the US market as compared to exporters from non-TPP countries like India, putting garments exports from India to the US in a difficult situation.”
“Similarly, the Yarn Forward Rule (YFR) makes it mandatory to source yarn, fabric and other inputs that are used in making clothes from TPP partner countries for availing duty preference. This will induce garment manufacturers in TPP countries to source their input from TPP countries, even if the suppliers in that region are not very efficient.”
“TPP therefore is going to be the biggest challenge for the Indian textile industry as US accounts for close to a-fourth of India’s apparel exports and because of duty disadvantage with Vietnam, post the trade pact,” he said and continued..
“And here we are focused on extracting more tax sops and subsidies for investment or exports. The key to survive in the long run would be to seek improved trade facilitation and basic infrastructure. India will have to phase out most of its export incentives (excepting may be – duty drawback and Textile Upgradation Fund Scheme) to comply with its commitment to WTO.”
“Nevertheless, all is not lost. There are a few potential markets such as Brazil in Mercosur region that remains untapped. Inclusion of textile items under India-Mercosur Preferential Trade Agreement can help India’s exports, as textile items face prohibitive import duties ranging from 26 per cent to 35 per cent in Mercosur countries,” Singh said and advised the Forum to seek Government help for providing marketing assistance to increase exports to Russia and other CIS countries.
D Prabhu, Secretary of Texpreneurs Forum, told BusinessLine that the Forum is in the process of submitting a report to the Central Government, based on Singh’s suggestion and advice.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) on Monday reported a 67.7 per cent surge in consolidated net profit at Rs 573.52 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, helped by strong cargo growth volume.
The company's net profit in the corresponding period of the previous 2013-14 financial year stood at Rs 341.83 crore, APSEZ said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
Commenting on the result Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said, "The results show the continuity of our growth trajectory and as a result each of our ports showing strong performance."
The multi-port operator's total income increased to Rs 1655.12  crore, from Rs 1149.88 crore in Q2 of FY14. Consolidated cargo handled  by the company was 35.18 MMT (million metric tonnes) in the reporting  quarter, registering an increase of 25 per cent over the corresponding  year-ago period. Adani ports at Mundra handled 26.57 MMT cargo in the  September-quarter of the 2014-15 fiscal.
The company's total  expenditure climbed up to Rs 837.03 crore as against Rs 576.73 crore in  the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
APSEZ Chief Executive Officer Sudipta Bhattacharya said, "We had a robust quarter with growth on our major cargo categories and we continue to maintain our volume at high level performance in our port business. Our focus is on leveraging the benefits through our pan-India presence and integrated logistics business."
The company further said that it has entered into a preliminary agreement with one of the parties for the development and maintenance of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure facilities at Mundra (Mundra LNG Project).
Adani Ports and the party are in the process of concluding definitive agreement for the Mundra LNG Project relating to development and lease of infrastructure facilities (including lease of land), the company said.

CIL inks 161 fuel supply pacts with power plantsCoal India signs 161 fuel supply pacts with power plants
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:54 IST
The Coal Ministry has said state-owned CIL has signed 161 fuel supply agreements (FSAs) for a capacity of 73,675 MW.
Following the CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) directions for signing of the FSAs with the projects with 78,000 mw capacity, out of the 172 FSAs covering 134 LoAs (Letter of Assurances), as on date, CIL ( Coal India Ltd ) has signed 161 FSAs for a capacity of 73, 675 MW, according to the latest official document.
The ministry further said there are 43 LoAs which were not covered within the 78,000 mw projects. Of this, 25 projects with a a capacity of 19,635 mw have already achieved their milestones. In nine cases, milestones are under verification or the matters are subjudice.
In the remaining 9 cases, one full LoA and one part LoA have been cancelled. However, in 4 full LoAs and one part LoA, CG (Commitment Guarantee) has been forfeited and matters are sub-judice.
In 3 LoAs, tapering linkage period has expired, the Ministry said. According to an official, the remaining fuel supply pacts could not be signed as some of power producers are yet to achieve milestones like forest clearances.
The coal ministry had earlier said CIL was yet to enter into fuel supply pacts with some of the power units as issues like change in ownership and extension of coal supplies were still being examined by it. Two deadlines set for the signing of FSAs by CIL with the power producers could not be adhered to. The government had set the deadline of August 31, 2013 for signing of FSAs, which could not be met.
The second deadline was set for September, last year. The company, which accounts for 80 per cent of the domestic coal production, dispatched 353.83 million tonnes (MT) of coal to the power sector in FY2014. CIL produced 462 MT in the last fiscal. It has targeted an output of 507 MT in the current fiscal.

Godrej Industries Ltd. (GIL), on Monday, reported a 2 per cent rise in net profit at Rs.95 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014. The company’s total income for the period rose by 13 per cent to Rs.2,360 crore and the operating profit was up 2 per cent at Rs.196 crore.
The company, which is in the businesses of oleochemicals, surfactants, finance and real estate development and agro products, saw a good performance in its agri products business despite a challenging environment. Godrej Agrovet reported 11 per cent growth in total income at Rs.1,071 crore and in profit before tax at Rs.79 crore.
Godrej Consumer Products saw India business grow 7 per cent while international business grew 12 per cent. Godrej Properties reported a 36 per cent growth in net profit. The chemicals business under GIL saw a 17 per cent rise in revenues and 10 per cent rise in profit before tax.
Speaking to this correspondent, Godrej Industries Chairman Adi Godrej felt the worst was over for the Indian economy. “The second half performance of companies will be better and there is a big revival in consumer off-take since September 2014. This is largely on the back of softening of commodity prices with softening crude oil prices. This is likely to sustain going forward.”

Fresh restrictions on babus  overseas toursGovt imposes fresh restrictions on overseas travels by babus
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 21:39 IST
The government on Monday imposed fresh curbs on foreign tours by bureaucrats saying that they should restrict their overseas visits to four in a year.
No officer should undertake more than four official visits abroad in a calendar year. For visits exceeding four by an officer, detailed justification would need to be furnished and such visits would be allowed only in exceptional cases depending on functional need, said an official order.
The order further stipulates that travel expenses for officials for participating in conferences, study tours and presentation of papers should be borne by the sponsors.
Proposals for participation in conferences/seminars/ conventions/workshop/study tours/presentation of papers abroad at government cost will not be entertained except those that are fully funded by sponsoring/inviting organisations which may be considered keeping in mind the public interest and the government business at home, the order said.
It said that the size of the delegation and the duration of the visit should be kept at absolute minimum. As regards the foreign visits by Secretary level officers, it said they should not go abroad unless their presence is essential and the officers of the level of Additional Secretary or Joint Secretary cannot be substituted for them.
Foreign travel by the officers at the expense of PSUs, it said, should be discouraged, unless the journey is undertaken specifically in connection with the affairs of the concerned PSU.
Wherever the expenditure on the visit of the government officials is borne by PSUs, the entitlements of the officers shall remain as his entitlements under the Government rules, the order said. The government had last month banned first class air travel by officers and asked them to effectively use videoconferencing facility. It had also asked them to keep their travel expenses within the budgetary limit.

Israeli soldier and woman stabbed to death by PalestiniansParamedics treat an Israeli soldier after he was stabbed in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday. (Source: AP photo)
By: Reuters | Jerusalem | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:34 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:52 am
An Israeli soldier and a woman were stabbed to death by Palestinians in Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank on Monday, extending a surge in violence fuelled by strife over access to Jerusalem’s holiest site.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to crush “terror being directed at all parts of the country” – remarks appearing to clash with Israeli security chiefs’ assertions that the tumult did not yet spell a new Intifada, or Palestinian revolt.
The soldier’s stabbing at a train station in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial capital, brought bloodshed to a city that has largely been spared since the last uprising died down in 2005. Police identified the suspected assailant, who was arrested, as a West Bank resident who was in Israel illegally and had no criminal record there.
Hours later, a Palestinian stormed out of a car to stab an Israeli woman to death and wound two other people outside the Jewish settlement of Alon Shvut in the West Bank, police said.

The attacker was shot and wounded by a guard, they added. The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed him as one of its own and an Israeli security official said he had been jailed between 2000 and 2005 for a petrol bomb attack.
Tension has risen anew over Israeli-controlled access to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam’s third holiest site, where biblical Jewish temples once stood.
Stone-throwing protests have erupted in several Arab towns in Israel since Saturday, when police killed an Arab youth who assaulted them. Last week, a Palestinian rammed his car into pedestrians in central Jerusalem, the second such incident in as many weeks, killing two Israelis. Police shot the driver dead.
There was no immediate comment on Monday’s stabbings from the U.S.-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which is based in the West Bank, whose peace talks with the Netanyahu government collapsed in April.
Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group with de facto control over the Gaza Strip, where it fought a war with Israeli forces in July and August, hailed the attacks as “a response to crimes conducted by the occupation (Israel) in Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa”.
Israel refers to the Al-Aqsa compound as the Temple Mount and some Jewish nationalists have been stepping up demands to pray there, infuriating Palestinians despite Netanyahu’s repeated vow to maintain a decades-old arrangement with Jordan – the compound’s custodian since 1924 – that only Muslims may worship there.
Speaking in parliament, Netanyahu said “terror … is being directed at all parts continued…

(“To remove him from a portfolio…)
NEW DELHI: Harsh Vardhan had no inkling that he was being shifted from the health ministry even on Sunday night, though he had met party president Amit Shah a few hours ahead of the formal announcement of portfolios, according to his political aides and friends. "To remove him from a portfolio that is his forte means that the PM was unhappy with him. Why would you embarrass someone like this before sending him back to state politics?" said a BJP leader in Delhi considered close to Harsh Vardhan.
His 'slow delivery' on the Modi's key promise of National Health Assurance — affordable preventive checkups, free drugs and insurance for all — diagnostic checkups was a big factor.
Even though an expert panel appointed by Vardhan for drafting the broad contours of the National Health Assurance had submitted its report on September 15, his ministry did not make any progress in finalising the proposal.
His aides say Vardhan was let down by the bureaucracy. RSS wasn't too happy with him either as they felt they lost communication with him after he was appointed as minister. "The lack of access rubbed RSS the wrong way," a BJP state leader said.

South Korean ferry captain gets 36 years in prison

Captain Lee Joon-seok
(Captain Lee Joon-seok and…)
GWANGJU: The captain of the South Korean ferry that sank in April with the loss of more than 300 lives was jailed for 36 years today, but acquitted of murdering those who died in the disaster.
In a ruling that followed five months of dramatic, often painful trial testimony, a three-judge court said prosecutors, who had demanded the death penalty, failed to prove that the Sewol's captain Lee Jun-Seok, 69, had acted with an intention to kill.
However, he was convicted of gross negligence and dereliction of duty, including abandoning his vessel while hundreds of passengers -- most of them schoolchildren -- remained trapped on board.
Victims' relatives who were present in the courtroom in the southern city of Gwangju, reacted furiously to the murder acquittal.
"Where is the justice?" one woman shouted at the judges, while others wept openly.
"It's not fair. What about the lives of our children? They (the defendants) deserve worse than death," screamed another.
Three other senior crew members, who had also faced homicide charges, were sentenced to jail terms of between 15 and 30 years.
"We find it hard to conclude that the defendants ... were aware that all of the victims would die because of their actions," Judge Lim Joung-Youb said in announcing the verdict.
"Therefore the murder charges are not accepted." However, Lim stressed that had Lee and his crew acted properly as soon as the Sewol ran into trouble, then many lives might have been saved.
"They did not honor their responsibility to protect passengers and abandoned them. As a result, countless lives were lost," he said.
Lee and his crew were publicly vilified in the wake of the April 16 disaster and some legal experts had raised doubts over whether they would receive a fair hearing.
South Korean media coverage was often coloured by a presumption of guilt and before the trial even began President Park Geun-Hye publicly stated that the crew's actions had been "tantamount to murder".
As well as abandoning the ship, they were condemned for instructing passengers to remain where they were as the vessel began to list dangerously.

India may pip China in VC invstment this qua...India may pip China in venture capital invstment this quarter
By Shilpa Phadnis & Sujit John, TNN | 11 Nov, 2014, 11.48AM IST
In the first two quarters of 2014, investments into China were three times more than that into India. But in the third quarter, India's stood at $1,397 million.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BENGALURU: India could overtake China in the final quarter of this calendar year in the amount of technology investments committed by venture capital and private equity firms.
In the July-September quarter, India significantly narrowed the gap with China, and now, in the final quarter, with $837 million already committed by Japan's Softbank to Snapdeal and Ola, it is possible that the amount of investments committed to India will be higher than that to China.
Research firm CB Insights, which put together the data, notes that Softbank's initial commitment is part of a $10 billion investment that it plans in India, and goes on to ask: "With all the attention India is getting from investors, is the technology balance of power shifting within Asia from China to India?"
In the first two quarters of 2014, investments into China were three times more than that into India. But in the third quarter, India's stood at $1,397 million, compared to China's $1,965 million, says CB Insights. Much of India's figure was on account of one deal -- the $1 billion funding that Flipkart raised in July. But the subsequent announcement from Softbank suggests that the Flipkart deal may not be a one-off, and the coming quarters might see an acceleration in investments.
Monday's news, reported by TOI, that Flipkart is looking for a fresh round of funding of about $1 billion makes the "shift towards India" argument more plausible, though Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi is also reportedly looking to raise some $1.5 billion in a new round of funding, and if successful, will be the largest VC investment generated by a Chinese company.
In an article in September, CB Insights had noted that Sequoia, one of the biggest investors in the region, has over the past two years stepped up its investments in India and Israel while becoming relatively less active in China. It said that in 2012 & 2013, India accounted for 38% of deal volumes and China 36%; in 2010 & 2011, the deal volume was dominated by China, with a 54% share; India was 29%.
Venkatesh Peddi, VP in IDG Ventures India Advisors, said funding activity in India had increased tremendously in the recent past. "Many limited partners are investing in India funds. Even international funds are making huge allocations towards India that shows renewed investor confidence in the technology space. So far, we have seen a sizeable interest in the seed and angel rounds, but we expect it to percolate into Series B, C and E rounds. There is willingness from global funds to increase the India allocation as consumer internet companies are leading the charge," Peddi said.
Sharad Sharma, co-founder of software product association iSpirt, noted that a large number of Chinese companies had gone public. "They can do an IPO very easily, like Alibaba did recently, so they may be less reliant on private capital," he said.
CB Insights data finds that India dominates the seed/angel rounds, with 113 deals being made since the first quarter of 2013 compared to the 48 made in China. But China dominates across the other rounds --Series A through Series D (mid-stage). "India has slightly more deals in Series E+ rounds, with notable deals including Myntra, Quikr, and Snapdeal," the report says.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Following directions from Prime Minister's Office, the road transport ministry has set four higher efficiency parameters for itself, including the target to award more national highway (NH) projects. The target that has been set for this fiscal is over two-and-a-half times more than 2013-14 achievement - from 8.7 km per day to 23.3 km per day.
The target for construction has also been pushed up by almost 50%. While during last financial year the ministry and its agencies including NHAI could complete only 11.7 km per day, it aims to build 6,300 km by March end. This comes to daily construction of about 17.3 km. Sources said it's a tough target, considering the fact that till October only 1,984 km could be built.
"We are pushing for more awards of projects and there is a huge improvement in the past one-and-a-half months as private players are getting projects on government funding mode. On the construction front, monitoring has been improved," said a road transport ministry official.
Another identified efficiency parameter is to bring 100% of plazas on NHs under the electronic toll collection (ETC) mode by the end of this financial year. This means over 10 times the target in comparison to last year. Recently, the ministry had a mega launch of the "Fastags", an interoperable smart tag across all toll plazas. Similarly, the ministry has set the target to reduce road deaths by 2000. In 2013, road fatalities were only 686 less than the previous year.

Not just Flipkart  Wipro Consumer sees a bil...Andhra Pradesh
(Wipro Consumer Care &…)
BENGALURU: Wipro's consumer care and lighting business could end this fiscal year with $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in revenue, as the privately-held company expects the Narendra Modi-led government's promised reforms to start reflecting on the ground, leading to a better second-half of the year for the company.
Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting, which reported a little more than Rs 5,000 crore in revenue in the year ended March 2014, saw a 25% growth in revenue in the quarter ended September, according to a senior company executive. "We did 11% volume growth (in the second quarter)," said Vineet Agrawal, president, Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting, adding that revenue grew 25% in that period on account of the 10-11% price hikes the company undertook.
This growth will be the envy of some of the goliaths, including Hindustan Unilever that saw a 5% growth in volume and homegrown Dabur that saw volume growing at less than 9% in the July-September period.
Significantly, four states—Karnata ka, Andhra Pradesh , Maharashtra and Gujarat--account for over 70% of the company's topline, while the com pany generates 53% of business from overseas, including China, Indonesia and Malaysia. Since a large chunk of revenues are accounted from interna tional markets, Agrawal shies away from putting a number because a cur rency depreciation could prove to be the biggest spanner in the company's e growth. Nonetheless, he remains opis timistic that the Modi government 0 will walk the talk and release money yfor the pending projects, thereby giv a ing a boost to discretionary spending.e "The bigger struggle for now is liq uidity. The money (is stuck) with our traders and distributors.Earlier, if they paid me in 60 days, now they pay me in 90 days," said Agrawal.
The fast-moving consumer sector growth has halved to 9% in 2013 from 18% in 2012 with some experts penciling-in a lower growth for this year on account of "uneven demand", hurt by belownormal monsoon, higher competition among companies and lower economic growth leading to less increments.
"Multiple reasons (including) Intensification of competition among firms, food inflation, lower monsoon and low increments suggest that growth for the sector as a whole will be lower this year," said Devangshu Dutta founder of Third Eyesight, a Delhi-based consultancy .
"So, against that backdrop, Wipro Consumer story is heartening. A lot of this success is also on account of overseas acquisitions made by the company . Also, because in the last few years, the company has tried to reposition itself."
Wipro's lighting and furniture business accounts for 18-19% of the company's domestic sales of about Rs . 2,400 crore. It recorded a 14% growth during the second quarter. Although Wipro consumer's two brands account for a large share of revenues, with Santoor alone bringing in 25% business and Yardley accounting for another 15%, Agrawal dismissed any talks of skating on thin ice.
"It is our strength. I would not like to have seven brands which each have a 5% share. For the simple reason, if you are not big, you cannot be profitable, you cannot defend or be aggressive," he said.
The management also believes that India could soon see a lot of more white goods being sold through ecommerce sites as the smartphone penetration increases. In China, which accounts for about 15% of its . 2,600 crore business from overseas Rs markets, Wipro Consumer generates 9% business from internet users.
In India, like in Indonesia and Malaysia, Wipro Consumer currently generates less than 1% of overall business from e-commerce sites.

Portfolios allocation to be done by weekend: Goa CM LaxmikantParsekarPrint
Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said that he would retain majority of portfolios which were with his predecessor.

Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar will expand his cabinet and allocate portfolios to his ministers during this weekend.
Portfolios would be allocated by Saturday after consulting former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Parsekar said here on Tuesday.
Parsekar was inducted as chief minister last Saturday after Parrikar took over as the new Union Defence Minister.
Nine others were also sworn in as ministers.
The government is yet to fill two more posts to make the entire cabinet of 12 ministers.
He said that he would retain majority of portfolios which were with his predecessor.
“All the portfolios which are crucial for functioning of the chief minister will be retained by me,” he said, adding, he would decentralise the entire functioning of the government.
“I will not interfere in the functioning of their (ministers) ministries. They will have all right to function the way they want. I will be just guiding them,” Parsekar said, hinting at Parrikar’s style of working, who was accused of wielding control over all the ministries.

China-India Development Fund looks to park Rs 30 000 crore in Indias infraprojectsChina-India Development Fund, amounting to $ 5 billion , has been launched for possible investments in infrastructure projects in India. (Reuters)

A private equity fund, christened as China-India Development Fund, amounting to USD 5 billion (over Rs 30,000 crore), has been launched for possible investments in infrastructure projects in India. Over Rs 6000 crore of this fund is expected to flow into Gujarat, official sources said on Tuesday.
The fund launched by Shanghai Entrepreneur Association (SEA) has the support of China India Trade & Investment Centre (CITIC), stated a release from CITIC here.
“Large infrastructure projects in India are not able to find adequate funding. In such a scenario, this fund will help provide the necessary finance. The SEA which has over 100 entrepreneurs is now looking for Indian partners which whom they can cooperate in various ways including joint venture participation for rail, highway, smart city and new city development projects,” said Jagat Shah, secretary general CITIC.
“The USD 5 billion is a private equity fund and we expect USD one billion to come to projects in Gujarat,” Shah told The Indian Express.
The China India Development Fund is looking to invest in Tran-state highways, inter-state highways, city ring-roads, transportation hubs, high-speed railways, international sea ports, airport construction, container wharf, iron ore wharf, satellite cities, industrial and logistic zones and real-estate.
SEA has over 100 entrepreneurs and where the leading company is Shanghai Pengxin Group which has more than 40 subsidiary companies with total assets reaching over 10 billion RMB (Renminbi).

Inflation in India seen cooling further in Oct  may not budgeRBIPrint
By: Reuters | Banglore | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:47 pm
Indian inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India.
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 percent in October.
If the forecast is met, it will be even lower than September’s 6.46 percent and the slowest pace of price rises since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
It would also make the RBI’s inflation targets – 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent a year later – appear more attainable.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 percent in October from September’s 2.38 percent, the Reuters poll showed. This data will be released on Friday.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 percent of the CPI basket, and Capital Economics’ India economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
“Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards,” Shah said.
The poll also predicted industrial production to have increased a meager 0.6 percent in September, albeit better than August’s 0.4 percent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply Asia’s third-largest economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth.
“Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect,” Shah said.
He said the RBI could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 percent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the RBI may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
“These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation – a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December,” said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
“But the RBI is unlikely to oblige.”
It will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March, after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the RBI to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 percent well into next year, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

Alert customers in high value cheque payments: RBI to banksRBI asks banks to alert customers in high value cheque payments
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 5, 2014  | 20:02 IST

To clamp down on cheque-related fraud cases, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday asked banks to alert account holders by a phone call and contact the base branch in case of non-home cheques before clearing high value payments.
The RBI also asked banks to send an SMS alert to payer/drawer when cheques are received for clearing and examine cheques under UV lamp for clearance beyond Rs 2 lakh.
The central bank further said multi-level checking should be done before clearing cheques above Rs 5 lakh.
"Banks may consider the following preventive measures for dealing with suspicious or large value cheques: Alerting the customer by a phone call and getting the confirmation from the payer/drawer and contacting base branch in case of non-home cheques," RBI said in a communication to banks.
The RBI said directions have been issued in the wake of a rise in the number of cheque-related fraud cases. It said cases have been reported where even though original cheques were in the custody of account holders cheques in the same series were presented and encashed by fraudsters.
The RBI said banks may resort to given directions selectively, if not feasible to be implemented systematically.
It further asked banks to take appropriate precautionary measures to ensure that the confidential information are neither compromised nor misused either from the bank or from the vendors' side.
"Due care and secure handling is also to be exercised in the movement of cheques from the time they are tendered over the counters or dropped in the collection boxes by customers."
Besides, it also asked banks to ensure usage of CTS-2010 compliant cheques, strengthen infrastructure for cheque handling, KYC compliancy, close monitoring of credits and debits in newly opened accounts.
The central bank said such frauds could have been avoided had due diligence been observed at the time of handling or processing of the cheques.
"Banks are, therefore, advised to review and strengthen the controls in the cheque presenting/passing and account monitoring processes and to ensure that all procedural guidelines including preventive measures are followed meticulously by the dealing staff," RBI said.

CERN may not have discovered elusive Higgs Boson‘CERN may not have discovered elusive Higgs Boson’

London, Nov 9:  
The elusive Higgs boson may not have been discovered despite claims of it being detected last year, according to a new study.
Many calculations indicate that the particle discovered last year in the CERN particle accelerator in Switzerland was indeed the famous Higgs particle.
Physicists agree that the CERN experiments did find a new particle that had never been seen before, but according to an international research team, there is no conclusive evidence that the particle was indeed the Higgs particle.
The research team has scrutinised the existing scientific data from CERN about the newfound particle and published their analysis in the journal Physical Review D.
“The CERN data is generally taken as evidence that the particle is the Higgs particle. It is true that the Higgs particle can explain the data but there can be other explanations, we would also get this data from other particles,” said Mads Toudal Frandsen, associate professor at the Centre for Cosmology and Particle Physics Phenomenology, Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy at the University of Southern Denmark.
The researchers’ analysis does not debunk the possibility that CERN has discovered the Higgs particle. That is still possible — but it is equally possible that it is a different kind of particle.
“The current data is not precise enough to determine exactly what the particle is. It could be a number of other known particles,” said Frandsen.
“We believe that it may be a so-called techni-higgs particle. This particle is in some ways similar to the Higgs particle — hence half of the name,” Frandsen added.
Although the techni-higgs particle and Higgs particle can easily be confused in experiments, they are two very different particles belonging to two very different theories of how the universe was created, researchers said.
The Higgs particle is the missing piece in the theory called the Standard Model. This theory describes three of the four forces of nature.
“A techni-higgs particle is not an elementary particle.
Instead, it consists of so-called techni-quarks, which we believe are elementary.
“Techni-quarks may bind together in various ways to form for instance techni-higgs particles, while other combinations may form dark matter. We therefore expect to find several different particles at the LHC, all built by ‘CERN may not have discovered elusive Higgs Boson’ ,” said Frandsen.
If techni-quarks exist, there must be a force to bind them together so that they can form particles. None of the four known forces of nature (gravity, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force) are any good at binding techni-quarks together.
There must therefore be a yet undiscovered force of nature. This force is called the the technicolor force, researchers said.

Fair play and e-commerceelectronic commerce
Still struggling to evolve, this nascent industry has been in news for a variety of reasons. For one, this ‘intangible’ sector has suddenly been witness to a few high profile disproportionate investments. For another, it has also come under intense public scrutiny in the wake of a technical glitch-induced sale fiasco faced by an online marketplace. Coming as it does against these backdrops, New Delhi’s move to push for a fresh tax regime for global e-commerce companies assumes considerable significance.
Surely, the demand merits serious consideration, especially since these global firms run their operations through a web of complicated structures that aren’t easy to decipher. The Indian initiative comes ahead of the G20 meeting in Brisbane. And, the timing of its demand is not lost on the international trade watchers. After all, the leaders of G20 are gathering in Brisbane to discuss the establishment of a new international tax regime that will leave little room for smart multi-national firms to skirt levies. E-commerce, especially, poses a new challenge to taxmen across the globe as its activities cut across borders, and impact differently the economies of countries.
In India, e-commerce is still an unclear arena. Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, however, have ensured that this industry hogs considerable column space in the print media. Competitive investment announcements of hitherto unheard of size in the domestic context, no doubt, signals the importance of India as a new investment destination especially in the e-commerce space. Indeed, this vote of confidence is a moment of joy and elation. Yet, one needs to be cautious in jumping to any quick conclusion.
It will be in the fitness of things to remember that these e-tailers, who have seen huge fund flows in the recent past, are essentially market places (where they provide a web-based platform for vendors to congregate in a virtual space - like a typical Mandi in village-parlance – and offer their products for sale). They have opted for marketplace model so as to seemingly conform to the policy prescriptions. This is the result of a general policy articulation i.e. e-commerce cannot be back-door entry into multi-brand retail.
Given this generic policy prescription, one is not quite sure how people put so much money into an online marketplace. Can their marketplace only activity justify the kind of money they attract? Do they have robust business model that could reward the expectation of such big ticket investors? These and several other questions beg convincing answers. Not just the e-tailers but the policy planners at the government level, too, need to clear many a misgiving.
Are we going to play only a reactive role in e-commerce field? Have we got ourselves entangled in a web by letting the marketplace model? Questions have already been raised on our policy approach to e-commerce. As the industry grows – as it is bound to, given the convenience and competitiveness it offers to consumers – and e-tailers turn innovative and smart, tensions are sure to surface between stakeholders. In that scenario, laws as applicable at the moment will be differently interpreted to the convenience of individual participants. It is precisely for this reason that there is an urgent need for putting upfront a comprehensive and all-encompassing policy framework that defines eligibility, rights, privileges and responsibilities of multiple players and stake-holders across the e-commerce chain.
Still a largely undefined space, e-commerce in India falls under multiple ministries. A host of government arms – from commerce to finance ministries and state administrations – try one way or the other to control the e-commerce industry. It is time e-commerce was brought under a unified authority, especially in view of the huge money coming into this space in such a short period.
Given the size of its population, and given the young profile of its content, India will be well served with a robust e-ecommerce structure. Its demand for a new international tax order for e-commerce companies, perhaps, indicates the shape of things to come in the Indian e-commerce industry.

Samsung to build $3 billion smartphone plant in VietnamSamsung Electronics to build USD 3 bn smartphone plant in Vietnam
Ho Binh Minh     Hanoi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:08 IST

Samsung Electronics has applied for a licence to invest $3 billion in building a second smartphone factory in northern Vietnam.
Samsung Electronics Vietnam plans to build the factory in Thai Nguyen province, where it opened a $2 billion smartphone plant in March, said a senior official at the province's Planning and Investment Department.
"We are working on the project," said the official, confirming an earlier report by Dau Tu, a newspaper controlled by Vietnam's Planning and Investment Ministry. "There are still a few things to fix."
The official was not authorised to speak to media on the matter and so declined to be identified by name. Officials at Samsung Electronics in Vietnam and South Korea declined to comment.
Samsung has been increasing production in Vietnam to reduce costs and better compete with the low-priced smartphones of Chinese rivals in particular.
The company's latest move would bring its total investment pledges in Vietnam this year to around $11 billion, according to Dau Tu newspaper, whose controlling ministry oversees foreign investment.
Mobile phones and accessories became Vietnam's biggest cash earner last year, taking over textiles. In January-October this year, export revenue reached $19.2 billion, or around 15 per cent of the country's total.
Samsung's first smartphone plant in Vietnam, built with an investment of $2 billion, generated $1.9 billion in export revenue in its first four months of operation, according to the Thai Nguyen provincial government.
The government, in a statement earlier this month, said the company's total revenue is expected to jump more than 67 per cent to $13.4 billion next year from $8 billion projected for 2014.

Pentagon wants an airborne aircraft carrier for dronesBy Dan Lamothe November 10 Follow @danlamothe
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency released this artist’s rendering to show its vision for a future aircraft carrier in the sky, capable of launching and recovering numerous drone aircraft while in flight. (DARPA image)
In the 2012 movie “The Avengers,” Captain America, the Hulk, Iron Man and the rest of the gang flew on a massive aircraft carrier that carried dozens of planes through the air and disappeared from plain view with the help of a cloaking device. The idea that the U.S. military could develop something similar is still seen as far-fetched , but this much is true: a Pentagon agency has just launched a new effort to develop an airship sure to draw comparisons.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is exploring whether it would be possible to turn an existing plane into a flying fortress capable of launching and recovering numerous drone aircraft. Doing so would extend the range of drones that gather intelligence and perform other missions while saving money and limiting the risks pilots take, DARPA officials said Sunday .
“We want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective, and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft, with minimal modification, to become ‘aircraft carriers in the sky,’” said Dan Patt a DARPA program manager. “We envision innovative launch and recovery concepts for new [unmanned aerial system] designs that would couple with recent advances in small payload design and collaborative technologies.”
Unlike the Avengers’ heli-carrier, DARPA’s sky-carrier would likely use a plane like the B-52 Stratofortress bomber, B-1B Lancer bomber or C-130 Hercules cargo plane, according to a request for information released by the agency on Friday . Companies, universities and other organizations interested in participating must submit ideas by Nov. 26 and include “system-level conceptual designs,” including a feasibility analysis.
DARPA also left open the possibility “missile-based approaches” to launching drones in its request for information, and says those interested should provide a sense for how many drones could be launched.
It’s not the first time that the U.S. military has dabbled with sky-carriers. In the 1930s, for example, the U.S. Navy launched Sparrowhawk biplanes from helium-filled rigid dirigibles built by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Company. This video shows how they were recovered:
The two airships that launched planes, the USS Akron and USS Macon, both experienced catastrophic crashes. The Akron crashed in 1933 off the coast of New Jersey, killing 73 of 76 men on board, according to the Navy Historical Center . The Macon crashed two years later off the coast of California. Most of the service members on board survived, but the dirigible sank “effectively ending the Navy’s controversial, and trouble-plagued, program of rigid airship operations,” Navy officials said .
More recently, the Air Force investigated whether it could use a 747 jet as an aircraft carrier, commissioning a report from Boeing. The defense contractor sketched a concept in which part of the plane would be hollowed out, and “micro-fighters” would be developed to fit inside, according to briefing slides later released by the military .

Draft civil aviation policy looks to enhance regional air connectivity
The NDA government’s new draft policy on civil aviation proposes enhanced regional air connectivity, rationalisation of jet fuel costs along with broader institutional reforms like corporatisation of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and development of a road map for Air India’s future.
The policy, unveiled by Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju here on Monday, proposes listing AAI and Pawan Hans Helicopters on stock exchanges.
The markets reacted favourably to the proposals with stocks of Jet Airways and SpiceJet surging to 6.82 percent and 5.02 per cent respectively.
Mr. Raju, while clarifying that national carrier Air India would not be privatised anytime soon, did not rule out the move for the future.
An expert committee will be constituted to develop a road map for Air India,” the draft policy says. According to it, airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore are to be developed into “major international hubs” to serve as the main access points for international travel.
More airports to be developed in PPP mode
The Modi government, with a strong focus on infrastructure development, will be developing more airports in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The airports in Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Jaipur are to be developed in the first phase.
Currently, the Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports are being operated in the PPP mode as joint ventures with private companies.
Noting that high tax rates have pushed Aviation Turbine Fuel costs 40 to 45 per cent higher than international levels, the draft civil aviation policy says the Ministry will be undertaking rationalisation of ATF costs, in consultation with the Finance Ministry and State governments.
India currently has 132 airports, of which 46 domestic and 15 international airports are run by the AAI; 31 are not operational while the remaining are civil enclaves in defence or customs airports.
The policy hints at a special package to boost air connectivity in the North-Eastern region, along with enhancing regional air connectivity across the country in general.
Another significant area the policy aims to address is attracting investment to the $700 million Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) industry by providing land and other incentives.
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), every 100 rupees spent on air travel results in benefits worth Rs. 325 while a 100 jobs in the aviation sector create 610 jobs in the economy overall.

LKG student molested in Kolkata  school faces protestsPrint
By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:21 am
An LKG student of a reputed south Kolkata school was allegedly molested on November 3. The incident took place when children from G D Birla Centre for Education of Ranikuthi were participating in a cultural programme along with students of two other schools at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.
According to the complaint, the six-year-old girl was molested on her way to washroom by the driver and the helper of a Volvo bus, hired by the school to ferry the students to the venue. The child had complained about the incident to the school maid, who earlier had asked the accused to accompany her to the washroom. She, however, did not pay heed to it, police said.
When the girl returned home, she was bleeding profusely and had to be treated at a private hospital. Her parents met the school authorities with a medical report of the child the next day, but the school allegedly tried to hush up the incident on the grounds that it might tarnish the school’s reputation and also affect the child’s future.
The school authorities had assured the parents of an internal inquiry into the incident and allegedly asked them not to file a police complaint. The authorities, however, did not take any action against the accused, forcing the several parents to protest in front of the school on Monday morning. Initially, the school refused the allegations, but later conceded that such an incident was reported to them.
Vijaya Bharadwaj, vice principal of the school, said, “The aayah (maid) has been suspended, and police have been intimated about the incident. We are also carrying out an internal inquiry.” A press statement later issued by the school said it had conducted a thorough internal probe to identify the offender, but the allegations were found “contradictory”. “The school management is and will continue to extend full cooperation. The school is also making extra security arrangement in all the buses,” it said.
The school authorities also said the matter had been brought to the notice of officials of Jadavpur Police Station. Santosh Pandey, DC (south suburban division) said, “We have started an inquiry. We hope there will be an identification within two days.”
State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said he had sought a complete report of the incident from the school authorities.

New Delhi has been ranked 25th among the world’s ‘Most Fun’ cities with Germany’s capital Berlin topping the survey.
New Delhi, the only Indian city to make the top 25 cut, was chosen among over 1,800 cities surveyed across the globe.
The Indian capital ranked high for its sports clubs, shopping and bars in ‘The Ultimate Fun City Ranking’ report commissioned by ‘GetYourOwnGuide’ and ‘GoEuro’ travel firms.
The two firms compiled data on 11 factors like nightlife, average beer price and entertainment options to define what exactly makes a city fun for travellers of different age groups and interests. Of the total 1,830 cities, Berlin topped the rankings for its all-round attractiveness of bars and museums, followed by London, Paris, New York and Tokyo.
The online consolidated data-provider service for travellers across Europe was founded by Indian entrepreneur Naren Shaam around two years ago.

8 women dead  25 critical after Chhattisgarh sterilisation campEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Sulemani Keeda review by Anupama Chopra: It's lovely but narrow
Sulemani Keeda means 'a bug so big that it’s a pain in the ass'. Or at least that’s how writer-director Amit V Masurkar describes his film’s title. The set-up and characters are promising but Sulemani Keeda never becomes more than the sum of its parts because it’s too thin.

NSUI leader  who self immolated himself  dies at SafadarjanghospitalPrint
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:42 pm
NSUI leader Rohit Pandey, who received burn injuries after self immolating himself at Ramanagar in Nainital on November 4, died at Safadarjang hospital in Delhi late on Monday evening. His body is expected to reach Ramnagar by today evening. The Uttarakhand government has ordered a CID probe in the case.
Rohit had self immolated himself allegedly in protest against the implication of his NSUI colleagues in a case of arson. “Rohit died at Safadarjang hospital in Delhi on Monday evening. His body would be brought to Ramnagar by today evening,” Kumayun range DIG G S Martolia told IE on phone.
Meanwhile, additional forces have been rushed to Ramnagar to keep the situation under control. Government has also asked the additional director general of police R S Meena to camp at Ramanagar.
On Monday afternoon, the state government had transferred Nainital’s district magistrate Akshat Gupta and SSP Vimmi Sachdeva.
Earlier on November 4, NSUI leader Rohit had attempted to commit suicide by self immolating himself at Ramnagar in Nainital. Rohit was allegedly unhappy with the police decision to lodge a case of arson against his few NSUI colleagues. Rohit had received more than 50 per cent burn injuries.
On November 2, five NSUI leaders were booked on the charge of their alleged involvement in torching two bikes parked near ABVP office at Maldhan in Nainital district during Students’ Union polls. NSUI had demanded transfer of SHO of Ramnagar police station.

Small investors drive big gains inmarketsPrint
Posted: November 11, 2014 1:29 pm
Small investors are known to arrive late to the party. Whether they’re early enough for this bull rally, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they’re certainly making their presence felt in the market — retail turnover as a share of the total cash turnover on the two
bourses, NSE and BSE, surged to a 12-quarter high of 51.04% in the September quarter.
What’s more, many more retail investors want to invest rather than just trade. Data compiled by FE show that in the three months to September 2014, retail investors’ holdings in India’s top traded companies rose for the first time in three quarters with their cumulative ownership of the 494 of the BSE 500 companies to 6.37%.
To be sure, foreign institutional investors have been far more bullish on Indian stocks — their ownership of the universe went up by a more significant 50 basis points to 14.5%. But the reversal in the ownership trends for retail investors — their share had dropped between December 2013 and June 2014 by 30 bps to 6.29% — suggests they’re more confident now.

Those that want to play it safer are opting for the mutual fund route. Retail folios have seen a 4.6% increase in H1FY15, marking the highest rise since March 2009, when industry body Amfi started reporting half-yearly folio data.
Sunil Subramaniam, deputy CEO, Sundaram Mutual Fund, points out that in the September quarter, retail investors pumped in Rs 23,821 crore into equity mutual fund schemes, more than twice seen in the June quarter. “While we have seen keen interest in our micro-fund launches, about 5% of our expanded customer base comprises new clients,” Subramaniam added.
October saw mutual funds buying close to Rs 6,000 crore worth of equities, continuing their buying for the sixth straight month. B Gopakumar, head, broking, Kotak Securities, said client acquisitions are up threefold in the last five months. “Nearly 50% to 60% of these clients are maiden investors although some may have bought mutual funds earlier,” Gopakumar said.
The higher retail participation has prompted many to believe that household savings in shares and debentures could go up meaningfully. JPMorgan wrote in a recent report that earlier phases of broad-based momentum in equities have resulted in as much as 12-14% of household financial savings flowing into share and debentures. Based on the current year’s GDP and household savings break-up — 32% financials, 68% physical — the peak allocation rate would amount to flows of $17 billion into shares and debentures, the brokerage observed.
Given how assets such as gold have been under-performing, it’s possible, say experts, that flows into stocks and bonds could increase significantly. In 2014 so far, the price of gold has dropped by nearly 11% to around Rs 25,887/10 grams, which is near its one-and-a-half year low. The BSE Sensex, on the other hand, has gained 31.64% with mid-caps, typically preferred by retail investors, clocking gains of over 43%.
The average retail cash turnover in September quarter stood at Rs 10,189 crore, with the cash turnover at continued…

Sena-BJP spar over Speakers election in MaharashtraAssemblyPrint
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:25 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:00 pm
The time for filing of nomination for the post of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Speaker was on Tuesday extended after Opposition Sena disrupted proceedings and demanded that the notification of schedule for the Speaker’s election be cancelled as all members had not taken oath.
As soon as the House assembled for the second day to enable the members to take oath, Sena leader Eknath Shinde, on a point of order, demanded that the notification of schedule for Speaker’s election be cancelled.
“The time for filing of nomination is till 12 noon. As many as 106 members are yet to take oath, they cannot participate in the process of election including proposing, seconding the name of the candidate or even if they want to contest the election, till they take oath as members,” Shinde said.
The time for filing of nomination for the post of Speaker was later extended till 3 PM.
As Shinde said that the notification should be cancelled and the time for filing of nomination be extended, all Shiv Sena members were on their feet demanding that the proceedings be stopped till ae ruling is given by the Protem speaker.
Protem Speaker Jeeva Pandu Gavit said there was no need for stopping the proceedings. However, Sena members were unrelenting. They raised slogans in favour of their demand that the proceedings cannot be continued till a ruling is given.
Intervening, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said it would be unfair to stop the oath-taking ceremony following which Sena members started sloganeering.
Ganpatrao Deshmukh (PWP) said the point of order was correct and at the same time it would not be right to stop the oath-taking procedure.
Deshmukh’s view was supported by NCP member R R Patil. Patil said the time for filing of nomination should be extended till all members take oath.
Parliamentary Affairs minister Prakash Mehta agreed to the suggestion.
On Monday, 178 members including Chief Minister and his cabinet colleagues, former chief minister and former ministers, former speaker and deputy speaker as well as women members took oath.

US-led airstrikes target Islamic State leaders inIraqThe Pentagon said that US air strikes has helped to keep Islamic State militants from taking Kobani.

Turkish-Syrian border, on Saturday. Source: Reuters
The U.S.-led coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, a senior U.S. defense official said Saturday.
The airstrikes on Friday night destroyed a convoy consisting of 10 Islamic state armed trucks, said the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe military operations.
He confirmed that coalition aircraft conducted a series of airstrikes “against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul,” using another acronym for the Islamic State group.
“We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,” he said. “We have no further information to provide regarding these strikes.”
The Islamic State group has proclaimed al-Baghdadi as caliph, or supreme leader, of the vast areas of territory in Iraq and Syria under its control and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.
Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.
Despite the airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, Sunni militants have continued to carrying out deadly bombings targeting Iraqi security forces and civilians.
A suicide truck bomber struck the convoy of a top Iraqi police officer killing eight people, including the ranking official, authorities said Saturday, in an attack that bore the hallmarks of militants from the Islamic State group.
The late Friday attack happened when the suicide attacker drove his bomb-laden truck into the convoy of police Lt. Gen. Faisal Malik al-Zamel, who was inspecting forces in the town of Beiji north of Baghdad, police said. The blast killed al-Zamel and seven other police officers, while wounding 15 people, hospital officials and police officers said.
Meanwhile on Saturday, a series of bombings in and around the capital Baghdad killed at least 43 people, with the deadliest blast hitting the city’s sprawling Shiite district of Sadr City, where a car bomb tore through a commercial area, killing 11 people and wounding 21.
There has been an uptick in the number of bombings blamed on Sunni militants in the capital and mostly targeting Shiites, feeding sectarian tensions in the city, as the security forces of the Shiite-led government battle the Sunni militants of continued…

In Motown  despondency overtakes optimism after tepid festivalseasonPrint
New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:17 pm
Car sales growth for FY15 is likely to be below 5% despite initial enthusiasm that the market will bounce back strongly after two years of sluggish sales, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Monday.
The industry body had previously given a more optimistic target of around 10% on the back of improving consumer sentiments and hopes of a sustained macroeconomic recovery after the Narendra Modi-led NDA government came to power at the Centre in May. The modest growth target comes on the back of disappointing passenger vehicle (PV) sales in October, a festival month that included both the auspicious Navratras and Diwali, when consumer spending usually increases.
Click here for graph
“We might see some revival in sales early next year, but the passenger vehicle segment and passenger cars are expected to grow at sub-5% this fiscal. Festival season has been subdued and unless we have some real economic growth, we might not see automobile sales going up,” said Siam deputy director-general Sugato Sen.
Volumes of PVs, which include cars, utility vehicles and vans, fell 7.5% in October after five straight months of growth while car and UV sales dropped 2.5% and 15%, respectively. Since May this year, PV sales had started recovering from their decade-low, posting some growth every month.
Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for light vehicle forecasting at IHS Automotive, said: “There was an inventory pile-up with car dealers till September. So, with lower production days in October because of sveral holidays, automakers were able to control stock in the pipeline.”
During the month, new launches helped market leader Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Honda record volume growth of 1% (97,069 units), 5.6% (38,010 units) and 18% (13,242 units). However, Mahindra and Tata Motors saw a drop of 20% (20,255 units) and 33% (13,665 units).
Two-wheelers sales also came as a surprise, posting their first drop in several months (down 3.6% to 14.61 lakh units). Scooters continued to do well with 11% growth (though lower than 20-30% of the previous months) while motorcycle sales fell 9%. Hero MotoCorp saw sales drop 10% to 5.50 lakh units while Honda saw flat sales. Bajaj also saw an 11% drop though TVS Motor saw an 18% jump in volumes.
The silver lining, however, was the medium and heavy truck segment, whose sales rose 25% to 17,866 units on the back of a pick-up in economic activity and lower diesel prices. India’s truck market, which has contracted by 40% in two years, is now making a comeback. However, light commercial vehicle sales fell 13% to 34,099 units, dragging CV sales 3% to 51,965 units.
During the month, Tata Motors CV sales were down 5% to 25,095 units while Ashok Leyland saw 26% growth.

Draft policy aims to boost aviation sector: ...Ashok Gajapathi Raju
("How do we rise to fulfil…)
ET Now caught up with Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju for his views on the new draft policy on civil aviation. Excerpts:
ET Now: Yesterday you released a draft policy. What was the main reason behind this? What is your vision for India's aviation sector?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: It is common knowledge that aviation in India is nowhere near its potential. You can put the blame on the economic infrastructure. You can put it that way.
So how do we rise to fulfil our potential? Based on certain discussions, a draft paper was prepared and it was released yesterday. The idea was that the quality of decisions depends heavily on the quality of information.
Another perception is that all points have not been covered, and that certain things could have been put in a different way. So, a timeframe should be put on it. It will ensure that all the information that the stakeholders feel ought to have gone into the process of consultation does appear. This way, any decision that comes in becomes a conscious decision because governments are expected to act consciously, not unconsciously. So, that is the basic shift.
ET Now: Listing was a new idea, and we expect some kind of opposition coming from the AAI workers' union, and from the Pawan Hans employees as well. Will you be open to reserving some shares for these employees so that there should not be much opposition?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: Shares to employees is a good idea, because they also should become part of the companies. It helps. You look at any successful entity anywhere in the world and you'll see that employees do have shareholding. With this, the level of confidence definitely goes up.
ET Now: What percentage would you like to reserve for the employees of these organisations?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: Let them suggest. Why should we jump into it without any suggestions? Let them suggest what they would like to have. Then we will see.
ET Now: ATF prices are still not down, but the oil prices globally have come down. Are you going to suggest to the Petroleum Minister that it should be passed on to the petroleum companies and further to the airlines?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: Obviously, because that is the policy of the Government of India. Petroleum products should be closer to the market reality. And ATF is part of it. So it should come about logically. We will definitely take it up with the Petroleum Ministry.
ET Now: One thing we have seen after you have taken charge is that airlines are decreasing their fares month after month. Some airlines have accused other airlines of predatory pricing. Will you look into the issue? Will you tell some airlines to stop these fare wars because it is hurting the aviation industry as a whole?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: Fare wars might be hurting the industry, but regulation is not the answer. There has to be some internal discipline among the airlines also. I understand that there are still some airlines which are doing well despite some which are under-selling. So, a lot depends on other factors also, such as time-bound performance, reliability, etc.
  ET Now: The audit of airlines was ordered a few months back. The findings are still not out. Is there any finding that could be shared?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: Most airlines' books are not in order. To generate confidence, they need to pull up their socks. I hope they do it. Aviation is important; we cannot have it crashing down. We have already had Kingfisher crashing. I do not think India can afford to have another airline crashing.
But then there is another side to the coin also. Everyone has to behave economically.
ET Now: Are more reforms on the cards? Any reduction in parking charges, etc?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: We hope that whatever decisions are taken will be in our thrust areas. The government's thrust is on regional connectivity. So, it should contribute to that.
We hope suggestions will come, which will make aviation vibrant and beneficial to our country. We are working to that end.
ET Now: Airlines in India are divided. Indigo always keeps on accusing other airlines of something or the other. Air Asia is not happy with other airlines. Will you work towards bringing all those airlines together so that the benefits are more pronounced?
Ashok Gajapathi Raju: We would like to encourage competition among them to bring out the best. We do not want it to become unhealthy, but desiring one thing and getting another is a different issue.
I guess they also have to work responsibly. They are responsible to their shareholders. So I guess everyone, in the ultimate analysis, will have to work responsibly for a vibrant aviation in India.

Central varsities to implement `credit transfer scheme from next year: Smriti IraniSmriti Irani, Human Resource Development Minister
New Delhi, Nov. 11:  
All central universities from next academic year will implement credit transfer scheme to facilitate seamless movement of students, said Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani on Tuesday.
A credit framework is now in place which allows lateral and vertical mobility within vocational educational system and between current education systems.
The framework defines the rules for credit allotment and follows the National Skills Qualification Framework.
For integrating vocational education with conventional education, skill knowledge providers will be registered by AICTE or other authorised bodies. Once the student completes the skill modules as required at a certification level and acquires the credits from the trainer, he can submit the credits to the institute which would transfer the credits to the technical board or university. Certification would then be awarded by the university or technical board accordingly.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development on Tuesday launched a number of schemes for the education sector.
SAKSHAM and PRAGATI are two schemes which provide scholarships for boys and girls.
The President, Pranab Mukherjee also launched Know Your College portal which aims to increase transparency and awareness about the opportunities of higher education.

The Nifty call: Break above 8 415 could push contract higherTweet
November 11, 2014:  
Nifty November Futures (8,370) The Nifty November futures contract has been stuck in a narrow range of 8,325 and 8,415 over the last few days. The contract opened with an upward gap today at 8,393 and rose to test the upper end of the above mentioned range. However, it failed to breach the range-resistance and has reversed lower after recording a high of 8,407.45. This keeps the sideways consolidation range intact.
The contract is currently poised at the mid-point of this range. There is a high possibility of an intraday fall to test 8,325 — the lower end of the range.
Traders with a short-term perspective can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at 8,395 for the target of 8,335.
A breakout on either side of the 8,325-8,415 range will decide the next trend for the Nifty futures contract. A fall below 8,325 will target 8,290, while a break above 8,415 can push the contract higher to 8,435.
Strategy: Go short with a stop-loss at 8,395
Supports: 8,340, 8,325

Buy rating to Maruti Suzuki shares: Clear road aheadMaruti Suzuki
Rating: Buy
Strong market share performance across all segments: MSIL’s market share performance has remained strong over the past year. Its market share in the passenger vehicles segment rose to 45.5% in H1FY15 compared with 43.6% in FY14 and 41.2% in FY13. In our view, MSIL’s outperformance has been helped by: (i) continued strong growth in rural areas– rural volumes increased 16% y-o-y in FY14 and 26% y-o-y in Q1FY15; (ii) first-time buyer mix has risen to 42% in H1FY15, from 37% in FY14 –MSIL has very high market share (70%) in the entry segment and (iii) successful launch of its Celerio model–6,000 units/ month.
We expect MSIL’s new launch momentum to stay strong over the next two years, which should help it sustain the outperformance. Market share performance was strong across all segments. Here, we would like to highlight two points: (i) A steep improvement in market share in the hatchback segment in FY15 led by the success of Celerio (58-60% so far vs. 44% in FY14); and (ii) MSIL has held on to its market share in the sedan segment despite two launches–Honda Amaze and Hyundai Xcent– which is quite positive. With more launches planned in the UV (utility vehicle) segment over two years, we expect MSIL to improve its market share from 10-12% currently.

Raising FY17F EPS estimate by 9%: Our FY15-17F (forecast) volume estimates remain largely unchanged. We expect 13% volume growth in FY15F and 17% in FY16F. We raise our ASP (average selling price) estimates by 1-3% for FY15-17F to account for a better product mix–more launches in the high-end segment. Our FY15-16F Ebitda margin estimates is largely unchanged while we have raised our FY17F Ebitda margin by 50 bp. Based on currency rates, Ebitda margins can improve by 60bp from Q2 levels. We build in a 1% reduction in discounts over the next two years (FY16-17F).
Overall, we raise our FY15F EPS (earnings per share) estimate by 5%; our FY16F EPS estimate is largely unchanged, while our FY17F EPS estimate is up by 9%.
Conservative depreciation policy vs. peers:We note that MSIL follows a conservative depreciation policy compared to its domestic peers. MSIL’s depreciation rate (based on average gross fixed assets ex-land) is around 11% which is much higher than, say, M&M, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Thus, MSIL’s earnings quality is better than the rest.
Dividend payout ratio to increase going ahead: MSIL’s board has decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 18-30% going ahead, from 10-15% earlier. We are building in a 20% dividend payout ratio for FY15-17F into our estimates. However, we note that MSIL still remains a growth stock—at the current price, we estimate the dividend yield at 1% for FY16F.
Reiterate Buy; TP raised to R3,660: We retain our SOTP (sum-of-the-parts) valuation methodology. We value MSIL at R3,813/share based on 18x consolidated FY17F EPS of R212. We then roll back our TP (target price) by four months to Nov-15 at a 13% cost of equity to arrive at our 12-month TP of R3,660.
Given factors like an economic recovery, lower oil prices and benign commodity prices, the outlook for the auto sector is strong. The sector multiples will likely remain towards the higher end of the historical trading range. Further, for Maruti specifically, we foresee some structural changes taking place over the next one-two years: (i) start of its R&D centre in India, leading to faster model rollouts; (ii) a possible fall in royalty rates on new models post higher local R&D; (iii) reduced earnings volatility on lower import content and (iv) likely upside to FCF (free cash flow) from the Gujarat plant deal.
Given the above, we expect MSIL to trade at 16-20x FY17F EPS . We peg our target multiple at 18x FY17F EPS—at the mid-end of our expected trading range. If the four-wheeler industry volume growth is stronger, the stock can trade at 20x FY17F EPS–at the higher-end.

Augmenting your password-protected worldEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
A USERNAME and password combination has long been the standard security mechanism for online accounts. But that method just isn’t cutting it anymore. Huge data breaches, in which hackers gain access to personal information, have risen sharply in the last few years. And consumers have named identity theft their No. 1 online concern for 14 consecutive years, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Sometimes, our existing security infrastructure can’t protect us, like when our personal data is stored in vulnerable databases. But all too often, we’re our own worst enemy. Our own weak passwords make it all too easy for hackers to guess them; we use the same passwords for multiple sites, offering thieves a sort of skeleton key. And even when we’re told about data breaches, we don’t always respond by changing passwords or any other behaviours.
The reality is, passwords don’t look to be leaving us anytime soon. Still, there are some new and interesting tools to help make our password-protected world a little safer. Many of the most ambitious and promising technologies are coming in the realm of biometrics—that is,
using some physical part of yourself like your voice, fingerprint, facial recognition or an iris scan.
Biometric security systems have long been promised. Those promises have started to become reality in recent years and really became mainstream with the introduction of a fingerprint reader in iPhones last year. Now, people with the latest iPhones can unlock their phones, authorise purchases from iTunes and other apps and even pay at some stores by just touching their finger to their phone. The phone reads the person’s fingerprint and approves the payment.
“It used to be a fingerprint sensor had to connect with a USB cable and you’d pay hundreds of dollars,” said Hector Hoyos, the chief executive of Hoyos Labs, a biometric security start-up. “Now it’s on your iPhone.” This month, Hoyos’s company will release 1U, an app that uses facial recognition to log people into various accounts. The app starts at $30 a year; the price can go up depending on how many websites and devices you connect to it.
The app doesn’t replace passwords entirely. To use it, you must first log into each online service, like your bank or email account or Facebook, while in the app. When you want to log into one of those services in the future, you visit the site through the app and have 1U scan your face with your phone’s camera. If the scan is successful, the app logs you in as though you had typed in your password.
Because you don’t need to remember your passwords when using the app, you can set a unique and sophisticated password for each service in the first place. In addition, the app allows you to set various levels of security for different accounts. You can choose to have the app scan your face quickly for one account, for example, and do a “liveness” test, which will force you to move your eyes and smile before you can log in, for another account.
The app can connect with your computer, too, so when you want to log in to sites there, you can glance at your phone for a facial scan instead of entering your password. The phone sends an encrypted message to the computer authorising the login. The experience isn’t perfect: For one thing, you have to go to the sites through the 1U app instead of the apps or the browser you usually use. And looking at your phone to log into a website on your computer is clunky.
In the future, Hoyos hopes that companies will stop using passwords altogether, eliminating the risk of having login credentials stored on external servers. Other companies are following a similar path: Making biometric add-ons that work with existing password systems while trying to persuade companies to make a wholesale change.
EyeLock, a start-up in New York, just released Myris, a USB-connected iris scanner that costs $280. The iris is one of the most unique human identifiers, as no two are alike. Anthony Antolino, the chief marketing officer for EyeLock, said the company was working with companies like Bank of America and had already incorporated its iris scanning technology into some of its buildings.
As for the Myris device, it’s essentially an extremely high-tech password manager. Like the 1U app, it doesn’t replace your passwords, it just replaces the need to enter them when you’re logging in to a site or to your computer. Unlike 1U, though, the Myris software can create new, secure passwords for you and save them so you don’t have to remember them. And it can import saved passwords from programs like LastPass.
If these two new products don’t excite you, rest assured that biometrics are almost surely headed your way soon. Brett Beranek, the director of product strategy for voice biometrics at Nuance Communications, which makes voice-recognition software and technologies, said most consumers would begin to encounter some kind of biometric systems in the next few years.

Oil Ministry seeks Rs 8 183 crore in fuel subsidyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The Oil Ministry has sought over Rs 8,183 crore cash subsidy to make good one-third of the losses that retailers like IOC incurred on selling diesel and cooking fuel below cost in the September quarter.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) had reported a revenue loss of about Rs 24,563 crore in the July-September quarter.
Of this, upstream oil and gas producers — ONGC, Oil India Ltd and GAIL India Ltd will make good Rs 16,379.55 crore and the rest Rs 8,183.33 crore is being sought from the government as cash subsidy, ministry sources said.
Fuel retailers sold diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at government-controlled rates which are below market price in Q2.
The loss they thus incur is made good through cash subsidy from the government and dole from upstream firms like ONGC.
Of the upstream compensation, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will provide Rs 13,641.25 crore, OIL Rs 2,238.30 and gas utility GAIL Rs 500 crore.
GAIL has already declared its second quarter earnings without accounting for the subsidy payout and will now have to make adjustments.
IOC will get Rs 9,097.81 crore from upstream firms, HPCL Rs 3,750.95 crore and BPCL Rs 3,530.79 crore.
During the April-June period, the three fuel retailers cumulatively lost Rs 28,690.74 crore on diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. Of this, the upstream firms met Rs 15,546.65 crore or 54 per cent of the under-recovery or revenue loss. The government gave cash subsidy of Rs 11,000 crore.
Of the upstream share, ONGC chipped in Rs 13,200.10 crore, OIL Rs 1,846.55 crore while the share of GAIL was Rs 500 crore.
Sources said diesel price has since been regulated and the government will from the third quarter not provide any subsidy on the fuel.
Only domestic LPG and kerosene remain to be subsidised. Petrol prices were deregulated in June 2010.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty slip after hitting all-time highs; ONGC  L&T majorlosersFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Both the indices – Sensex and Nifty – slipped into negative zone after hitting all-time highs in early trade on fresh selling, mainly in capital goods and refinery stocks, despite buying in FMCG and healthcare counters.
The Sensex resumed higher at 27,919.45 and firmed up further to an all-time high of 28,027.96 on initial strong buying on the back of strong foreign capital inflows into equity market coupled with higher Asian cues.
However, it failed to maintain this level and declined afterwards to 27,818.23, showing a loss of 50.40 points, or 0.18 per cent at 1100 hours.
The CNX 50-share Nifty also moved down by 16.25 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 8,320.75 after hitting life-time high of 8,383.05.
Major losers on the Sensex were – ONGC (1.70 per cent), Larsen (1.61 per cent), Hindalco (1.60 per cent), Tata Steel (1.46 per cent), Cipla (1.34 per cent) and Tata Motors (1.01 per cent).
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Team Narendra Modi now less compactNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Less than six months after it assumed office, the Narendra Modi government on Sunday undertook the first expansion of its council of ministers by increasing its strength to 66 from 45, a move that could lead to divesting of some crucial portfolios like defence and telecom from senior ministers who currently hold multiple portfolios and hopefully add further momentum to policy-making.
Industry, which pins hopes on the administrative agility promised by the Modi government to tide over a longer-than-expected economic slump, said the Cabinet expansion signalled a “serious intent” to expedite reforms. But the ruling alliance also saw the first definite signs of fissures, with BJP’s “natural ally” Shiv Sena asking its nominee Anil Desai at the last minute not to take oath, apparently annoyed by Modi’s decision to induct Suresh Prabhu into the Cabinet against its wishes and the BJP’s alleged indecisiveness on who to team up with in Maharashtra – the Shiv Sena or the Nationalist Congress Party.

Desai, who arrived here in the morning, returned from the airport itself after telephonic talks with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who announced in a press conference later in the day that Eknath Shinde as the party’s leader in the new Maharashtra assembly, in what is a not-so-veiled threat that the party would play Opposition in the state. Anant Geete, Sena’s lone member in the Modi Cabinet, however, would stay for the time being, Thackeray said, indicating that a rapprochement between the two estranged allies was still possible. “Even today, we are not in favour of parting ways with the BJP… but they should decide soon (on who ally with),” he said.
Apart from Prabhu, former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, veteran BJP leader from Himachal Pradesh JP Nadda and Jat leader from Haryana Birender Singh were sworn in as Cabinet ministers by President Pranab Mukherjee. Bandaru Dattatreya and Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who were ministers in the Vajpayee government, and Mahesh Sharma, newly-elected MP from Gautam Buddh Nagar bordering Delhi, were sworn in as ministers of state with independent charge, while another 14 took oath as ministers of state.
Sunday’s Cabinet expansion went against Modi’s promise of a compact Cabinet (he has advocated “minimum government and maximum governance”), which, incidentally, is still leaner than those headed by Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
The strength of UPA-II Cabinet stood at 78 after its final reshuffle in October 2012 while the previous NDA government led by Vajpayee started with a lean 56-member ministry but was expanded up to nearly 88 ministers.
As the power minister, Prabhu took measures towards providing affordable power for all, introduced transparency in tendering and bidding of projects and started signing agreements with states on power sector reforms in return for federal capital support. Prabhu also spearheaded a project for improving efficiency of old power generating stations and for lowering transmission losses. As chemicals and fertilizers minister, Prabhu started the work for a new pharmaceutical policy.
Among the new ministers, Parrikar is tipped to get the defence portfolio, which has come into focus with the Modi government’s policy of attracting more FDI into the sector and giving a major fillip to domestic manufacturing of defence equipment. Prabhu, credited with the reform steps he took as power minister in the Vajpayee government, is likely to be given an important economic portfolio, maybe telecom, which is now held by law minister Ravishankar Prasad, as an additional portfolio.
The cabinet expansion comes ahead of a series of economic data releases this week that would reveal how potent has the Modi government been in rejuvenating the economy. Industrial production data for September and inflation figures based on combined consumer price indices for October would be announced on Wednesday, while inflation date based on the wholesale price index would be out on Friday.
Efficient and transparent reallocation of captive coal blocks which were cancelled by the Supreme Court, reining in revenue expenditure, relaxing the consent and social impact assessment provisions in the land acquisition law and introducing the goods and services tax (GST) without unduly compromising on its integrity are among the immediate priorities of the government.
The economy is yet to show definite signs of a turnaround, while the calls for rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India to catalyse investment and consumption have become louder. Consumer price inflation, the new benchmark for monetary policy-making, dropped in September to 6.46%, the lowest since the relevant index was introduced in January 2012, while wholesale price inflation hit its meanest in almost five years in September at 2.38%. Although industrial production witnessed growth for a fifth straight month through August, its best run in almost three years, the expansion came off conducive bases.
Industry welcomed induction of new faces into the Cabinet. “… new ministers would streamline governance and bring in new ideas for the economic reforms process,” said CII president Ajay Shriram. “The fact that some of the key portfolios will now have full-time Cabinet minister in charge will provide speed to the decision making in important sectors of the economy,” Assocham said in a statement.

Resistance cant stop relaxed land rules: FM Arun JaitleyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The Narendra Modi government will soon announce steps to reduce the cost of production for businesses that will complement efforts to strengthen the country’s grossly underperforming manufacturing sector and pursue a reasonable and rational tax policy to aid a gradual return to the high economic growth trajectory, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday.
He indicated the government’s plan to push ahead with reforms to a land acquisition law by relaxing the cumbersome social impact assessment and consent clauses that fret industry, “even if there is resistance to loosening the rules”. He said these changes were needed to fulfil the Prime Minister’s vision of building 100 new “smart” cities across India.
Sources told FE that one of the measures the finance ministry was working on was to further reduce import duty on a host of raw materials that would make production of value added goods more competitive. Implementing the proposed new indirect tax regime, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), will also help in lowering the cost of production by reducing multiple taxation of items.
“Even though we have a manufacturing export base of $300 billion, because of certain steps that we have not taken, our costs are a little higher. Therefore, one of the principal objects of the present government is to take the relevant steps so that India can not only be a manufacturing hub, but also a low-cost manufacturing hub,” Jaitley said at the India Global Forum summit here.
India’s manufacturing sector, which had contracted 0.7% in 2013-14, has posted a 3.5% growth in the first quarter of this fiscal compared to a 1.2% contraction in the same quarter a year ago.
Jaitley said the government had estimated a gradual return to high economic growth rate. “We expect the economy to grow reasonably and modestly this year, a little higher next year and hopefully if that trend continues, India can be on a high growth trajectory,” said Jaitley.
What is also on the cards is rationalisation of tax provisions to reduce disputes. “We have seen the challenges before the economy. So, a reasonable and rational tax policy (is needed). It can’t be ultra-aggressive with the tax payers,” the minister said.
The Modi government intends to amend the law to ease land acquisition procedures for business projects even if it does not get support from Opposition parties. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Settlement Act of 2013 provides for rigorous social impact assessments and requires consent of 70% of the affected families. The law passed during the previous government’s term seeks to give a fair compensation for land owners but has been criticised by the industry for making it difficult to acquire land for projects.
“Some changes (to the law) may be necessary. We will first try to reach a consensus, and if that is not possible, we will go ahead and take the decision,” he said.
The finance ministry has also finalised a disinvestment policy which the minister said will “unfold” in the next couple of days. The government intends to bring down its equity in public sector banks
to 52%.

Royalty: Lost in translationNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Royalty received by multinational corporations (MNC) from their India subsidiaries in FY14 went up less than they would have hoped for, thanks to a sharp depreciation in the Indian rupee, reports Nitin Shrivastava in Mumbai. The top ten India-listed MNC subsidiaries saw their aggregate royalty and related expenses increase by 11.30% to R4,675 crore in FY14 because a weaker local currency meant much was lost in translation.
However, given that several MNCs have upped the rates at which they earn royalty, most of them —Unilever Plc, Bosch, Nestle and ABB, Holcim made decent money.

Most Indian subsidiaries of MNCs pay out royalty in local currency terms. However, Maruti denominates the payment in yen on a per-car basis and the amount accounts for a significant share of SMC’s global profits. Maruti paid Rs 2,486 crore or 5.75% of net sales, as royalty to SMC in FY14, close to the R2,454 crore it paid out in FY13.
At roughly 41.43 billion yen, the amount was nearly 40% of SMC’s net income in FY14.
A few MNCs have, in recent years, altered the terms for royalty payments. Swiss major Holcim—parent of subsidiaries ACC and Ambuja– now pays out 1% of sales up from 0.65% earlier. As such, despite an 11% fall in the rupee, against the Swiss Franc, and weaker sales at its subsidiaries, Holcim made much more in FY14 with an 80% jump in royalty earnings of CHF 42.7 million. Hindustan Unilever has said it will gradually scale up its royalty payments to 3.15% of its turnover, by FY18; in FY18 payments amounted to 1.85% of net sales, up from 1.45% in FY13. Unilever Plc earned Euro 67 million in FY14, a 19.7% increase despite the fact that Euro on an average appreciated by 15.76% against the rupee.
However for Bosch – the third largest royalty receiver – the royalty and related payments rose just 2.93% due to a sharp 13.48% fall in Indian rupee against the Euro in 2013; Bosch India paid Rs 410 crore, up 16.8% over 2012. Nestle and ABB saw their royalty income drop marginally by 2-3%, although their Indian subsidiaries paid out nearly 7% more in 2013.

Tax distortions  poor infra hit Basmati farmersNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
A heavy burden of taxes and levies, exacerbated by inter-state trade disparities in taxation and under-developed market infrastructure in key producing states like Uttar Pradesh, is threatening to dent India’s lately acquired export competitiveness in basmati rice.
In 2013-14, India’s basmati rice exports peaked an impressive R29,299 crore, but industry sources say, given a widening of tax differential between Haryana and Punjab, processing costs have gone up. As a result, export realisations from the rice variety have taken a hit.
Punjab now has a big tax differential of about four percentage points with neighbouring Haryana after it lowered the taxes in October 2013. As a consequence, traders from Haryana, where most of rice processing units are located, have stepped up their buying at various mandis in Punjab, resulting in gross under-utilisation of processing capacities in Punjab.

Also, a lack of marketing infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh has forced its farmers, especially those in the districts bordering Haryana, to take their produce to the processors in Haryana. In the process, the UP farmers incur transportation costs that render farming of basmati less remunerative for them.
An official from Punjab food and civil supplies department told FE that so far this year, Haryana traders have purchased a substantial 17,000 tonne of Basmati paddy in Punjab’s Khanna mandi, Asia’s biggest grain market. Neeraj Singh Chaudhary, a farmer from UP’s Muzaffarnagar district, told FE he had brought 50 quintals of Basmati paddy to Karnal mandi in Haryana which is 35 miles away from his paddy fields, in what indicated the predicament of UP farmers.
The tax and levies on grain are at irrationally high levels — the combined onus of taxes and other imposts are as high as 11.5% in Haryana and 7.75% in Punjab. Ashok Gulati, former chairman Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), said that all key Basmati-growing states should have a uniform taxation regime and the taxation on staple grain trade should be around 3%. Analysts say the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) would present an opportunity for rationalisation of taxes on trade of grain across states.
For promoting food processing, the Punjab government had exempted Basmati paddy purchase in the state from 2% rural development fund (RDF) tax and 2% mandi fee last year. This brought down the overall tax to 2.75% for local buyers and 7.75% for exporters. The tax refund system for exporters is barely useful to nullify the taxes incurred.
“These variations in tax structure create uncertainties in the supply of key raw materials in basmati trade. We need to have an unified tax structure for sustaining our growing Basmati rice exports,” Vijay Setia, a former president of All India Rice Exporters Association and executive director, Chaman Lal Setia Export, an exporter of Basmati rice, said.
According to Rakesh Rawal, secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Karnal, which handles 4.5 lakh tonnes of paddy and wheat annually, more than 60% of the grain traded are from the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh.
Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are the biggest producers of aromatic long-grained basmati rice, especially PUSA 1121 and the newly introduced PUSA 1509 varieties. Basmati rice is being cultivated in more than 2.5 million hectare in these three states this year. The country produced 5 million tonne of basmati rice last year.

US  EU appreciating Indias stance on food security  says Nirmala SitharamanNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
A week ahead of the Brisbane G20 summit, where leaders of the world’s 20 major economies will, among other things, discuss ways to restore confidence in the multilateral trading system and the World Trade Organization (WTO), New Delhi on Sunday said the US and the European Union were now better appreciating India’s stance on food security and the importance of course correction to arrive at a solution.
“We still believe in going ahead with the Doha Round, including trade facilitation and the larger developmental issues that will address poverty (alleviation). Between July and now, the Prime Minister’s (Narendra Modi) interaction with the US President (Barack Obama) and our interaction with the European Union gives me confidence that there is a greater appreciation of our (India’s) position,” commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
Speaking at the India Global Forum 2014, organised by think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies, she said: “We (India) are after all asking for what is only right in the name of human rights… I can very clearly say that we are moving with great hope. I expect that there will be greater engagement and some solution will come out of it which will calm down everyone questioning whether or not the Bali agreement will be recognised or whether it will all come down.”
India was not trying to undermine the trade facilitation agreement, the minister said, and termed WTO’s Bali package (on public stockholding for food security in developing countries, trade facilitation and a package for least developed countries) as imperfect.
“Government’s sovereign duty to protect its poor farmers is seen (by the developed world) as trade distorting. If the course correction has to happen, it has to happen now and that is what we (India) are demanding. We may not be waiting till 2017 to get what is due and what is not trade distorting,” she said, adding that India was committed to WTO as it believed in multilateralism as opposed to regionalism.
The Bali package had an interim ‘peace clause’ preventing WTO members from taking any developing country to the dispute settlement panel for violating the norms that the ‘trade distorting’ (agricultural) domestic support should not be over 10% of the total production. The package also said members should work on a permanent solution to reach an agreement by December 2017.
The WTO members had failed to meet the July 31 deadline for signing the protocol of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), mainly due to India’s stance that an agreement on a permanent solution to the food security issue should be arrived at by December-end this year so that it can be implemented with the TFA and a package for least developed countries. India is challenging the calculation of domestic support at 1986-88 reference prices citing inflation and currency fluctuation since then, and therefore wants the base year to be changed from 1986-88 to reflect current market realities.
The Prime Minister’s Office had recently held a meeting with the commerce ministry on the WTO negotiations in the wake of the readiness shown by the US to discuss India’s concerns on food security. Although India is unlikely to retract from its tough stance on the issue, sources said it is evaluating a proposal for “a perpetual peace clause” till a “permanent solution” is found on the issue of public stock holding for food
security.
A peace clause like this would ensure that developing countries are not taken to world body’s dispute settlement panel even if their domestic support to farmers crosses the limits prescribed.
TFA was meant to ease global customs rules and add $1 trillion to the global economy in addition to creating 21 million jobs. India has since said it is not opposed to TFA, but added that while members engaged seriously and with commitment on TFA to quickly resolve issues, the same enthusiasm and urgency was not shown on the issue of food security. The EU had earlier said a confirmation of the open-ended nature of the interim solution can most probably be achieved. Once the Bali package is amended to include such a perpetual peace clause, India will not come in the way of signing the TFA, the sources said.

Microsoft sharpens its cloud edgeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Mumbai-based Zing HR, a human resources management firm, had a peculiar problem. Every morning and evening, while registering employee attendance, its data storage infrastructure would get overloaded. The company had to buy servers to create capacity for just two hours of the day. But when Zing moved to Microsoft Corp’s Azure cloud service 10 months ago, it was able to cut its data storage cost by 30% apart from getting access to many analytical tools from Microsoft.
“We were earlier using the most popular cloud service out there. But we felt that the flexibility and tools that we were looking for were lacking. Also Microsoft came to us offering free onboarding and transitioning guidance from their Microsoft Development Centre (MDC),” says Prasad Rajappan, managing director of Zing HR. The company’s clients include HDFC bank, department of income tax, government of India and Adhunik Metaliks, a construction company. MDC is a 6,000 strong support and research centre of Microsoft in Hyderabad.
The $85 billion software giant from Seattle says that it is ready to be a ‘fierce competitor’ in a world headed towards a cloud-first mobile first era. “We see a proliferation of devices that create and consume data and the implications are far reaching. The cloud provides immense computing power to facilitate small business to expand without much capital cost and a flexibility of scale that they have never been able to do before,” says Tyler Bryson, general manager, marketing and operations at Microsoft India.
After Satya Nadella took over the reins from Steve Ballmer early this year, the company accepted the growth of the open source space in technology. It positioned Redmond-based Microsoft as a ‘Platform and Productivity’ company, subsuming Ballmer’s former four-pillar strategy of cloud, mobile, big data and devices. While the company’s devices have come as a failure despite the belated and moderate success of Surface tablets, the Windows operating system (OS) has been stagnating and Nokia increasingly being cornered by other Android handset makers.
Microsoft though is not worried about the consumerisation and the Android domination eating up its cloud business.
“Microsoft is becoming a much more open company and certainly market has led us that way and we are repositioning ourselves. And our tools and solutions support all the platforms and all languages apart from helping users to seamlessly transition from work and personal usage,” says Bryson. He points out that while devices create and capture data, the cloud will store and analyse data for its consumers. The cost of data collection, storage, security and analysis will come down with companies moving to cloud, Bryson adds.
However, Microsoft is tasting success in the cloud technology space, with the Azure platform growing at 136% during the latest quarter and now strongly positioned as the second biggest cloud player behind Amazon Web Services, which took startups and small business to the cloud in a big way. Amazon, which has 27% marketshare, grew at industry rates of around 50%, with the industry pegged at around $15 billion, on an annualised rate. The company, which now has 10% market share, has data centres in 19 locations across the world with two planned in India as announced by CEO Nadella on his trip to the country recently. Rajappan of Zing adds, “Domestic data centres will help us and Microsoft gain more financial services clients who are still concerned about information being moved into public cloud infrastructure outside of the country.”
IBM, which recently hived off its chip business, is growing its cloud business fast, gaining 7% market share, while Google has slashed prices forcing others including Microsoft to follow suit. “We believe cloud providers have not passed on the savings to customers based on the hardware price that has come down. On average, prices have fallen 15-20% year-on-year but the price drops by cloud providers have been in low single digits and we think that is not fair,” Shailesh Rao, Google’s global head of cloud business and director, told FE. All the companies are investing heavily in the cloud infrastructure, with Google pouring in $3 billion every quarter.
According to Bryson, in the enterprise world Microsoft still has a lead over others despite the enterprise apps being built on Google’s Play Store. “We are talking about the apps that run big dollar billion corporations and the scale is huge. People have been developing applications for our platforms for more than 20 years,” he says adding that such developers are coming to Azure. India has the second largest number of developers after the US with 1.6 million developers. India is important than most other markets as it provides software services to customers around the world, Bryson says.
Bryson says that Microsoft’s hybrid public-private cloud option for its customers gives it an edge over other cloud players. Bryson adds that the other products of Microsoft like Office 365 now being available over cloud also helps it gain more small businesses despite Google’s early penetration. “We are increasingly giving consumers the choice,” he says.

Dispelling the clouds over data securityEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
The past few years have seen a tremendous growth in the number of mobile applications. Another industry that has grown alongside the mobile application sector is data collection and processing. Often, mobile apps are designed to collect information available on the mobile device such as name, age, location, internet browsing history, etc. This information is then stored on a central server, and is processed and utilised. Certain other mobile apps also provide the user with an option to store data in a remote manner (cloud computing).
The key challenge while developing and marketing such applications is that of data security. Consumers need to be made conscious of the fact that the data on their mobile device is being collected and processed. Typically, permission is sought at the time of downloading the application from the relevant app store. However, the permissions requested are seldom explained in detail, thus leaving the user unaware of the nature of information being collected, or the process or purpose for the same.
In the recent past, we have encountered several instances of data being stolen and being used for unlawful purposes. Internet trolling, whereby illegally extracted information is posted on social media networks and the source individual is subjected to public ridicule and insult, is also a trend which is on the rise. The necessity to protect one’s data from being accessed by these ‘internet trolls’ cannot be emphasised enough, in light of the increased usage of cloud computing. The latest hacking of the iCloud has only established what was being said by privacy advocates around the world—data can never truly be secure and private when stored in a remote manner. This and other similar experiences have app developers scrambling to ensure that their apps, as well as the data collected from these apps are sufficiently protected.
The Indian legislations which govern offences relating to unlawful exfiltration of data contained on a mobile device/cloud include the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the tort law and possibly the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. Claims may be raised based on a breach of confidence, violation of privacy, trust and confidence. There are also several criminal offences under the IT Act, such as unlawful access to computer resources, disclosure of computer record and altering computer data without permission, which may apply in such situations.
The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (Rules) provides protection to personal information. Rule 3 of the Rules provides an aggregated definition of sensitive personal data including within its ambit information such as a person’s financial information, medical records, biometric information, etc.
The IT Act, in Sections 43 and 66, deal with hacking a computer system which is punishable with imprisonment up to 3 years, or with a fine which may extend up to R5 lakh, or with both. Section 67 of the IT Act penalises publication or transmission of lascivious material. Such an act is punishable with imprisonment up to 5 years and with fine.
Indian law does not determine what privacy is, but only what situations where privacy will be afforded legal protection. Here, ‘privacy’ would be understood as the claim of ‘aggrieved’ parties, who have determined for themselves when, how and to what extent their personal information is to be communicated to others. An argument that may be used by the ‘victims’ is that the information has been acquired by some form of hacking (or unlawful access to a computer resource), therefore, any viewer of such information may be assumed to known the information was confidential.
It is also pertinent to note that the IT Act applies to offences committed outside India by any person so long as the offence involves a computer, computer system or computer network located in India. While the IT Act does have extra-territoriality, it may not be possible to easily identify the jurisdiction (and consequently the laws) for raising a claim in such a situation. The hacker, the cloud provider, the data and the victim may all be in different countries (and subject to different laws).
The question is whether the data controller can be held responsible for data exfiltration in India? A data controller would need to establish that it followed the provisions under the Rules with regard to reasonable security practices and procedures in order to have a defense against any claim against it. Then there is the question of what were the terms and conditions of use of the services provided.
Typically, terms of such services specifically provide that the service provider does not represent or guarantee that the service will be free from loss, corruption, viruses, hacking, or other security intrusion, and that it disclaims any liability relating thereto. It is unlikely that an action would lie under the Indian Consumer Protection Act, claiming that such terms were unreasonable.
Some simple safeguards that may be adopted to mitigate the risk of data exfiltration include multi-factor authentication and frequent change of passwords. One could also consider encryption of data/ files prior to placing the same on the cloud. This will ensure that no one other than the holder of the encryption key (you) will easily manage to gain access to your files.
As can be seen, the law in relation to data security in India is in a nascent stage of development. There is yet scope to strengthen the laws in relation to service providers, as well as provide effective remedies for persons who are victims of data theft or exfiltration. The enactment of the Information Technology (The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team and Manner of Performing Functions and Duties) Rules, 2013 (CERT-In Rules), which provide for mandatory reporting of specified cyber incidents as well as operation of a 24 hour incident response help desk, seems to be a step forward in this regard.

HM trade unions frustrated over VRS

The package offers each employee his balance salary dues (around Rs.45,000) plus encashment of earned and sick leave besides gratuity plus a Rs.1 lakh purse.
Trade unions associated with the Uttarpara unit of Hindustan Motors on Monday felt that the company should have talked to them before announcing the VRS scheme. The unit has been under work suspension since May 24.
However, a number of workers have already begun picking up application forms, which are available from the security office at the factory gates. There are 2,218 employees at its mother unit in Uttarpara here. The scheme is valid till November 20.
Experts felt that the move might eventually lead to phasing out of the iconic Ambassador cars. The company was making 150 cars against a breakeven of 1,500 vehicles.
The package offers each employee his balance salary dues (around Rs.45,000) plus encashment of earned and sick leave besides gratuity plus a Rs.1 lakh purse.
For a person with 34 years of service, this works out to around Rs.4 lakh. Workers were peeved that amount was not linked to the number of service years left. Hindustan Motors is now a BIFR-referred company with an accumulated loss of over Rs.500 crore.

Rap for Haryana  fresh warrant against RampalPrint
By: Express News Service | Chandigarh | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:11 am
The Punjab and Haryana High Court Monday expressed displeasure over the Haryana government’s failure to arrest and produce self-styled godman Sant Rampal against whom it had issued a non-bailable warrant in a contempt case.
The division bench of Justices M Jeyapaul and Sneh Prashar also expressed unhappiness over the Hisar administration forming a medical board, which certified that he was too ill to be produced before court.
Issuing fresh non-bailable warrant against Sant Rampal, the court directed Haryana’s Home Secretary and Director General of Police to either ensure his presence on or before November 17, or the two themselves appear before the court.
The court said: “We are not happy with the way in which a medical board was constituted, without the authority of this court in order to evade implementation of the directions of this court.
“We are totally dissatisfied with the view expressed by the medical board as regards the health condition of contemner Rampal,” the court observed.
The bench also initiated proceedings to cancel the bail which was granted to Rampal by a single bench in 2008 in a murder case. The court had initiated contempt proceedings against Rampal after his followers mobbed the courts in Rohtak and Hisar, where he was to be produced in the murder case in July. Despite notices, he did not appear in the court.
After the court issued non-bailable warrant, a large of number of his followers gathered at the Hisar ashram with armed men taking position both inside and outside.
When the proceedings began, Haryana DGP Shriniwas Vashisht filed a status report, stating that the police force provided was inadequate to maintain law and order in the event of Rampal’s arrest.
The police produced Ram Kanwar Dhaka, chief of the National Social Service Commission and a Rampal follower, against whom the court had issued a non-bailable warrant as well.

Optimism tempered by jittersOptimism about aviation markets tempered by Asian jitters
By Andrew Parker

Rising stakes: an AirAsia aircraft prepares to depart Singapore’s Changi airport. The Kuala Lumpur-listed carrier is the region’s low-cost, short-haul market leader, but it faces increasing competition
Asia’s growing middle classes and their desire to travel are making the region home to some of the world’s fastest expanding aviation markets.
For example, Airbus expects China to replace the US as the most valuable market in the world for passenger jet deliveries by about 2030, and several other Asian countries – including India and Indonesia – have huge potential for aircraft orders.
More
21st century promises era of radical change
But at the Singapore air show, which starts on Tuesday, this optimism about the long-term future of Asia’s aviation markets will be tempered by concerns about slowing economic growth and currency turmoil, and whether this could result in the region’s airlines cancelling orders with Airbus and Boeing .
The last strong year for Asian airlines was 2010, when the continent overtook North America to become the largest source of passenger traffic, having overtaken Europe several years earlier.
By 2030, 49 per cent of all traffic will originate in Asia, compared with 37 per cent currently, according to Boston Consulting Group.
BCG estimates 1bn people in Asia will have annual earnings of at least $15,000 by 2030, and will therefore be able to afford to fly. “The vast majority of these ‘next billion’ travellers will come from China, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea,” says Vincent Lui, a BCG partner.

However, these attractive long-term growth prospects contrast with recent performance. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that Asian carriers have seen net profits fall from $11.1bn in 2010 to $3.2bn in 2013.
The biggest factor behind Asian carriers’ declining earnings has been the weak state of the air cargo market since the onset of the global financial crisis.
After a brief rebound in 2010, the cargo market has been shrinking and this hit Asian carriers hard because they account for about 40 per cent of the world’s freight traffic by value, as their cargo fleets fly high-priced products made in the region to western countries.
Asian carriers’ average freight charges – called yields – have been pushed down by excess capacity, in part as a result of airlines expanding their passenger fleets.
“Yields for cargo have been falling quite sharply partly because of the success of the passenger business, which has brought on new aircraft to serve passenger markets with cargo capacity in the hold,” says Brian Pearce, chief economist at Iata.
“That has led to more and more capacity chasing less and less cargo volume, forcing prices down and damaging profitability in [the cargo] part of the business.”
But it would be wrong to think of Asia as one homogeneous travel market.
Rather, it is a series of discrete – mainly country-specific – markets that are expanding at different rates.
Iata estimates that China’s domestic passenger traffic increased 11.7 per cent last year, reflecting robust, albeit slowing, economic growth. This was well ahead of global traffic growth of 5.2 per cent.
By contrast, Indian domestic traffic increased by 4 per cent, as growth slowed markedly and the country’s airlines struggled with poor infrastructure and high fuel taxes. Kingfisher Airlines , which was grounded by regulators in 2012 , is seen as emblematic of the financial problems affecting Indian carriers.
“The Indian market has huge potential, but has been a bloodbath for carriers for several years,” says Andrew Herdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), whose members include Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, have taken several steps towards a liberalised aviation market that supports more flights between big cities. This initiative has underpinned the emergence of AirAsia as the region’s largest low-cost short-haul carrier.
But Kuala Lumpur-listed AirAsia, founded by Tony Fernandes , the flamboyant entrepreneur, faces intensifying competition from other budget airlines. Last year, Lion Air, a low-cost carrier based in Indonesia that has placed large orders with Airbus and Boeing for short-haul passenger jets, started a business in Malaysia.
Rising competition in Asia is not confined to short-haul routes. Some airlines that focus on long-distance routes are also under pressure.
Singapore Airlines spoke of “intense competition” as it reported a 3.5 per cent fall in average fares in the first half of its 2013-14 fiscal year compared with 2012-13. This competition involves fast-growing Gulf carriers, led by Emirates Airline, which are flying between Asia and Europe.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, says Singapore Airlines is the company “most exposed” to Gulf carriers because of its large Europe-Australia business, but he also highlights Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways as vulnerable.
With more liberalisation in the offing, there are likely to be more entrants in Asian aviation markets. And the liberalisation will not just be within the region – through the proposed completion of the single aviation market between Asean members – but also on routes outside Asia.
For example, the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, is hoping to negotiate an agreement with the Asean countries that will enable EU carriers to do more flying to this bloc.
Consultants say that, in the long term, there is a compelling case for consolidation involving Asian airlines, but they acknowledge that it will probably be contingent on some governments being willing to relinquish control of their flag carriers – and even letting some of them go out of business.
Alex Dichter, a director at McKinsey, the global consultancy, says: “While we admit that the cultural, political and regulatory barriers to consolidation in Asia are significant, we see no way round this end-game.
“The combined pressures of Mid-East carrier growth and intra-Asia market liberalisation, alongside increases in labour costs, airport charges and fuel, will eventually be too much to bear.”
Meanwhile, some analysts are questioning whether Airbus and Boeing may have to cut production of their aircraft – several of which are being made at record rates – if emerging-market economies suffer a crunch similar to the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.
Asia accounts for a third of manufacturers’ order backlogs – larger than any other region – and analysts say any drawn-out crisis could reduce air travel and force some airlines to cancel orders or defer deliveries.
Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, does not see the current weakness in developing countries’ financial markets as being likely to lead to reduced production by Airbus and Boeing in the short term.
Rather, he sees as a more plausible scenario that reduced Asian economic growth will accentuate a predicted slowdown in orders for the aircraft makers, that, in the medium to long term, could result in production cuts.
“If we are going to see the impact of any significant [short-term] weakness in Asia or emerging markets generally,” he says, “it will be as a weakening of order intake rather than an impact on [aircraft] deliveries.”

Sensex Turns Flat  Nifty Falls Below 8 350Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
BSE Sensex and Nifty failed to hold on early gains and edged lower in afternoon trade. Some selling pressure was seen in IT and FMCG stocks while banking stocks pared their early gains.
Buoyed by positive momentum higher global markets, FII buying and the recent reform measures from the government, the Sensex and Nifty edged up close to record levels in early trade. The Sensex had risen to 27,996 levels at its day's high while Nifty jumped to 8,378 at its day's highest level.
Asian markets were mostly higher today following a record close overnight on Wall Street.
Foreign institutional investors bought Indian equities worth Rs 355 crore on Monday, taking its total to Rs 9,592 crore from October 29.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava said markets are in a consolidation phase and the Nifty is likely to hover in a range of 8280-8380 for a couple of more sessions.
The breadth of the market was neutral with BSE midcap and smallcap indices also giving up their early gains. At 12:15 pm, the Sensex was down 76 points to 27,798 while Nifty fell 20 points to 8,324.
Among IT stocks, Infosys fell 1.2 per cent while Wipro slipped over 0.5 per cent. Market heavyweight ITC fell 1.4 per cent after rising over 4 per cent yesterday. Also weighing on Nifty, ONGC fell over 1.2 per cent.

Dollar nears seven-year high versus yen as Tokyo stocks soar0
Short-term Treasury yields shot higher, widening the premium paid by U.S. two-year paper to 65 basis points over bunds and near the widest since early 2007.
As a result, the dollar soared against its peers to highs not seen since March 2009. The dollar index traded at 89.357, flirting with the 2009 peak of 89.624. A break above would take the index back near decade highs.
Against the yen, the greenback hovered just below Friday's seven-year peak of 121.69. The euro, on the other hand, languished near a two-year trough of $1.2270.
Not helping sentiment for the common currency, Standard & Poor's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above junk.
For some analysts, the upbeat U.S. jobs report added to the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. In stark contrast, the European Central Bank is under pressure to expand its asset-buying stimulus program.
While the ECB disappointed some by its inaction last week, President Mario Draghi gave his clearest signal yet that quantitative easing may be on the cards early in 2015.
Draghi received support from fellow policy maker Ewald Nowotny on Friday even as Germany firmly maintained its opposition to buying sovereign bonds.
"EUR/USD is on its way to below 1.20 for the first time in a decade," analysts at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients, adding the greenback "still has plenty of room to the upside, and will be supported in 2015 by a sharp divergence in monetary policy."
Indeed, investors bought the greenback against all of its peers in the wake of the payrolls report, driving it to multi-year highs versus the Canadian and Australian dollars and a 15-month high on sterling.
The Aussie dipped below 83 U.S. cents for the first time in over four years, reaching a low of $0.8288. It could face further pressure if trade data out of China, Australia's biggest export market, were to disappoint.

CPI inflation likely fell to 5.80% for Oct  shows pollCPI-based inflation likely fell to 5.80 per cent for October, shows poll
Deepti Govind     Bangalore   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 14:22 IST

The country's inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 per cent of the CPI (Consumer Price Index) basket, and Capital Economics' economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
"Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards," Shah said.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 per cent in October from September's figure of 2.38 per cent, the Reuters poll showed.
Official government data for inflation will be released on Friday.
If the inflation forecast is met, it will be even lower than September's figure of 6.46 per cent and the slowest pace of price rise since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
Meeting the forecast would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
The poll also predicted that industrial production increased by a meager 0.6 per cent in September, albeit better than the August-figure of 0.4 per cent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply the domestic economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth .
"Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect," Shah said.
The economist said the central bank could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the Reserve Bank may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
"These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation - a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
"But the RBI is unlikely to oblige."
The country's apex bank will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March,2015 , after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the country's central bank to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 per cent well into 2015, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

Japan likely to delay sales-tax hikeJapan likely to delay sales-tax hike
Reuters
Tweet
TOKYO, Nov 11:  
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to delay a planned increase in the nation's sales tax, judging that the economic recovery remains too fragile to weather a further blow, a government official close to Abe's office said on Tuesday.
The comment comes as momentum appears to be building for Abe to delay the painful measure and call a snap election, with major parties scrambling to prepare for a possible campaign.
"There's a high probability that the consumption-tax hike will be delayed," the person told Reuters. "It looks like the government will begin full-fledged consideration of this."
Abe raised the tax to 8 per cent from 5 per cent in April, sending the world's third-biggest economy into its deepest contraction since the global financial crisis in the second quarter.
He is to decide after seeing gross domestic product data on Monday whether the economy is strong enough for the planned second stage of fiscal reform - raising the tax again to 10 per cent next October. Some of Abe's advisers have called for him to delay the increase for 18 months to April 2017.
Speculation of a tax-hike delay drive the benchmark Nikkei share average up 2.1 percent on Tuesday to a seven-year high.

Mumbai, Nov 11:  
Corporates would be required to disclose non-events such as loss of market share or technology obsolescence on a periodic basis (annually to start with) to shareholders through an exchange filing.
Outlining the future of corporate disclosures at an event in Mumbai today, Prashant Saran, Whole-Time Member, SEBI, said that companies would have to incorporate such information in the annual information memorandum and periodically update the prospectus filed by them at the time of their IPOs.
This, Saran said, would provide secondary market investors with updated information besides enabling companies to file for future capital raising in the form of rights or further public offerings (FPO).
"Right now the imperative is to build trust as a lot of trust has been lost in the last decade, we have to build it assiduously.We have been reviewing Clause 36 of the listing agreement (for timeliness and adequacy) and have suggested that corporates disclose all material events in a manner such that investors will get a meaningful understanding," Saran said.
SEBI's discussion paper dated August 19,2014 is expected to be taken up during the SEBI's next board meeting likely to be held this month.
Clause 36 of the equity listing agreement requires a listed entity to disclose the details of all events which will have a bearing on the performance/operations of the listed entity as well as price sensitive information to stock exchanges immediately. This usually consists of information on events such as strikes, lock-outs, closure on account of power cuts and the like.

Nkemiin Nokia  you will always be part of mymemoriesBRAND CHANGE: The Nokia Lumia 530 and the Microsoft Lumia 535.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:04 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 11:05 am
It was 2001. My aunt had just couriered me her old Nokia 3310 because she had got herself a new Nokia. Being an underpaid journalist far away from home, I was quick to latch on to the offer. I used that old phone for two years, during which period I fell in love and got married to the woman who is now my wife.
#NokiaStory: 10 Nokia phones India will always remember
The phone, and BSNL’s night time free SMS plan, paid a huge role in our courtship. Just after marriage my wife gifted me a new Nokia 6230 with a colour screen, a big upgrade.I  still have that phone somewhere in my house and I am pretty sure that if I charge it for a couple of hours, it should be able to work like before.
The Nokia timeline. (Click image to see enlarged version)
But a decade later, I cannot buy a Nokia phone anymore. Nor can I buy the kind of trust associated with that Finnish brand we all called the mobile phone for many years.
Today, Nokia’s new owners Microsoft Devices announced the launch of the Lumia 535. Yes, the first Lumia phone without the Nokia branding.  No surprises here, for we had reported earlier this year that this change was in the offing. But seeing the Nokia brand fade away brings in a flood of memories.
There are very few brands that would have touched our lives as much as Nokia and there would be very few of us who haven’t used their products at least once in our lives. I am sure each one of us has a Nokia story of our own.
The Lumia 535 has a 5-inch screen, 5-megapixel front and rear cameras and 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 200 processor, but no Nokia branding anywhere. It will be the Microsoft Lumia 535. This will be the first of many Microsoft Lumia devices, and usher in the last few months where we might be able to buy a Nokia branded device. Microsoft has the license to use the Nokia brand for few more years, but it seems Redmond does not want to  become more dependent on the legacy.
There are reports that, once the Microsoft license is over, Nokia will return, maybe with even an Android phone.
But till then, it is Goodbye Nokia. Or should we say näkemiin Nokia?
Do you also have a Nokia story that you want to share? Post in our comments below.

Villages along Indo-Bhutan border have no basic amenities: BodostudentsPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:58 pm
The All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) which organised a 22-day march through Chirang district in western Assam, said that the villages along the Indo-Bhutan border have no basic amenities like healthcare, drinking water and electricity, and roads are all practically non-existent.
“While 85 per cent of the people live below poverty line, illiteracy and lack of safe drinking water has made life hell in dozens of villages that we toured in three weeks. Moreover, witchcraft, black magic and proliferation of small arms have further complicated lives of the poo tribals,” said Phanin Boro, president of the Chirang district unit of ABSU.
The ABSU, which flagged off its first phase of “long march” on October 2 in Chirang, groups of student volunteers would march through three other Bodoland districts – Baksa, Kokrajhar and Udalguri – in the next eight to ten weeks. “We often talk about backwardness, poverty, illiteracy and diseases in our villages based on newspaper reports and stray allegations. But this long march has not only opened our eyes through first-hand experience but also helped us understand how thousands of poor tribals are suffering due to ignorance and lack of a voice,” said ABSU central committee president Pramod Boro. The ABU will come out with a detailed report of their findings after covering all the four districts.
In Chirang, most villages along the Indo-Bhutan boundary do not have road access to the outside world, with Khanindra Basumatary, general secretary of the ABSU’s Chirang unit saying people have to wade across rivers and streams to travel to the nearest road. “The village in which Priya Basumatary, a Class X student was brutally killed in full view of her parents and fellow villagers in August, for instance can be reached only after crossing two rivers,” Basumatary said.
“Most people drink water from rivers, streams and nullahs. Only a handful of slightly better-off families have hand pumps. This water-borne diseases and deaths caused by these are rampant,” Basumatary added. The group of 148 student volunteers who touched 372 villages in their 443-km “long march” carried out cleaned 169 school campuses, 59 temples, 27 churches and 20 village market-places apart from helping villagers in harvesting paddy in six villages.
The volunteers held small meetings and interactions with the people in each village and staged street-plays focusing on ill-effects of liquor, early marriage, illiteracy, witch-craft and other issues affecting the people’s lives. “We also highlighted the importance of attending schools, immunization, cleanliness and sanitation, though these are primary responsibilities of the elected government,” said ABSU central committee president Pramod Boro.
“In many primary schools we did not find teachers. Either they were absent on the day we visited, or have been not appointed at all. Thus more than half the enrolled students do not attend school at all. In many primary schools we found bidi butts all over. Either the students have been smoking, or teachers smoke bidi in school,” Basumatary said.
In many villages people also make traditional rice beer and illicit liquour in order to earn a livelihood. “We continued…

Lufthansa to start Airbus A380 flights to Mumbai from2015Print
Written by Geeta Gupta | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:53 pm
German airline Lufthansa has announced it will start operating the world’s largest commercial aircraft the Airbus A380 to Mumbai starting next summer.
Wolfgang Will, Director South Asia, said the airline plans to start flying between Mumbai and Frankfurt with the A380 from July-August 2015. This is despite the Mumbai airport, unlike the one in Delhi, having just one position/slot to land the A380.
The airline had earlier this week launched the A380 flights between Frankfurt and Delhi. The launch of the A380 flight to Delhi will see the airline offering 140 more seats a day from what was offered earlier. Similarly, the launch of the A380 to Mumbai will see the airline offering 170 more seats a day.
Will also announced that Lufthansa will offer ‘premium/economy’ seating to passengers flying between Bangalore and Frankfurt from November 22 this year. Lufthansa had launched the ‘premium/economy’ class (in between economy and business) globally this year.

An incomplete process
history
When in August 1961, the Soviet Union erected a 13-foot-high wall through Berlin to halt the flow of millions of people from the eastern part to the western part, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) dubbed it a “barrier against fascism”. It kept Germany divided for the next 28 years. “A wall is a hell of a lot better than a war,” was the initial, circumspect response from U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who was also not unmindful of the economic repercussions for the Eastern Bloc from mass emigration. At its 20th anniversary in 1981, Erich Honecker, the GDR’s head of state, thundered that the wall may stand for another hundred years. When the wall finally came crumbling down on November 9, 1989, it was seen as symbolising the end of the Cold War. It also conjured up images of the beginnings of a borderless world. Paradoxically, the freedom supposedly restored for the peoples of Eastern Europe on that fateful night 25 years ago seems to be in peril even today. The current opposition to freedom of movement within the member-states of the European Union is targeted at the countries that were admitted to the bloc only a decade ago. Compounding this is the tide of nationalism and jingoism sweeping across the continent. The bloodletting now witnessed on Europe’s borders stands in stark contrast to the non-violent political transformation in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and of course East Germany.
The western powers know full well that Russia’s annexation of Crimea early this year and its backing to rebel groups in Ukraine are not unrelated to the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to encompass the former Eastern Bloc countries. Moreover, NATO’s muscle-flexing vis-à-vis territories that have long been part of Moscow’s sphere of influence does not exactly strengthen economic interdependence between the regions, especially in the arena of energy supplies. Similarly, the regime of economic sanctions, which has inevitably triggered Russian retaliation and produced a crippling effect on business interests at home, is if anything a self-fulfilling proposition. Vladimir Putin’s recent utterances suggest that he may not be in any great hurry to relent. Mikhail Gorbachev’s warning over the weekend of a world on the brink of another Cold War must be heeded by the big powers as the ceasefire in Ukraine stands in danger of unravelling. Perhaps more than at any time since the fall of the wall, voices advocating Germany’s leadership position on the international stage are being heard loud and clear. Maybe there is merit in this, not just in view of the country’s economic clout, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s deft diplomatic skills.

PM Modi s  Make in India  Push to Depend on Chinese SteelGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: India's steel consumption is expected to grow at its fastest pace in five years next year on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's infrastructure push, but a scarcity of raw materials means it will be at the expense of another key goal - curbing imports.
In his triumphant election campaign, Mr Modi criticised the last government for exporting iron ore but importing steel. But his first five months as the prime minister has coincided with a surge in imports of both, denting his high-decibel drive to make India an export powerhouse.
India's steel imports from China, the world's biggest producer of the alloy, doubled in April-September from a year ago though the country has enough capacity to meet its demand.
While India's consumption is expected to rise, China will continue to see a downtrend, likely leading to a flood of cheap steel from China just as Mr Modi pushes ahead with a signature 'Make in India' initiative to boost industry.
Charged by the strongest electoral mandate in three decades, Mr Modi has staked his reputation on making India an export hub, launching his pet campaign with much fanfare in September with a lion as its logo.
Soaring steel imports, however, underscore the challenges Mr Modi faces in realising his dream. Steelmakers, such as JSW, are clamouring for higher import tariffs.
"The 'Make in India' slogan has to be true for steel also," said Ravinder Bhan, deputy general manager of marketing at state-owned Steel Authority of India. "Let steel firms get iron ore and other raw materials. But that's not happening."
India, Asia's third-largest economy, has become a major importer of iron ore and coal despite having big reserves of both at home. Once a top exporter, India is now bringing in shiploads of iron ore due to court action against illegal mining that has stifled supply, while coal behemoth Coal India is struggling to boost production.
The shortages mean that India's steel industry is running at 80 per cent of capacity. But the World Steel Association expects Mr Modi's pro-business plans - building 100 new 'smart' cities, creating new logistic hubs and residential townships - to spur steel demand that has been weak in recent years.
China imports jump
World Steel expects India's demand to rise 3.4 per cent to 76.2 million tonnes in 2014, after growth of 1.8 per cent in 2013. Structural reforms and improving confidence will support a further 6 per cent growth in 2015, it said.
Indian steelmakers such as JSW, Tata Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, however, run the risk of being priced out by their Chinese competitors.
"The global market is such that the only thing that you can do is take some protective action to save the (Indian) industry," said A.S. Firoz, chief economist at a Steel Ministry unit. "Otherwise you can't decide what the global prices will be or at what price China will export steel."
A Steel Ministry spokesman said he had no immediate comment on whether authorities would consider raising tariffs, although a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the issue was being looked into.
China, the world's largest steel producer, rolls more steel in a month than India, the fourth largest producer, manages in nine months. But a slowdown in China means it is set to end with a surplus of about 100 million tonnes a year.
"Made outside India"
A tonne of reinforcement steel produced in India for use in buildings can cost up to 15,000 rupees ($244) more than that from China, according to Firoz.
Shipments into India jumped 33 per cent to 4.19 million tonnes in April-September from a year ago, with imports from China leaping 108 per cent to 1.34 million tonnes. Total steel imports in the fiscal year to next March 31 could nearly double to 9 million tonnes, JSW predicts.
"Through 'Make in India', Modi is saying that India should be the hub for the rest of the world and of course to meet our full demand," said N.C. Mathur, president of the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association.
"Instead something made outside India is coming into the country. That's a big threat. It's a week after week, month after month survival issue."

Air India sets 2021 target for turnaroundAir India sets 2021 target for turnaround
Turnaround to be aided by govt bailout and several cost-saving and revenue-generating measures, a top official says

Mumbai: The loss-making Air India Ltd may turn around by 2021, aided by a government bailout and several cost-saving and revenue-generating measures, a top official said.
“There is a turnaround plan approved by the government. All the grants and financial assistance by the government are linked to achievement of turnaround targets. Roughly around 2021, we can expect the turnaround would be reasonably complete for Air India ,” said Ravindra H. Dholakia , member, board of directors, Air India.
Dholakia, talking on the sidelines of the 110th birth anniversary celebrations of industrialist J.R.D. Tata , said the airline’s performance has improved and is “improving steadily”. He, however, added that the environment has changed since the turnaround plan was approved.
“ Vistara (an airline floated by Tata Sons Ltd and Singapore Airlines waiting for final approvals) was not there when Air India prepared its turnaround plan. We did not know the dollar will go up to 60. But at the same time, nobody knew that jet fuel prices would go down,” Dholakia said.
The government approved a Rs.30,000 crore package to rescue the airline in April 2012. This included an upfront equity infusion of Rs.6,750 crore and assured equity support of Rs.23,481 crore till 2020-21. Banks have recast their exposure to the airline, resulting in interest savings of Rs.1,000 crore a year for the airline. Air India had a total debt of Rs.40,000 crore, as on 30 September 2014.
The state-run airline is expected to post a net loss of Rs.3,900 crore for the last fiscal. It posted a net loss of Rs.5,100 crore in 2012-13 and a net loss of Rs.7,100 crore in 2011-12.
Dholakia, however, said the yearly equity infusion is not sufficient to support Air India as the annual losses are more than the equity infusion.
Dholakia, who teaches at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is also heading a five-member committee appointed by the aviation ministry to suggest ways to cut costs and utilize resources optimally at Air India.
“Efficient operations, on-time performance, cost-cutting measures and revenue generation measures are going to help Air India turn around. The most important thing is to keep your head above the water levels till then,” Dholakia said.
Experts, however, are not convinced that the revival plan will work.
Hormuz P. Mama , an independent aerospace analyst said the fundamentals of Air India are still not sound. “Instead of running like a tight ship, Air India is run on the basis of social obligations against intense competition by private players. Air India should have been given a free hand to run its operations,” Mama said.
According to Dholakia, Air India has improved its on-time performance and passenger load factors considerably. However, he admitted that Air India has hurdles, including legacy cost, lack of route rationalization and a bloated workforce.
Air India board of director member, Ravindra H. Dholakia discusses a turnaround plan and three hurdles Air India faces: dated aircrafts, issues with routes and labour.
Competition has forced India’s airlines to cut fares to attract passengers, further denting profitability. India’s airlines lost an estimated $1.95 billion in 2012-13 on a combined revenue of $9.5 billion due to high fuel and other operational costs, according to consulting firm Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.
Apart from AirAsia India and Vistara, adding further competition, last year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways bought a 24% stake in Jet Airways (India) Ltd for Rs.2,058 crore, giving the Indian counterpart more financial muscle to compete.

DDA housing scheme draw gets further delayedComments
The much awaited draw for Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme has got further delayed.
The draw of lots, which was initially scheduled to be held on November 5, was postponed to November 10 after delay in the processing of applications. DDA vice chairman Balvinder Kumar had told Hindustan Times on Sunday that the draw is likely to be held on November 12 after successful trial runs but the land development agency has now discovered that there are still a lot of discrepancies in the applications submitted for the housing scheme.
DDA has now provided more time to applicants for checking out their applications online and get errors rectified, if any. “It has been decided to provide another opportunity to the applicants by DDA so that they can check discrepancies in application filed by them and the data displayed on our website,” said a DDA spokesperson.
Applicants can visit the DDA website  to check their applications online and in case of any discrepancy in the details submitted, they can report these directly to the Director (Systems), DDA at 011-24694157 to get the errors rectified.
The spokesperson said that this has been necessitated as even till Monday DDA is receiving corrections from the banks. DDA is facing problems from some banks such as Punjab National Bank, the data on applications received from which are still incomplete.
The total number of applications received by DDA for the housing scheme now stands at 10,08,700. DDA is yet to give a new deadline for holding the draw of lots.
DDA has started holding trial runs of the draw of lots from Monday and will continue as an effort is being made to compress the time being taken for the draw, the spokesperson said. On Monday, data of nearly five lakh applications were used to conduct a mock draw. “Initially, the data was taking more time for the draw and now it is being reduced to a minimum possible,” she said.

Ice cream is a job  not a treat  for this Afghan girlIce cream is a job, not a treat, for this Afghan girl

The gaggle of girls outside a school in Herat are all about the same age, but one of them sticks out.
Fatima, eight, isn't wearing a neat black and white uniform, or laughing and playing with classmates.
She is hard at work, selling ice creams to the other girls from her small cart as she tries to make enough money to feed her disabled father and the rest of her family.
Fatima yearns to go to school like her noisy, cheerful customers, but she is her family's only regular money-earner.
Her father, his two wives and six daughters all live in a dilapidated two-room, rented house with one bed and few other possessions.

She works from 7am to 4pm, starting her long day by picking up boxes of ice cream from a wholesaler and then pushing her cart through the rough and uneven streets of Herat city in the west of Afghanistan.
"My only and biggest dream is to have some money, so that I don't need to work anymore and can go to school and study just like other girls," Fatima told AFP.
"When I'm selling ice cream in front of this school and see other girls go inside, laughing and happy, I really wish I could go too."
Child labour is common in Afghanistan, with 17% of all girls aged between 7 and 14 either working outside the home or doing full-time household chores, according to UNICEF.
Fatima makes just a few dollars a day, and spends it all looking after her family, who eat a simple daily meal of vegetables, rice and bread.

Her father Ab Zahir is in a wheelchair, with his legs paralysed after a spine accident when he was working as a labourer in neighbouring Iran four years ago.
On days when he feels well enough, he tries to help his daughter by selling mobile phone cards.
Back at their home, Fatima helps him move laboriously from his bed to his wheelchair, and she also fixes on his feet braces and massages and cleans his withered limbs.
It is a heavy burden for a young child.
"I cannot afford to eat ice cream. I like it, though," she said. "I don't like being poor."

SAN FRANCISCO — Google has signed a long-term lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics.
The giant Internet company will pay $1.16 billion in rent over 60 years for the property, which also includes a working air field, golf course and other buildings. The 1,000-acre site is part of the former Moffett Field Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Peninsula.
Google plans to invest more than $200 million to refurbish the hangars and add other improvements, including a museum or educational facility that will showcase the history of Moffett and Silicon Valley, according to a NASA statement. The agency said a Google subsidiary called Planetary Ventures LLC will use the hangars for "research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies."
Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have a well-known interest in aviation and space. The company has recently acquired several smaller firms that are working on satellite technology and robotics. But a Google spokesperson declined Monday to discuss specific plans for the property, which is located just a few miles from the company's main campus in Mountain View.
NASA plans to continue operating its Ames Research Center on the former Navy site. Google will take over operations at the runways and hangars, including a massive structure that was built to house dirigible-style Navy airships in the 1930s. NASA said the deal will save it $6.3 million in annual maintenance and operation costs.
Local officials praised Google's promise to restore the historic structure known as Hangar One, which is a San Francisco Bay Area landmark. U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, called the lease agreement "a major win for our region."
Google already has a separate lease for another portion of the former air base, where it wants to build a second campus. Page and Brin have also used the Moffett runways for their collection of private jets, under another lease arrangement that's been criticized by some watchdog groups who say NASA gave the executives a sweetheart deal.

RBI won t let Rupee go above 65/$: BofA-ML | Gold below Rs 26 000Bofa-ML
("Our call that the RBI will…)
NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to hold the rupee in the 58-62/$ range with lower oil prices and gold import curbs offsetting US Dollar strength, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch (India). The bank continues to expect the RBI to recoup foreign exchange reserves to guard against contagion.
"Our call that the RBI will hold Rs 58-62/$ has held so far, although the stronger US Dollar may force a temporary breach," the bank says. In case the Rupee breaches 62/$, BofA-ML expects the RBI to mount a token defense, selling around $500 million-$1 billion.
"RBI would ideally want to hold Governor Raghuram Rajan's preferred 60-62/$ zone. At the same time, it will not spend too much of precious foreign exchange at a time the Rupee has outperformed most BRIC/TIM currencies," the bank feels.
The bank believes that RBI will be able to hold Rupee expectations beyond 62/$. Rajan will be able to anchor Rupee expectations if he takes the Foreign Exchange market into confidence, says BofA-ML.
Is there a risk of the rupee depreciating to levels beyond 65 versus the US dollar? Bofa-ML is of the opinion that Rajan will not allow that to happen and will step up an aggressive defence. "We expect the RBI to mount a full barrelled defense to anchor expectations, at 65/$, selling up to $20 billion, if need be."
"Given the low import cover, the Rupee has tended to fall below the previous low in each successive rounds of volatility. The Rupee dropped to 53/$ during the end-2011 European crisis. It fell further to 57/$ during the 2012 Greek crisis. The Rupee collapsed to 68/$ during the taper tantrum of 2013. Against this backdrop, Rajan will not want to take chances with Rupee expectations beyond 65/$," the bank explains.
BofA-ML adds that dollar strength should continue to be offset by falling oil prices and gold import restrictions. Given gold import curbs, the bank forecasts the current account deficit at a manageable 1.5% of GDP for the current fiscal at its house $100/bbl Brent forecast.

Singles Day shoppers spend $6 billion on Alibaba

(The ecommerce giant said…)
HANGZHOU: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said more than $6 billion of goods have been sold so far during its annual Singles' Day online shopping frenzy, as customers jumped on heavily discounted goods to send sales surging past 2013's record high.
More than 39 billion yuan ($6.4 billion) worth of goods was sold on the e-commerce giant's websites 15 hours into the event on Tuesday, with another nine to go.
Less than eight weeks after its public share listing in New York , which set its own $25 billion record, expectations for this year are high.
Alibaba did 35 billion yuan in business during last year's festival, and Tech research firm IDC predicts this year's total gross merchandise volume (GMV) will reach $8.62 billion.
Less than 18 minutes into this year's "11.11 Shopping Festival", GMV had already hit $1 billion, the company said.
The numbers are boosted by Alibaba's "pre-sales initiative". Merchants advertised Singles' Day prices as early as Oct. 15, taking deposits for the items but only processing full payments and shipping the goods on Singles' Day itself.
Though the 27,000 vendors that take part can boost their sales and gain customers by being featured on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping sites, some have also complained the sharp discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits.
Chinese e-commerce rival JD.com Inc said on its official Twitter account that orders in the first 10 hours of Singles' Day had more than doubled compared with last year, up 140 percent.
China's Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd, the world's third-largest smartphone maker, which also uses the Singles' Day festival to boost turnover, said on its official Weibo account its sales had so far surpassed 1.2 billion yuan, selling more than 853,000 phones.
The "11.11 Shopping Festival", which Alibaba says is the world's biggest 24-hour online sale, began in 2009 when just 27 merchants on the company's Tmall.com site offered deep discounts to boost sales during an otherwise slack period.
This year's festival is global, reaching shoppers in more than 200 countries, the company said.

Gold traded 0.7% lower at Rs 25,552 per 10 gm on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India on Tuesday, underscoring weak sentiment in the metal as the dollar strengthened because of the US economic revival.
The fall of the front-month gold contract below Rs 26,000 resulted in a marginal increase in demand for the wedding season. MCX gold tracks the price of the metal traded on overseas bourse Comex, part of the CME Group.
"Sentiment is weak primarily because of a stronger dollar," said Sudheesh Nambiath, senior analyst at precious metals consultancy GFMS Thomson Reuters. "But the fall has raised demand a tad, better than what it was during Diwali. That's also helped hold premiums at between $15 and $20 an ounce."

Portfolios allocation to be done by weekend: Goa CM ParsekarPrint
Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said that he would retain majority of portfolios which were with his predecessor.
By: Press Trust of India | Panaji | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:15 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 1:18 pm
Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar will expand his cabinet and allocate portfolios to his ministers during this weekend.
Portfolios would be allocated by Saturday after consulting former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Parsekar said here on Tuesday.
Parsekar was inducted as chief minister last Saturday after Parrikar took over as the new Union Defence Minister.
Nine others were also sworn in as ministers.
The government is yet to fill two more posts to make the entire cabinet of 12 ministers.
He said that he would retain majority of portfolios which were with his predecessor.
“All the portfolios which are crucial for functioning of the chief minister will be retained by me,” he said, adding, he would decentralise the entire functioning of the government.
“I will not interfere in the functioning of their (ministers) ministries. They will have all right to function the way they want. I will be just guiding them,” Parsekar said, hinting at Parrikar’s style of working, who was accused of wielding control over all the ministries.

Mumbai, Nov 11:  
Shares of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) showed a mixed trend on the BSE today after the RBI tightened norms for these firms by asking them to have a much stronger capital base.
SREI Infrastructure Finance tumbled 5.95 per cent, while Religare Enterprises fell 2.48 per cent on the BSE. On the other hand, shares of IDFC rose 3 per cent, while LIC Housing Finance was up 3 per cent.
As per the latest directives announced yesterday, RBI has raised the limit for NBFCs to maintain the net owned fund (NOF) requirement to Rs 2 crore.
At present, the NOF requirement is Rs 25 lakh. In a phased manner, the NBFCs would be required to raise it to Rs 1 crore by March 2016 and further double it to Rs 2 crore by 2017, the RBI said.
The move comes at a time when thousands of companies, including various small entities and some large ones, have been under the scanner for illicit fund-raising activities across the country.
In India, the total assets being managed by the financial sector is estimated at $2.8 trillion, out of which over $300 billion are with NBFCs.
With a view to streamline the regulations for the NBFC space, RBI said it would cancel the registration if the companies fail to adhere to norms, starting April 1, 2015 in a phased manner, as against the current practice of ‘temporary suspension’ of Certificate of Registration.

HPCL to take 8% stake in Petronet’s Gangavaram LNG terminal
PTI

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
State-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) may pick up 8 per cent stake in Petronet LNG Ltd’s Rs 5,000 crore liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh.
“HPCL has evinced interest in taking stake in the terminal as they have a huge requirement of gas at Visakhapatnam refinery,” a top Petronet official said.
The Viskhapatnam refinery of HPCL, which is only a few kilometers away from Gangaravam port, is being expanded to 15 million tonnes per annum from current 8.33 million tonnes and the expanded unit will have a gas requirement of close to 2.5-3 million standard cubic meters per day.
“We have earmarked a total of 24 per cent shareholding for strategic investors and ports. Out of this, the Gangavaram port has already taken 8 per cent and a similar stake is being offered to LNG suppliers. So HPCL can get 8 per cent equity,” he said.
Andhra Pradesh government too has evinced interest and is likely to get 5 per cent stake, leaving Petronet with 69 per cent shareholding.
Years ago, HPCL had missed the LNG bus when it got left out of the PSU consortium that formed Petronet. Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL and Bharat Petroleum each have 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet.
The official said gas utility GAIL India Ltd has evinced interest in booking half of the 5 million tonnes a year import capacity of the proposed terminal.
“We are in discussions with GAIL but nothing has been finalised as yet,” he said.
The Gangavaram project received all approvals of the state government only last month, a good one-and-half-year behind schedule, and Petronet is now looking to build an import facility by 2018.
This will be Petroent’s first import facility on the east coast. It already has a 10 million tonnes a year terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and a 5 million tonnes unit at Kochi in Kerala.
Petronet is expanding Dahej to 15 million tonnes by end of 2016 and plans to add another 2.5 million tonnes capacity at a cost of about Rs 1,100 crore.
The official said the company is looking for strategic partners who can either bring in gas turned into liquid at minus 160 degrees Celsius (liquefied natural gas or LNG) or buy a minimum quantity of the imported fuel to be sold in the domestic market.

Data tariffs may fall 20% with Reliance Jios entry: FitchData tariffs may fall 20% with Reliance Jio’s entry: Fitch
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
The entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in the telecom space will intensify competition and may bring data tariffs down by at least 20 per cent, Fitch Ratings said today.
It, however, said no tariff wars are expected as witnessed during the 2009-2013 period.
“The likely entry of new telco Reliance Jio, which is a part of Reliance Industries Ltd, will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20 per cent,” Fitch said in its 2015 outlook for Indian telecommunications services.
Reliance Industries had announced that it would launch commercial 4G telecom service of RJio in 2015 entailing an investment of Rs 70,000 crore.
Fitch said Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents’ core voice business, given a weak “voice-over-LTE” technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India.
“We do not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs,” Fitch said.
Fitch expects the top four Indian telcos — Bharti Airtel Ltd (Bharti; BBB—/Stable), Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications — to increase their revenue market share to around 83 per cent by 2015 from the current 79 per cent in the $30-billion industry.
“Industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos’ 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32-33 per cent (2014: 32 per cent) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs,” it said.
Fitch said the top four telcos will generate a minimal free cash flow margin due to higher capex and flat EBITDA; the 2015 industry capex/revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investment.

Chhattisgarh: 8 women die after sterilisation surgery in govt camp  4 docs suspendedEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Maharashtra: Fadnavis keeps Plan B ready as Sena  BJP spar in HouseWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

PM Modi marches on  gives lift to BJP s new faces in Centre  statesPM Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah give lift to new faces in Centre, states and party

Modi, who took office in May after sweeping to power with a massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, now heads a 66-member council of ministers , with 26 ministers holding Cabinet rank.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajiv Pratap Rudy, JP Nadda, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who were earlier engaged in party affairs, are now a part of his team .
Their engagement at the frontline will put the onus on party president Amit Shah to create a new second line of leadership at a time when the going is good for the BJP.
As is perceived with Modi, there seems to be a plan in the manner in which leaders are being picked for the Centre and in states. Here’s a list of those rising through the ranks.
In Modi government
Manohar Parrikar , defence minister: He has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, health and family welfare minister: Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims to be a disciplined solider of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is seen as the spiritual and ideological guide of the BJP.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy , skill development and entrepreneurship, parliamentary affairs minister: He was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the single largest party after the recent assembly elections.
Mahesh Sharma, culture, tourism and civil aviation minister: A doctor, Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA. He is now the MP from Gautam Budh Nagar constituency in Uttar Pradesh.
Ram Shankar Katheria, MoS human resource development: A PhD holder and writer of books on social issues and uplift of Dalits, among others, Katheria's elevation as a MoS is being seen as a move which would help the party in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
Hansraj Ahir, MoS chemicals and fertilisers: He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. An active parliamentarian, Ahir has introduced a number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, MoS minority affairs, parliamentary affairs: A vocal BJP spokesperson, Naqvi has been the Muslim face of the party for long.
Giriraj Singh, MoS micro, small and medium enterprises: His emergence on the national political scene has been rather dramatic. A firebrand Bhumihar leader, he has influence over vast pockets in southern Bihar and election-bound Jharkhand. He was a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government in Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015.
Ram Kripal Yadav, MoS drinking water and sanitation: Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both houses of Parliament, where he had represented Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign in the state for the 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, MoS urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation: The singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol was a huge boost for the party.
Jayant Sinha , MoS finance: Sinha, is a former corporate insider with wide experience in governance and strategy consulting. He is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a BTech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, MoS water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation: He defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. He is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje cabinet to contest the elections.
Mohan Kundariya, MoS agricultutre: He is an influential leader from the Patel community and MP from Rajkot. A powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, MoS human resource development: A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academic and was a part of the party's anti-corruption campaign.
Vijay Sampla, MoS social justice and empowerment: It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to the Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, MoS home affairs: He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been a BJP member since 1988, and was the vice-president of the party’s Gujarat unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, MoS food processing industries: The lone woman inducted into the Modi cabinet in the expansion, Jyoti is an MP from Fatehpur. She defeated the Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life.

New faces in party
BJP president Shah has also carried out a major organisational reshuffle, giving important assignments to performers and bringing in new faces.
OP Mathur: The Rajasthan leader — who as election in-charge in Maharashtra polls won accolades — has been given charge of Uttar Pradesh. This is a job that Shah himself looked after in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.
Shrikant Sharma: As party secretary, he oversaw media affairs during the Lok Sabha polls. He has been given the charge of Himachal Pradesh, which the BJP lost to the Congress last year.
Vinay Sahasrabuddhe: Party vice-president and a close aide of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. He has been given charge of Madhya Pradesh.
Prabhat Jha: The Rajya Sabha MP will continue to oversee party affairs in Delhi while general secretary P Murlidhar Rao, another leader with RSS background, gets charge of Karnataka, which goes to poll in 2018.
Trivendra Singh Rawat: Former Uttarakhand minister and a Thakur leader, he worked closely with Shah as joint in-charge of Uttar Pradesh during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in-charge of poll-bound Jharkhand.
Shyam Jaju: The party secretary worked closely with Team Modi during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in charge of Uttarakhand.
Satish Upadhyay: He is president of the party’s Delhi unit and will be kept busy ahead of polls, most likely in January or February next year.
Chief ministers
Mohan Lal Khattar , Haryana: Khattar is a former RSS pracharak.
Devendra Fadnavis , Maharashtra: The 18th chief minister of Maharashtra was an active Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in college. In the ABVP, he started as a grassroots worker, painting walls and sticking promotional posters for established leaders.

Coimbatore, Nov 11:  
Engineering Export promotion Council (EEPC) India has inked an agreement with Deutsche Messe for 'Partner Country' status at Hannover Fair, scheduled between April 13 and 17 at Hannover in Germany.
This, according to an EEPC release, would give Indian hi-tech products and services instant visibility at this global event. The Ministry of Commerce has mandated EEPC India along with the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) for organising the high level participation.
The Executive Director and Secretary of EEPC India, Bhaskar Sarkar, and the Senior Vice-President of Deutsche Messe, Marc Siemering, have signed the agreement.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend this event.
India, which has been participating in Hannover Messe for several years now, was a partner country in 2006.
According to the release, participation in 2006 generated total business worth $1.3 billion. Several major deals were finalised, including joint ventures between Mann Age and Force Motors, Deutsche Bann and Indian Railways, during the Hannover Fair in Germany in April 2006.
“India and Germany have over $21 billion bilateral engagements and Germany is one of India’s largest trading partners. There is potential for further growth of foreign direct investment and we are hoping that through participation in Hannover Messe, we will be able to further strengthen the Indo-German trade relationship. A major focus will be to reinforce our global supply chain by attracting some key global investors from the fair to our country,” said Anupam Shah, India Chairman, EEPC.
“India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and our engagement will prove highly beneficial for both the countries. This alliance would give India an opportunity to stimulate its economic growth and provide a suitable platform to engage with exhibitors from across the globe. Deutsche Messe in India, would in the coming months support the Indian Government build participation for the show,” Siemering said.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Commodity markets regulator FMC has discontinued guarseed and guargum contracts for three months — October to December — at the MCX platform due to insufficient liquidity in them.
The running contracts have been discontinued at the request of MCX itself.
“The Commission on October 20 approved discontinuation of the October, November and December 2014 guarseed and guargum contracts at MCX,” Forward Markets Commission (FMC) said in its latest report.
“MCX had requested for discontinuation of guar contracts. We approved their request as the contracts had insufficient liquidity,” a senior FMC official said.
Currently, its competitor NCDEX is offering guarseed and guargum contracts for delivery up to March 2015.
FMC has also asked exchanges to charge a minimum initial deposit amount of 5 per cent in case of guargum and guarseed keeping in view the recent price movement and volatility.
With the arrival of guar crop, prices of guarseed and guargum in the futures market have come under pressure.
The future price of guarseed for December month delivery at the NCDEX are quoting over Rs 5,000 per quintal now, as against Rs 6,540 in August.
Similarly, the future price of guargum has declined to Rs 14,200 per quintal from the peak of Rs 17,800 in the same period, as per the exchange data.

Nkemiin Nokiayou will always be part of my memoriesBRAND CHANGE: The Nokia Lumia 530 and the Microsoft Lumia 535.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:04 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 11:05 am
It was 2001. My aunt had just couriered me her old Nokia 3310 because she had got herself a new Nokia. Being an underpaid journalist far away from home, I was quick to latch on to the offer. I used that old phone for two years, during which period I fell in love and got married to the woman who is now my wife.
#NokiaStory: 10 Nokia phones India will always remember
The phone, and BSNL’s night time free SMS plan, paid a huge role in our courtship. Just after marriage my wife gifted me a new Nokia 6230 with a colour screen, a big upgrade.I  still have that phone somewhere in my house and I am pretty sure that if I charge it for a couple of hours, it should be able to work like before.
The Nokia timeline. (Click image to see enlarged version)
But a decade later, I cannot buy a Nokia phone anymore. Nor can I buy the kind of trust associated with that Finnish brand we all called the mobile phone for many years.
Today, Nokia’s new owners Microsoft Devices announced the launch of the Lumia 535. Yes, the first Lumia phone without the Nokia branding.  No surprises here, for we had reported earlier this year that this change was in the offing. But seeing the Nokia brand fade away brings in a flood of memories.
There are very few brands that would have touched our lives as much as Nokia and there would be very few of us who haven’t used their products at least once in our lives. I am sure each one of us has a Nokia story of our own.
The Lumia 535 has a 5-inch screen, 5-megapixel front and rear cameras and 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 200 processor, but no Nokia branding anywhere. It will be the Microsoft Lumia 535. This will be the first of many Microsoft Lumia devices, and usher in the last few months where we might be able to buy a Nokia branded device. Microsoft has the license to use the Nokia brand for few more years, but it seems Redmond does not want to  become more dependent on the legacy.
There are reports that, once the Microsoft license is over, Nokia will return, maybe with even an Android phone.
But till then, it is Goodbye Nokia. Or should we say näkemiin Nokia?
Do you also have a Nokia story that you want to share? Post in our comments below.

Modi opts for ability over experience in Cabinet rejigPM opts for ability over experience in Cabinet rejig
Mail Today –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have prioritised leaders’ expertise above experience while picking new members of his Cabinet.
Several leaders who were sworn in as Union ministers on Sunday have little experience as members of Parliament.
Modi, who was three-time chief minister of Gujarat, also entered the portals of Parliament for the first time as the prime minister.
Like Modi, more than half of the 21 new ministers who took the oath of office on Sunday are first-time MPs. A few of them, like former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, will become an MP only after being sworn in as Union ministers.
Experience as a Parliamentarian, it seems, is not a criterion to join Team Modi. Otherwise, leaders like Rajyavardhan Rathore and Babul Supriyo woudn’t have been made ministers of the BJP-led NDA government.
Rathore and Supriyo are debutants in Parliament and politics. Rathore, a former Army officer who won a silver medal in Olympics, and Supriyo, a Bollywood singer, had joined the BJP just ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
Supriyo rose as a young face of the BJP in West Bengal and successfully entered Modi's good books after his victory in the general elections.
During an election campaign in Asansol, Modi had told voters: “I want Babul in Parliament. You please elect him from Asansol.”
Even seasoned politician J.P. Nadda, who has been at the helm of BJP affairs for a number of years, was nominated as a Rajya Sabha member only in 2012.
Other first-time MPs in Modi’s council of ministers are Dr. Mahesh Sharma from Noida and Sanwar Lal Jat, a close confidant of Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje. Lal is an MP from the Ajmer Lok Sabha seat.
Another new entrant is Hoshiarpur MP Vijay Sampla, whose humble background has caught the attention of many in the party. A Dalit leader, Sampla was a plumber in the Gulf before he returned to India.
Telugu Desam Party’s Y.S. Chowdary, who was sworn in as a minister of state, is a first-time Rajya MP. Chowdary is also one of the richest parliamentarians whose assets are worth around Rs 190 crore.
Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha’s son Jayant, who entered Parliament for the first time this year, is an IIT-ian and an alumnus of Harvard University. Jayant worked in the corporate world for around 25 years.

Sunil Mittal demands  respect  from govt  wants support for India Inc to counter ChinaEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Indian companies will need active help from the new government in expanding overseas, but such support has been lacking in the past as against China which has always put its might behind its enterprises, leading industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal said today.
“We are facing might of Chinese state wherever we go abroad,” said Mittal, who heads telecom-to-retail conglomerate Bharti group.
Sharing his experiences from the past, Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of USD 100 million for a project.
“I conveyed it in MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and officers in PMO (Prime Minister Office) but nothing moved after that. I could only convey. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of $1 billion to Sri Lanka which helped its companies,” Mittal said at the India Global Forum here.
He said Indian companies started venturing abroad and investing big after Tata acquired European steel firm Corus in 2006 and soon it was followed by acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.
“Indian companies are making big investments abroad. Some of them are extremely successful, some moderate and some are in the process. In Africa, I have seen good amount of goodwill for India. Though we cannot match the amount of money they (China) commit in Africa but government can support Indian businesses there,” Mittal said.
Airtel acquired African telecom operator Zain in 2010 for $10.7 billion. The telecom major operates in 17 African countries but is yet to register profit.
At the same event, Wockhardt Chairman and Group CEO Habil Khorakiwala said that Indian companies have brought down price of HIV drugs by about 98 per cent in Africa which was earlier unaffordable for people there.
Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the new government but more needs to be done.
“PM (Narendra Modi) is now making bold moves overseas. He asked us to introduce ourself in Japan,” Mittal said.
But unlike foreign businessmen who are made part of delegation when their ministers visit overseas, Indian businessmen are given a badge which says “coinciding with visit of Prime Minister”, he added.
“I have asked senior officials to at least make ‘accompanying’ if not call it delegates. We deserve some respect,” Mittal said.
Bharti Enterprise chairman recalled a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin where Russian conglomerate Sistema’s chairman Yevtushenkov was present during the meeting between heads of the two states.
Mittal said, “A PMO official after the meeting asked me who is Yevtushenkov and said Putin was asking PM why don’t you give a telecom licence to him.
“I said you should have taken me along with you and I could have also asked for licence in Russia.”
Indian businesses can play key role in helping the government build good relationship overseas but states also need to support them, he said.
US companies like Google, Facebook, Apple get tremendous support from their governments, he added.

Domestic LPG Cannot be Sold to Non-State Marketeers: ReportGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: In a setback to non-state LPG marketeers, the government's top law officer has ruled that all domestically produced cooking gas (LPG) should necessarily be sold to public sector undertakings for subsidised sale to consumers.
Ranjit Kumar, Solicitor General of India (SGI), the country's second highest law offer, has upheld the Oil Ministry's view that sale of LPG by domestic producers to anyone other than state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) is not permissible under LPG Control Order.
In his opinion on a query by the ministry, he said non-state LPG sellers - called parallel marketeers - cannot source the fuel from domestic refiners. They have to import LPG if they intend to sell the cooking fuel in domestic market.
Sources said Mr Kumar in his opinion upheld the ministry's view that parallel marketeer's distribution/sale in the domestic market could only be of imported LPG subject to conditions prescribed in the LPG Control Order.
While India is surplus in refining capacity, it does not produce enough LPG to meet all of its demand. LPG is produced by public sector firms like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) as well as private firms like Reliance Industries. LPG is sold to the consumer mostly through distributors appointed by government at subsidised rates.
Reliance Industries, the largest single location LPG producer in the country, had last year contested the ministry view saying rules do not mandate that all domestic LPG must be sold only to state firms. It had allegedly sold the cooking gas produced at its Jamangar, Hazira and Patalganga plants to retail customers.
According to sources, on the ministry's query on what action should be initiated against those LPG producer who had sold LPG in parallel market, the SGI said the action should be in accordance with the law.
Mr Kumar stated that parallel marketers were allowed to sell LPG sourced from domestic refiners from 2005. And so, they should be first given a notice/warning that they cannot sell domestically produced LPG to the consumer directly and action as per law may be taken only if they do not adhere to the notice/warning.
The SGI said the LPG Control Order of 2000 defines parallel marketeer as someone who is carrying on business of importing, storing, transporting, marketing and distributing of LPG. It does not prohibit the parallel marketeer from producing LPG but it cannot sell such production directly to consumers.
The LPG Order nowhere permits the domestically produced LPG to be sold by a parallel marketeer, who is a person other than a government oil company, and that such parallel marketeer could only distribute/sell imported LPG.

Mutual Fund Asset Base at Record High of Rs 11 Lakh Cr in October
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 10, 2014 19:44 (IST)
The mutual fund industry's assets under management (AUM) climbed to record high of nearly Rs 11
lakh crore in October on the back of strong capital inflows and surge in equity markets.
     
The country's 45 fund houses together had an average AUM of Rs 10,95,653 crore at the end of October 31, 2014, up from Rs 9,59,415 crore in the preceding month, according to the data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).
     
The AUM data for individual fund house is not being disclosed.
     
Industry experts said the monthly rise in AUM is largely on account of gains in equity markets and strong capital inflows. Besides, retail participation in equity schemes has increased significantly during the recent months.
     
The fund houses together witnessed an inflow of Rs 1.24 lakh crore. During the month, the benchmark BSE Sensex grew by over 1,200 points or nearly five per cent.
     
The assets managed by mutual funds had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore-mark for the first time in May, when the markets went up after the General Elections' result.
     
Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.

Google signs 60-year  $1-billion NASA leaseGoogle signs 60-year, $1-billion NASA lease
PTI
Google recently acquired several smaller firms that are working on satellite technology and robotics.
San Francisco, Nov 11:  
Google has signed a long-term lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics.
The giant Internet company will pay $1.16 billion in rent over 60 years for the property, which also includes a working air field, golf course and other buildings. The 1,000-acre (400-hectare) site is part of the former Moffett Field Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Peninsula.
Google plans to invest more than $200 million to refurbish the hangars and add other improvements, including a museum or educational facility that will showcase the history of Moffett and Silicon Valley, according to a NASA statement.
The agency said a Google subsidiary called Planetary Ventures LLC will use the hangars for “research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies.”
Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have a well-known interest in aviation and space. The company recently acquired several smaller firms that are working on satellite technology and robotics. But a Google spokesperson declined yesterday to discuss specific plans for the property, which is located just a few miles (km) from the company’s main campus in Mountain View.
NASA plans to continue operating its Ames Research Center on the former Navy site. Google will take over operations at the runways and hangars, including a massive structure that was built to house dirigible-style Navy airships in the 1930s.
NASA said the deal will save it $6.3 million in annual maintenance and operation costs.
Local officials praised Google’s promise to restore the historic structure known as Hangar One, which is a San Francisco Bay Area landmark.
Google already has a separate lease for another portion of the former air base, where it wants to build a second campus. Page and Brin have also used the Moffett runways for their collection of private jets, under another lease arrangement that’s been criticized by some watchdog groups who say NASA gave the executives a sweetheart deal.

PM embarks on 10-day tour to attend key summitsPM arrives in Myanmar; to step up ties with ASEAN
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
The 12th ASEAN-India summit kicks off tomorrow with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to make a strong pitch to step up engagement with the 10-nation bloc by improving regional connectivity to give a boost to trade and people-to-people contacts.
Modi arrived in the Myanmarese capital this afternoon by a special Air India plane, starting his 10-day three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia for the G-20 Summit and bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott and Fijian premier J V Bainimarama.
Modi was received by Myanmar Health Minister Than Aung at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport.
“Landed in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar to a very warm welcome! Great being in this beautiful country,” Modi tweeted after his arrival.
The Prime Minister will attend the India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.
‘Act East’ policy
Asserting that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is at the core of India’s ‘Act East’ policy, the Prime Minister said before leaving for Myanmar that he was looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take “our relationship to a new level, which will supplement our deepening bilateral ties with each member’’.
“ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration and where India will play a crucial role, ” Modi said, adding that ties with ASEAN are “deep rooted’’.
Modi expressed confidence that these meetings with the leaders of ASEAN and East Asian blocs would be fruitful.
India-ASEAN 5-year plan
Indian officials said New Delhi is keen that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should lay emphasis on enhancing people-to-people contacts, augmenting trade, besides reinforcing strategic and political engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
An ambitious project is underway to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand. It was originally envisaged to be completed around 2017 but it is behind schedule and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway.
Bilateral trade
Officials said the free trade pact in services and investment between India and the ASEAN is expected to help the bilateral trade touch $100 billion by 2015.
The bilateral trade grew 4.6 per cent from $68.4 billion in 2011 to $71.6 billion in 2012.
ASEAN’s exports were valued at $43.84 billion and imports from India amounted to $27.72 billion in 2012.
The ASEAN community has the third largest population. It would be the seventh largest economy in the world and the third fastest growing economic unit this century.
It comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
East Asia Summit
Modi will be also participating in the 18-nation East Asia Summit (EAS) on Thursday before leaving for Brisbane to attend the G20 Summit.
“At the East Asia Summit, I look forward to discussing with ASEAN and seven global leaders how we can strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity,” the Prime Minister said ahead of the deliberations.
The EAS comprises 10 ASEAN nations, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.
On the sidelines of the international summits in Myanmar, Modi is slated to meet Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Singapore President Tony Tan, besides the host President Thein Sein.

HPCL to take 8 per cent stake in Petronet's Gangaravam LNG terminal

(The official said gas utility…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) may pick up 8 per cent stake in Petronet LNG Ltd's Rs 5,000 crore liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh.
"HPCL has evinced interest in taking stake in the terminal as they have a huge requirement of gas at Visakhapatnam refinery," a top Petronet official said.
The Viskhapatnam refinery of HPCL, which is only a few kilometers away from Gangaravam port, is being expanded to 15 million tonnes per annum from current 8.33 million tonnes and the expanded unit will have a gas requirement of close to 2.5-3 million standard cubic meters per day.
"We have earmarked a total of 24 per cent shareholding for strategic investors and ports. Out of this, the Gangavaram port has already taken 8 per cent and a similar stake is being offered to LNG suppliers. So HPCL can get 8 per cent equity," he said.
Andhra Pradesh government too has evinced interest and is likely to get 5 per cent stake, leaving Petronet with 69 per cent shareholding.
Years ago, HPCL had missed the LNG bus when it got left out of the PSU consortium that formed Petronet. Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL and Bharat Petroleum each have 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet.
The official said gas utility GAIL India Ltd has evinced interest in booking half of the 5 million tonnes a year import capacity of the proposed terminal.
"We are in discussions with GAIL but nothing has been finalised as yet," he said.
The Gangavaram project received all approvals of the state government only last month, a good one-and-half-year behind schedule, and Petronet is now looking to build an import facility by 2018.
This will be Petroent's first import facility on the east coast. It already has a 10 million tonnes a year terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and a 5 million tonnes unit at Kochi in Kerala.
Petronet is expanding Dahej to 15 million tonnes by end of 2016 and plans to add another 2.5 million tonnes capacity at a cost of about Rs 1,100 crore.
The official said the company is looking for strategic partners who can either bring in gas turned into liquid at minus 160 degrees Celsius (liquefied natural gas or LNG) or buy a minimum quantity of the imported fuel to be sold in the domestic market.

(Having sold its operations…)
LONDON: Vodafone nudged its forecasts for core earnings higher on Tuesday after reporting a sharp improvement in its main quarterly revenue measurement helped by growing demand for mobile services in its big European markets.
The British group reported second-quarter organic service revenue, which strips out items like handset sales and currency movements, down 1.5 per cent, compared with the near 4 or 5 per cent falls it recorded in the last six quarters. It also beat the consensus of a fall of 2.8 per cent.
The world's second-biggest mobile operator said it now expected its full-year core earnings to be between 11.6 billion pounds and 11.9 billion pounds, compared with the previous guidance of between 11.4 billion pounds and 11.9 billion pounds.
"We have made encouraging progress during the quarter," said Chief Executive Vittorio Colao . "There is growing evidence of stabilisation in a number of our European markets, supported by improvements in our commercial execution and very strong demand for data.
"Our two year, 19 billion pound investment programme is well underway, and customers are beginning to see the benefits."
Having sold its operations in the United States, Vodafone is investing some of the proceeds on new, faster 4G networks to satisfy customers' growing appetite for data.
But that has comes against the backdrop of cut-throat competition as operators battle weak demand in some struggling European economies. Regulatory changes, such as cutting the charges operators can impose to connect calls across networks, have also been a drag.
But results on Tuesday showed some of the pressures in its biggest European markets had eased. While service revenue remained negative in the four big markets of Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain , all four showed an improvement on the previous quarter.

RBI tightens rules for NBFCs as business grows

Capital First
(On Monday, the Reserve Bank…)
MUMBAI: India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans to avoid any potential risk to the economy from these rapidly growing finance firms by regulating them like traditional banks.
Shadow banks, or non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), have in recent years played a bigger role in financing small businesses and individuals in India, taking over from the banks that reined in credit as economic growth slowed.
On Monday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said these companies were now so entrenched in the financial system that they needed better regulation.
Assets of shadow banks, which include Capital First Ltd , Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd and LIC Housing Finance Ltd, rose to 12.5 percent of GDP last year from 8.4 percent in 2006, RBI data shows.
"They are as exposed to risks arising out of counterparty failures, funding and asset concentration, interest rate movement and risks pertaining to liquidity and solvency, as any other financial sector player," the RBI said in a statement.
There are some 12,000 NBFCs registered with the RBI, and like traditional banks, they offer loans. Some take deposits.
Analysts and financing company executives said the new RBI rules on what constitutes a bad loan would reduce the sectors' ability to lend to small companies which have trouble getting credit from big banks because they are considered risky.
Currently, the NBFCs consider a loan bad if it has not been paid for 180 days after it is due, but the new rules cut that timeframe by half, in line with the regulations for banks. The new rules will fully take effect after March 2018.
"You know in an emerging economy like ours where we've got 40 percent of our small businesses not getting adequate credit, I don't understand why we are talking of this global standards before we cater to all of them," G.S. Sundararajan, group director at Shriram Group, which owns two of India's leading non-banking financial firms, told Reuters.
As part of the new rules, the RBI said non-banking firms must raise their core capital requirements to at least 10 million rupees ($162,668) by March 2016 and 20 million rupees by end-March 2017, from 2.5 million rupees now.
Only certain investment-grade non-banking firms would be allowed to take deposits and the companies will have until March 2016 to acquire a credit rating. The RBI also capped deposit-taking at 1.5 times the size of a firm's minimum capital, down from four times previously.

BJP says open to support from any party  except Congress inMaharashtraPrint
The remark by Rajiv Pratap Rudy indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of NCP. (Source: PTI photo)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:50 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:52 pm
As its government braces for a trust vote in Maharashtra on Wednesday, BJP on Tuesday said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is “responsible for the mess”, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
“Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around,” he said.
Asked about Sharad Pawar’s NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
“Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government,” he said.
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Rudy was speaking after taking over as Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs along with Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Parliament House on Tuesday in the presence of Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
In a sudden move yesterday, a day after its chief Uddhav Thackeray served an ultimatum to BJP to come clear within two days on the issue of taking NCP’s support for survival of its  government, Sena submitted a letter to the Assembly Secretary asking him to accord its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde Leader of Opposition status.
Hours later, however, Uddhav said the decision to stake claim to LoP’s post was taken because Congress wanted the position on the ground that Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA and, if that were to happen, “we would have been left nowhere”.
After BJP and Sena, Congress is the third largest party in the Assembly with 42 MLAs.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition, the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.

A committee formed by the followers and admirers of T.Chennaiah, Gandhian, freedom fighter from Kolar, one of the heroes of the Vidurashwattha struggle and a member of the Constituent Assembly, is gearing up to belatedly organise the birth centenary of the late leader on November 16.
Although the centennial was in 2012, the committee decided to commemorate a visionary leader in the absence of any government initiative.
Born in a poor Dalit family on October 12, 1912, Mr. Chennaiah worked hard and rose to become a member of Constituent Assembly of independent India, minister in the Kengal Hanumanthaiah Government in the then Mysore and a member of the Rajya Sabha.
He participated in the Freedom struggle and was jailed several times for his role in it. He was one of the participants of the Vidurashwattha protest, which is also known as the Jalianwallabagh of the South, in which nine people including a pregnant woman were killed in firing by British police.
He also participated in the Karnataka unification and Goa liberation struggles.
Closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, he is credited with Gandhiji’s visit to Kolar’s Kelaginapet - now called Gandhinagar. Known for his simplicity, Mr. Chennaiah is remembered for the fact that he did not own a car and lived in a modest, tiled-roof house till his death on January 18, 1985.
He studied up to fourth standard in Kolar and had to break his education due to his family’s acute poverty. He later continued education and passed out of Maharaja College, Mysore. He became the first SC or ST student to get a B.Sc degree, says Kotiganahalli Ramaiah, one of the functionaries who initiated the T. Chennaiah Centenary Celebration Committee.
Had his visionary plan to supply water from the Markandeya tank and Cauvery to undivided Kolar been implemented, people in the region would have had to agitate for drinking water, his son, Balaji Chennaiah, told The Hindu.
As minister, Mr. Chennaiah got hostels built for underprivileged students in several parts of Karnataka. Nachiketa Nilaya in Kolar and Siddhartha Nilaya in Mysore are prominent among them.
He left his mark as an upright minister when he successively handled the portfolios of Health, Municipal Administration, Excise, Forest, Planning, Agriculture and Prisons; and in his contribution to development works in Kolar and Chikballapur.

A mix of regional, political, caste compulsions determines the Cabinet expansion
New Delhi, Nov 9:  
Shiv Sena’s protestations clouded an otherwise classical Cabinet expansion exercise on Sunday that balanced issues of regional and caste representation and contained a mix of technocrats and experienced administrators.
Probably realising that “minimum government and maximum governance” was only serving to overwork certain Ministers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi enlarged his Council of Ministers to a robust 66 members. Professionals and technocrats such as Jayant Sinha and Mahesh Sharma as well as credible leaders with proven administrative records such as Manohar Parrikar and Suresh Prabhu were inducted.
The BJP seemed to have thought through the Shiv Sena tangle given the alacrity with which Suresh Prabhu quit his former party and adopted the ruling dispensation. Prabhu’s induction was not suggested by the Sena, and more a reflection of the Prime Minister and the RSS’s faith in his administrative and professional acumen. The BJP knew in advance that the Sena will react badly to the manner in which Prabhu was being inducted. That is why his transition to the BJP was smoothly arranged as soon as the Sena started reacting on expected lines.
Wide representation
Now plans are reportedly afoot to elevate him to the Rajya Sabha from Haryana. The BJP clearly believes it holds all the cards in Maharashtra and is willing to take the risk of pushing the Sena to the brink. Promoting Suresh Prabhu and refusing to offer a Cabinet berth to Anil Desai is a pointer in this direction.
So, while the Sena continued to fume, celebrations had erupted in the respective houses of the leaders who were elevated to the Cabinet this afternoon. As Rajiv Pratap Rudy pointed out, the Cabinet now has Ministers from regions which were not represented earlier. The Council of Ministers now has JP Nadda from Himachal Pradesh, YS Chowdhary from Andhra Pradesh, Bandaru Dattatreya from Telangana and popular singer Babul Supriyo from West Bengal.
Supriyo’s anointment is, in fact, is a signal about the States where the BJP aspires to further its political advance. From Bihar, where elections are due next year, as many as three new Ministers were inducted – Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Giriraj Singh and Ram Kirpal Yadav. It is a clever mix of representatives from among the BJP’s traditional vote support base — Rajputs (a community to which Rudy belongs) and the Bhumihars (represented by Giriraj Singh) — as well as an attempt to reach out to the intermediary castes (Ram Kirpal Yadav). Besides reassuring the Bhumihars, the elevation of Giriraj Singh may also be an indication of the kind of campaign the BJP plans to run in the Bihar Assembly election.
Hindi heartland
The Cabinet expansion also has message for the Dalits in the Hindi heartland and the northern States, where they have traditionally voted either for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) or the Congress. From Uttar Pradesh, two Dalit and backward caste MPs — Ram Shankar Kathiria from Agra and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti from Fatehpur — were inducted in the Council of Ministers. From Punjab, that has the highest percentage of Dalits, about 31.9 per cent, the BJP inducted its Dalit face, the Hoshiarpur MP Vijay Sampla as a Minister of State.
Reaching out to Jats
The induction of Chowdhary Birender Singh and Sanwar Lal Jat reflects the BJP’s outreach to the Jats. The party has won a majority in Haryana Assembly recently largely owing to non-Jat consolidation in its favour and now has a Punjabi Chief Minister in the State. With a non-Jat Chief Minister in Haryana, the BJP would like to make amends and ensure future attraction for the community. In fact, the inclusion of Sanwar Lal Jat, the man who defeated Congress’s Sachin Pilot in Ajmer, and Olympian Rajyvardhan Singh Rathod who are both from Rajasthan, reflects the Jat-Rajput consolidation that the BJP had achieved in the State in the recent Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.
Here is the full list of newly included Ministers:

Poll: Narendra Modi invokes Bill Gates  tells youth to make life  sarthakEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked the life and struggle of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Eknath Ranade to urge the youth to make their life meaningful rather than be just successful and cited the example of Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates to bring home the point.
Saluting the contributions of Ranade who lived by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, the Prime Minister hoped that Ranade’s ideals of “one life, one mission” will inspire the youths to join in nation-building and fulfil Swamiji’s dreams.
“Ask anyone what the purpose of their life is and they will tell you it is to be successful. But Ranade used to attach more importance to make life meaningful rather than being simply successful. That should be our strive in life,” he said.
To drive home the difference between a “successful (safal)” and a “meaningful (sarthak)” life, the Prime Minister cited the example of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world, is today working towards social welfare, helping people install toilets across the world and serving humanity.
“Bill Gates made a discovery that changed the world. He made a world of wealth, attained unmatched success but then realised that all this was not the end of life. He then donated money towards the human development in poorer nations, supporting toilet-building and other activities. This made his life meaningful,” he said.
Modi said Ranade’s vision should inspire in creation of an India that is both “bhavya” (prosperous) and “divya” (spiritual).
Modi, who at a function at Vigyan Bhawan launched the birth centenary celebrations of Ranade that will begin from November 19, recalled how as a youngster he had the chance of being blessed by the RSS ideologue.
The Prime Minister said Ranade played a “very significant role during the Emergency”.

Broken glass and fluid marks  found in Sunanda s roomPolice and lab officials find 'broken glass and fluid marks' in Sunanda's hotel room
Mail Today –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014
Print
New Delhi: A team of Delhi Police and Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL) officials, which last week visited the Suite number 345 of Hotel Leela where former Union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar was found dead, has discovered some fresh evidence — some broken glasses and fluid marks on bed and carpet.
“The fresh evidence will be examined by the CFSL, which will submit a report to the police soon,” said a police officer.
According to the police, its team has revisited the crime spot after the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical board reiterated its earlier stance that Pushkar had died of poisoning.
It is possible that the police may register a case soon in the case.
The hotel room, which was locked after the incident took place, had been opened for the first time since January when the initial investigation was conducted.
“The police team may again visit the room,” a police officer said.
Experts from AIIMS had said they could not pinpoint the exact poison or chemical that caused Pushkar’s death owing to lack of facilities to pursue the matter. They concluded that Sunanda was “neither ill nor had any disease prior to her death”.
“Medical board reserved the comment on specific poison/chemical since there is a lot of limitation on viscera report,” their report had said.
Over the course of the report’s final four pages, they had given a long list of reasons why they were unable to identify the poison or chemical, ranging from the Delhi Police’s failure to provide certain statements and evidence, to procedures followed by forensic laboratories.
“In forensic toxicology, there are so many reasons due to which poison/chemical may not be detected in viscera test like complete metabolism, excretion, decomposition, inappropriate technique used in detection and the intake of nature of poison beyond the list of common poison,” the report had said.
The police had earlier said there were traces of urine on the bed that was used by Pushkar. However, investigators now reportedly believe that she could have been poisoned on the intervening night of January 16 and 17.
At a time when the Delhi Police is struggling to solve the mysterious death case, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said he would file a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a court-monitored probe.

New Delhi: Apollo Tyres Ltd on Monday reported a 17.52 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 257.94 crore for the second quarter that ended on September 30, 2014-15, driven by higher exports.

HCC shares soar 12% after Lavasa gets nod for IPOHCC shares soar 12 per cent after Lavasa gets nod for Rs 750-crore IPO

Shares of Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) on Tuesday soared over 12 per cent after its realty arm Lavasa Corporation got a go-ahead for market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for raising Rs 750 crore through an IPO.
Lavasa had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Sebi in July this year for the proposed initial public offer (IPO).
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Reacting to the IPO go-ahead, HCC shares on Tuesday rose to a high of Rs 38.25 in early morning trade, with a gain of 12.2 per cent from its previous close.
It was trading at Rs 37.20 at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at 12:01 pm.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares of land in 'Lavasa' near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money through IPO.
In November 2010, Lavasa had got the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan at that time.
As per draft documents, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

Brent Trades Around $82  Just Above Recent 4-Year LowOil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
Brent crude traded close to $82 per barrel on Tuesday after hitting a four-year low, as a firm dollar and robust production from U.S. shale oilfields outweighed a drop in Libyan output.
Brent for December fell $1.11 to $81.23 per barrel, its lowest since October 2010, and was around $82 by 4.15 p.m. US crude was down 20 cents at $77.20 per barrel.
The US dollar hit a seven-year high against the yen and was up 0.2 percent on the day against a basket of currencies.
A strong dollar suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities by making them more expensive for purchasers using other currencies.
"The path of least resistance is lower, until the OPEC meeting," said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale, in a research note.
Brent has fallen nearly 30 per cent since late June due to rising production, slowing global demand, and the absence of clear signals from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it will cut output at a Nov. 27 meeting.
Falling prices have had little impact on drilling in the United States, with output from the fastest-growing and largest shale fields showing no sign of slowing, the Energy Information Administration said.
A supply shock in Libya lent some support to prices, as a rival government that has seized the capital took control of the country's biggest oilfield, El Sharara.
El Sharara and the eastern oil port of Hariga, which was shut by protests on Saturday, remain closed.
Libya's output in the coming months will depend on whether that government can consolidate control over assets and avoid international sanctions, but most analysts believe production in 2015 will be significantly lower than the peak above 900,000 barrels a day, achieved in September.
There was no breakthrough in negotiations between Iran and Western powers after talks in Muscat, officials said, but talks continued on Tuesday. A deal could result in the lifting of Western sanctions, paving the way for increased Iranian oil exports.
JPMorgan slashed its 2015 Brent price forecast by $33 to $82 per barrel on Monday, citing supply pressures in the Atlantic Basin and the apparent inability of OPEC member states to work cohesively to restrain production.

MH370 search to end Rage over report that plane to be declared  lostRage over report that MH370 to be declared 'lost'

Relatives of MH370 passengers have criticised beleagured Malaysia Airlines after an official reportedly said authorities would set a date to announce the plane "lost", with an industry source saying such a declaration would see the search called off.
 
Both Malaysia Airlines and officials in Australia -- which is leading the search for the missing jet far off its western coast -- have denied the reported comments by the carrier's commercial director Hugh Dunleavy.
But Voice370, an association of MH370 victims' relatives, said in a statement late Monday that it was "bewildered" by the report last week.
"Such unilateral declaration brings intense agony and confusions to family members and makes us lose faith in the search effort," it said.
A New Zealand Herald article, citing Dunleavy, said authorities were working to set a date -- likely by the end of the year -- to formally announce the loss of the Boeing 777, which vanished off radars on March 8 with 239 people aboard.
"We don't have a final date but once we've had an official loss recorded we can work with the next of kin on the full compensation payments for those families," he was quoted as saying.
An industry source familiar with the MH370 saga said once the plane is declared lost, all search efforts will be stopped.
"The talk has been that the search has been futile so far and it's unlikely to bring anything," he said.
In a statement Monday, Malaysia Airlines distanced itself from Dunleavy's comments, saying it was his personal opinion and "ongoing search and recovery operations will remain and will not be discontinued".
It said any information regarding MH370 will only be communicated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) in Australia.
Officials at the JACC said Tuesday that Dunleavy's comments were "greatly disturbing for the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board MH370", reiterating Australia's commitment to the search.
MH370 inexplicably disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in what remains one of history's great aviation mysteries.
Australia has been spearheading the hunt for the plane, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean off western Australia.
Some next-of-kin bitterly accuse the Malaysian government and airline of a bungled response and cover-up, charges that they have strenuously denied.
A Malaysian family last month sued the government and the airline for negligence in what is believed to be the first lawsuit filed over the disaster.

(The fall of the front-month…)
Gold traded 0.7% lower at Rs 25,552 per 10 gm on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India on Tuesday, underscoring weak sentiment in the metal as the dollar strengthened because of the US economic revival.
The fall of the front-month gold contract below Rs 26,000 resulted in a marginal increase in demand for the wedding season. MCX gold tracks the price of the metal traded on overseas bourse Comex, part of the CME Group.
"Sentiment is weak primarily because of a stronger dollar," said Sudheesh Nambiath, senior analyst at precious metals consultancy GFMS Thomson Reuters. "But the fall has raised demand a tad, better than what it was during Diwali. That's also helped hold premiums at between $15 and $20 an ounce."

Chhattisgarh: Botched sterilisation surgeries kill 8 women  govt suspends 4 docsEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Sena  BJP alliance hopes remain  but Fadnavis keeps Plan B readyWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

New technique for generating electricity developedNew technique for generating electricity developed

London, Nov 11:  
Researchers have demonstrated a new technique for generating electricity by harvesting energy from mechanical vibrations of the environment.
The new electricity generation technology could be introduced on an industrial scale within three to six years, researchers said.
Energy harvesters are needed, for example, in wireless self-powered sensors and medical implants, where they could ultimately replace batteries.
In the future, energy harvesters can open up new opportunities in many application areas such as wearable electronics.
Research scientists at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland have successfully generated energy by utilising the charging phenomenon that occurs naturally between two bodies with different work functions.
Work function is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from a solid and it determines, for example, the well-known photoelectric effect.
When two conducting bodies with different work functions are connected to each other electrically, they accumulate opposite charges.
Moving of these bodies with respect to each other generates energy because of the attractive electrostatic force between the opposite charges.
In VTT’s experiment the energy generated by this motion was converted into useful electrical power by connecting the bodies to an external circuit. This new energy conversion technique also works with semiconductors.
In many sensor applications and medical implants such as pacemakers, electricity is typically provided by batteries.
Research into small energy harvesters that turn mechanical vibration into electricity has focused on piezoelectric and electrostatic devices.
Unlike these devices VTT’s technique does not require an integrated battery, electrets, a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge, or piezo materials.
The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

A day after the minor blast near CRPF camp here which housed the camp office of NIA probing the Burdwan blast, Bidhannagar City Police on Tuesday said preliminary probe indicated that there was no evidence of bomb blast and crackers could have been used to play mischief.
“Prima facie there is no evidence of bomb blast as we have not found smell of explosives or remnants. We have found one or two eye witnesses and it is likely that crackers could have been used to play mischief,” Bidhannagar City Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar said.
He, however, had said a detailed investigation would be carried out into the incident.
Bidhannagar police officers said that they have already sent samples collected from spot for chemical test.
“We are waiting for the results”, they said.
The police was also looking into CCTV footage at the Technopolis bus stand which is close to the CRPF camp, they said.
Debasish Dhar, Additional Police commissioner, Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, last night said that they were suspecting the material used could be a firecracker.
“We are not taking it lightly. A police team has rushed to the spot to inquire into the nature of the explosive material,” Dhar had said.
The anti-terror probe agency situated in the Bidhannagar area in the suburb of the city, is also being used to interrogate Sajid, the mastermind of the Burdwan blast, and other terrorists arrested in connection with the blast.

Harish Rawat stumps rival Bahuguna camp  BJP inUttarakhandEarlier, Rawat had got selected his loyalist Kishore Upadhayay as the new president of Uttarakhand Congress. (Source: PTI photo)
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:16 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:21 pm
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat has stumped his rival Vijay Bahuguna camp within ruling the Congress party and the state’s main opposition BJP.
While his government’s decision to implement pension scheme for priests has troubled the BJP, Congress Party’s Rajya Sabha ticket for his loyalist and former mayor of Dehradun Municipal Corporation Manorama Sharma Dobriyal is a clear message to his detractors within the Congress that Rawat is now under full command of the party affairs in Uttarakhand.
Former CM Vijay Bahuguna was allegedly in race to enter the Rajya Sabha as Congress nominee from Uttarakhand. In local media, the name of Congress veteran and former union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was highlighted as possible candidate for Congress Party’s RS ticket from Uttarakhand. “Initially, both the camps – separately headed by CM Rawat and former CM Bahuguna – were against the selection of an outsider as Congress nominee for RS seat. Once it was decided that Congress would select its local leader, the Rawat camp prevailed over the party high-command and ensured ticket for its loyalist Manorama Dobriyal,” a source close to Rawat said.
Dobriyal is a surprising choice for the state Congress. Earlier, Rawat had got selected his loyalist Kishore Upadhayay as the new president of Uttarakhand Congress. Bahuguna’s loyalist and Congress MLA from Narendra Nagar Subodh Uniyal were in race for the post of Congress president of Uttarakhand unit.
On the contrary, Rawat has been continuing to target the main opposition BJP on the same issues which suits the BJP’s political interest in Uttarakhand. Rawat first troubled the BJP by inviting Baba Ramdev and his close aide Balkrishna to visit Kedarnath to see the reconstruction works undertaken by the state government. Now, he has sent the BJP’s state leaders into a tizzy by planning to launch a pension scheme for priests.
“The CM would formally launch the pension scheme for priests on the state’s foundation day on November 9. There is nothing wrong in a scheme to give pension of Rs 800 to priests in Uttarakhand,” said media advisor to CM Surendra Agrawal. He also added that the CM is also planning to focus on initiatives for madarasa teachers and maulvies in the state.
Sources in the government said Rawat has already discussed his new idea to grant ministerial status to mayors and chairmen of Zila Panchayats in the state. “He is seriously considering to give ministerial status to mayors and chairman of the Zila Panchayats,” a source in the government said.

PM arrives in Myanmar  to step up ties with ASEANPM arrives in Myanmar; to step up ties with ASEAN

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
The 12th ASEAN-India summit kicks off tomorrow with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to make a strong pitch to step up engagement with the 10-nation bloc by improving regional connectivity to give a boost to trade and people-to-people contacts.
Modi arrived in the Myanmarese capital this afternoon by a special Air India plane, starting his 10-day three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia for the G-20 Summit and bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott and Fijian premier J V Bainimarama.
Modi was received by Myanmar Health Minister Than Aung at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport.
“Landed in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar to a very warm welcome! Great being in this beautiful country,” Modi tweeted after his arrival.
The Prime Minister will attend the India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.
‘Act East’ policy
Asserting that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is at the core of India’s ‘Act East’ policy, the Prime Minister said before leaving for Myanmar that he was looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take “our relationship to a new level, which will supplement our deepening bilateral ties with each member’’.
“ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration and where India will play a crucial role, ” Modi said, adding that ties with ASEAN are “deep rooted’’.
Modi expressed confidence that these meetings with the leaders of ASEAN and East Asian blocs would be fruitful.
India-ASEAN 5-year plan
Indian officials said New Delhi is keen that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should lay emphasis on enhancing people-to-people contacts, augmenting trade, besides reinforcing strategic and political engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
An ambitious project is underway to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand. It was originally envisaged to be completed around 2017 but it is behind schedule and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway.
Bilateral trade
Officials said the free trade pact in services and investment between India and the ASEAN is expected to help the bilateral trade touch $100 billion by 2015.
The bilateral trade grew 4.6 per cent from $68.4 billion in 2011 to $71.6 billion in 2012.
ASEAN’s exports were valued at $43.84 billion and imports from India amounted to $27.72 billion in 2012.
The ASEAN community has the third largest population. It would be the seventh largest economy in the world and the third fastest growing economic unit this century.
It comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
East Asia Summit
Modi will be also participating in the 18-nation East Asia Summit (EAS) on Thursday before leaving for Brisbane to attend the G20 Summit.
“At the East Asia Summit, I look forward to discussing with ASEAN and seven global leaders how we can strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity,” the Prime Minister said ahead of the deliberations.
The EAS comprises 10 ASEAN nations, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.
On the sidelines of the international summits in Myanmar, Modi is slated to meet Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Singapore President Tony Tan, besides the host President Thein Sein.

Call drops spell trouble for mobile phone subscribersCall drops spell trouble for mobile phone subscribers
M Rajendran , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 09, 2014
First Published: 00:35 IST(9/11/2014) | Last Updated: 10:55 IST(9/11/2014)
Sunil Sharma, a Delhi-based investment advisor, conducts much of his business over his mobile phone. But over the last year, frequent call drops, patchy connections and difficulty in getting through to his clients have made life difficult for him.
 
He lost a few outstation clients because of this and now prefers to conduct most of his business over his landlines.
 
A number of factors – from inadequate availability of spectrum (airwaves that carry telecom signals), sub-optimal utilisation of the available spectrum, court orders shutting down telecom towers on fears that the radiation they emit causes cancer, lack of investments by telecom companies in new telecom towers to address a rising subscriber population to regulatory hurdles – have combined to make life difficult for consumers such as Sharma and nearly every one of India’s 900 million mobile phone subscribers.
There is little hope of any immediate resolution to this problem. The auction of additional spectrum, which was expected this financial year, may get delayed further. Early availability of additional spectrum could ease the situation a little.
Then, there are 425,000 telecom towers in India against a requirement of 625,000 towers. “India needs a minimum of 200,000 additional towers to ensure robust connectivity for calls and data,” said Umang Das, director general, Tower & Infrastructure Providers Association (TIPA).
 
TIPA is the apex body of telecom tower companies that rents out towers to telcos.
 
At an average cost of Rs. 5 lakh per tower, it will require an investment of about Rs. 10,000 crore to bridge the gap.
 
“Telecom companies are not investing in technologies that can offer optimum spectrum utilisation. They are only adding more subscribers. So, the quality of service gets compromised,” said Saleem Ahemad, vice president of Telecom Users Group, a leading consumer organisation registered with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
He added that telcos use the government’s directives not allowing them to put up towers in certain areas, such as some parts of Lutyens’ Delhi as well as some parts of Mumbai, as an excuse to shut down towers or for not putting up new towers to improve the quality of service. According to a TRAI report, all telcos are performing within the prescribed levels of call drops of less than 2%. But the actual user experience of is very different.
HT contacted all the major telcos – Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Reliance Communications and Tata Communications – for their reactions but all of them declined to comment.
 
“It is lack of spectrum that is creating this problem. In addition, the governments at the Centre and in some states have stringent health and regulatory norms for deployment of telecom towers; so, quality suffers,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI), the apex body representing all telecom operators except Tata Communications and Reliance Communications.
Mathews says it is possible to provide good connectivity, if “the government allow us to set up towers in government buildings with a single window clearance; secondly, it needs to give us more spectrum and educate the customers that there are no ill-effects of radiation from towers.”
He pointed to a Gujarat high court judgment in September that dismissed the plea of some residents of an Ahmedabad neighbourhood who had opposed the setting up of telecom towers on the grounds that transmission of electromagnetic waves could lead to health hazards including cancer.
The prescribed radiation levels from telecom towers in India are one-tenth the global norm. COAI has suggested that the government come out with a new set of emission guidelines that will allow operators to set up more towers.
“The proposal is currently under examination. The technical details need to be verified,” said a senior official in Telecom Commission, the policy making wing of the department of telecommunications.

2G case: final hearing from Dec. 19trials
A special court here on Monday fixed a new date for hearing the final arguments in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case in which former Telecom Minister A. Raja and DMK Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi figure as accused. The arguments were scheduled to begin on Monday.
Special Judge O.P. Saini adjourned the hearing to December 19, saying that it would be proper to begin the final arguments on conclusion of evidence in the money laundering case, connected with the 2G case. The former Minister and Ms. Kanimozhi are also accused in this case. The recording of evidence in it has been scheduled for November 17. Earlier, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against Ms. Kanimozhi as she was not present when the case was taken up for hearing. However, it later cancelled it when her lawyer apologised for her absence.
The court had in September concluded recording of evidence in the 2G case.
The court had in September concluded recording of evidence in the 2G case. The testimony of 153 prosecution witnesses, including that of the chairman of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), Anil Ambani, his wife Tina Ambani and corporate lobbyist Niira Radia, besides that of 29 defence witnesses was recorded during the trial. The Ambani couple had turned hostile in the case.
However, the prosecution may examine some more witnesses to prove the case if the court allows its application for summoning them, including Rajeshwar Singh, Deputy Director of the Enforcement Directorate, Delhi Circle. Argument on it has been scheduled for Tuesday.

Iraqi officials say IS leader wounded in airstrikeIraqi officials say IS leader wounded in airstrike
By QASSIM ABDUL-ZAHRA and VIVIAN SALAMA | Associated Press –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.
Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.
The reports came at a time when President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the Islamic State militants.
Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.
He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.
An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official, cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.
The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.
A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defense Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.
Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.
The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armored vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.
When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: "We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured."
Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some Islamic State militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.
"They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital," Abdurrahman said.
There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.
The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.
Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.
As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.
On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.
The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.
Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.
In an interview with CBS' "Face the Nation" that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.
"Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offense," Obama said.
"The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making," he added.

Shiv Sena presents green cap to BJP ministerShiv Sena presents green cap to BJP minister
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014

Mumbai, Nov 10 (IANS) The Shiv Sena continued its aggressive stance vis-a-vis the Bharatiya Janata Party and presented a green cap to Revenue, Minority Affairs & Wakf Minister Eknath Khadse for what it termed his "soft corner" for Muslims, here Monday.
The Sena's 63 members trooped inside the Vidhan Bhavan with full throated vigour and slogans on the first the day of the three-day special legislative session for the swearing-in of the 287 newly-elected members of the state assembly.
Sena senior leader Diwakar Raote brought a bright green cap with him which he intended to present to Khadse for the latter's proposal to introduce Urdu as an optional subject to students studying in Marathi medium schools in the state.
"Nobody has demanded this from the government. Even if one student opts for Urdu, they will have to appoint a teacher, make arrangements for 'namaz', and other requirements. What is the need for this?" Raote demanded, questioning the government's move to appease the minorities.
The Sena's attack on Khadse, currently the No.2 in Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' cabinet, came a day after the party warned the BJP it would sit in the opposition if it (BJP) took the help of Nationalist Congress Party to prop up the minority government during the confidence vote here Wednesday, Nov 12.
Several Sena leaders have lauded party president Uddhav Thackeray's decision on this ticklish issue which resulted in the party boycotting the first cabinet expansion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi Sunday, and the Sena recalling its nominee Anil Y. Desai minutes before the swearing-in ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
The Shiv Sena legislators occupied the opposition benches during the swearing-in of legislators and earlier exchanged slogans of 'Jai Shivaji' versus BJP's 'Jai Shree Ram'.
The day started with Maharashtra Governor C.V. Rao swearing in senior legislator J.P. Gavit as the pro-tem Speaker of the new assembly ahead of the crucial floor test by Fadnavis after two days.

Motorola Moto G
Motorola Moto G
The original Moto G was an instant hit when launched in India early this year. Motorola has bumped up the new Moto G with even better specifications but is it enough to survive cut-throat competition?
Taller and wider than its predecessor, the new Moto G has a 5-inch display with 1280x720p resolution. The display is bright and legible, even under sunlight. The phone is equipped with an 8MP camera with flash, compared with the average 5 MP camera in the older version. While it isn't the best in its category, it still captures good shots and the low-light performance is superior to other smartphones.
Motorola has continued with the same processor for the new Moto G - 1.2Ghz quad core processor on Snapdragon 400 chipset paired with 1GB of RAM. This is good enough for day-to-day tasks such as emails, updating Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp , etc. Browsing is smooth. However, I did notice a slight lag (barely a second) after long browsing sessions on the Chrome browser.
The device runs on Android KitKat, the signal reception is good and the sound is pretty impressive even on loudspeaker mode. The phone comes with removable pack panel that hides three slots - two for micro SIM cards and one for the memory card. The battery is non-removable yet impressive as it easily lasted me a day on a single charge.
Price: Rs 12,999
Specs: 5-inch display; 8MP camera;  1.2GHz quad core processor; 1GB RAM; 16GB internal storage, expandable  memory card slot; WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, dual SIM; 149 grams; 2070 mAh  battery
Bag it or junk it: A good buy as the 16GB variant costs Rs 1,000 less than its predecessor.

Moody s Sees Sustained  Robust Growth in India in 2 YearsMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Mumbai: Global rating agency Moody's has said it expects India to witness "sustained robust growth" over the next two years.
"We expect sustained robust growth in the US, Britain and India over the next two years," Moody's Investors Service said in its quarterly Global Macro Outlook report issued in London.
The agency has a 'Baa3' rating with 'stable' outlook on India, which is the lowest in the investment grade.
Its peers S&P and Fitch had flagged concerns over falling growth, high inflation, the high fiscal and current account deficits and a sense of 'political paralysis', among other factors and had also threatened to downgrade the country to junk status.
However, with the economic conditions improving, the country has been able to convince all the rating agencies' concerns and both S&P and Firch have upgraded their respective outlooks now.
In an earlier note, Moody's had said it expected GDP growth to touch 5 per cent in 2014 and accelerate in 2015. The country had two consecutive fiscals of sub-5 per cent growth, and the prospects have been looking up since the June quarter, when GDP growth accelerated to 5.7 per cent.
However, there are concerns that the number will slip to around 5 per cent due to a weak industrial growth.
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan had called the process of recovery as "uneven".
At the global level, Moody's said the US growth was likely to accelerate as pent-up consumer and investment demand is realised.
For the G-20 economies, it is expecting GDP growth of around 3 per cent in 2015 and 2016, after notching up 2.8 per cent in 2014.

NEW YORK (AP) — In a night that was all about empowerment, actresses Lupita Nyong'o and Laverne Cox, fashion designer Sarah Burton, U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and Chelsea Clinton were among those awarded Women of the Year awards by Glamour magazine.
The awards were presented in a star-studded ceremony Monday evening at Carnegie Hall.
Hillary Clinton joined daughter Chelsea for her first evening out since the birth of daughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky on Sept. 26.
"I had sort of wondered if I'd get to wear a fancy dress and high-heeled shoes again," Clinton said, drawing laughter and applause from the crowd.
Clinton was honored for her work with the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Glamour also cited her work on a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to encourage achievement among women and girls across the world. That commitment, Clinton said, was only strengthened by becoming a mother.
"I want Charlotte to grow up to be whatever she dreams to be, wherever she dreams to be it," Clinton said.
Nyong'o, whose mother offered congratulations on a pre-taped video, won a supporting-actress Oscar for her performance in "Twelve Years a Slave," capping her swift rise to the top rungs of Hollywood and the fashion world. She was also named a new face of Lancome and appeared on the cover of People magazine's Most Beautiful issue. She will be appearing in the new "Star Wars" movie.
"The truth is, I don't really know what's next," Nyong'o said, through tears. "Though what has happened to me so far is incredible, I am still a work in progress and I hope to always be."
Cox, from "Orange Is the New Black," was the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy Award. In a press release, Glamour called her "the face of one of the biggest equality stories of 2014."
"I love being a woman, and I am so honored to be the vessel tonight for what I believe is this inevitable historic moment where the womanhood of transgender women is not in question," Cox said.
Burton is best known for designing Kate Middleton's wedding gown. She became creative director of Alexander McQueen in 2010, following the designer's death, and has been credited, Glamour noted, with boosting the British fashion industry.
Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was cited for her work in diplomacy "during a year when the U.N. Security Council held more emergency sessions than it had in the entire 10 years prior."
Other Glamour winners:
—Robin Roberts, the "Good Morning America" host who has survived breast cancer and a public struggle with myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare blood and bone marrow disease, cited for her success and influence in broadcasting.
—Actress Mindy Kaling, creator and star of the Fox comedy "The Mindy Project." ''Millions of women feel like Kaling is their BFF," Glamour said.
—Natalia Vodianova, supermodel and founder of the Naked Heart Foundation, which helps children with special needs.
—Sylvia Earle, a noted oceanographer who "even as her eightieth birthday approaches ... continues to spend three months a year on expeditions."

China Opens Museum Dedicated to Roast Duckchina opens museum dedicated to roast duck
Want to contest local polls in Gujarat First install a toilet at homeWant to contest local polls in Gujarat? First install a toilet at home
Agencies  Gandhinagar, November 11, 2014
First Published: 14:34 IST(11/11/2014) | Last Updated: 14:39 IST(11/11/2014)
Comments
Aspirants for elections to local bodies, including municipal corporations in Gujarat, will now have to prove that they have toilet facility at their homes or they will not be able to contest.
The legislative assembly on Monday unanimously passed the Gujarat Local Authorities Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2014, making it mandatory for every aspirant who want to contest elections to district, taluka, village, panchayat, municipality and municipal corporations to first prove that he/she has a toilet facility at home as per the new amendment made in the existing law.
While putting the bill to vote, state road and building minister Nitin Patel said that those willing to fight elections to these local bodies must submit an affidavit on toilet facility.
"Candidates who don't have such facility at his/her residence, cannot contest upcoming elections to local bodies, including corporations, municipalities, and panchayats.
"Those who are already elected are now required to submit a certificate within a period of six months to declare that he is having a toilet at his home," Patel told the House.
"Curbing open defecation is vital from the point of view of creating hygienic conditions and cleanliness and preventing water contamination," the state government said.
A recent report by the UN children's fund UNICEF estimates almost 594 million -- or nearly 50% of the country's population -- defecate in the open. Being forced to squat outside at night also exposes some 300 million women and girls to potential harassment and assault.
The issue was highlighted in May when two girls, aged 12 and 14, were attacked as they went into the fields to relieve themselves.
The bill also proposed two more amendments, the first being holding bypolls for municipal corporations within six months of the seat(s) falling vacant, bringing the time period on par with that of municipalities. Earlier, the time limit for municipal corporations to hold bypoll was three months.
As per another amendment, the minimum population of any area to declare it as a village will now have to be 25,000 as against current 15,000.
"The earlier limit of 15,000 was based on the figures of Census carried out in 1991. Now, we have to take into consideration the latest figures of 2011 Census," Patel said.
The bill was passed unanimously through a voice vote.

PM Narendra Modi arrives in Myanmar  to step up engagement withASEANPrint

Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:40 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:45 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off his 11-day foreign tour on Tuesday afternoon with his first stop at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, where he held bilateral talks with President U Thein Sein.
The focus was on beefing up engagement in the areas of culture and commerce and the Prime Minister is learnt to have made a strong push for improving regional connectivity as a booster to trade and increased people-to-people contact.
Modi landed here in a special aircraft and was given a ceremonial welcome. Tweeting after his bilateral meeting, Modi said that he and President Thein Sein had reviewed the bilateral relationship. “Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations…. We talked about strengthening ties in the fields of culture, commerce & enhancing connectivity.”
On Wednesday, Modi will attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit and the following day, he will take part in the 9th East Asian summit on the first leg of his three-nation foreign tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh’s visit there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar. Among the leaders that he is slated to meet is Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
For official talks, the agenda includes Indias keeness that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should focus on improving people-to-people contact, ramping up trade relations and reinforcing the strategic engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
Among issues on the anvil at the ASEAN summit meeting is the review of an ambitious connectivity project to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand that was originally envisaged to be completed by end-2017, and is now expected to be completed in 2018. India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway project.
Modi in a tweet earlier this week had said that India’s ties with ASEAN are “deep rooted” and that strengthening relations with the nations in the grouping are an important part of its ‘Act East’ policy”. He said he looked forward to meeting leaders attending the two summits in Myanmar. “ASEAN is central to our dream of an Asian century, where India will play a crucial role. Am sure the meetings there would be fruitful,” Modi had said.
With the bloc’s plan to float an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, the free trade pact in services and investment signed in September between India and the ASEAN is expected to help the bilateral trade climb to $100 billion by 2015, from $71.6 billion in 2012.
Modi is also said to be keen to tap the potential offered by the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit to attract more tourists from southeast nations.
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The East Asia summit (EAS) is a major forum for leaders in the region and it currently has 18 members. Besides the 10 countries in the ASEAN region and India, the other EAS members are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the US and Russia. The EAS bloc represents 55 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for around 56 per cent of global GDP.

Economic and business agenda invariably occupies the centre stage in the international deliberations, it said in a statement.
Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said, “Inclusion of the industry bodies in the PM’s entourage as part of the official delegations would bring in a lot of respect and status to India Inc, which is now contributing significantly to the economic growth.
“Initiatives such as Make in India would certainly need a strong endorsement from the Indian industry in the presence of global business leaders.”
Rawat added that the inclusion of business chambers in PM's visit should be only as official delegates and they should not be included as participants on the sidelines of the central agenda.

Chhattisgarh shocker: Botched sterilisation surgeries kill 8 women  govt suspends 4 docsEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Shiv Sena-BJP alliance hopes linger  but CM Fadnavis keeps Plan B readyWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

Shipping unit boosts AP Moller-Maersk results... 
November 11, 2014 05:04 AM EST | Associated Press
STOCKHOLM (AP) — Shipping and oil group A.P. Moller-Maersk has posted a 30 percent increase in quarterly profits as higher freight volumes and rates offset falling oil prices.
The Danish company's net profit rose to $1.47 billion in the third quarter, from $1.13 billion a year ago.
Revenue was $12.2 billion, up from $12.1 billion in the third quarter of 2013.
The company said Tuesday that revenue was "impacted by higher container volumes, and freight rates as well as higher oil entitlement production, partly offset by a lower average oil price."
Citing its third-quarter performance, the group's shipping unit, Maersk Line, raised its projected 2014 profit to "above $2 billion," from a previous forecast of "significantly above $1.5 billion."
Company shares rose 0.15 percent to 12,280 kroner ($2,057) in early trading in Copenhagen.

Mumbai, Nov 11:  
Reliance Power has said that its 100 MW CSP (concentrated solar project) project in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan has begun generating power.
It has been synchronised with the grid.
RPower said the plant is being built at a cost of Rs 2,100 crore, adjacent to the 40 MW solar photovoltaic project commissioned last year. Rajasthan Sun Technique Energy Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Power, was awarded the project in December 2010.
The award was based on international competitive bidding conducted by NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (a subsidiary of NTPC) under the National Solar Mission programme.
NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam will take 100 per cent of the power generated for 25 years. RPower said the project has 25 per cent reserve margin to meet the 25-year power purchase agreement.
The project is financed by debt from multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, Export Import Bank of the US, Financerings Maatschappu Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO), the Netherlands, and Axis Bank.
Areva Solar, a US subsidiary of the Areva SA of France, has provided the CFLR (compact linear fresnel reflector) technology for the project.
With this project, R Power said its generation capacity has increased to 5,285 MW, which includes 5,100 MW of thermal capacity and 185 MW of renewable energy.

BSE Sensex edge higher; rate-sensitive stocks up ahead of inflationdataFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The BSE Sensex today gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data tomorrow.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government’s reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of USD 82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore yesterday, according to the stock exchanges’ data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released tomorrow, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.
Indian shares edge higher ahead of key retail inflation data
(Reuters) Indian shares edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank  rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Meanwhile, non-banking finance companies like Housing Development Finance Corporation also rose after the central bank unveiled rules on bad loans and capital requirements that came largely along expected lines.
Traders say volumes will remain muted until India releases data on Wednesday on retail inflation, which is expected to slow to a record low of 5.80 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll.
That is expected to intensify calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review on Dec. 2.
“Market is discounting a fall in inflation and a resultant decrease in interest rates,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.
The benchmark BSE index rose 0.13 percent to end at 27,910.06.     The broader NSE index rose 0.22 percent to end at 8,362.65, also marking a record closing high.
Rate-sensitive stocks led the gains on hopes lower retail inflation data would enable the central bank to go for early rate cuts.
ICICI Bank ended up 1.6 percent while HDFC Bank  gained 0.4 percent.
Among state-run banks, Bank of Baroda rose 2.7 percent while Punjab National Bank advanced 3.4 percent.
Some auto stocks gained with Mahindra and Mahindra  rising 2.4 percent while Larsen and Toubro gained 1.1 percent.
Non-banking finance companies also rose. India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans on Monday, but the rules were largely within expectations.
Housing Development Finance Corporation gained 1.2 percent, while IDFC ended 2.7 percent higher.
Shriram Transport gained 4.9 percent, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services rose 1.1 percent.
However, among decliners, Jet Airways fell 2.5 percent on profit-taking after Monday’s 6.9 percent surge after September-quarter results.

Former Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Suresh Kalmadi on Monday joined the Vigilance inquiry into the 2011 National Games in Ranchi, with the principal investigator saying it was too early to rule him out as an accused.
Kalmadi was asked to be present after two arrested accused in the scam told interrogators that they were merely procuring equipment that was recommended by the IOA.
Kalmadi’s interrogation could mean the investigators are the doorstep of the Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee as well, as multiple vendors associated with the 2010 event were allegedly awarded questionable deals by the committee.
“I am merely a witness in the case, not an accused,” Kalmadi told journalists outside the Vigilance office in Ranchi after spending two hours answering a questionnaire.
“We will ask him to come back if needed. He will be made an accused if evidence turns up against him,” said Assistant Superintendent of Police Anand Joseph Tigga.
The first arrests into the 34th edition of the games were made on October 14 this year, with Vigilance officials arresting former Sports Department Director P C Mishra and Organising Committee Secretary S M Hashmi.

Dena Bank net profit falls 51%  bad loans soarDena Bank net profit falls 51%, bad loans soar
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 21:25 IST
Mid-sized state-run lender Dena Bank on Monday reported about 51 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 52 crore for the September quarter on account of higher provisions for bad assets.
The bank had registered net profit of Rs 107.38 crore in the July-September quarter of the previous fiscal, 2013-14.
"Our profit was impacted by higher provisions of Rs 352 crore, which we made during the quarter for non-performing assets, against Rs 109 crore in the year ago period," Dena Bank Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Kumar told reporters.
Its asset quality worsened in the period with gross NPAs at 5.12 per cent, which includes the Rs 250 crore-fixed deposits fraud at its Malabar Hill branch.
Net NPAs stood at 3.59 per cent during the quarter. In the year ago period, its gross bad loans ratio stood at 3 per cent, while net NPA stood at 2.02 per cent.
The total income has increased from Rs 2,599.94 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 to Rs 2,885.22 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the bank said.
Earlier this year, the CBI had unearthed Rs 250 crore fraud at the bank wherein the branch manager and a private person allegedly took loans using forged documents on behalf of seven private companies which had deposits in the bank.
Without the fraud, gross NPAs would have been 4.83 per cent, Kumar said, adding that the bank made a provision of Rs 42 crore for the Malabar Hill fraud case.
Bank's fresh slippages rose to Rs 1,000 crore and with the Malabar Hill fraud case, the slippages totalled to Rs 1,200 crore.
Net interest margins declined to 2.32 per cent from 2.57 per cent year-ago, and the bank is targeting its NIM to improve to 2.75-3 per cent by March-end.
The bank said Rs 450 crore of restructured accounts slipped into non performing assets during the period. The biggest restructured account which slipped into NPA was telecom tower company GTL, worth Rs 180 crore. The bank also has exposure of Rs 60 crore to its subsidiary, GTL Infrastructure, but the account remains standard so far, he said.

Scientists find remains of Ice Age infants in elaborate but mysterious graveBy Rachel Feltman November 10 Follow @rachelfeltman
The University of Alaska Fairbank's Ben Potter explains the significance of finding burial sites for infants during the Ice Age. (University of Alaska Fairbanks)
Scientists have found two infants buried under an ancient dwelling, sitting beneath a previously discovered set of toddler remains. At 11,500 years old, this Alaskan grave isn't the oldest in North America  -- but it's the oldest to show such elaborate burial practices, indicating that Native Americans put more care into burying their kin than we had thought. But because we have so little knowledge of life at that time, the remains present as many questions as they do answers.
The burials of these children, who died around the same time (probably even within the same season, the researchers report) showed an unprecedented level of care. But even though the researchers believe that one cultural group buried all three children, they weren't all buried in the same way.
Two of the children (one of whom died around six to 12 weeks after birth, and the other who was stillborn) were swaddled and buried with grave offerings -- intricately carved and pounded hunting tools made from elk antlers and stones. They were buried in a pit dug into the hearth of a residential dwelling, with a new hearth created on top. Later, the three-year-old was cremated in that hearth, which was then filled with dirt -- probably right as the nomadic Native Americans were leaving the settlement.
The researchers, led by Ben Potter of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, published their work Monday in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences . They can't be sure why the toddler was treated differently from the infants, but they don't believe that gender was an issue -- while their results on the sex of the remains aren't definitive, they're fairly sure that all three children were female. They're also pretty sure that this nomadic group was only around for one summer, so it's not likely that they had seasonal variation in burial practices.
It could be that the group had specific burial requirements depending on age, based on when they thought children gained souls. The researchers also suggest that ceremonial burials might only have taken place if certain family members were present to oversee them. Whoever was meant to carry out the burial rites might not have been present at the time the toddler died. Or maybe, given the timing of the cremation, the tribe was just in too much of a hurry to bury the last child.
It's frustrating to have so few answers about these lost children, but the archaeological finding is nonetheless an impressive one. "We are so often limited to comparing stone artifacts, often with questionable context, in our understanding of the early peopling of North America," Brian Robinson, a University of Maine anthropologist who wasn't involved in the study, told The Verge . "Burial ritual provides insights to human belief and organization that are largely unobtainable in other ways."

RBI raises minimum capital requirement for NBFCsReserve Bank tightens rules for NBFCs, raises minimum capital requirement

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened rules for so-called "shadow banks", raising minimum capital requirements and restricting deposits with a set of changes that it hopes will protect consumers and the market without stifling growth.
Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as LIC Housing Finance, provide a variety of banking services for both firms and individuals. They have been lending heavily to sectors like infrastructure at a time when traditional banks are held back by, among other things, hefty bad loans.
However, NBFCs do not hold full banking licences and are not subject to the tougher rules imposed on commercial banks.
The central bank , which has long warned of the risks posed by unregulated financial firms, said on Monday that their growth meant NBFCs could now pose risks to the broader market. A senior RBI official said in September that the bank recognises roughly 12,000 registered NBFCs.
"NBFCs are now deeply interconnected with the entities in the financial sector," the central bank said in a statement on Monday.
"Being financial entities, they are as exposed to risks arising out of counterparty failures, funding and asset concentration, interest rate movement and risks pertaining to liquidity and solvency , as any other financial sector player," it added.
The new rules are meant to replace a set of loose guidelines that had previously governed the NBFC sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years. Analysts estimate NBFCs account for about 12 per cent of the total assets in the domestic financial sector.
RBI tightened Tier 1 capital requirements and said NBFCs would need to hold capital levels of at least of Rs 1 crore ($162,668) by the end of March 2016 and Rs 2 crore by March-end 2017 to avoid losing their right to operate.
The country's apex bank also said only certain investment-grade NBFCs would be allowed to take deposits, saying the firms would have until the end-March 2016 to acquire a credit rating. RBI capped deposit-taking at 1.5 times the size of a firm's minimum capital - down from four times previously.
The central bank said the new rules would address risks posed by these firms "without impeding the dynamism displayed by NBFCs".
An executive at one of the country's biggest NBFC said the RBI would continue to tighten rules.
"RBI is slowly and steadily removing all kinds of arbitrage possible," he said, declining to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media. "To that extent, I am more inclined to believe, this is not the last of it," the executive said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Two Mark Rothko paintings have fetched more than $76 million at a New York auction of post-war and contemporary art.
The paintings were owned by Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, heir to the Listerine fortune. Mellon was a noted horticulturist and widow of philanthropist Paul Mellon. She died in March at 103 at her Virginia estate.
The Rothko paintings were among the offerings at Sotheby's Monday sale.
Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange) sold for $36.5 million, just over its estimated price range. Untitled was created 15 years later and brought in $40 million, double its top pre-sale estimate.
Sotheby's is offering a third Rothko on Tuesday. No. 21 (Red, Brown, Black and Orange) was bought by art benefactors Pierre and Sao Schlumberger from Rothko's estate. It could bring more than $50 million.

Data tariffs may fall 20% with Reliance Jio s entry: Fitch | Govt set to ban porn sites4G
(Reliance Industries had…)
KOLKATA: The likely entry of Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm next year will lead to a decline in data tariffs by at least a fifth but it will not hurt India's top four carriers, which are expected to see higher voice tariff realisations, rating agency Fitch has said.
"Jio's planned entry in the first half of 2015 will intensify competition in the data segment, and cause data tariffs to decline at least 20% but the top four telcos — Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications — will increase revenue market share to around 83% as they boost voice tariff realisations and gain data market share," Fitch said in a note on Tuesday.
Although Jio, by virtue of its spectrum assets in the 2300 MHz and 1800 MHz bands, will focus on data services, "it may have a limited impact on the incumbents' core voice business, given a weak voice-over-LTE technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets," the agency said.
Analysts at Fitch also do not foresee "a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-13", which had led to a severe decline in industry tariffs, especially since "Jio has a significant investment on spectrum and infrastructure". The agency said in the note that weaker unprofitable operators will seek mergers amid EBITDA losses, paucity of 3G/4G spectrum assets and relaxation of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions.
The credit profiles of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and RCom will stay intact, owing to a gradual rise in voice tariffs despite a likely fall in data tariffs triggered by Jio's entry, the note said.
The agency said it expects "six operators to emerge" from the ongoing industry shakeout as it believes the 10-12 operator scenario "is unsustainable". The note added that "the regulatory environment will improve further through the influence of the new pro-business government," coupled with the telecom regulator's focus on increasing spectrum supply before rushing into an auction.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened rules for so-called "shadow banks", raising minimum capital requirements and restricting deposits with a set of changes that it hopes will protect consumers and the market without stifling growth.
Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd (LICH.NS), provide a variety of banking services for both firms and individuals.

BJP says open to support from any party, except Congress in Maharashtra

(The remarks were significant…)
NEW DELHI: As its government braces for a trust vote in Maharashtra tomorrow, BJP today said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is "responsible for the mess", so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Rudy was speaking after taking over as Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs along with Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Parliament House today in the presence of Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
In a sudden move yesterday, a day after its chief Uddhav Thackeray served an ultimatum to BJP to come clear within two days on the issue of taking NCP's support for survival of its government, Sena submitted a letter to the Assembly Secretary asking him to accord its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde Leader of Opposition status.
Hours later, however, Uddhav said the decision to stake claim to LoP's post was taken because Congress wanted the position on the ground that Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA and, if that were to happen, "we would have been left nowhere".
After BJP and Sena, Congress is the third largest party in the Assembly with 42 MLAs.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition, the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.

Mumbai, Nov 11:  
Reliance Power has said that its 100 MW CSP (concentrated solar project) project in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan has begun generating power.
It has been synchronised with the grid.
RPower said the plant is being built at a cost of Rs 2,100 crore, adjacent to the 40 MW solar photovoltaic project commissioned last year. Rajasthan Sun Technique Energy Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Power, was awarded the project in December 2010.
The award was based on international competitive bidding conducted by NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (a subsidiary of NTPC) under the National Solar Mission programme.
NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam will take 100 per cent of the power generated for 25 years. RPower said the project has 25 per cent reserve margin to meet the 25-year power purchase agreement.
The project is financed by debt from multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, Export Import Bank of the US, Financerings Maatschappu Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO), the Netherlands, and Axis Bank.
Areva Solar, a US subsidiary of the Areva SA of France, has provided the CFLR (compact linear fresnel reflector) technology for the project.
With this project, R Power said its generation capacity has increased to 5,285 MW, which includes 5,100 MW of thermal capacity and 185 MW of renewable energy.

Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: Gold prices plunged by Rs 345 to Rs 26,050 per 10 grams in the national capital on Tuesday, tracking a weak global trend amid absence of demand from jewellers and retailers at domestic markets.
Silver remained under pressure and fell by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units.
Sentiment remained subdued largely in tandem with a weak trend in global markets where gold traded at a four-year low as surging dollar waned demand for the precious metals, traders said.
Besides, slackened demand from jewellers as well as retailers at prevailing levels at domestic spot markets too weighed on prices, they added.
Globally, gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell 0.16 per cent to $1,149 an ounce - the lowest level since 2010. Silver also slid 0.7 per cent to $15.50 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity tumbled by Rs 345 each to Rs 26,050 and Rs 25,850 per 10 grams respectively. It had lost Rs 55 in Monday's trade.
Sovereign declined by Rs 100 to Rs 23,700 per piece of 8 grams.
In a similar fashion, silver ready dropped further by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 535 to Rs 34,490 per kg.
Silver coins also fell sharply by Rs 2,000 to Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

New Delhi: Amara Raja Batteries on Tuesday reported a 6.04 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 100.30 crore for the second quarter that ended on September 30, 2014.

Net income of the company increased 32.02 per cent during the quarter under review to Rs 1,065.59 crore as against Rs 807.12 in the year-ago period.
"We are delighted to report the continuing growth momentum of the company that is reflected by the highest revenue and profit for the quarter," Amara Raja Batteries vice chairman and managing director Jayadev Galla said.

Brent Just Above Recent 4-Year LowOil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
Brent crude traded close to $82 per barrel on Tuesday after hitting a four-year low, as a firm dollar and robust production from U.S. shale oilfields outweighed a drop in Libyan output.
Brent for December fell $1.11 to $81.23 per barrel, its lowest since October 2010, and was around $82 by 4.15 p.m. US crude was down 20 cents at $77.20 per barrel.
The US dollar hit a seven-year high against the yen and was up 0.2 percent on the day against a basket of currencies.
A strong dollar suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities by making them more expensive for purchasers using other currencies.
"The path of least resistance is lower, until the OPEC meeting," said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale, in a research note.
Brent has fallen nearly 30 per cent since late June due to rising production, slowing global demand, and the absence of clear signals from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it will cut output at a Nov. 27 meeting.
Falling prices have had little impact on drilling in the United States, with output from the fastest-growing and largest shale fields showing no sign of slowing, the Energy Information Administration said.
A supply shock in Libya lent some support to prices, as a rival government that has seized the capital took control of the country's biggest oilfield, El Sharara.
El Sharara and the eastern oil port of Hariga, which was shut by protests on Saturday, remain closed.
Libya's output in the coming months will depend on whether that government can consolidate control over assets and avoid international sanctions, but most analysts believe production in 2015 will be significantly lower than the peak above 900,000 barrels a day, achieved in September.
There was no breakthrough in negotiations between Iran and Western powers after talks in Muscat, officials said, but talks continued on Tuesday. A deal could result in the lifting of Western sanctions, paving the way for increased Iranian oil exports.
JPMorgan slashed its 2015 Brent price forecast by $33 to $82 per barrel on Monday, citing supply pressures in the Atlantic Basin and the apparent inability of OPEC member states to work cohesively to restrain production.

November 11, 2014 05:11 AM EST | Associated Press

Gold steadies near $1 150 on physical demandGold steadies near $1,150 on physical demand
Reuters
Tweet
London, Nov 11:  
Gold steadied near $1,150 an ounce on Tuesday as demand for physical metal picked up after the previous day’s 2 per cent slide, though prices remain under pressure from gains in the dollar and stocks.
Buying of physical metal gathered pace in major consumer China on Tuesday, traders said, supporting prices after dollar strength pushed them sharply lower in the previous session.
Spot gold, gold futures
Spot gold was flat at $1,150.45 an ounce at 1021 GMT, while US gold futures for December delivery were down $9.90 an ounce at $1,149.90.
The metal slid to a 4-1/2 year low at $1,131.85 an ounce last week, and is currently down 4.3 per cent this year.
“Retail demand is very strong since prices came off,’’ Heraeus trader Alexander Zumpfe said.
“Overall, physical demand is lending some support - Asia is also showing steady buying interest, though not on extreme levels.’’
Dollar index
A 0.2 per cent rise in the dollar index is keeping pressure on gold. A stronger dollar makes assets priced in the US unit more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Appetite for other assets is also improving. European stocks rose, with investors bullish after Wall Street posted a fourth straight record close and Tokyo’s Nikkei hit a seven-year high.
US economic recovery
Gold’s inability to retain Friday's 3 per cent jump suggests investors are selling into rallies, expecting more losses on the back of the US economic recovery, a robust dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner rather than later.
Gold could fall towards $800-$900 an ounce, a level not seen since the 2008/2009 financial crisis, as the metal is no longer seen as a decent portfolio diversifier, hedge fund Red Kite had said on Monday.
Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 1.8 tonnes on Monday to 725.36 tonnes, a six-year low. The fund has seen outflows of 15.8 tonnes so far this month.
Silver was down 0.3 per cent at $15.51 an ounce. Spot platinum was down 0.2 per cent at $1,190.24 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 0.2 per cent at $757.35 an ounce.

92% Indian adults say cyber attacks can damage economy: Survey92% Indian adults say cyber attacks can damage economy: Survey
Our Bureau

Bangalore, Nov 11:  
More than nine in ten or 92 per cent of surveyed adults in India say they are fearful that cyber hackers are carrying out attacks on major industries and sectors of the economy in their countries, according to the results of a global study announced today by Honeywell Process Solutions (HPS).
Of the 10 countries surveyed, India had the highest percentage of respondents who said they were very fearful or somewhat fearful of cyber attacks. Further, the survey pointed out that more than one third of Indian respondents 34 per cent indicated they do not believe that it is possible to stop all the cyber attacks. 61 per cent said that they don’t have faith in India’s ability to keep up with cyber attacks because they feel that government and organisations are not taking these threats seriously enough – the highest among countries surveyed. The next two highest were China 48 per cent and Mexico 47 per cent, according to the survey.
According to Michael Chertoff, co-founder and executive chairman of the Chertoff Group, and former head of the US Department of Homeland Security, this threat is real and industries need a proactive and coordinated approach to protect their assets as well as their intellectual property. "We have seen a number of attacks to critical industries in areas like the Middle East and the U.S. and these have had major impacts on their operations,” he added.

BSE Sensex edges higher; rate-sensitive stocks up ahead of inflation dataFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The BSE Sensex today gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data tomorrow.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government’s reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of USD 82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore yesterday, according to the stock exchanges’ data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released tomorrow, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.
Indian shares edge higher ahead of key retail inflation data
(Reuters) Indian shares edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank  rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Meanwhile, non-banking finance companies like Housing Development Finance Corporation also rose after the central bank unveiled rules on bad loans and capital requirements that came largely along expected lines.
Traders say volumes will remain muted until India releases data on Wednesday on retail inflation, which is expected to slow to a record low of 5.80 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll.
That is expected to intensify calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review on Dec. 2.
“Market is discounting a fall in inflation and a resultant decrease in interest rates,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.
The benchmark BSE index rose 0.13 percent to end at 27,910.06.     The broader NSE index rose 0.22 percent to end at 8,362.65, also marking a record closing high.
Rate-sensitive stocks led the gains on hopes lower retail inflation data would enable the central bank to go for early rate cuts.
ICICI Bank ended up 1.6 percent while HDFC Bank  gained 0.4 percent.
Among state-run banks, Bank of Baroda rose 2.7 percent while Punjab National Bank advanced 3.4 percent.
Some auto stocks gained with Mahindra and Mahindra  rising 2.4 percent while Larsen and Toubro gained 1.1 percent.
Non-banking finance companies also rose. India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans on Monday, but the rules were largely within expectations.
Housing Development Finance Corporation gained 1.2 percent, while IDFC ended 2.7 percent higher.
Shriram Transport gained 4.9 percent, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services rose 1.1 percent.
However, among decliners, Jet Airways fell 2.5 percent on profit-taking after Monday’s 6.9 percent surge after September-quarter results.

The last thing you would expect on a heritage walk in Hauz Khas is that the lovely archways or windows have overdressed and over made up couples necking in full public glare pretending to be in love with each other while photographers advise them on how to pose and pout at each other. At first I thought this was a joke, it had a very unreal feel to it till I saw the elaborate setup with cameras and lighting and some of the girls even had makeup assistants to boot. Hauz Khas with its pavilions, has plenty of arches, pillars and windows and all of them were choc-a-bloc with fake pre-wedding romance.
The three domed pavilion was a particular favourite and it was hogged all morning by a woman who kept tripping over a long rust skirt. She and her fiancée locked their arms around each other in great displays of passion. The young man took chivalry to another level by carrying her in his arms, all orchestrated by the photographer, and doing a couple of laboured pirouettes. All of us watched with bated breath, wondering if he could manage without dropping her, but in the end he set her down gratefully the ordeal had ended.
In addition to us, watching this spectacle adoringly was a thin young girl who couldn’t take her eyes off the couple as they pranced among the ancient arches. I could see the pre-wedding shoot had hit a home run with this girl. And as we meandered around the L shaped madrassa and Feroz Shah Tughlaq’s tomb, overlooking the lake, there were couples everywhere and attendant photographers. A girl was being taught to pout, all very awkwardly and another couple had in a master stroke of innovation. They brought along a rather small and dainty umbrella with frills and some gold design under which to pose for pictures.
Sitting on the weather-beaten stones, another bride-to-be, dressed in an unbecoming, green polka-dotted halter, was being made up with haste, as she tried to ignore the amused gaze of the visitors, while in the short grass photographers set up equipment and made sure the poses were modest, but suggestive. So this girl dressed in some flowing gold ensemble stuck close to her man and looked adoringly into his eyes while others hugged in front of tombs, giving the phrase ‘turning in one’s grave’ an altogether new meaning. We asked one of the couples what this was all about and they confirmed this was indeed a shoot before their wedding which was sometime next month. Obviously this had become part of some ritual much like the mehendi and the sangeet which has invaded marriages even in the south.
A day earlier, right wing activists disrupted the Kiss of Love protest held near the RSS headquarters in the capital but students incensed by moral lectures had had enough. The Kiss of Love movement, which began in Kerala, seems to have caught on and these moralists feel pain only when they see people displaying affection in public. Kissing is Western culture, say these oracles on what is Indian culture and its do’s and don’ts. But in the best tradition of hypocrisy, it’s perfectly okay to cling to each other in public, look deeply into each others’ eyes and pose in the most suggestive manner possible. Most of these poses seem to be borrowed from Hindi films where titillation rules the roost. Even that Sunday there was plenty of suggestion of what is possible, a trailer, really, frozen on hundreds of digital frames, of things to come. But this is a pre-wedding shoot you see and we must be modest and pretend. How is it that these same guardians of morality never think of stopping vulgar extravagant weddings or the huge amounts of dowry that families have to pay, or protest when women are burnt to death for not bringing enough money. That’s Indian culture, not Western, you see. We are like this only.
The history of Hauz Khas goes back to the 13th century and is a sterling example of planning and architecture, all totally lost on the mooning couples. The madrassa was established in the 1350s and also overlooks the lake which was dug during Allauddin Khilji’s reign and was named after him – Hauz-e-Ilai. The water body has been revived under a new plan and even if it’s treated sewage water, it has a serene emerald look in the dull morning haze. The lake had dried up completely, says Sohail Hashmi, the man who knows everything there is to know about the history of Delhi and who conducts these walks. He remembers going on day-long picnics at Hauz Khas when it was dry.
The saving grace was there were no pre-wedding shoots then. It’s the kiss of death to any monument.

Snag  duty time curbs cancelled Air India NY flightSnag, duty time curbs cancelled Air India NY flight
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 9:  
Air India passengers bound to New York and London had a harrowing time at the city airport after the airline had to cancel the NY flight due to technical snag and duty time curbs on crew and the other flight because of a mock drill at the airport.
While a technical snag and duty time restrictions on cabin crew grounded AI-191 Mumbai-Newark flight yesterday, the Mumbai-London flight (AI-131) was delayed by nearly three hours due to the mock drill at the airport. When contacted, Air India admitted to the delays and claimed that passengers had been taken care of.
“Yes, we had to cancel the AI-191 Mumbai-Newark flight with 191 passengers due to a technical snag yesterday. When the snag was rectified, the FDTL (flight duty time limit) of the cabin crew came into being thus had to cancel the flight,” Air India said in a statement.
The airline further said out of the 191 passengers, 44 were provided hotel accommodation and the rest who came from Mumbai were given taxi fares. All of them were accommodated on today’s flight at 0130 hours which had full load of 303 passengers.
The passengers who came from Ahmedabad were sent to Delhi for the JFK flight which departed at 0200 hrs today from the national capital, the airline said.
As regards the delay of AI-131 Mumbai-London flight, the airline blamed it on the mock drill at the airport. “Though the flight was ready for departure at 1400 hrs yesterday, it was delayed to 1620 hrs due to a mock drill by MIAL which lasted till 1530 hrs,” AI said.
In the past few weeks, AI had been facing severe delays, so much so that the aviation ministry had to issue instructions to the national airline to improve its on-time performance.

Islamic State Leader Wounded In Airstrike  Report Iraqi OfficialsISIS Leader Wounded In Airstrike, Report Iraqi Officials
 | By                                                                QASSIM ABDUL-ZAHRA and VIVIAN SALAMA

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.
Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.
The reports came at a time when President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the Islamic State militants.
Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.
He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.
An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official, cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.
The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.
A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defense Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.
Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.
The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armored vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.
When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: "We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured."
Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some Islamic State militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.
"They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital," Abdurrahman said.
There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.
The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.
Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.
As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.
On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.
The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.
Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.
In an interview with CBS' "Face the Nation" that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.
"Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offense," Obama said.
"The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making," he added.

BSE Sensex hits record high  but closes flat on profit-booking; ITC surges 4pctFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark BSE Sensex today ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75. It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC Ltd, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Hind Unilever, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet, lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Universal license for spectrum: Vodafone accuses DoT of using  artwisting  tacticsEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Vodafone today moved the Delhi High Court alleging the Centre is indulging in “arm-twisting” and “coercive” tactics by refusing to sign its unified licence (UL) till the telecom major unconditionally accepts the “restrictive” clauses in the licence.
Vodafone has contended in its plea that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) showed them a copy of the UL only on November 3 and the company had on November 5 written to the government to remove the “restrictive clauses” prohibiting the telecom major from entering into intra-circle roaming (ICR) pacts.
“However, petitioners (Vodafone) were surprised that instead of signing and executing the ULs, the respondent (DoT) wrongly, unreasonably and arbitrarily and at the last moment informed that the letter of November 5 is a conditional compliance and not acceptable.
“DoT also informed that petitioners’ request for deletion of restrictive clauses in UL pertaining to roaming cannot be accepted. It is submitted that said restrictive clauses in the UL take away the rights already granted to petitioner and as upheld by TDSAT on April 29, 2014,” the petition has said.
TDSAT had on April 29 overturned a government ban on offering 3G mobile services beyond their licensed zones through roaming pacts saying it was in national interest to allow better utilisation of scarce radio frequency.
It has sought orders declaring the “restrictive clauses” as illegal and their deletion from the UL.
The matter is likely to be heard tomorrow.
The telecom major has accused DoT of “adopting coercive steps” saying “if UL is not signed in a timely manner, then the existing 22 million subscribers in three service areas – Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata – of the petitioners, being provided services under existing unified access service licence (UASL), will face disruption of services after November 29, 2014.”
Vodafone’s UASL for these service areas is set to expire on November 29.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that as it was in a “vulnerable” position, owing to impending expiry of its UASL, and DoT, being aware of consequences for the company “is arm-twisting, abusing its position/powers as a licensor to delay and deny” the telecom major’s entitlement to use the spectrum obtained in the auctions.
Vodafone has contended that it bought/acquired spectrum in 2010 and 2014 at a total cost of around Rs 24,000 crore, of which Rs 12,000 crore has already been paid.
“Respondent, after taking such huge amounts paid towards spectrum, cannot now adopt coercive measure for signing UL with the petitioners,” the petition has said.
According to Vodafone’s plea, DoT has already accepted their applications, conveyed approvals and issued Letters of Intent (LoI) on August 28, September 15 and September 23 for Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi areas respectively.
The company has claimed that it too has unequivocally and unconditionally accepted these LoIs and have fulfilled each and every requisite condition thereunder through their acceptance letters.
As per the new telecom policy, unified licences are to be given to telecom companies to use the spectrum acquired by them and provide mobile services to their subscribers.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that the UL of another telecom service provider was signed only after it moved the Bombay High Court.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular, the three biggest mobile service providers in the country, and Reliance Jio were among eight companies that bid a combined Rs 61,162 crore for spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands offered by the government during a 10-day auction that ended on February 13 this year.

Feder: Chicago anchor sues Telemundo over firingTweet
Edna Schmidt
Edna Schmidt, who was a top news anchor at two Spanish-language stations in Chicago, is suing one of them for firing her when she appeared drunk on the air.
A lawsuit filed in federal court last week claims Telemundo Station Group’s WSNS-Channel 44 and parent company NBC Universal violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to provide Schmidt “reasonable accommodation” for her alcoholism.
After two months on the job, Schmidt was suspended as co-anchor of “Noticiero Telemundo Chicago” when she showed up intoxicated on the 10 p.m. newscast September 30, 2013. Within weeks, her suspension turned into termination from her $200,000-a-year position. Management at the time said only that Schmidt was no longer with the station, adding: “We wish her the best in her future endeavors.”
Seeking unspecified damages for wrongful termination, Schmidt’s lawsuit alleges that her bosses made no attempt to get her treatment.
Chris McDonnell, president and general manager of Telemundo Chicago, declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday.
Schmidt’s legal action last week coincided with the airing of a five-part November sweeps series on her struggles with alcoholism on Univision WGBO-Channel 66. Schmidt was a top news anchor for “Noticias Univision Chicago” from 1995 until she was promoted to Univision Network News correspondent and anchor in 2000.
“The series is to raise awareness about the subject of alcoholism,” Teri Arvesu, news director of Univision Chicago, said in a statement. “It’s an opportunity to empower women who are going through this and motivate their rehabilitation.”

Brown student tests positive for date-rape drug after fraternity partyBy Sarah Larimer November 10 Follow @slarimer
A female Brown University student has tested positive for the date rape drug GHB. A school official says two female students became rapidly intoxicated at a fraternity party, and one reported being sexually assaulted. (AP)
In October, two students at Brown told university officials that they thought they had been given spiked drinks at a fraternity party. One of the students also said she’d been sexually assaulted, according to the Brown Daily Herald .
Shortly after the incident, students received a campus-wide e-mail alert, the Daily Herald reported. Phi Kappa Psi — the fraternity believed to have hosted the party at which the drinks were spiked — wrote an open letter in the campus newpaper , saying the allegations were a “complete surprise.”
“First and foremost, we were all shocked by the circumstances of the allegations,” the brothers wrote. “Sexual assault and the use of illegal date-rape drugs number among the most heinous of crimes. We are confident that in no way did any member of Phi Kappa Psi engage in or perpetrate such atrocious and criminal behavior.”
This weekend, though, students at Brown received another campus-wide e-mail. It said that one of the victims tested positive for gamma hydroxybutyrate — a “date-rape” drug more commonly known as GHB.
“GHB is a colorless, odorless drug that can be hard to detect in a drink,” the university notice read, according to the Providence Journal , “but has a strong sedative effect that is incapacitating.”
GHB can have a salty taste, which can sometimes be masked when it is mixed with a punch, as it allegedly was at the frat party. It can knock you out, and it can kill you. That’s what happened in the case of 15-year-old Samantha Reid , whose death helped inspire federal legislation .
“This is a cruel, evil thing to do to another person,” Gail Abarbanel, founder the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, told Salon in 2000 . “It’s potentially lethal, and it’s a felony crime. Those are the reasons not to do it. Then, of course, you wonder what the attraction is to have sex with an unconscious body.”
Authorities say GHB was also the drug used by Max Factor heir Andrew Luster during a series of rapes at his beachfront home. At his trial, prosecutors played a tape labeled “Shawna GHBing,” which included footage of a victim snoring.
“This is exactly what I want, a passed-out beautiful girl,” Luster said on the tape, according to the Los Angeles Times . “Look at that.”
Inevitably, the Brown case will be followed by larger conversations about campus safety and sexual assault .
“This is the only crime where people blame the victim,” Annie E. Clark, co-founder of the survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus , told Bloomberg in August . “Regardless of what you do, you don’t ask for a crime to be committed.”
The investigation at Brown also comes about two months after the president of another university told a group of women that they should avoid “a situation that would cause you to be trying to explain something that really needs no explanation had you not put yourself in that situation.”
“We have, we had, on this campus last semester three cases of young women who after having done whatever they did with young men and then it didn’t turn out the way they wanted it to turn out, guess what they did,” Lincoln University president Robert R. Jennings told the group , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “They went to Public Safety and said, ‘He raped me.’”
His comments were posted to YouTube, though Jennings told the paper they were taken out of context.
“No one would ever discourage a young woman on this campus from reporting a sexual assault,” Jennings told the Inquirer. “In fact, I emphasize to them how serious that allegation is and that the university takes it very seriously and so does the federal government and so does the court.”
In the Brown case, a test on the second victim is still pending, according to the Providence Journal.
The newspaper also reported that a Providence College student said she was sexually assaulted off-campus on Saturday by someone who wasn’t enrolled at the university.

A day after the minor blast near CRPF camp here which housed the camp office of NIA probing the Burdwan blast, Bidhannagar City Police on Tuesday said preliminary probe indicated that there was no evidence of bomb blast and crackers could have been used to play mischief.
“Prima facie there is no evidence of bomb blast as we have not found smell of explosives or remnants. We have found one or two eye witnesses and it is likely that crackers could have been used to play mischief,” Bidhannagar City Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar said.
He, however, had said a detailed investigation would be carried out into the incident.
Bidhannagar police officers said that they have already sent samples collected from spot for chemical test.
“We are waiting for the results”, they said.
The police was also looking into CCTV footage at the Technopolis bus stand which is close to the CRPF camp, they said.
Debasish Dhar, Additional Police commissioner, Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, last night said that they were suspecting the material used could be a firecracker.
“We are not taking it lightly. A police team has rushed to the spot to inquire into the nature of the explosive material,” Dhar had said.
The anti-terror probe agency situated in the Bidhannagar area in the suburb of the city, is also being used to interrogate Sajid, the mastermind of the Burdwan blast, and other terrorists arrested in connection with the blast.

After Kochi  Kozhikode to host kiss in the street to protest moralpolicingThis is a cultural surge. Come let us kiss in the street, said the Facebook page.

After the Kochi edition of the ‘ kiss of love ‘ early this month, next in the same line is ‘kiss in the street’ slated for December 7 in Kozhikode to publically register the protest against the alleged incidents of moral policing in Kerala.
The organisers have launched a Facebook page for kiss in the street to uphold the freedom of an individual. The ‘kiss of love’ held in Kochi on November 2 had a slap on the cheek of moral policing. We need decentralised repeat of the kiss of love. This is a cultural surge. Come let us kiss in the street, said the Facebook page.
Police had arrested several men and women in Kochi who tried to conduct the ‘kiss of love’ protest in the wake of BJP attack against a hotel in Kozhikode. Thousands had thronged Kochi to witness the event, but had to return crestfallen as the police did not allow the participants of the kiss festival to go into the venue.

The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday announced five more candidates, including four Muslim faces, for the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections while releasing its third list of candidates.
The BJP has so far declared 72 candidates out of a total of 87 seats in the State Assembly, of which 20 Muslims have been fielded.
While Abdul Rehman Lone will contest from Kupwara constituency, Abdul Rashid Zargar will contest from Lolab, M M War from Langate seat and Ghulam Hassan Zargar from the Kulgam seat.
The party has also fielded Nirmal Singh from Billawar assembly constituency.
The party’s Central Election Committee cleared the names of five more candidates for the State Assembly elections starting November 25, party general secretary and CEC Secretary J P Nadda said.
Buoyed with the party’s recent successes in Haryana and Maharashtra, the BJP is optimistic of performing well in the upcoming Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand as well.
The BJP has also chalked out a strategy for Jammu and Kashmir and is working in close coordination with smaller parties. The party is likely to carry along some moderate separatists in the Valley and may align with some of them after the polls.

Ferrari  Maserati coming back toIndiaPrint
By: Express News Service | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:30 pm
Word is out that Ferrari and Maserati are contemplating to re-enter the Indian car  market. The Fiat Chrysler Group, which owns both of these Italian marques among others, is keen to set up Ferrari and Maserati shops back again here as it sees a great opportunity in the higher-end niche car segment in India.
Close sources and those in the know of the matter have revealed that Maserati will open a national sales company in India first. The company has in fact already started the proceedings and is currently in process of appointing an eight-member team for the same. Post the successful completion of the ongoing recruitments, Maserati is expected to start selling its range of cars in India, starting from the second half of 2015 as per the current plans.
On the other hand, Ferrari’s Indian operations will be managed by the group’s base in Dubai. It has also come to notice that Ferrari is currently in talks with Yadur Kapur to open a dealership in Delhi. Yadur Kapur is a dealer partner for a number of luxury car brands in Delhi including Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Rolls Royce.
In Mumbai, Navnit Motors, which runs BMW, Land Rover and Rolls Royce dealerships in the region, is also in touch with Ferrari for a possible dealership, starting from the first quarter of 2015. Both the groups have also confirmed of the ongoing talks if sources are to be believed. Ferrari, once it officially comes back to India, will be offering cars like the California T convertible, FF, 458 Italia, F12 Berlinetta, 458 Spider in India.
In the past, Ferrari and Maserati were both present in the Indian car market. In the year 2011, Shreyans Group had been chosen as the official importer for Ferrari in India. The same group was also handling Maserati brand under a separate deal. In April 2014 though, the partnership between Shreyans Group and Ferrari fell through after Ferrari received repeated complaints from its customers in India about the substandard aftersales services of their vehicles by Shreyans Group; ultimately leading Ferrari to terminate the partnership.
Ferrari was not the only brand that had been left with a bad taste in its mouth by the Shreyans Group. Brands like Ducati and Porsche, too, parted ways from the group owing to the same concerns in the past. While Porsche is now going strong on its own in India, Ducati outlets here have been shut completely. Ducati is also expected to re-enter in to the Indian market soon under the guidance of its current owners, Audi.

EU court backs Germany on jobless benefit refusal... 
GEIR MOULSON | November 11, 2014 06:22 AM EST | Associated Press
BERLIN (AP) — A European Union court ruled Tuesday that Germany was within its rights to refuse unemployment benefits to an immigrant from Romania who made no effort to seek work in Germany, a decision that comes amid concern over perceived welfare abuse by migrants from poorer EU nations.
German judges sought a ruling from the European Court of Justice after a Romanian woman who arrived in Germany in 2010 sued a job center for refusing to grant her and her young son benefits intended primarily for the long-term unemployed and their children.
The EU court pointed to safeguards in the 28-nation bloc's rules on workers' freedom of movement which it said aim to "prevent economically inactive Union citizens from using the host member state's welfare system to fund their means of subsistence."
Member nations aren't obliged to grant benefits to other EU countries' citizens for the first three months and that, if they stay longer and don't work, they must have "sufficient resources of their own" to be entitled to residence, the court noted.
That wasn't the case with the Romanian woman, who lives with her sister, has no professional training and hasn't worked in Romania or Germany.
The EU has expanded over the past decade to take in formerly communist nations in central and eastern Europe and there has been mounting concern in other European countries, particularly Britain, about perceived abuse of workers' freedom of movement and welfare systems.
German lawmakers recently approved legislation that foresees entry bans for citizens of other EU countries who fraudulently claim benefits.
Germany is firmly committed to the principle of free movement of workers in the EU. British Prime Minister David Cameron, however, wants to take steps to limit the level of migration from the EU into Britain.

BSE chief: Need more stock markets in India to channelise savingsBSE MD and CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Leading bourse BSE today favoured more stock markets in the country, saying it will help in channelising household savings into productive capital.
Speaking at an annual summit on the capital markets, BSE MD and CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan said there is “need for more stock markets in India as it allows to channelise the savings of the country into productive capital.”
He further said India needs to create 1.5 crore new jobs annually for the next 20 years or about 30 crore new jobs that cannot be created by the Government alone. He said this “will have to come from the private sector, which goes to the stock markets to raise its funds.”
Chauhan said the focus should be on channelising household savings into the equity market, rather than it turning it into ‘idle money’.
“Only 10 per cent of India’s total savings worth about $600 billion i.e. about 30 per cent of India’s GDP ($2 trillion) goes into financial instruments, while 90 per cent of it goes into non-productive assets such as gold, but when invested in stock markets that money goes into creating jobs and creating companies,” Chauhan said at an Assocham event.
Meanwhile, Manoj Joshi, Joint Secretary, Financial Markets in the Finance Ministry, talked about the need to train financial regulators in the country.
“There is a need to train financial regulators in India, such as SEBI and RBI in terms of the cost-benefit analysis as it is essential to optimise regulation in the financial system by weighing its costs against its benefits,” he said.
He emphasised on the need for a strong penal system for less regulation in financial markets.
“If SEBI or RBI are able to effectively take action against wrongdoers not after the scam is broken and after it becomes too large an issue but for the minor offences in the beginning, probably there would be less requirement of corporate governance norms,” Joshi said.

Vodafone India loses its position to Italian opsSunny Sen      Follow @SunnySen    Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 17:24 IST
Photo: Reuters
Vodafone India has lost its position in the Vodafone Group Plc. Till last year, it was the third largest contributor to the group's revenues. But now it has been replaced by Vodafone's Italian operations.
Thomas Reisten, CFO of Vodafone India, said the drop was due to the increase in stake in Vodafone Italy, which in turn has increased its revenue position. Also, the services revenue of Vodafone India does not include revenue from Indus Towers, an infrastructure joint venture between Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular .
Vodafone India registered a revenue of Rs 20,642 crore, up 11.7 per cent, in the first half of 2014/15. In the same period, its EBITDA grew by 11.9 per cent. Marten Pieters, Managing Director and CEO of Vodafone India, attributed the growth to increased investments and data growth. Data revenue grew by 65.5 per cent to Rs. 2,552 crore. The company's 3G customer base grew 204 per cent to 13.6 million subscribers.
Vodafone has also increased its capital expenditure by 116.3 per cent to Rs. 3,509 crore in the first half. Though the company has managed grow profitably in India, Pieters might have to review the company's speed of growth, given the drop in position. After all, Vittorio Colao, Group CEO, had said last year that India had the potential to be one of the top two contributors.

AMU in controversy over denying library access to UG students  VC rejects sexist approachchargePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Aligarh | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:52 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:13 pm
The Aligarh Muslim University vice chancellor on Tuesday came under attack over his controversial remarks regarding the access of undergraduate girls to a varsity library with HRD Minister Smriti Irani having termed the matter an “insult to daughters”.
AMU VC Zameer Uddin Shah courted controversy as he turned down a demand of students of the varsity’s Women’s College for access to its main library, saying there would be “more boys” in the library if girls were allowed there.
Taking a strong view of the matter, Irani said, “There are some reports which hurt you as a woman and also agitate you that when we attained freedom there was a belief that education and constitutional rights were same for all… And now we get reports that amounts to an insult to daughters.”
Joining the chorus of disapproval over Shah’s comment, Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah said his statement was “appalling” even as the new MoS in the Ministry, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, averred that such remarks are “in bad taste and not acceptable in a civilised society”.
“I do find it appalling, especially on the day of Maulana Azad’s birth anniversary… 62 years ago, Azad focussed on girls’ education… I am really surprised. This day, somebody talks like that as the head of an institution, it is shocking,” Heptullah said.
The AMU has cited space constraints for not allowing access to the library to the said students while refuting the charge of having a “sexist approach”. But Heptullah said that the vice chancellor should take steps for expanding the library so that more girls can be accommodated.
Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said, “Prohibiting somebody from going (to the library) is not right. Arrangements should be made so that all students can go to the library.”
Terming Shah’s statement as “regressive and antediluvian”, National Commission for Women chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam wondered if it was “legal for them (AMU) to bar any student from accessing such services in a university”.
All India Democratic Women’s Association general secretary Jagmati Sangwan termed Shah’s statement ‘unfortunate’ and called for action against people making such remarks.
Reactions also poured in from corporates with Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar Shaw saying in a tweet, “AMU’s Curbs on Women Using Library is a slur on system”.
Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti also criticised the decision, saying it reflected “anti-women mentality” of the university authority.
“Restricting entry of girl students in library of a Central university reflects that the university authority maintains anti-women mentality,” said the Minister of State for Food Processing Industries while talking to reporters in Lucknow.
“Women of all sections of the society have freedom to get educated and progress. They should get equal opportunity,” she said.

Pennsylvania cities sue over law on firearm rules...SEAN CARLIN and MARC LEVY | November 11, 2014 06:50 AM EST | Associated Press
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Pennsylvania's two largest cities sued the state on Monday over a new law that was designed to let the National Rifle Association challenge local firearms ordinances in court.
The lawsuit is the latest fight between Pennsylvania cities trying to curb gun violence and a legislature that has resisted new forms of gun control in a state rich with hunting tradition.
The lawsuit, filed by Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in Commonwealth Court, argues that lawmakers approved the measure in violation of state constitutional provisions designed to promote transparency in the legislative process.
"We'll fight this effort in every possible step. We're doing the right thing in trying to make people safe," said Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. "The NRA is wrong again, as usual."
Other plaintiffs include the city of Lancaster and five Democratic lawmakers from Pittsburgh and the Philadelphia area.
State Sen. Daylin Leach, D-Montgomery, said "the way this bill was passed was such an egregious violation of the basic rules of legislating that we felt compelled to act." He said the law allows the NRA "to sue our own citizens for protecting themselves and their communities."
In general, Pennsylvania bars its municipalities from enforcing firearms ordinances that are stronger than state law. But the NRA has complained that dozens of local ordinances go unchallenged in Pennsylvania courts by residents who can prove it harmed them.
Under the new law, a gun owner would no longer have to prove they had been harmed by the law to successfully challenge it, and "membership organizations" could stand in to sue on behalf of any Pennsylvania member. The challenger also could seek damages, and the law's opponents fear a wave of expensive lawsuits against municipalities.
Both the NRA and the gun-control advocacy group CeaseFirePA said they knew of no similar law in any other state.
The lawsuit cites provisions in the constitution that say a bill should not be changed to alter its original purpose, and that no bill should contain more than one subject. Last month, the lawsuit provision was added to an underlying bill written to try to prevent the theft of wires, cables and other metals from businesses.
Within five days of it being amended, Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled House and Senate each passed the bill over the protests of most urban Democrats and some suburban Republicans.
Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican who opposes gun-control measures, signed the bill last week, starting a 60-day clock before the law would take effect. A spokesman for Corbett's office said the governor's lawyers had not reviewed the lawsuit, while House Speaker Sam Smith said through a spokesman that he believes the bill met constitutional requirements.
Many of Pennsylvania's biggest cities require gun owners to tell police if a gun they own is lost or stolen, an effort to stop straw purchases of firearms for people who intend to use them in crimes.
Courts have struck down other municipal firearms ordinances — such as bans in Philadelphia on selling assault weapons or buying more than one handgun a month. The NRA has complained that legal challenges to the "lost and stolen" reporting laws were unsuccessful because courts said the plaintiffs could not prove they were harmed by it.

Man branded  selfie stalker  sues Nancy Grace...Nancy Grace Sued For Defamation By Falsely Accused 'Selfie Stalker'
 | By                                                                SADIE GURMAN

DENVER (AP) — A man who was quickly branded a "selfie stalker" after his picture turned up on a crime victim's cellphone is suing television commentator Nancy Grace for defamation, saying she refused to stop airing his photo even after authorities had cleared him of any wrongdoing.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Denver says Grace, who hosts a show on Turner Broadcasting's HLN network, incorrectly told millions of viewers that Ben Seibert invaded a woman's home and snapped a photo of himself on her phone, which she described as a "textbook serial killer's calling card."
Seibert said Grace humiliated him with her commentary, which prompted people across the country to label him a weirdo, sicko, rapist and pervert on various social network sites. The suit says Grace didn't check the facts and didn't care.
"It hasn't been easy for him as a result of this," Seibert's attorney, John Pineau said.
Turner Broadcasting did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment. Through his attorney, Seibert declined to comment.
Denver Metro Crime Stoppers released Seibert's photo on Jan. 29, after a woman called police saying a man had entered her home while she was putting her children to bed. Police said she was especially fearful because she believed the man had taken a selfie with her phone inside of her home.
But further investigation showed the picture was Seibert's Facebook photo that had been taken elsewhere. Seibert, who was working in California, called police Feb. 8 after friends told him his photo was being associated with the Denver home invasion. He was not charged.
The same month, police told Grace her broadcast was false, but she continued to air it, according to the lawsuit, which seeks more than $100,000 in damages.
The suit also names Crime Stoppers, which Seibert says refused to stop publishing his picture even after Denver police notified the organization of the mistake.
Mike Mills, board president of Metro Denver Crime Stoppers, told The Associated Press that police agencies choose when to release and retract crime alerts.
"When we heard there was a mistake, or that it had been retracted, we pulled it off Facebook. We pulled it off Twitter. We pulled it off our website," Mills said.
The lawsuit points to other cases in which it says Grace made "outrageous and defamatory" comments on television and notes that several courts admonished her for unethical conduct during the nine years she was a prosecutor.
"Based on the history we've researched regarding Ms. Grace, we're pretty confident there are other victims," Pineau said, urging others to come forward to help Seibert's case.

CBS  Logan quarantined after Ebola report... 
DAVID BAUDER | November 11, 2014 06:48 AM EST | Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — Lara Logan of CBS News is being quarantined in a South Africa hotel for three weeks as a precaution after visiting an American-run hospital treating Ebola patients in Liberia for a "60 Minutes" report that aired Sunday.
CBS said Monday that Logan's 21-day self-quarantine will end this Friday. Neither Logan nor the four other CBS employees in South Africa have shown any sign that they are infected with the virus.
Logan, speaking in a "60 Minutes Overtime" web interview from the room where the CBS crew put its report together, admitted to some cabin fever as she waits out her stay. She said the South African government had given the crew permission to work at the hotel.
"We wanted to try, as much as possible, to minimize our exposure to anybody while we still had to get our piece done," she said. "We were very mindful of the fact that this 21-day period after you've been in an Ebola-affected country is very important to everyone."
The interview showed Logan and one of her colleagues in a room stuffed with equipment. "We haven't traveled far from the room that you can see," she said.
The "60 Minutes" report detailed her precautions while in Liberia, including being hosed down with a chlorine solution, having her temperature taken frequently and making sure not to touch people. A CBS security worker traveled with the crew with the responsibility of watching everyone's interactions to minimize any chance they could be infected.
A cameraman who was working for NBC News in Liberia contracted the virus but recovered last month. Nancy Snyderman, the NBC News medical correspondent who worked there, was asked to go into voluntary quarantine when she arrived home but that was made mandatory after she was spotted leaving her home. ABC's Richard Besser was not quarantined upon his return from Liberia because the ABC team was judged not to have had exposure to the virus.
Logan briefly teared up when talking about William, a 5-year-old boy featured in her report who was cared for in the hospital by his father but who later died. She said she has a son the same age.
"It's so heartbreaking," she said. "It's really been hard on all of us."
It was Logan's second "60 Minutes" story aired since her return from a forced leave of absence after questions were raised about her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.

Safety and customer service will be priority, he says
Suresh Prabhu on Monday took over as the new Railway Minister and said rail safety and customer service would be his priorities, as he seeks to unleash the true potential of the transport behemoth.
“We have faced lots of challenges in running the railways in the past. We do have potential which has not been properly utilised,” he told reporters after assuming charge.
Mr. Prabhu, who took oath as a Cabinet minister yesterday shortly after he joined BJP from Shiv Sena, replacing SD Sadananda Gowda who was shifted to the Law Ministry in the reshuffle.
“The Prime Minister has decided that the condition (of railways) has to change...Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety as passenger safety is increasingly becoming an area of concern,” he said.
Observing that the people have reposed lot of faith in the government, he said the steps they undertake in railways will be seen in due course of time.
“What we will do will be seen in due course of time, so no announcement will be made is the announcement,” he said.
Mr. Prabhu said the economy is also dependent on railways. Railways are an integrating factor for the economy and, “if we work in this direction we can propel economic growth,” he said.
With the public transporter having the largest workforce in the country, Mr. Prabhu said addressing their concerns will also be high on his agenda as they are the driving force behind the railway’s journey.

BIG Cinemas lines up suitors for Rs 800-cr dealBIG Cinemas lines up suitors for Rs 800-crore deal
SPS Pannu     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 12:39 IST
BIG Cinemas is a 100-per cent subsidiary of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Capital
BIG Cinemas, a 100-per cent subsidiary of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Capital, has lined up three suitors for a Rs 800-crore deal on the lines of the merger agreement that Reliance MediaWorks (RMW) had inked with global media and entertainment giant Prime Focus Limited in July.
According to sources, Carnival Films Private Limited, a South India-centric company, has emerged as the front runner for the deal while PVR Limited and Inox Leisure Limited are also in the race.
Reliance ADAG had in a gamechanging move for the industry signed an agreement for the merger of the global film and media services business of Reliance MediaWorks with Prime Focus. The combined revenues of the two firms worked out in excess of Rs 1,800 crore and included operations in India, Los Angeles, London, Vancouver, Singapore and Beijing.
The deal had entailed an equity infusion of Rs 240 crore at Rs 52 per share into Prime Focus by RMW and the promoters of Prime Focus in equal proportion.
Big Cinemas owns 500 screens of which 258 are in India while the rest are in the US and Malaysia. The company was hived off from RMW at the time of the Prime Focus deal and made a 100-per cent subsidiary of Reliance Capital, the financial services company of the Anil Ambani Group.
Sources disclosed that the new move to strike a deal with Carnival Films is expected to be modelled on the same lines.
If Big Cinemas' proposed deal comes through, it would be the third in the movie exhibition business in recent months as multiplex operators seek to consolidation to increase their bargaining power with film producers and distributors so that they get a bigger slice of the box office receipts in India's whopping Rs 9,200-crore movie industry.
Inox Leisure, India's second-largest multiplex operator, acquired Delhi-based Satyam Cineplexes for nearly Rs 240 crore paying Rs 182 crore in cash and taking over its debt in a deal that expanded Inox's presence to 50 cities with 91 multiplexes and 358 screens.
Similarly, Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited sold its multiplex business Broadway Cinemas to Carnival Cinemas. PVR had acquired Cinemax a couple of years ago.
According to industry sources, very few new malls have come up due to the economic slowdown, which is limiting the number of fresh screens that can be brought into operation. Most of the big players are therefore seeking consolidation in operations in order to take advantage of the economies of scale to rake in higher profits.

World Cup shared if final tied or washed out
The total prize money on offer during the tournament will be US$10 million, which is a rise of 25% compared to the 2011 event.

The World Cup will be shared if the final at the MCG on March 29 is tied - or washed out - after it was decided not to use Super Overs during the knockout phase of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand.
The 2011 tournament had the provision for one-over eliminators in the event of tied knockout matches, but this time group position will be the deciding factor if teams cannot be separated on the day in either the quarters or semis - a criteria which was needed in the famous 1999 semi-final when Australia tied with South Africa at Edgbaston and progressed by virtue of their higher Super Six position.

However, should the scores be level in the final, two captains will get their hands on the trophy. There will be reserve days available from the quarter-finals onwards in the event of poor weather.
The total prize money on offer during the tournament will be US$10 million, which is a rise of 25% compared to the 2011 event (not 20% as stated in the official ICC release). Teams exiting in the group stage will earn US$35,000, which rises to US$3,750,000 for winning the title outright.
The ICC also confirmed the cut-off date for qualification for the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales, which seemingly ends any chance of a u-turn from it being a 10-team tournament. On September 30, 2017 the top eight-ranked ODI nations will qualify for the World Cup with those ranked at nine and 10 playing in a qualification tournament, to be held in Bangladesh in 2018.
Originally next year's World Cup was set to be a 10-team event - a decision announced days after the 2011 final in Mumbai - but the outrage from Associate nations promoted a rethink and retention of the 14-team tournament for one more cycle. Ireland, Scotland, Afghanistan and UAE are joining the 10 Full Members in Australia and New Zealand, but for the next World Cup there is no guarantee of any Associate nations being present.
There is also a cut-off for qualification for the 2017 Champions Trophy - which will also be staged in England - after the tournament was revived following the decision not to progress with the Test Championship. The top eight nations on September 30, 2015 will qualify for the tournament.
West Indies are currently No. 8 in the ODI rankings although there is a considerable gap of 27 points to Bangladesh in ninth.

Villages along Indo-Bhutan border have no basic amenities: Bodo studentsPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:58 pm
The All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) which organised a 22-day march through Chirang district in western Assam, said that the villages along the Indo-Bhutan border have no basic amenities like healthcare, drinking water and electricity, and roads are all practically non-existent.
“While 85 per cent of the people live below poverty line, illiteracy and lack of safe drinking water has made life hell in dozens of villages that we toured in three weeks. Moreover, witchcraft, black magic and proliferation of small arms have further complicated lives of the poo tribals,” said Phanin Boro, president of the Chirang district unit of ABSU.
The ABSU, which flagged off its first phase of “long march” on October 2 in Chirang, groups of student volunteers would march through three other Bodoland districts – Baksa, Kokrajhar and Udalguri – in the next eight to ten weeks. “We often talk about backwardness, poverty, illiteracy and diseases in our villages based on newspaper reports and stray allegations. But this long march has not only opened our eyes through first-hand experience but also helped us understand how thousands of poor tribals are suffering due to ignorance and lack of a voice,” said ABSU central committee president Pramod Boro. The ABU will come out with a detailed report of their findings after covering all the four districts.
In Chirang, most villages along the Indo-Bhutan boundary do not have road access to the outside world, with Khanindra Basumatary, general secretary of the ABSU’s Chirang unit saying people have to wade across rivers and streams to travel to the nearest road. “The village in which Priya Basumatary, a Class X student was brutally killed in full view of her parents and fellow villagers in August, for instance can be reached only after crossing two rivers,” Basumatary said.
“Most people drink water from rivers, streams and nullahs. Only a handful of slightly better-off families have hand pumps. This water-borne diseases and deaths caused by these are rampant,” Basumatary added. The group of 148 student volunteers who touched 372 villages in their 443-km “long march” carried out cleaned 169 school campuses, 59 temples, 27 churches and 20 village market-places apart from helping villagers in harvesting paddy in six villages.
The volunteers held small meetings and interactions with the people in each village and staged street-plays focusing on ill-effects of liquor, early marriage, illiteracy, witch-craft and other issues affecting the people’s lives. “We also highlighted the importance of attending schools, immunization, cleanliness and sanitation, though these are primary responsibilities of the elected government,” said ABSU central committee president Pramod Boro.
“In many primary schools we did not find teachers. Either they were absent on the day we visited, or have been not appointed at all. Thus more than half the enrolled students do not attend school at all. In many primary schools we found bidi butts all over. Either the students have been smoking, or teachers smoke bidi in school,” Basumatary said.
In many villages people also make traditional rice beer and illicit liquour in order to earn a livelihood. “We continued…

Vodafone India April-September revenue up 12%Vodafone India April-September revenue up 12% at Rs 20,747 crore
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 07.16PM IST

(The company had reported…)
NEW DELHI: Country's second largest operator Vodafone India's revenue grew over 11 per cent to Rs 20,746.9 crore for the first six months of the current fiscal on higher data uptake, customer additions and stable pricing.
The company had reported total revenue of Rs 18,571.1 crore in the April-September period of last fiscal.
The data (Browsing) revenue was Rs 2,552.5 crore in the first half of 2014-15 and it now contributes 13.5 per cent to the company's service revenue.
"We have delivered a healthy double digit revenue growth driven by strong customer additions and robust growth in data," Vodafone India MD and CEO Marten Pieters said here.
It has 57.2 million total data users, of which 13.6 million are 3G users. Vodafone had 174 million subscribers at the end of September.
The company said data drivers include factors such as higher smartphone penetration and strategic partnerships with handset manufacturers and application providers to provide innovative value propositions and better customer experience.
Data average revenue per user (ARPU) grew to Rs 142, as compared to Rs 130 in the same period last year. The average revenue per minute stood at 49.9 paisa and ARPU at Rs 200.
Vodafone has a network of over 1,24,000 sites. On spectrum availability, Pieters said its inadequacy is one of the most serious challenges facing the mobile industry.
He reiterated his stand that auctions should be conducted when there is enough spectrum available.
"We agree and the regulator also agrees that doing an auction when there is no additional spectrum available is just not the right thing to do...it would be a disappointment for the industry," Pieters said.
He added that given the situation for Vodafone, it is very easy for competition to drive the prices up.
If operators have to pay such high price for spectrum alone, then investments in network suffer, he said, adding that the government should make more radiowaves available.
"...you milk the industry so far that there is kind of no money left to make investments in networks or you say enough is enough and you make sure that spectrum becomes cheaper... If you see enough supply of spectrum, prices go down, then there will be more money available for operators to invest in networks," Pieters said.
The telecom industry is already witnessing decreased investments in networks.
"...only the top three are investing and the new one (Reliance Jio) which is yet to start the services," he added.
The company made a capital expenditure of Rs 3,509.1 crore during H1 FY'15.

China hopes to gain admiration by showcasing...(It is unclear whether the…)
By Christina Larson
BEIJING: Amid the whine of high-performance jet engines at the start of an air show in Zhuhai, the Chinese government is hoping to generate a different sort of buzz: admiration, and perhaps purchases, of its shadowy J-31 stealth fighter, which is expected to make its first public appearance.
For almost 20 years, the event, Airshow China, has been a showcase for the country's homegrown hardware, and a marketplace for those interested in selling to the world's most populous country. As the country tries to climb into the high-end arms market, it has been eager to display fighters, missiles and drones that it hopes will demonstrate how China can compete on the global stage.
By exhibiting a stealth aircraft at the show, China wants to show just how far its arms industry has come, experts say. The US is the only country with operational stealth planes, and Lockheed Martin the only company to have successfully exported one, the F-35.
The air show, which starts Tuesday, is widely expected to be "a coming-out party for the J-31," said John Stillion, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent research institute in Washington.
"The more ambitious the display, probably the closer it is to being ready for prime time. If they fly it, that's a big deal," he said. "One of the ways countries try to increase demand for their combat aircraft is displaying them, doing cool stuff at air shows; it's an opportunity to show off."
After scrutinizing online videos and squinting at oblique references in Chinese state news media, foreign experts say there are many open questions regarding the J-31's development: how soon the plane will be in service, whether it will use engines that are domestically made or imported from Russia, whether its capabilities will be a match for Lockheed Martin's jets, and whether it will be substantially cheaper than the competition.

It is also unclear whether the introduction of the J-31 at the show will significantly bolster China's clout in the global arms trade. It is not even certain that the jet, developed by the state-owned Shenyang Aircraft Corp., is meant for export. Another stealth fighter, the J-20, is being developed by the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.
"People think the J-20 won the contest," said Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow and coordinator of the Military Transformations Program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
Some shortcomings may be evident in the plane's appearance, he said. Unlike the F-35, the J-31 has two engines.
"Traditionally the Chinese have to stick in extra engines because their engines aren't powerful enough - that's a warning signal right there," he said.
Lockheed Martin's F-22, the world's only operational stealth fighter, also has two engines, but they are powerful enough to propel the plane faster than the speed of sound without using the fuel-intensive afterburner.
Robert M. Farley, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce, said engine designs had hindered Chinese aerospace ambitions. The Xian Aircraft Industry Y-20, a domestically produced military transport that will also be shown at Zhuhai, has been developed with engines made by the Russian company Aviadvigatel that are far less efficient than their Western counterparts, typically made by General Electric, Pratt & Whitney or Rolls-Royce.
"The problem with Chinese engines is that they've been remarkably unreliable," Farley said. "Engines require extremely tight tolerances in construction; even small errors can lead to the engine burning out."
Quality control, in general, could undermine the J-31's biggest apparent selling point: its ability to evade radar.
  "The potential problem with Chinese- and Russian-construction stealth fighters is that if there's a bolt out of place, it shows up on a radar signature,'' Farley said. "Russian and Chinese construction is typically much looser."
"Will Chinese fighters be as 'stealthy' as Western fighters? We won't know that for another five or 10 years," he said.
If China's fighters perform as advertised, Farley said, the J-31 will attract buyers - but only if it is marketed well below the F-35's price tag, which ranges from about $150 million to more than $300 million depending on the model.
"My guess is that somewhere around $75 million, or at least less than $100 million, is the ballpark cost to make it attractive," Farley said. "Pakistan, of course, would be a huge buyer. Several Latin American countries are recapitalizing their air forces. In the Middle East, there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the U.S. and U.S. equipment. A cheaper Chinese stealth fighter could do well."

In order to support bigger panniers and aftermarket luggage boxes, the frame and rear profile of Versys 1000 have been slightly modified too. The bike now comes fitted with a 4-stroke 1,043cc engine, which produces 122PS of power and 102Nm of torque and is paired with a 6-speed gearbox. To ease off the rideability, Kawasaki has equipped the Versys 1000 with a three-mode KTRC traction control system and revised mapping for low and top-end performance. The Kawasaki Versys 1000 will be brought and sold in India as a Completely Built Unit (CBU), which implies in it’s expected ex-showroom price of Rs. 12 to 15 Lakh.

China wins support for Asia-Pacific trade proposal...Asia-Pacific Leaders Agree To Work Toward Possible Adoption Of Trade Deal

HUAIROU, China (AP) — Leaders of Asia-Pacific economies agreed Tuesday to begin work toward possible adoption of a Chinese-backed free-trade pact, giving Beijing a victory in its push for a bigger role in managing global commerce.
In a joint statement after a two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to take a first step by launching a two-year study of the initiative.
"This is a historic step in the direction of an Asia-Pacific free trade area," said Chinese President Xi Jinping at a news conference.
China is promoting the proposed Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific despite U.S. pressure to wrap up other trade negotiations. Analysts see it as a response to a U.S.-led initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes 12 countries but excludes China.
The APEC leaders also promised to work more closely to combat official corruption. That is a special concern for Beijing, which is stepping up efforts to pursue officials who flee abroad with stolen public money.
Beijing has launched a series of trade and finance initiatives in pursuit of a bigger role in U.S.-dominated economic and security organizations to reflect Beijing's status as the world's second-biggest economy.
APEC was the first major international gathering in China since Xi took power and gave Beijing a platform to lobby for a bigger leadership role.
On the eve of the summit, Beijing announced a free-trade agreement with South Korea. Also Monday, regulators approved a plan to open Chinese stock markets wider to foreign investors by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That followed the weekend announcement of a $40 billion Chinese-financed fund to improve trade links between Asian economies.
Earlier this year, Beijing launched a regional development bank with 20 other governments. In May, Xi called for a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a group that includes Russia and Iran but excludes the United States.
China says its motives are benign, but its growing economic weight as the top trading partner for most of its neighbors from South Korea to Australia could erode U.S. influence.
Tuesday's meeting took place under elaborate security at a government conference center in wooded hills north of the Chinese capital.
In an effort to appear more open, organizers took the unusual step of allowing access from the press center to websites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube that usually are blocked by China's extensive Internet filters.
The Asia-Pacific trade pact was first proposed by an APEC business panel but China took the lead in promoting it. It marks the first time Beijing has played a leading role in a multinational trade agreement.
"(The U.S.-led) TPP is being used to push aside China and to weaken China's economic core status," said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Promoting its own initiative "will give China a bigger right to speak in the Asia-Pacific — to have a new status."
Obama said Monday the United States "welcomes the rise" of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China. Still, American officials chafe at Beijing's insistence on promoting the Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.
U.S. trade officials say the two proposals are not competitors. But they want Beijing to wrap up a U.S.-Chinese investment treaty and a separate agreement to lower barriers to trade in information technology. Washington and some other governments argued the Chinese proposal would be a distraction at APEC but Beijing made it the centerpiece of the meeting.
Few details of the U.S.-led proposal have been released but promoters say it would reduce or eliminate tariffs on most goods among the member countries. That might hurt China by encouraging member countries to trade more with each other.
Leaders of the nations involved in TPP talks, including the United States, Mexico, Japan and Australia, met Monday and issued a statement saying they were making progress. The talks have been delayed repeatedly by disputes over the sweeping nature of its market-opening proposals.
"We have instructed our ministers and negotiators to make concluding this agreement a top priority," the statement said.
The initiative promoted by Beijing is less ambitious and is aimed at reducing conflict among overlapping trade agreements between pairs of Asia-Pacific economies.
It is a logical response to being excluded from the TPP, said Li Wei, an economist at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.
"If the U.S. doesn't want China to join the TPP, then China can form its own trade groups," said Li.
Li also pointed to limits on access to U.S. markets for some Chinese technology companies such as Huawei Technologies Ltd., a maker of network switching gear, on security grounds.
"The world, with the U.S. leading, is retreating from free trade. It is moving into protectionism," said Li. "If the U.S. is saying, I should be careful about who I have free trade with, then China should take a more liberalizing role."

Families furious over report MH370 will be declared lostFamilies furious over report MH370 will be declared ‘lost’
PTI
Tweet
Kuala Lumpur, Nov 11:  
Relatives of passengers of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, that vanished mysteriously eight-months ago with 239 people on board, have expressed shock after a senior airline official reportedly said that the plane would be declared “lost” by the year end.
The Airlines’ commercial Director Hugh Dunleavy reportedly said that the Malaysian and Australian governments were working together with the national carrier to determine compensation details, adding that the formal announcement of the loss would likely be made by the year end.
“We don’t have a final date but once we’ve had an official loss recorded we can work with the next—of—kin on the full compensation payments for those families,” Dunleavy was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald.
His comments created a furore and Voice370, an association of relatives of passengers of the missing flight, questioned the speculative statement and the official’s intention behind doing so.
“The official channels of information for the group are the MAS Family Support Centre (FSC) and the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC). Therefore, what is the agenda behind such an astounding statement?” Voice370, said in a statement.
Malaysia Airlines, however, has distanced itself from the controversial statement, saying it was Dunleavy’s personal opinion and “the ongoing search and recovery operations will remain and will not be discontinued“.
“Any information regarding MH370, the operations and any matters related to the missing aircraft will only be communicated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC),” the statement added.
Despite the biggest and costliest search and rescue operation mounted in the aviation history, authorities have not been able to trace the missing flight that went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board including 13 crew members.

Venkaiah s 10 points for governance | Says govt to go extra mile to accomodate oppnbabul Supriyo
(Naidu touched upon a range…)
NEW DELHI: Seeking innovative ideas and new initiatives from bureaucrats, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu today chalked out a ten-point charter for them for enabling effective governance.
Naidu urged the senior officials of Urban Development and Housing and the Urban Poverty Alleviation Ministry, to reorient their attitudes and approaches and enable the government to fulfill the mandate of rapid and inclusive economic growth given to them by people in the last general elections.
Naidu addressed over 130 Under Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Directors, Joint Secretaries and Secretaries, according to a senior Urban Development Ministry official.
During his 50-minute pep talk, Naidu also stressed upon need for speedy decision making and creating an enabling environment to facilitate the much desired flow of private investments into urban development and housing initiatives.
Naidu touched upon a range of issues including the mandate of the government, inhibitive nature of bureaucracy, discipline and punctuality among others during his address.
Minister of State for UD and HUPA Babul Supriyo Baral and secretaries of both the ministries also attended the meeting convened to motivate the senior officials to meet the challenges of growing urbanisation.
Naidu urged the officials to "move away from the attitude of playing safe and risk aversion resulting in delayed decision making to one of being pro-active and innovative with the objective of improving the ease of doing business".
He stressed that the perception of India being a "bureaucratic nightmare" needs to be changed at the earliest and a beginning in this direction has already been made with Narendra Modi becoming the Prime Minister .
While suggesting the 10-point charter to the senior officials to enable effective governance, he asked them to elevate individual conscience to a higher level in the cause of nation building and to internalise the attitudes of punctuality, discipline, dedication and righteousness.
He advocated for unleashing of the force of initiative and innovation and to foster team spirit instead of working in silos and also to enhance domain knowledge to facilitate quick and informed decision making among others.
Naidu asked officials to acquire required skills necessary for speedy decision making and increased output.
He also suggested for delegation of responsibilities and transparency and accountability not under duress but as a virtue.
Naidu told officers to ask themselves at the end of the day if they have done justice to the responsibilities given during the day.
He concluded by saying "One has to keep work environment clean and motivating."
Naidu assured the officials that all well meaning initiatives and innovations by the 'selected executive' will be fully backed by the 'elected executive'. He further noted that there will be no compromise in respect of punctuality and integrity.
Babul Supriyo said that he was delighted to hear the 'elderly advice' of the senior minister.
He urged the officials to rise to the occasion and enable the country realise its true potential under the leadership of Narendra Modi.

CM suspends four health officials
Eleven women died and 34 were reported critical on Tuesday after undergoing “faulty” sterilisation surgeries at a government-organised family planning camp in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh.
Eighty three women underwent the procedure in five hours at the free sterilisation camp, organised by the Bilaspur district health department on November 8, at the Nemichand Jain hospital.
“Around 60 women fell sick after the surgery and were admitted to different hospitals in Bilaspur,”said District Collector S.K. Pardeshi.
“I had two babies in the last three years and wanted to go in for family planning. I got to know the district administration had organised a free camp and I underwent the sterilisation surgery on Saturday. Twelve hours after the operation, I started vomiting,” Deepa Yadav, 22, said.
Sarojini Kewat (26), a mother of four, said she started vomiting a few hours after the surgery while Hemlata Suryavanshi (25), a mother of three, said she developed breathing problems.
Chief Minister Raman Singh visited the victims at Bilaspur hospitals and suspended four health officials, including Health Director Kamalpreet Singh and Bilaspur Chief Medical Officer Dr. S.C. Bhange.
Mr. Singh has ordered an inquiry, besides announcing a compensation of Rs. 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 each for those who fell ill after the surgery. Health and Family Welfare Minster Amar Agrawal, who represents Bilaspur in the Assembly, took “complete moral responsibility” but said that there was no question of resigning.

Unhygienic conditions led to deaths: Congress
The Congress lashed out at the Chhattisgarh government on Tuesday over the death of 11 women due to “faulty sterilisation” in Bilaspur district on November 8.
“Medicines past their expiry date were given to the patients and the surgeries were conducted in an extremely unhygienic place which led to the deaths. This is criminal negligence on the part of the government,” State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel told reporters in Bilaspur after visiting the victims at a hospital here.
Congress leader and Bilaspur Mayor Vani Rao alleged that more than 18 women have died but “the government is deliberately hiding the facts. They admitted patients to different hospitals to conceal the facts.”
Congress workers protested against the State government and demanded resignation of Chief Minister Raman Singh and Health Minister Amar Agrawal and lodged an FIR against the duo at a police station in Bilaspur. “How can they conduct 83 surgeries in five hours when each surgery takes at least 20 minutes?,” asked Mr. Baghel. District Collector S.K. Pardeshi denied the allegations and said the cause of death would be known only after post-mortem.

NBC airs three-drama crossover story line...versions
LOS ANGELES (AP) — NBC is airing an unusual hat-trick series crossover.
Episodes of three of the network's dramas, "Chicago Fire," ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Chicago P.D.," will share a story line about an effort to crack a child pornography ring.
The three-parter begins at 10 p.m. EST Tuesday on "Chicago Fire" and wraps up Wednesday on the two other NBC dramas airing back to back from 9-11 p.m. EST.
Making the ambitious crossover feasible: All the shows are produced by Wolf Films in association with Universal Television.
Producer Dick Wolf said linking the two Chicago-based shows made sense, while drawing in New York-based "Law & Order: SVU" was a "little tricky."
"But it wasn't too far-fetched to develop a story about child pornography that crosses state lines," Wolf said, which he called a sad reflection of reality.

Mondelez buying stake in Vietnam snacks business... 
November 11, 2014 06:56 AM EST | Associated Press
DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Mondelez is buying an 80 percent stake in a Vietnamese snacks business for $370 million as it seeks to offset flagging U.S. sales in Asia.
Acquiring a majority stake in Kinh Do Corp's snacks business will give Mondelez access to Kinh Do mooncakes and biscuits, Cosy biscuits, Solite soft cakes and AFC crackers. Mondelez's brands in the region include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolates.
Mondelez has an option to buy the remaining stake in Kinh Do's snacks business once the completion of its 80 percent investment passes the one-year mark.
The deal is targeted to close in 2015's second quarter. It still needs approval from Kinh Do shareholders at a meeting that is expected to be held in December.
Shares of Mondelez International Inc., based in Deerfield, are up 17 percent over the past year.

JACKSON, N.J. (AP) — Authorities are investigating what caused a fire that destroyed an animal enclosure in the safari park at New Jersey's Six Flags Great Adventure.
The fire broke out just after 10 p.m. Monday in the enclosure and there were at least seven brush fires outside the safari park area in Jackson, New Jersey.
The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office says two animals described as a type of antelope were in the enclosure, but escaped unharmed.
No animals or people were injured.
The fires were extinguished within 20 minutes.
The park is located between New York City and Philadelphia. It offers rides, shows and other amusements.

US pollution data on Beijing blocked on mobile app... 
LOUISE WATT | November 11, 2014 06:54 AM EST | Associated Press
BEIJING (AP) — All the sky-clearing measures plus cooperation from the weather kept Beijing relatively free of air pollution for most of a seven-day Asia-Pacific conference. Then, toward the end as top leaders met, the smog crept back.
So, China went to Plan B: Censor the pollution monitors.
Many Beijingers get up-to-the moment updates on pollution — including levels of the dangerous PM2.5 particles — by monitoring websites and mobile phone apps. Usually these provide two sets of readings, one from Beijing city authorities and one from the U.S. Embassy, with the latter considered by many to be the more trustworthy.
But the Embassy readings were absent from some of the pollution monitoring sites during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference that opened Nov. 5 and culminated in a summit Tuesday of leaders including Presidents Barack Obama, Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.
One of the websites, Beijing-air.com, posted a noticing saying it had "received instructions from authorities saying that this month's air quality readings will be based only on what is released by the Beijing environmental protection bureau."
"Wishing the APEC meeting every success," the website added.
Chinese authorities went to great lengths to turn the skies blue for APEC by closing factories and construction sites, banning cars on certain days and postponing the seasonal start of a coal-powered heating system.
For most of the conference the skies were so stunningly clear that "APEC blue" was coined by Chinese as a new phrase meaning "ephemeral" — "He's not that into you; it's an APEC blue."
By Monday evening, Beijing's levels of PM2.5 had reached nearly 200 — or about eight times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization — according to the U.S. Embassy figures, which were still available on Twitter for people who can log onto the Internet outside of China's Great Fire Wall.
One of the mobile apps that Beijingers use, the CN Air Quality app, had no pollutants data for the U.S. Embassy and an index reading of "-1" on Tuesday morning. The official index was "50" or "Good." On Monday, the app had mysteriously failed to load.
Many Beijing residents check these apps several times per day to decide, for example, whether to go jogging.
Chinese officials say the U.S. Embassy's reading is unreliable because it only measures the air in one spot, from its rooftop, whereas Beijing municipal's environmental monitoring center reports hourly data from 35 stations around the city.
The U.S. Embassy also rates pollution levels according to more stringent standards, which has in the past frustrated the Chinese government, which unsuccessfully asked the embassy in 2012 to stop publishing the data. The government said it wasn't fair to judge Chinese air by American standards because China is a developing country.

Former Mamtek CEO gets 7 years for theft  fraud... 
November 11, 2014 06:53 AM EST | Associated Press
ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) — A California man who talked a small Missouri community into issuing $39 million in bonds for an artificial sweetener plant was sentenced Monday to seven years in prison for stealing more than $700,000 from the project, which never got off the ground.
Bruce Cole, 67, of Beverly Hills, California, pleaded guilty in September to one count of felony stealing and two counts of securities fraud.
Cole was CEO of Mamtek U.S. Inc., a company he formed to produce artificial sweetener. In 2010 he persuaded Moberly, a northeast Missouri town of about 14,000, to issue bonds for a plant he promised would employ 600. He also got the state to authorize up to $17 million in incentives.
The plant never materialized because the plan collapsed financially before construction was finished. Mamtek defaulted on the debt in August 2011 and Moberly defaulted on its bonds. The state never paid any of the incentives because the project failed before meeting aid criteria.
St. Charles County Circuit Judge Daniel Pelikan sentenced Cole to seven years on each count, to run concurrently.
Gov. Jay Nixon announced in July 2010 that Mamtek had chosen the Missouri site for the plant after competition from 12 states. The company said it had developed proprietary technology and began manufacturing sucralose, an artificial sweetener, in China, but an investigation later revealed that plant had been shut down by the Chinese government.
The state filed charges in 2012 accusing Cole of directing a consultant to submit an invoice for more than $4 million to Mamtek for purported engineering-related services by a sham company called Ramwell Industrial Inc.
Immediately after Mamtek received the bond revenues in July 2010, the state said Cole instructed the company's bookkeeper to wire $700,000 to his wife's personal bank account. Nanette Cole then allegedly used part of the money to make a mortgage payment on their Beverly Hills home. She was not charged.
"Cole lied to the people of Moberly and conned investors in his project in order to steal hundreds of thousands in bond money for himself," Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement. "Today's prison sentence brings a measure of closure to the pursuit of justice for Moberly."

Feds add fishing restrictions for Atlantic cod... 
ALANNA DURKIN | November 11, 2014 06:53 AM EST | Associated Press
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — With the Atlantic cod population at an all-time low, federal regulators Monday announced the closure of commercial and recreational cod fishing in parts of the Gulf of Maine.
The temporary restrictions also include a 200-pound limit on how much a fishing vessel can catch during a single trip, following several years of no trip limits for most active fishermen, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.
The emergency measures are necessary to prevent "a cod stock collapse" and complete closure of the fishery, which is in the worst shape regulators have seen since they began monitoring the stock 40 years ago, said John Bullard, a regional administrator for NOAA Fisheries.
Bullard acknowledged the restrictions will have a significant economic impact on some fishermen this year.
"They're going to pay an economic price," he told news reporters. "We're going to have to hope somehow that ... we're going to get a break from Mother Nature and there's going to be good recruitment class (of young cod)... and we're going to see a rebuilding."
NOAA estimates the restrictions will reduce revenues from groundfish, which includes cod, by $1.6 million in 2014.
The Gulf of Maine, along with Georges Bank off the coast of Massachusetts, is one of two key areas where East Coast fishermen capture cod, a vital commercial fish in New England that appears in supermarkets and roadside fish-and-chip shops.
The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service estimates cod spawning in the Gulf at only 3 percent to 4 percent of its target level, or a 13 percent to 18 percent decline from three years ago.
Regulators are closing areas where most of the cod catches have occurred over the last couple of years to protect the remaining stock. Most of those areas will be off the coast of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, impacting those who fish the inshore waters there.
The emergency plan goes into effect Thursday, and will remain in place until May.
Proctor Wells, who sold his groundfishing permits three years ago when federal regulations made it too difficult to survive, said he understands why regulators need to act. Whether it's environmental factors, overfishing, or both, cod stocks have not rebounded despite two decades of warnings about the fishery's collapse.
"I understand 'em. It's tough medicine but if there's going to be any fish in the future, then you've got to do something," said Wells, who's now a lobster fisherman who fishes from Sebasco, Maine.
While the cod population is diminishing, the Gulf of Maine's haddock stock has rebounded, allowing NOAA to double its quota from more than 600,000 pounds to about 1.3 million pounds. NOAA officials say they hope the increase in the haddock catch will blunt the financial impact of the cod restrictions, although they acknowledge the economic benefits will be modest.
Peter Baker, director of Northeast U.S. oceans for the Pew Charitable Trusts, said in a statement that while the rules are "helpful and necessary," a long-term strategy needs to be developed "to protect the habitat they need to recover."
Bullard said a New England Fishery Management Council committee will meet this week to begin crafting long-term measures.

Shiv Sena steps up confrontation  BJP hints at NCP supportWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

Putin  Obama meet at APECputin  obama meet at apec
Obama  China s President Xi hold talks in Beijing...and
versions
BEIJING (AP) — When Xi Jinping took the reins of a booming China two years ago, President Barack Obama saw an opportunity to remake America's relationship with the Asian power. But even after Obama's unusually robust efforts to forge personal ties with Xi, the two leaders are meeting in Beijing amid significant tensions, both old and new.
While Obama and Xi tackled sensitive matters like cybersecurity and human rights privately, they sought to accentuate areas of agreement in their public remarks. The countries jointly announced new goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, signaling that the world's largest economies were united in the need to tackle climate change. U.S. officials said the two leaders were also likely to announce progress on deals to avert military confrontations in Pacific, where their aircraft have come into close contact.
As Obama and Xi opened talks Wednesday, the U.S. president said cooperation between their nations "can make important contributions to security and progress in the region and around the world."
Since assuming the presidency in 2012, Xi has consolidated power, deepened China's provocative maritime disputes with its neighbors and stands accused of continuing cyberattacks against the United States. U.S. officials have new concerns over the potential for a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and are warily watching Beijing strengthen ties with Moscow as the West distances itself from Russia.
For its part, Beijing remains skeptical of Obama's intentions in Asia, seeing his efforts to bolster U.S. economic ties in the region as a way of countering China's rise. Obama's domestic political weakness, particularly following the Democrats' defeats in last week's midterm elections, has also sparked questions in China about whether the U.S. president can deliver on potential international agreements.
Arriving on Wednesday at the Great Hall of the People, Obama walked with Xi to a platform in the center of the room, where a military band played the U.S. and Chinese national anthems and the two leaders inspected an honor guard lined up against a massive mural of the Great Wall. A group of waiting schoolchildren bearing flags from both countries and flowers cheered for the leaders when given their cue.
After their morning meetings, the leaders were to take questions from reporters, a surprising last-minute addition to the schedule given China's tight media controls.
In the lead-up to the Obama-Xi meetings, U.S. officials sought to refocus attention on areas of U.S. agreement with the Chinese, including a climate pact that was the result of months of secret discussions between the two countries.
As part of the new agreement, Obama announced that the U.S. would move much faster in cutting pollution, with a goal to reduce emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. Xi, whose country's emissions are still growing as it builds new coal plants, didn't commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. Rather, he set a target for China's emissions to peak by 2030, or earlier if possible.
The U.S. and China also announced a reciprocal accord to extend visa lengths for their citizens. And Obama announced that the U.S. and China had reached an understanding that would allow negotiations to move forward on a deal with the World Trade Organization to reduce tariffs on high-tech goods.
But despite the White House's public focus on cooperation, analysts say Xi's approach to running China is likely to lead to more tensions ahead.
"I think that consensus is growing that there's going to be more viscosity, more tension with China over the next few years," said Michael Green, an Asia analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. He added that Xi has proved to be "less accommodating" and "tougher than expected" in his dealings with the U.S.
That's hardly the landscape Obama envisioned when he began trying to cultivate Xi as partner. Obama had developed little personal rapport with Xi's predecessor, the older and more formal Hu Jintao. But in Xi, U.S. officials saw a potentially new kind of leader, with closer ties to the U.S. than other Chinese officials — he spent time in Iowa as an exchange student — and an ease with public appearances that eluded Hu.
In an unusual move, Obama last summer invited Xi to a two-day retreat at Sunnylands, a sweeping estate in the southern California desert. Away from the glare of their capitals, the leaders held eight hours of wide-ranging talks, toasted each other with Chinese liquor and sealed their new relationship with a 50-minute stroll through the manicured grounds.
Both sides considered the summit a success. Yet the months that followed have seen increased tensions, from the U.S. levying cyberspying charges against five Chinese officials to a recent series of close calls between U.S. and Chinese aircraft in the Pacific.
Xi is still reciprocating Obama's California hospitality with a state visit in the Chinese capital. Following meetings Tuesday with regional leaders at an Asia-Pacific economic summit, Obama and Xi met for a private dinner at Zhong Nan Hai, the imperial gardens near Tiananmen Square that serve as the center of power for China's government and the Communist Party of China. In the spirit of the Sunnylands summit, the two men ditched their ties for dinner as they sought to project a more casual and comfortable atmosphere.

Captaincy will do Kohli a  world of good  - DravidTweet
0
Opportunity for Virat.Former India captain Rahul Dravid has said that it will be "unfair" to judge Virat Kohli 's captaincy credentials on the basis of one Test. In the absence of the injured MS Dhoni, Kohli will be leading India in the first Test of the four-match series against Australia at Brisbane from December 4. Dhoni is expected to be fit in time for the second Test in Adelaide from December 12.
"Dhoni's absence gives Virat the opportunity to show that he leads maybe differently," Dravid told ESPNcricinfo. "I still think it's going to be Dhoni's side, he has been announced captain. It's just a nice opportunity for Virat and a great feeling, every time you get the opportunity to lead your country in a Test match, it's a great thrill and Virat will really enjoy that."
Having observed Kohli closely over his career Dravid believes he is the "obvious candidate" to take over the job from Dhoni in the long run but it will "depend on his batting." According to Dravid, "I think he's (Kohli) got a good cricket brain. From what we've seen a little bit in the IPL and one-day cricket, he's willing to make things happen. He's spent quite a bit of time learning from Dhoni. He's been in the side for a while now. If he can bat well in Test matches and have that certainty about himself as a player, then I have no doubt that he's the obvious candidate to take over from Dhoni once he's finished."
While Kohli has bounced back in recent weeks with some impressive knocks in ODIs against West Indies and Sri Lanka, he had a wretched run on the tour of England. In 10 innings over five Test matches, Kohli made just 134 runs. Dravid believes the challenge of having to lead the team will do Kohli "a world of good."
"Maybe it will take his mind away from thinking about his own batting, he will have other stuff to think about and it's only for one match," he said. "Rather than be consumed by his own thoughts and scoring runs he will have to think about other things which sometimes can be a pretty good thing. Hopefully, he's learnt his lessons. Having said that Virat has scored a hundred in Australia as well so he's the most experienced of that young middle order."
Among the 18-man squad named for the series are two new faces in opening batsman KL Rahul and legspinner Karn Sharma. Dravid had in fact selected both while naming his preferred squad for the series on ESPNcricinfo on November 3. While he concedes that both are unlikely to make the cut for the playing XI immediately, Dravid doesn't expect them to merely make up the numbers.
"If you pick people to go on tour, you have to have the belief that they are good enough to replace people in the side," he said. "On my first tour, I didn't play the first Test match through injuries and lack of form of other people, Sourav and myself got an opportunity in the second Test and were able to cash in. Anyone picked on tour, you should believe are good enough not only to play but also have an impact."
While Dravid had left Suresh Raina out of his 16-man squad, the selectors have included him in the 18-member unit they have named for the tour. Although one school of thought suggests Raina has been included to give him an early feel of the conditions in Australia ahead of the World Cup, Dravid disagrees.
"Suresh has been to Australia many times before with the one-day team. I don't think there was a need to get him used to the conditions thinking ahead to a World Cup," he said. "I believe he has been picked to replace someone in the middle order if they go out of form or gets injured. The team likes Raina, he gives so much on the field, he's a brilliant slip fielder, it's an area India struggled in England, he can give you a few overs of off-spin. It's a chance for him to resurrect his career, I am sure that he can play well in Test cricket where his record isn't as good."
In fact the size of the touring party doesn't sit too well with Dravid as well who is of the view that "16 players would have sufficed" for the series. "With the domestic season on in India, some of the players picked would be better off having played four-day cricket," he said. "If there were injuries you almost want people coming in having played cricket rather than cold, not having played matches for whatever length it might be. You might find cases that some of the guys have been on tour for a month and half and not having played a single game. Maybe the selectors felt they needed that back up, they were covering for a few injuries."

The Council of Mortgage LendersHouse purchase lending in August down 3% on July
09 Oct 14
New CML data on the characteristics of lending in August show that lending declined slightly compared to July, the first month-on-month drop in house purchase lending volume since February this year. 
Monthly highlights:
First-time buyer lending declined in August compared to July, with 28,900 first-time buyer loans - 4% fewer than in July but 9% up on August 2013. By value, there was £4.4 billion of lending to first-time buyers - 4% down on July but 22% higher than August last year.
Lending to home movers also declined, with the number of loans advanced to movers totalling 36,500, a 3% fall on the previous month but up 7% on August last year. By value, lending to movers totalled £7 billion, 3% down on July but up 17% on August last year.
Remortgage lending activity saw a decrease month-on-month and also year-on-year in August. The number of remortgages in August was 4% down on July and 11% down on the same month last year. The value of these loans (£3.7 billion) was down 5% on the previous month and down 3% year-on-year.

Lending to first-time buyers
First-time buyers saw the first month-on-month lending decline since January this year, with 28,900 first-time buyer loans in August - 4% fewer than in July, but still 9% up on August 2013.

First-time buyers in August paid 19.7% of gross income towards covering capital and interest payments, little changed from 19.6% in July and still significantly less than the recent peak of 24.8% in December 2007.

Lending to home movers 
Lending to home movers also weakened, for the first time in five months. In August, the number of loans advanced to movers was 36,500, a 3% fall on the previous month but up 7% on August last year. By value, lending to movers totalled £7 billion, 3% down on July but up 17% on August last year.
Home movers typically borrowed 3.04 times their gross income in August, compared to 3.03 in July. The typical loan size for home movers was £156,750 in August, up from £155,999 in July. The typical gross household income of a home mover was £54,651 in August compared to £54,434 in July.
Home movers' payment burden remained relatively low in August at 18.8% of gross income being spent to cover monthly capital and interest payments, up slightly from 18.7% in July, but well below the recent peak of 23.8% in December 2007.

Buy-to-let lending
There were 15,300 buy-to-let loans in August, representing lending of £2.1bn. The number of loans and the value of these loans was down 13% compared to July. Compared to August 2013, this was a 6% increase by volume and 11% by value. 
Within the overall total of buy-to-let loans, 8,400 were advanced in August for house purchase and 6,700 for remortgage. The number of buy-to-let house purchase loans was down by 13% compared to July but up 9% compared to August last year. This totalled £1bn in value, down 17% on July but up 16% on August last year. 
The number of remortgage loans decreased compared to July, down 14% and down slightly by 1% compared to August last year. These loans had a total value of £1bn, down 17% on July but up 4% on August last year.

Paul Smee, director general of the CML, commented: 
“The lending climate had a glass half full, glass half empty feel about it in August. On the one hand it saw a decline in all lending types month-on-month, which would suggest a levelling off of the market, with remortgaging remaining flat. Yet, on the other hand, we saw the highest August house purchase lending levels since 2007, and the recent Bank of England Credit Conditions Survey expects an upward trend in remortgaging in the final months of the year. Overall, these figures give no support to any fears of a developing bubble in housing.
"This has been a year of major change, and the market has shown significant resilience and responsiveness to the changing environment, improving the availability of lending without compromising financial stability, as the Bank of England's assessment last week highlighted."

Weed Entrepreneurs In Oregon And Alaska Celebrate LegalizationWeed Entrepreneurs In Oregon And Alaska Celebrate Legalization
Posted:

On Tuesday, marijuana prohibition suffered another defeat.
Voters in Washington, D.C. , Oregon and Alaska followed Colorado and Washington in voting to legalize cannabis for recreational use. The historic votes signal victories for pro-legalization advocates hoping to bring legal cannabis to even more states in 2016.
Cannabis entrepreneurs in Oregon and Alaska, which are slated to open retail pot shops in coming years, say they are thrilled. (D.C.'s measure did not legalize the sale of marijuana.)
"I'm very excited. I've been medicating with marijuana since I was 21 years old," said Mario Mamone, who owns the medical marijuana dispensary Maritime Cafe in Clackamas County, Oregon, and who suffers from back spasms dating to the late 1960s when he was a soldier in Vietnam.
"I've always been afraid I'd be arrested and thrown in jail. But this lifts the stigma," he said.
But it's not all sunshine and roses for the marijuana industry that's developing in the Pacific Northwest. Cannabis entrepreneurs say the way legal weed is being rolled out by state governments can be problematic. Their concerns add to the growing pains experienced by advocates and regulators in trying to figure out the best way to safely regulate the fledgling industry.
For example, Oregon's historic vote on Tuesday won't do much to get Mamone's dispensary back in business. Maritime Cafe, which is located a few miles from downtown Portland and began providing Oregon residents with medical weed in 2011, was forced to close earlier this year when Clackamas County enacted a moratorium on cannabis sales .
"It's put us through some hardship," said Mamone. "We signed a lease on a new, bigger space next door [to our current location] before the moratorium, because we had no idea it was coming."
Mamone said he's been paying his $3,100-a-month rent plus all his bills every month, but the business "hasn't had any revenue since May."
He's been talking to county officials to try to lift the moratorium as soon as possible -- before the scheduled April 2015 end date -- but his business may have to remain shuttered until then.
Meanwhile in Portland, just a few miles away, medical weed is already being sold freely by dozens of medical dispensaries. Under the new law , those dispensaries will be eligible for a license to sell retail pot.
But not all of them are interested in doing that. Sally Bishop, the owner of Green Goddess Remedies , a shop that sells marijuana buds, edibles and THC concentrates, isn't sure she wants to branch out into the retail market, even though it could be lucrative for her and her family.
That's because she fears the retail weed industry will lead to lower-quality pot.

"Retail changes the vibe. It becomes mass consumption. It turns into, like, Budweiser beer," said Bishop, a 49-year-old mother of two. "Whereas, here on the medical marijuana side of things, we have more of a microbrew mentality. Our growers take a lot of pride in what they do."
Oregon's new law will allow anyone 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce of weed in a public place or 8 ounces at home. But there won't be recreational pot shops in Oregon for another couple of years. The state first must figure out how the system will be regulated and begin the process of issuing licenses to eligible entrepreneurs.
Unlike Washington, Oregon already had a fairly robust medical marijuana system in place when it legalized recreational weed. The state decriminalized pot back in the '70s and legalized it for medical use in 1998. Still, for years, medical patients had to grow their own weed (or have a caregiver grow it for them). Actual medical dispensaries weren't fully authorized to do business until this year.
Since Oregon already has a medical pot system in place -- and because taxes in Oregon will be lower than they currently are in Washington -- retail pot in Oregon is projected to be substantially cheaper than in neighboring Washington. In Oregon, it's predicted to be about $145 per ounce , while in Washington it gets sold for about $20 a gram, which works out to be over $500 per ounce.
In Alaska, things are different. Although the state legalized medical marijuana the same year Oregon did -- 1998 -- it never set up a dispensary system, forcing people to make arrangements to grow their own weed or obtain it on the black market.
As a result, Alaska may face some of the same difficulties that Washington has had in trying to create a dispensary system from scratch.
But pot entrepreneurs in the Last Frontier are still excited. "This is great for Alaska and great for America," said Michael Smith, who owns The Healing Center Medical Clinic in Anchorage, which doesn't sell medical marijuana but instead helps people obtain state-issued cards that let them grow their own.
Smith, 49, says he will definitely be applying for a state license to sell retail weed, but he won't be doing it in Anchorage, where he said he's heard talk of a possible moratorium on pot sales.
"You never know what politicians might do, what kind of pressure they could get from their constituencies," he said. "I mean, the vote here in Alaska was only 52 to 48 [percent] , so it was a very close call. There's still a large demographic that could push against this."
Alaska's initiative doesn't allow local governments to criminalize marijuana, but it does allow them to ban the commercial industry.
So Smith bought a space in rural Alaska -- in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, to be precise -- where he plans to grow and sell recreational weed if he wins a license from the state. He said he's less afraid of a moratorium happening there.
"It's a little more liberal there than in Anchorage," he said. "They have a history up there of growing some well-known strains [of cannabis]. I mean, they've been growing Matanuska Thunderfuck since the '70s. So I think people up there are really going to come out to take advantage of the end of prohibition. And I wish everyone well, I really do."

Meet JPMorgan s Worst NightmareAndrew Querner
Chase whistle-blower Alayne Fleischmann risked it all.
Meet the woman JPMorgan Chase paid one of the largest fines in American history to keep from talking
By Matt Taibbi
| November 6, 2014
She tried to stay quiet, she really did. But after eight years of keeping a heavy secret, the day came when Alayne Fleischmann couldn't take it anymore. 
"It was like watching an old lady get mugged on the street," she says. "I thought, 'I can't sit by any longer.'" 
Fleischmann is a tall, thin, quick-witted securities lawyer in her late thirties, with long blond hair, pale-blue eyes and an infectious sense of humor that has survived some very tough times. She's had to struggle to find work despite some striking skills and qualifications, a common symptom of a not-so-common condition called being a whistle-blower.

The Vampire Squid Strikes Again
Fleischmann is the central witness in one of the biggest cases of white-collar crime in American history, possessing secrets that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon late last year paid $9 billion (not $13 billion as regularly reported – more on that later) to keep the public from hearing.
Back in 2006, as a deal manager at the gigantic bank, Fleischmann first witnessed, then tried to stop, what she describes as "massive criminal securities fraud" in the bank's mortgage operations.
Thanks to a confidentiality agreement, she's kept her mouth shut since then. "My closest family and friends don't know what I've been living with," she says. "Even my brother will only find out for the first time when he sees this interview." 
Six years after the crisis that cratered the global economy, it's not exactly news that the country's biggest banks stole on a grand scale. That's why the more important part of Fleischmann's story is in the pains Chase and the Justice Department took to silence her.
She was blocked at every turn: by asleep-on-the-job regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, by a court system that allowed Chase to use its billions to bury her evidence, and, finally, by officials like outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, the chief architect of the crazily elaborate government policy of surrender, secrecy and cover-up. "Every time I had a chance to talk, something always got in the way," Fleischmann says.
This past year she watched as Holder's Justice Department struck a series of historic settlement deals with Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. The root bargain in these deals was cash for secrecy. The banks paid big fines, without trials or even judges – only secret negotiations that typically ended with the public shown nothing but vague, quasi-official papers called "statements of facts," which were conveniently devoid of anything like actual facts.

And now, with Holder about to leave office and his Justice Department reportedly wrapping up its final settlements, the state is effectively putting the finishing touches on what will amount to a sweeping, industrywide effort to bury the facts of a whole generation of Wall Street corruption. "I could be sued into bankruptcy," she says. "I could lose my license to practice law. I could lose everything. But if we don't start speaking up, then this really is all we're going to get: the biggest financial cover-up in history." 
Alayne Fleischmann grew up in Terrace, British Columbia, a snowbound valley town just a brisk 18-hour drive north of Vancouver. She excelled at school from a young age, making her way to Cornell Law School and then to Wall Street. Her decision to go into finance surprised those closest to her, as she had always had more idealistic ambitions. "I helped lead a group that wrote briefs to the Human Rights Chamber for those affected by ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina," she says. "My whole life prior to moving into securities law was human rights work."
But she had student loans to pay off, and so when Wall Street came knocking, that was that. But it wasn't like she was dragged into high finance kicking and screaming. She found she had a genuine passion for securities law and felt strongly she was doing a good thing. "There was nothing shady about the field back then," she says. "It was very respectable."
In 2006, after a few years at a white-shoe law firm, Fleischmann ended up at Chase. The mortgage market was white-hot. Banks like Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup were furiously buying up huge pools of home loans and repackaging them as mortgage securities. Like soybeans in processed food, these synthesized financial products wound up in everything, whether you knew it or not: your state's pension fund, another state's workers' compensation fund, maybe even the portfolio of the insurance company you were counting on to support your family if you got hit by a bus.
As a transaction manager, Fleischmann functioned as a kind of quality-control officer. Her main job was to help make sure the bank didn't buy spoiled merchandise before it got tossed into the meat grinder and sold out the other end.
A few months into her tenure, Fleischmann would later testify in a DOJ deposition, the bank hired a new manager for diligence, the group in charge of reviewing and clearing loans. Fleischmann quickly ran into a problem with this manager, technically one of her superiors. She says he told her and other employees to stop sending him e-mails. The department, it seemed, was wary of putting anything in writing when it came to its mortgage deals.
"I could lose everything. But if we don't start speaking up, we're going to get the biggest financial cover-up in history." 
"If you sent him an e-mail, he would actually come out and yell at you," she recalls. "The whole point of having a compliance and diligence group is to have policies that are set out clearly in writing. So to have exactly the opposite of that – that was very worrisome." One former high-ranking federal prosecutor said that if he were taking a criminal case to trial, the information about this e-mail policy would be crucial. "I would begin and end my opening statement with that," he says. "It shows these people knew what they were doing and were trying not to get caught."
In late 2006, not long after the "no e-mail" policy was implemented, Fleischmann and her group were asked to evaluate a packet of home loans from a mortgage originator called GreenPoint that was collectively worth about $900 million. Almost immediately, Fleischmann and some of the diligence managers who worked alongside her began to notice serious problems with this particular package of loans.
For one thing, the dates on many of them were suspiciously old. Normally, banks tried to turn loans into securities at warp speed. The idea was to go from a homeowner signing on the dotted line to an investor buying that loan in a pool of securities within two to three months. Thus it was a huge red flag to see Chase buying loans that were already seven or eight months old.
What this meant was that many of the loans in the GreenPoint deal had either been previously rejected by Chase or another bank, or were what are known as "early payment defaults." EPDs are loans that have already been sold to another bank and have been returned after the borrowers missed multiple payments. That's why the dates on them were so old.
In other words, this was the very bottom of the mortgage barrel. They were like used cars that had been towed back to the lot after throwing a rod. The industry had its own term for this sort of loan product: scratch and dent. As Chase later admitted, it not only ended up reselling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of those crappy loans to investors, it also sold them in a mortgage pool marketed as being above subprime, a type of loan called "Alt-A." Putting scratch-and-dent loans in an Alt-A security is a little like putting a fresh coat of paint on a bunch of junkyard wrecks and selling them as new cars. "Everything that I thought was bad at the time," Fleischmann says, "turned out to be a million times worse." (Chase declined to comment for this article.)
When Fleischmann and her team reviewed random samples of the loans, they found that around 40 percent of them were based on overstated incomes – an astronomically high defect rate for any pool of mortgages; Chase's normal tolerance for error was five percent. One mortgage in particular that sticks out in Fleischmann's mind involved a manicurist who claimed to have an annual income of $117,000. Fleischmann figured that even working seven days a week, this woman would have needed to work 488 days a year to make that much. "And that's with no overhead," Fleischmann says. "It wasn't possible."
But when she and others raised objections to the toxic loans, something odd started happening. The number-crunchers who had been complaining about the loans suddenly began changing their reports. The process she describes is strikingly similar to the way police obtain false confessions: The interrogator verbally abuses the target until he starts producing the desired answers. "What happened," Fleischmann says, "is the head diligence manager started yelling at his team, berating them, making them do reports over and over, keeping them late at night." Then the loans started clearing.

Chase's Twitter Gambit Devolves into All-Time PR Fiasco
As late as December 11th, 2006, diligence managers had marked a full 33 percent of one loan sample as "stated income unreasonable for profession," meaning that it was nearly inevitable that there would be a high number of defaults. Several high-ranking executives were copied on this report.
Then, on December 15th, a Chase sales executive held a lengthy meeting with reps from GreenPoint and the diligence team to examine the remaining loans in the pool. When they got to the manicurist, Fleischmann remembers, one of the diligence guys finally caved under the pressure from the sales executive. "He had his hands up and just said, 'OK,' and he cleared it," says Fleischmann, adding that he was shaking his head "no" even as he was saying yes. Soon afterward, the error rate in the pool had magically dropped below 10 percent – a threshold that itself had just been doubled to clear the way for this deal.
After that meeting, Fleischmann testified, she approached a managing director named Greg Boester and pleaded with him to reconsider. She says she told Boester that the bank could not sell the high-risk loans as low-risk securities without committing fraud. "You can't securitize these loans without special disclosure about what's wrong with them," Fleischmann told him, "and if you make that disclosure, no one will buy them."
A former Olympic ski jumper, Boester was such an important executive at Chase that when he later defected to the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, Dimon cut off trading with Citadel in retaliation. Boester eventually returned to Chase and is still there today despite his role in this affair.
This moment illustrates the most basic element of the case against Chase: The bank knowingly peddled products stuffed with scratch-and-dent loans to investors without disclosing the obvious defects with the underlying loans.
Years later, in its settlement with the Justice Department, Chase would admit that this conversation between Fleischmann and Boester took place (though neither was named; it was simply described as "an employee . . . told . . . a managing director") and that her warning was ignored when the bank sold those loans off to investors.

A few weeks later, in early 2007, she sent a long letter to another managing director, William Buell. In the letter, she warned Buell of the consequences of reselling these bad loans as securities and gave detailed descriptions of breakdowns in Chase's diligence process.
Fleischmann assumed this letter, which Chase lawyers would later jokingly nickname "The Howler" after the screaming missive from the Harry Potter books, would be enough to force the bank to stop selling the bad loans. "It used to be if you wrote a memo, they had to stop, because now there's proof that they knew what they were doing," she says. "But when the Justice Department doesn't do anything, that stops being a deterrent. I just didn't know that at the time."
In February 2008, less than two years after joining the bank, Fleischmann was quietly dismissed in a round of layoffs. A few months later, proof would appear that her bosses knew all along that the boom-era mortgage market was rotten. That September, as the market was crashing, Dimon boasted in a ball-washing Fortune article titled "Jamie Dimon's SWAT Team" that he knew well before the meltdown that the subprime market was toast. "We concluded that underwriting standards were deteriorating across the industry." The story tells of Dimon ordering Boester's boss, William King, to dump the bank's subprime holdings in October 2006. "Billy," Dimon says, "we need to sell a lot of our positions. . . . This stuff could go up in smoke!"
In other words, two full months before the bank rammed through the dirty GreenPoint deal over Fleischmann's objections, Chase's CEO was aware that loans like this were too dangerous for Chase itself to own. (Though Dimon was talking about subprime loans and GreenPoint was technically an Alt-A pool, the Fortune story shows that upper management had serious concerns about industry-wide underwriting problems.)
The ordinary citizen who is the target of a government investigation cannot pick up the phone, call the prosecutor and have his case dropped. But Dimon did just that.
In January 2010, when Dimon testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, he told investigators the exact opposite story, portraying the poor Chase leadership as having been duped, just like the rest of us. "In mortgage underwriting," he said, "somehow we just missed, you know, that home prices don't go up forever."
When Fleischmann found out about all of this years later, she was shocked. Her confidentiality agreement at Chase didn't bar her from reporting a crime, but the problem was that she couldn't prove that Chase had committed a crime without knowing whether those bad loans had been sold.
As it turned out, of course, Chase was selling those rotten dog-meat loans all over the place. How bad were they? A single lawsuit by a single angry litigant gives some insight. In 2011, Chase was sued over massive losses suffered by a group of credit unions. One of them had invested $135 million in one of the bank's mortgage--backed securities. About 40 percent of the loans in that deal came from the GreenPoint pool.
The lawsuit alleged that in just the first year, the security suffered $51 million in losses, nearly 50 times what had been projected. It's hard to say how much of that was due to the GreenPoint loans. But this was just one security, one year, and the losses were in the tens of millions. And Chase did deal after deal with the same methodology. So did most of the other banks. It's theft on a scale that blows the mind.
In the spring of 2012, Fleischmann, who'd moved back to Canada after leaving Chase, was working at a law firm in Calgary when the phone rang. It was an investigator from the States. "Hi, I'm from the SEC," he said. "You weren't expecting to hear from me, were you?"
A few months earlier, President Obama, giving in to pressure from the Occupy movement and other reformers, had formed the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group. At least superficially, this was a serious show of force against banks like Chase. The group would operate like a kind of regulatory Justice League, combining the superpowers of investigators from the SEC, the FBI, the IRS, HUD and a host of other federal agencies. It included noted anti-corruption- investigator and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which gave many observers reason to hope that finally something would be done about the crimes that led to the crash. That makes the fact that the bank would skate with negligible cash fines an even more extra-ordinary accomplishment.

By the time the working group was set up, most of the applicable statutes of limitations had either expired or were about to expire. "A conspiratorial way of looking at it would be to say the state waited far too long to look at these cases and is now taking its sweet time investigating, while the last statutes of limitations run out," says famed prosecutor and former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
It soon became clear that the SEC wasn't so much investigating Chase's behavior as just checking boxes. Fleischmann received no follow-up phone calls, even though she told the investigator that she was willing to tell the SEC everything she knew about the systemic fraud at Chase. Instead, the SEC focused on a single transaction involving a mortgage company called WMC. "I kept trying to talk to them about GreenPoint," Fleischmann says, "but they just wanted to talk about that other deal."
The following year, the SEC would fine Chase $297 million for misrepresentations in the WMC deal. On the surface, it looked like a hefty punishment. In reality, it was a classic example of the piecemeal, cherry-picking style of justice that characterized the post-crisis era. "The kid-gloves approach that the DOJ and the SEC take with Wall Street is as inexplicable as it is indefensible," says Dennis Kelleher of the financial reform group Better Markets, which would later file suit challenging the Chase settlement. "They typically charge only one offense when there are dozens. It would be like charging a serial murderer with a single assault and giving them probation."
Soon Fleischmann's hopes were raised again. In late 2012 and early 2013, she had a pair of interviews with civil litigators from the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of California, based in Sacramento.
One of the ongoing myths about the financial crisis is that the government is outmatched by the legal talent representing the banks. But Fleischmann was impressed by the lead attorney in her case, a litigator named Richard Elias. "He sounded like he had been a securities lawyer for 10 years," she says. "This actually looked like his idea of fun – like he couldn't wait to run with this case."
She gave Elias and his team detailed information about everything she'd seen: the edict against e-mails, the sabotaging of the diligence process, the bullying, the written warnings that were ignored, all of it. She assumed that it wouldn't be long before the bank was hauled into court.

Instead, the government decided to help Chase bury the evidence. It began when Holder's office scheduled a press conference for the morning of September 24th, 2013, to announce sweeping civil-fraud charges against the bank, all laid out in a detailed complaint drafted by the U.S. attorney's Sacramento office. But that morning the presser was suddenly canceled, and no complaint was filed. According to later news reports, Dimon had personally called Associate Attorney General Tony West, the third-ranking official in the Justice Department, and asked to reopen negotiations to settle the case out of court.
It goes without saying that the ordinary citizen who is the target of a government investigation cannot simply pick up the phone, call up the prosecutor in charge of his case and have a legal proceeding canceled. But Dimon did just that. "And he didn't just call the prosecutor, he called the prosecutor's boss," Fleischmann says. According to The New York Times, after Dimon had already offered $3 billion to settle the case and was turned down, he went to Holder's office and upped the offer, but apparently not by enough.
A few days later, Fleischmann, who had by then moved back to Vancouver and was looking for work, was at a mall when she saw a Wall Street Journal headline on her iPhone: JPMorgan Insider Helps U.S. in Probe. The story said that the government had a key witness, a female employee willing to provide damaging testimony about Chase's mortgage operations. Fleischmann was stunned. Until that moment, she had no idea that she was a major part of the government's case against Chase. And worse, nobody had bothered to warn her that she was about to be effectively outed in the newspapers. "The stress started to build after I saw that news," she says. "Especially as I waited to see if my name would come out and I watched my job possibilities evaporate."
Fleischmann later realized that the government wasn't interested in having her testify against Chase in court or any other public forum. Instead, the Justice Department's political wing, led by Holder, appeared to be using her, and her evidence, as a bargaining chip to extract more hush money from Dimon. It worked. Within weeks, Dimon had upped his offer to roughly $9 billion.
In late November, the two sides agreed on a settlement deal that covered a variety of misbehaviors, including the fraud that Fleischmann witnessed as well as similar episodes at Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two companies that Chase had acquired during the crisis (with federal bailout aid). The newspapers and the Justice Department described the deal as a "$13 billion settlement," hailing it as the biggest white-collar regulatory settlement in American history. The deal released Chase from civil liability. And, in what was described by The New York Times as a "major victory for the government," it left open the possibility that the Justice Department could pursue a further criminal investigation against the bank.
But the idea that Holder had cracked down on Chase was a carefully contrived fiction, one that has survived to this day. For starters, $4 billion of the settlement was largely an accounting falsehood, a chunk of bogus "consumer relief" added to make the payoff look bigger. What the public never grasped about these consumer--relief deals is that the "relief" is often not paid by the bank, which mostly just services the loans, but by the bank's other victims, i.e., the investors in their bad mortgage securities.
Moreover, in this case, a fine-print addendum indicated that this consumer relief would be allowed only if said investors agreed to it – or if it would have been granted anyway under existing arrangements. This often comes down to either forgiving a small portion of a loan or giving homeowners a little extra time to pay up in full. "It's not real," says Fleischmann. "They structured it so that the homeowners only get relief if they would have gotten it anyway." She pauses. "If a loan shark gives you a few extra weeks to pay up, is that 'consumer relief'?"
The average person had no way of knowing what a terrible deal the Chase settlement was for the country. The terms were even lighter than the slap-on-the-wrist formula that allowed Wall Street banks to "neither admit nor deny" wrongdoing – the deals that had helped spark the Occupy protests. Yet those notorious deals were like the Nuremberg hangings compared to the regulatory innovation that Holder's Justice Department cooked up for Dimon and Co.
Instead of a detailed complaint naming names, Chase was allowed to sign a flimsy, 10-and-a-half-page "statement of facts" that was: (a) so short, a first-year law student could read it in the time it takes to eat a tuna sandwich, and (b) so vague, a halfway intelligent person could read it and not know anyone had done anything wrong.

Chase Isn't the Only Bank in Trouble
The ink was barely dry on the deal before Chase would have the balls to insinuate its innocence. "The firm has not admitted to violations of the law," said CFO Marianne Lake. But the deal's most brazen innovation was the way it bypassed the judicial branch. Previously, federal regulators had had bad luck with judges when trying to dole out slap-on-the-wrist settlements to banks. In a pair of celebrated cases, an unpleasantly honest federal judge named Jed Rakoff had rejected sweetheart deals worked out between banks and slavish regulators and had commanded the state to go back to the drawing board and come up with real punishments.
Seemingly not wanting to deal with even the possibility of such a thing happening, Holder blew off the idea of showing the settlement to a judge. The settlement, says Kelleher, "was unprecedented in many ways, including being very carefully crafted to bypass the court system. . . . There can be little doubt that the DOJ and JP-Morgan were trying to avoid disclosure of their dirty deeds and prevent public scrutiny of their sweetheart deal." Kelleher asks a rhetorical question: "Can you imagine the outcry if [Bush-era Attorney General] Alberto Gonzales had gone into the backroom and given Halliburton immunity in exchange for a billion dollars?"
The deal was widely considered a good one for both sides, but Chase emerged with barely a scratch. First, the ludicrously nonspecific language surrounding the settlement put you, me and every other American taxpayer on the hook for roughly a quarter of Chase's check. Because most of the settlement monies were specifically not called fines or penalties, Chase was allowed to treat some $7 billion of the settlement as a tax write-off.
Couple this with the fact that the bank's share price soared six percent on news of the settlement, adding more than $12 billion in value to shareholders, and one could argue Chase actually made money from the deal. What's more, to defray the cost of this and other fines, Chase last year laid off 7,500 lower-level employees. Meanwhile, per-employee compensation for everyone else rose four percent, to $122,653. But no one made out better than Dimon. The board awarded a 74 percent raise to the man who oversaw the biggest regulatory penalty ever, upping his compensation package to about $20 million.
"The assumption they make is that I won't blow up my life to do it. But they're wrong about that."
While Holder was being lavishly praised for releasing Chase only from civil liability, Fleischmann knew something the rest of the world did not: The criminal investigation was going nowhere.
In the days leading up to Holder's November 19th announcement of the settlement, the Justice Department had asked Fleischmann to meet with criminal investigators. They would interview her very soon, they said, between December 15th and Christmas.
But December came and went with no follow-up from the DOJ. She began to wonder: If she was the government's key witness, how was it possible that they were still pursuing a criminal case without talking to her? "My concern," she says, "was that they were not investigating."
The government's failure to speak to Fleischmann lends credence to a theory about the Holder-Dimon settlement: It included a tacit agreement from the DOJ not to pursue criminal charges in earnest. It sounds outrageous, but it wouldn't be the first time that the government used a wink and a nod to dispose a bank of major liability without saying so publicly. Back in 2010, American Lawyer revealed Goldman Sachs wanted a full release from liability in a dozen crooked mortgage deals, while the SEC didn't want to give the bank such a big public victory. So the two sides quietly agreed to a grimy compromise: Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle a single case, and the SEC privately assured the bank that it wouldn't recommend charges in any of the other deals.
As Fleischmann was waiting for the Justice Department to call, Chase and its lawyers had been going to tremendous lengths to keep her muzzled. A number of major institutional investors had sued the bank in an effort to recover money lost in investing in Chase's fraud-ridden home loans. In October 2013, one of those investors – the Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund – asked a federal judge to force Chase to grant access to a series of current and former employees, including Fleischmann, whose status as a key cooperator in the federal investigation had made headlines in The Wall Street Journal and other major media outlets.

In response, Dorothy Spenner, an attorney representing Chase, told the court that Fleischmann was not a "relevant custodian." In other words, she couldn't testify to anything of importance. Federal Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV took Chase's lawyers at their word and rejected the Fort Worth retirees' request for access to Fleischmann and her evidence. 
Other investors bilked by Chase also tried to speak to Fleischmann. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which had sued Chase, asked the court to force Chase to turn over a copy of the draft civil complaint that was withheld after Holder's scuttled press conference. The Pittsburgh litigants also specified that they wanted access to the name of the state's cooperating witness: namely, Fleischmann.
In that case, the judge actually ordered Chase to turn over both the complaint and Fleischmann's name. Chase stalled. Later in the fall, the judge ordered the bank to produce the information again; it stalled some more.
Then, in January 2014, Chase suddenly settled with the Pittsburgh bank out of court for an undisclosed amount. Months after being ordered to allow Fleischmann to talk, they once again paid a stiff price to keep her testimony out of the public eye.
Chase's determination to hide its own dirt while forcing Fleischmann to keep her secret was becoming more and more absurd. "It was a hard time to look for work," she says. All that prospective employers knew was that she had worked in a department that had just been dinged with what was then the biggest regulatory fine in the history of capitalism. According to the terms of her confidentiality agreement, she couldn't even tell them that she'd tried to keep the bank from committing fraud.
Despite it all, Fleischmann still had faith that the Justice Department or some other federal agency would make things right. "I guess I was just a trusting person," she says. "I wasn't cynical. I kept hoping."
One day last spring, Fleischmann happened across a video of Holder giving a speech titled "No Company Is Too Big to Jail." It was classic Holder: full of weird prevarication, distracting eye twitches and other facial contortions. It began with the bold rejection of the idea that overly large financial institutions would receive preferential treatment from his Justice Department.
Then, within a few sentences, he seemed to contradict himself, arguing that one must apply a special sort of care when investigating supersize banks, tweaking the rules so as not to upset the world economy. "Federal prosecutors conducting these investigations," Holder said, "must go the extra mile to coordinate closely with the regulators who oversee these institutions' day-to-day operations." That is, he was saying, regulators have to agree not to allow automatic penalties to kick in, so that bad banks can stay in business.

Nobody Should Shed a Tear for JP Morgan Chase
Fleischmann winced. Fully fluent in Holder's three-faced rhetoric after years of waiting for him to act, she felt that he was patting himself on the back for having helped companies survive crimes that otherwise might have triggered crippling regulatory penalties. As she watched in mounting outrage, Holder wrapped up his address with a less-than-reassuring pronouncement: "I am resolved to seeing [the investigations] through." Doing so, he added, would "reaffirm" his principles.
Or, as Fleischmann translates it: "I will personally stay on to make sure that no one can undo the cover-up that I've accomplished."
That's when she decided to break her silence. "I tried to go on with the things I was doing, but I just stopped sleeping and couldn't eat," she says. "It felt like I was trying to keep this secret and my body was literally rejecting it."
Ironically, over the summer, the government contacted her again. A new set of investigators interviewed her, appearing to have restarted the criminal case. Fleischmann won't comment on that investigation. Frustrated as she has been by the decisions of the higher-ups in Holder's Justice Department, she doesn't want to do anything to get in the way of investigators who might be working the case. But she emphasizes she still has reason to be deeply worried that nothing will be done. Even if the investigators build strong cases against executives who oversaw Chase's fraud, Holder or whoever succeeds him can still make the whole thing disappear by negotiating a soft landing for the company. "That's the thing I'm worried about," she says. "That they make the whole thing disappear. If they do that, the truth will never come out."
In September, at a speech at NYU, Holder defended the lack of prosecutions of top executives on the grounds that, in the corporate context, sometimes bad things just happen without actual people being responsible. "Responsibility remains so diffuse, and top executives so insulated," Holder said, "that any misconduct could again be considered more a symptom of the institution's culture than a result of the willful actions of any single individual."
In other words, people don't commit crimes, corporate culture commits crimes! It's probably fortunate that Holder is quitting before he has time to apply the same logic to Mafia or terrorism cases.
Fleischmann, for her part, had begun to find the whole situation almost funny.
"I thought, 'I swear, Eric Holder is gas-lighting me,' " she says.
Ask her where the crime was, and Fleischmann will point out exactly how her bosses at JPMorgan Chase committed criminal fraud: It's right there in the documents; just hand her a highlighter and some Post-it notes – "We lawyers love flags" – and you will not find a more enthusiastic tour guide through a gazillion-page prospectus than Alayne Fleischmann.
She believes the proof is easily there for all the elements of the crime as defined by federal law – the bank made material misrepresentations, it made material omissions, and it did so willfully and with specific intent, consciously ignoring warnings from inside the firm and out.
She'd like to see something done about it, emphasizing that there still is time. The statute of limitations for wire fraud, for instance, has not run out, and she strongly believes there's a case there, against the bank's executives. She has no financial interest in any of this, no motive other than wanting the truth out. But more than anything, she wants it to be over.
In today's America, someone like Fleischmann – an honest person caught for a little while in the wrong place at the wrong time – has to be willing to live through an epic ordeal just to get to the point of being able to open her mouth and tell a truth or two. And when she finally gets there, she still has to risk everything to take that last step. "The assumption they make is that I won't blow up my life to do it," Fleischmann says. "But they're wrong about that."
Good for her, and great for her that it's finally out. But the big-picture ending still stings. She hopes otherwise, but the likely final verdict is a Pyrrhic victory.
Because after all this activity, all these court actions, all these penalties (both real and abortive), even after a fair amount of noise in the press, the target companies remain more ascendant than ever. The people who stole all those billions are still in place. And the bank is more untouchable than ever – former Debevoise & Plimpton hotshots Mary Jo White and Andrew Ceresny, who represented Chase for some of this case, have since been named to the two top jobs at the SEC. As for the bank itself, its stock price has gone up since the settlement and flirts weekly with five-year highs. They may lose the odd battle, but the markets clearly believe the banks won the war. Truth is one thing, and if the right people fight hard enough, you might get to hear it from time to time. But justice is different, and still far enough away.

Invest cautiously in this  mother of all bull runsStory
Taming the bull
We explain why you should invest cautiously despite all the talk about the 'mother of all bull runs'
Dipak Mondal        Edition: November 2014

The buzz is back in stock markets. Investors, both domestic and foreign, are upbeat. So are most market analysts. Once again it is time when investors dump caution and chase returns as if there's no tomorrow. How can it not be, when almost every analyst worth his or her name is claiming that we are in the middle of the 'mother of all bull runs'? Especially when investors, too, have already tasted blood by earning huge returns this year.
The National Stock Exchange's large-cap index, the Nifty, rose 37% between February 4 (when it touched the lowest level of 5,933 this year) and September 8 (it touched the year's peak of 8,180). Returns from mid-cap stocks are even more mind-boggling. The BSE Mid Cap index returned 63% between January 30 (when it touched 6,186 this year) and September 16 (when it touched a peak of 10,068 this year).
BULL RUN: HOW IT STARTED
Investors first got upbeat at the start of the year after they got some conviction that Narendra Modi ,  seen as pro-business, would become the country's prime minister. Equity markets, expecting huge pro-market changes in economic policies under Modi, acknowledged the win by breaking into new levels.
Will this euphoria last? Can the huge expectations from the government materialise into big economic reforms? Well, the economy is showing signs of revival even before the new government gets down to serious business. India's gross domestic product (GDP), the value of products and services produced by a country, grew 5.7% in April-June compared to 4.6% a year ago. Various estimates suggest growth of 5.5-6% this financial year as against 4.6% in 2013-14.
The index of industrial production (IIP), which tracks changes in industrial output, is also showing signs of revival. In April-August, it grew 2.8% compared to zero growth a year ago.
The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation fell from 6.2% in May to 2.4% in September, the lowest since October 2009. The indicator of retail inflation, the consumer price index (CPI), is also showing signs of softening. It grew 6.46% in September compared to 7.73% in August.
The Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, has been holding back from cutting interest rates due to high inflation. These latest price trends raise hope that it will cut interest rates, making loans cheaper. Low interest rates are key to the revival of corporate investments.
Nomura says if global commodity prices do not reverse the recent fall and stabilise at current levels, the WPI inflation is expected to average 4.5% in 2014-15 compared with the earlier forecast of 4.9% and 4.3% in 2015-16 as against the earlier forecast of 5.4%.
Falling global commodity prices, especially of crude oil, will keep inflation in check. Brent crude oil prices fell 32% from $112 on June 20 to $85 on October 14. This will bring down the country's oil subsidy burden, which was Rs 1.4 lakh crore in 2013-14, substantially this financial year. This will strengthen the country's fiscal position and lower government borrowings and, possibly, interest rates as well.
"The oil market has moved from being a sellers' market to a buyers' market. India, being a big oil importer, can now negotiate on prices. That is why India is in a sweet spot," says Raamdeo Agarwal, MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
Reflecting these changes, Standard & Poor's has upgraded India's sovereign rating from Negative to Stable. This is a big positive for India as more foreign investors will now buy its bonds. India's companies, too, will be able to get easier access to the global debt market. Despite hiccups such as the fall in export growth to 2.4% in August from 7.33% in July, flat IIP in July and August and uncertainty about the global economy, the chances of India's economy reviving are fairly high.
BULL MARKET
When things look this good, complacency is sure to creep in, forcing you to start committing 'small' mistakes that may burn a big hole in your portfolio when the market cycle reverses.
'I focus 1% on the market and 99% on the corporate side. There is nothing I can do about the market. Even god would not know how the market is going to move', says Raamdeo Agarwal, director and co-founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services
The biggest risk is smugness. One must guard against it at all cost. It is probably worthwhile to look back at the last bull run (2004-2007) and think of mistakes you or someone you knew had committed and learn a lesson or two from them.
Also, it will do you a world of good if you can figure out the 'dirty' practices adopted by market players to acquire customers. Remember that your interests are pitted against those of agents, distributors, even manufacturers of products such as funds and insurance companies. Therefore, caution will serve you well.
And do not forget the famous saying-be fearful when others are greedy. It sounds like a cliche but is the best advice you can get at this stage.
LEARNING FROM MISTAKES
Here are a few common mistakes investors make when the going gets easy.
Everything you touch will turn into gold: In a bull run, every stock that you buy rises. Your confidence grows. You think you have perfected the art of stock-picking and cannot go wrong. So, you make huge bets on high-beta (which move more than the overall market) and small-cap stocks as you want huge returns.
But once the rally reverses-and by the way all bull markets end, some sooner, some later- you are left licking your wounds. So, remember that when the going is too good, or easy, it's time for the cycle to turn. Be prepared.
Why pay fund managers when you can do it yourself: Such thinking results from the fact that almost all stocks give good returns in bull markets. Returns from mutual funds, which usually have 25-50 stocks, may look modest in comparison. But such stellar performance can last for a very short time. The real test of stock-picking ability is when markets are volatile. Have you been able to beat fund managers through all market cycles? If not, stick to mutual funds, for while they may not give you the 'kick' of direct investing, they can help you build a good corpus in the long run.
Blurred line between trading & investment: Not knowing the difference between trading and investment is a mistake in any market. However, in a bull market, you are more likely to be punished for your ignorance.
On television and in newspapers-and this happens more in bull markets-you will find dozens of experts giving buy/sell calls. These are for short periods, usually not more than a few days. If you use these to invest for the long term, you may end up doing serious damage to your portfolio.
Fundamentals, valuations take a back seat to sentiment: Often, amid the euphoria, as is evident now, investors lose sight of fundamentals and valuations. They invest in a stock just because it has given stellar returns in the past few months without bothering to see if it has become overvalued. They don't even notice if the company's business environment has changed for the worse or not.
At the peak of the bull run in 2006-07, many companies started borrowing heavily to expand in India and abroad. Some took on so much debt that soon their profits began to diminish due to high interest costs. When the slowdown hit and demand and order flow slackened, these companies saw a sharp dip in market capitalisation. Retail investors were slow to react and were caught in a slump.
Investors also failed to see that for most of 2007, the Sensex was above the price-to-earnings, or PE, multiple of 20 on a 12-month trailing basis, which is considered quite high. In the second half of the year, the PE crossed 25, and touched 28 by January 2008. The mayhem that followed is now well-known. Investors must remember that any bull market that is running on stretched valuations cannot be sustained. It will, sooner or later, revert to its long-term average.
'The unprecedented returns over the last few months have built up huge expectations in the minds of investors. We believe investors should moderate return expectations', says Sankaran Naren CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
Borrowing money to invest: There was a time between May 2005 and March 2007 when the daily one-year rolling return of the Sensex was above 20%. Making money had become too easy. Some investors became greedy and took personal loans from banks or borrowed from neighbours and relatives to invest in equity markets with the aim of doubling money in a couple of years. But the 2008 crash not only eroded the value of their investments by more than half within a year, it also left them with heavy debt, the interest rate on which was as high as 15-20%.

Waiting too long on fringes: It's a classic small investor syndrome. When markets are down, retail investors are nowhere to be seen. When markets start touching new highs, they think it is the right time to invest. This is the result of their impatience. Somehow they think that equities means doubling of money every two years. This leads them to make futile efforts to time the markets.
"Retail investors enter when markets have already rallied and chase laggards. One must assess the quality of the company and not focus on near-term laggards to generate extraordinary returns," says Nischal Maheshwari, head of research, Edelweiss Financial Services.
TRICKS, FRAUDS: TELL-TALE SIGNS
We discussed earlier how bullish markets lead to adoption of unethical practices such as mis-selling of complicated structured products which benefit only agents/distributors at the cost of investors. You have to guard yourself against these tricks. Here are some points you must be aware of.
Your broker insists you open a trading account with margin facility: If you are a long-term investor, you will neither trade frequently nor borrow money for trading. Margin facility allows you to take a bigger bet on a stock or an index by paying a part of the total value of the investment. The rest of the money is provided by the brokerage at an interest.
If you take a wrong call, you have to not only suffer a loss but also pay back the borrowed money to the brokerage with interest. Margin trading can make a serious dent in your portfolio. But these help brokerages earn interest as well as brokerage.
Your broker asks you to churn the portfolio: The decision to partially or fully book profit must be based on your need for money. If your broker is trying to coax you into selling a stock and buying another, and that too for no particular reason, this means that all it wants is to make you churn the portfolio so that he can earn some extra brokerage.
Someone called you to sell a structured equity product with guaranteed return: Structured products are complex and have exposure to derivatives. These are for investors who are savvy. You should avoid them at all cost if you do not understand them. Bets in derivatives involve taking future calls which could be speculative and lead to heavy losses.
'India's macro fundamentals are clearly improving and that gives confidence that we are in a bull run. However, this time, unlike the 2003-08 cycle, global risks are higher and, therefore, the rise could be bumpy', says Nischal Maheshwari Head of Research, Edelweiss Financial Services

Hot multi-bagger tips: Remember the movie, The Wolf of Wall Street, where the protagonist sells (over phone) an investor a penny stock of a 'cutting-edge technology' company (Aerotyne Industries) run from a garage by saying that it's one of the best investment ideas that has come up in a long, long time.
Of course, none of what he said was true, but since he was talking in difficult investment parlance with confidence, and promising a return of 10 times, the buyer on the other side of the call commits $4,000. You do not have to be a genius to know what happened to that investment. Avoid getting fleeced.
Bank/agent tries to sell you a new scheme: Fund houses try to make the most of upbeat investor sentiment by launching funds with fancy, sometimes weird, themes. These themes often survive for a very short while. Their only aim is to attract bulk investments in one go.
New funds are sold by telling investors they are cheap (mostly Rs 10). Funds usually offer high commissions to distributors for pushing these products. Ideally, one should invest in funds with a long track record and avoid new fund offers.

Don't get swayed by bull-run talk: An investment decision should be based on investment horizon, goals and portfolio makeup and not purely on market movements. Though you must tweak your portfolio to take advantage of the possible bull run in the coming years, you should not go overboard.
"The investor should consider his time horizon. If you are a longterm investor, you must remain invested irrespective of the market conditions. You have to decide whether you want to play a Test, an ODI or a T20 match," says Mukesh Dedhia, managing director, Ghalla & Bhansali, a financial advisory company.
If you have been investing for the last few years when equity markets were not doing well, you may already be sitting on good gains without doing much. That's the power of equity. Years of belowpar performance can be made good in just a few months.
Take the example of Quantum Long Term Equity Fund. Imagine you started a monthly systematic investment plan (SIP) of Rs 1,000 every month on 1 January 2008 and continued till 2 December 2014. Your Rs 72,000 investment would have become Rs 1,50,000 on 14 October 2014 by growing at 20% a year. But if you had redeemed the investment on 31 December 2013, its value would have been Rs 1,13,000, an yearly return of 15%.
Should you book profit if you have made decent gains? "You can book profit partially if you need the money or for adjusting your asset allocation. But do not stop SIPs as we feel the equity market cycle is yet to pick up," says Anil Rego, CEO, Right Horizons.
Investors must watch valuations of stocks they are holding. Besides, it is important to keep track of policies that may impact sectors the stocks belong to.
If you are a new investor, it is certainly the time to have some exposure to equities, but do not go overboard. Invest in a staggered manner as equities will witness a lot of volatility in the next 12-18 months. Any fall will be an opportunity to enter the market.
"Investors could now keep some cash as well so that if the market corrects over the next few months or one year they can buy," says Sankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.
New equity investors should invest through mutual funds and not directly. "It may be a prudent strategy to add the flavour of funds in the balanced or dynamic category in a portfolio which seeks to capture the upside by increasing allocation to equities when markets are declining and protect the downside by reducing exposure when markets are rising," says Naren of ICICI Prudential.
Keep an eye on earnings: If you are investing directly, look at earnings of companies whose stocks you are holding. The financial results of companies will decide if they deserve the valuations at which they are trading. Even in a bull run, ultimately it is earnings that drive stocks.
We have already seen Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) disappointing markets with its second quarter results. Other IT companies such as HCL Tech and NIIT Technology have also posted mixed results. Do these indicate a shift in outlook for the sector? You would probably like to know about it before investing in the sector.
However, analysts see an improvement in earnings going forward. "Corporate profitability is expected to grow faster than nominal GDP with companies becoming more efficient in the last down cycle, operating leverage playing out and some pricing power coming back. The deleveraging of corporate balance sheets has also begun, supported by an improvement in market sentiment and cash flow," says Ravi Malani, director, head of equities, Wealth and Investment Management - India, Barclays.
'One must keep in mind that valuations tend to expand with improvement in GDP growth. With expectations of steady recovery in economic activity and healthy corporate earnings, we may see better valuations for the market, as witnessed in the earlier cycles', says Ravi Malani Director, Head of Equities, Wealth and Investment Management-India, Barclays
Keep a close watch on valuations: Broader market indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, are trading at a 12-month trailing P/E ratio of 18, slightly above the fair value of 16. It is still way below the 28 touched in 2008.
"Given the historic political mandate along with domestic recovery and lower international commodity prices, it will not be appropriate to say that the Nifty is overpriced at these levels," says Nischal Maheshwari of Edelweiss.
However, many individual stocks are trading at high valuations. Some have seen valuations rise 80-90% since May (See BSE 500 Stocks With Steepest Valuation Jump). If their earnings do not improve in line with expectations, their stocks may see a sharp correction.
Click here to Enlarge
Avoid overexposure to mid- and small-caps: Typically, mid- and small-cap stocks or funds should not account for more than 20-30% of the portfolio. When equity markets are doing well, investors lap up these stocks in search of high returns. These move faster and in bull markets give much higher returns than the large caps. However, investors forget that sharp price changes happen both ways, and when markets tank, these crash much more than the large-caps.
Stick to asset allocation: Diversify portfolio with a judicious mix of equity, cash and debt. Stick to the ideal asset allocation. Review your portfolio once a quarter and adjust it to achieve the desired level of debt and equities.
'If global liquidity goes away for whatever reason, the yield gap will start to work against the market and cause it to contract to a level where the risk-reward ratio becomes favourable for equities', says Anish Damania, Head, Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities
Click here to Enlarge
The horizon of an equity investment should be at least three years. For short-term needs, keep money in either savings accounts or liquid funds. For two-three years, invest in bank fixed deposits or medium-term debt funds.A lot of discipline goes into creating a big long-term corpus. Bull markets, ironically, can be a distraction. Investors should be consistent and have realistic expectations to maintain discipline so that they can take the maximum advantage of the bull run, if at all there is one in the near future.

Boy and His Penguin Ad Tugs at HeartstringsBoy and his penguin ad tugs at heartstrings, purse strings
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Judging by the outpouring on Twitter, it seems everyone with an Internet connection and a heart is positively melting over a new ad featuring a seven-year-old boy who helps his penguin companion find love.
It begins with a very "Calvin and Hobbes" scenario where a boy and his penguin buddy, "Monty," pal around, playing Legos, jumping on trampolines and sledding. Penguins are of course naturals at sliding down snowy hills. 
But midway through the seasonal frolicking the boy realizes his companion is missing something. The answer, unwrapped in the final scene, positively rips at the heartstrings. 
Not to mention the purse strings. The 2-foot version of the Monty doll, costing £95.00 or about $150, sold out online within hours of the video going live. So too did the other penguin-branded plushies, pillows, mugs and scarves.
Not to worry, it's only November. The retailer plans on restocking and they'll make sure there's plenty of chances to snap up this penguin before Santa seals up his sacks.

A suicide bomber disguised in school uniform detonated explosives at a high school assembly in the northeast Nigerian city of Potiskum on Monday, killing at least 48 students, according to survivors and a morgue attendant.
Soldiers rushed to the scene, grisly with body parts, in the capital of Yobe state, but they were chased away with stones and calls by people angry at the military’s inability to halt a 5-year-old Islamic insurgency that has killed thousands and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
A suicide bomb attack in the same city killed 30 people one week ago, when suspected Boko Haram fighters attacked a religious procession of moderate Muslims.

Some 2,000 students had gathered for Monday morning’s weekly assembly at the Government Technical Science College when the explosion blasted through the school hall, according to survivors who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.
“We were waiting for the principal to address us, around 7:30 a.m., when we heard a deafening sound and I was blown off my feet, people started screaming and running, I saw blood all over my body,” 17-year-old student Musa Ibrahim Yahaya said from the general hospital, where he was being treated for head wounds.

Scientific Research Antarctica Caltech
Dolphin-sized robots are giving clues to a thaw of Antarctica's ice in a sign of how technology is revolutionizing data collection in remote polar regions, scientists said on Monday.
An international study led by the California Institute of Technology used three yellow "gliders", about 2 meters (6 feet 6 inches) long and each costing $240,000, to measure temperature and salinity in the depths of the Weddell Sea off Antarctica.
The measurements showed how vast eddies drive heat into shallower waters around Antarctica, helping thaw coastal ice.

The findings, in the journal Nature Geoscience, back up theories about how heat moves south and set benchmarks to track climate change. The U.N. panel of climate scientists says both Greenland and Antarctica are losing mass, raising sea levels.
"A revolution is underway in Antarctic data," Karen Heywood, a co-author of the study at England's University of East Anglia, said of how such battery-powered robots are raising the amount of data collected and cutting costs.
One of the three gliders got lost, but Heywood said it still worked out cheaper than a similar trip in 2007 which required a ship costing $30,000 a day, with many stops, to collect less data. Robot gliders can be left for months, diving and surfacing with tiny adjustments to buoyancy.
"We call them mechanical dolphins," she told Reuters of the gliders made by Norway's Kongsberg. Other makers are U.S. Teledyne Technologies and France's Alcen Group.
Elsewhere, about 3,600 free drifting "Argo floats" have been deployed worldwide since 2000 to help monitor temperatures and salinity in the seas. In the air, drones have also been used by organizations such as NASA to monitor ice.
Katharina Nygaard, of Kongsberg's subsea division, estimated the firm had a quarter of a world market of 800 gliders. Demand "is growing in the marine research world along with small but noticeable uptake by defense and commercial operators," she said.
In the Arctic, gliders are tracking higher temperatures that are driving fish stocks north. "We've moved from prototypes to the more regular use of gliders in the last year," said Peter Haugan, professor at the University of Bergen in Norway.

Cass Sunstein channels HayekBy Ilya Somin November 10
In a column written just before the election , prominent Harvard Law School Professor and former Obama administration official Cass Sunstein channels the great libertarian economist F.A. Hayek’s classic critique of conservatism in his advice to the new GOP majority in Congress:
Instead of conservatism, Hayek argued for a principled commitment to liberty — an approach that would sharply constrain government and “take an essentially radical position, directed against popular prejudices, entrenched positions and firmly established privileges.” It’s fair to say that in the current period, Hayek’s “radical position” would entail a strong commitment to free trade, a rejection of protectionism, decreased regulation, deep skepticism about occupational licensing (and other barriers to entry), a firm commitment to religious liberty, and less frequent appeals to patriotism as a substitute for freedom-protecting reforms…
In his short essay, Hayek did not deliver a knockout punch against conservatism. But he did land some powerful blows, not least in his objection that conservatives cannot easily work with people whose values differ from their own….
In the coming period, however, Republicans will be under increasing pressure to define themselves affirmatively rather than by opposition. One of their chief goals should be to identify freedom-promoting initiatives that might attract support from people who cannot, by temperament or otherwise, be counted as conservative. They would do well to begin with a close reading of Hayek.
Sunstein’s advice that the GOP pursue a “radical” Hayekian libertarian agenda may be in some tension with his recent critique of “paranoid libertarianism,” (which I commented on here ). Still, I agree with him that Hayek’s critique of conservatism remains relevant today . And I would be very happy if the new Republican-controlled Congress were to advance Hayekian reforms of expanding liberty and cutting back government regulation, while also eschewing appeals to nationalism.
Obviously, however, the GOP does not consist solely or even primarily of libertarians who feel the same way as I do. It has many other elements, including a still-strong social conservative contingent that party leaders must cater to in order to hold their coalition together. I am also skeptical about how much support a “radical” libertarian agenda (or even a moderate one) would attract from Sunstein’s fellow liberal Democrats.
That said, I think it is possible to envision the GOP evolving in a more libertarian direction over the next few years. With the very important exception of immigration, the party emphasized libertarian ideas far more than social conservative ones in the fall election. Significantly, they did not even make much of an issue out of the rapidly growing trend towards acceptance of same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization .
Some Republicans have even begun to rethink the War on Drugs and the mass imprisonment it generates . The Tea Party – the most dynamic part of the GOP in recent years – has largely focused on fiscal and economic issues, and has a substantial libertarian component (though it also has many social conservatives in its ranks).
Meanwhile, younger Republicans are far more socially liberal than their elders. For example, a recent survey finds that 61% of 18-29 year old Republicans support same-sex marriage , and many also support marijuana legalization . Generational succession will likely give such views greater weight in the party over time. By contrast, young Republicans are generally no less suspicious of government spending and economic regulation than older ones. The GOP is still very far from being a libertarian party, and it may never fully become one. But it could well become significantly more libertarian over the next few years than it has been at any time in the recent past.
It is also possible that libertarian-leaning Republicans can cooperate with liberal Democrats on some issues, including cutting back on the War on Drugs, and NSA surveillance, among others. At the same time, past attempts to build a “liberaltarian” alliance have had only extremely limited success, in part because the gap between libertarians and the left on many issues is very large .
In sum, I doubt that it is realistic to expect a “radical” Hayekian agenda from the Republicans. Even if party leaders wanted to do it (which is very doubtful), they probably could not bring it off. But it is possible that the party will become incrementally more libertarian over time, and that the more libertarian elements in the GOP will manage to find some common ground with liberals. At the very least, that scenario seems much more plausible today than even a few years ago.

Since then it s morphed into a monsterAlibaba's Singles' Day sales exceed predictions at $9.3bn
Chinese retailers prepare for "Singles' Day" - a retail bonanza. Leisha Chi reports.
Alibaba 'breaks share sale record'
China's online retail giant Alibaba says it has pulled in $9.3bn (£5.9bn) in sales from its annual 'Singles' Day' shopping event.
At the end of Tuesday, the firm said sales had reached 57.1 billion yuan, and that it had shipped 278 million orders - 43% of which were placed on mobile devices.
Last year, Alibaba recorded sales of $5.75bn, shipping 150 million packages.
Singles' Day is the world's biggest online retail sales day.
It compares with "Cyber Monday" in the US, the Monday after Thanksgiving, which is also marketed as a big online shopping day.
"You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer," said Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman, Joe Tsai.
"We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy from focused on the state sector to consumption."
Growing market
Alibaba had said it expected to break sales records during the annual event, offering big discounts to boost sales.
"I bet the number [of goods bought] is going to be scary," said Alibaba's executive chairman Jack Ma last week. He estimated that 200 million packages would be shipped from orders made during the day.
The company, which recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, surpassed that number by 18:00 Beijing time.
Alibaba sees record sales on Singles' Day
Analysis: Celia Hatton, Beijing correspondent, BBC News.
When did an obscure holiday devoted to single people, a kind of anti-Valentine's Day, become China's biggest shopping day of the year? Many in China find the transition baffling.
"November 11 used to be 'Singles' Day'. Then it became the Shopping Day, and now it's Couples' Shopping Day," complains one user on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. "Looking across the globe and over the years, there's never really been a day dedicated to single people."
Others point out that China's biggest online shopping platform, Alibaba, engineered the change.
Alibaba trademarked the term "Double-11", a popular term describing the November 11th holiday, in 2012.
The website earns a significant chunk of its profits on that day.
"They say behind every successful man, there's a woman quietly supporting him.  Behind Jack Ma, [Alibaba's founder], there're tens of millions of female shopaholics," jokes one Weibo user.
Frustration lingered in the background of many Weibo forums.
Shoppers complained the online deals were too good, tempting them to spend money they didn't have.
"Please Singles' Day, can you pass by quickly?," reads a typical comment. "I didn't think I needed anything until today when I feel like I need everything I see. I'm so helpless!"
Asia Business Report speaks to AT Kearney analyst Goh Mui Fong about the rise in Chinese e-commerce.
Singles' Day in China was adopted by Alibaba in 2009 to boost sales, but dates back to at least 1993, when students at Nanjing University are believed to have chosen the date as an anti-Valentine's Day where single people could buy things for themselves.
Since then, it has gone on to become a massive day of sales for China's fast growing e-commerce market.
The market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 25% over the next few years, from $390bn in 2014 to $718bn in 2017, according to a recent study released by management consulting firm AT Kearney.
This year's Singles' Day online sales event has attracted the participation of more than 27,000 global brands, including Japanese label Muji, Spanish clothing retailer Desigual and American outdoor clothing label The North Face.
Challenges?
"Lots of clients from the brands side have for the first time, approached the Singles' Day as an event on its own, and earmarked it as a significant retail operation, as major as Christmas and the Chinese New Year," said Shaun Rein from China Market Research in Shanghai.
However, despite Alibaba's recent successful share sale and the strong performance of this year's Singles' Day, Mr Rein says Alibaba still faces challenges.
He notes that while 35% of e-commerce transactions in China come from mobile devices, Alibaba is lagging slightly behind, with 31% of its sales generated from mobiles.

Vittorio Colao, Group Chief Executive, commented:
"We have made encouraging progress during the quarter. There is growing evidence of stabilisation in a number of our European markets, supported by improvements in our commercial execution and very strong demand for data. Our two year, £19 billion investment programme is well underway, and customers are beginning to see the benefits: in wider 3G and 4G data coverage, improved voice quality and reliability, and increased access to next generation fixed line services. Customers are showing an increasing propensity to trade up to bigger data allowances as a result of the 4G experience. In India, growth has accelerated, stimulated by investment in our 3G network. Our unified communications strategy continues to advance, with accelerating customer growth, further progress on fibre deployment, and the ongoing integration of recent acquisitions.
 
"Our markets continue to be highly competitive, and regulatory and macroeconomic risks remain. However, we are not yet half way through our investment programme, and there is still much more we will do to build a differentiated service for customers and improve perception. Today in Europe, only 6% of our customers are using 4G. In the next 18 months, we will reach 90% 4G coverage in Europe, giving us a great opportunity to increase penetration, stimulate data usage and grow customer spend. At the same time, we remain committed to shareholder returns, as the growth in the interim dividend demonstrates."

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENT
Financial review of the half year
The Group's emerging markets business continues to deliver strong organic growth, reflecting the combination of increasing demand for mobile voice and data services, with leading network quality and distribution reach, effective marketing strategies, and innovative services such as mobile money transfer. European market conditions remain challenging mainly due to continued competitive headwinds and the difficult macroeconomic conditions, leading to an overall fall in organic service revenue. However, signs of improvement in our commercial execution, a more stable competitive environment in some markets, and the early benefits of our Project Spring investment programme particularly in India, have led to a stabilisation of revenue quarter-on-quarter in several markets and an improved year-on-year revenue trend in the second quarter.
Group
Revenue for the first half fell 3.0%* to £20.8 billion. Group service revenue was £19.1 billion, reflecting a 2.8%* decrease on an organic basis comprising -4.2%* in Q1 and -1.5%* in Q2. Excluding the impact of MTR cuts, organic service revenue declined 2.9%* and 0.9%* respectively, with the improvement reflecting better trends in both our European and AMAP regions.
EBITDA fell 10.0%* to £5.9 billion. The Group EBITDA margin fell 0.9 percentage points to 28.4% (or -2.1* percentage points on an organic basis). This reduction reflected the impact of continued revenue declines in Europe, particularly in Spain, Germany and Italy, which offset broadly stable margins in AMAP.
Adjusted operating profit decreased to £1.8 billion from £2.5 billion in the prior period as higher reported EBITDA was offset by higher amortisation and depreciation, mainly due to the acquisition of KDG and the consolidation of Vodafone Italy.
 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the first half was 30.6% and includes the impact from foreign exchange losses. Excluding this impact the adjusted effective tax rate would be 29.5%. We recognised an additional deferred tax asset of £5.5 billion (2014: £14.9 billion) which takes our total deferred tax assets to £25.4 billion.
 
Adjusted earnings per share1 of 2.63 pence fell 46.5% mainly reflecting the Group's lower adjusted operating profit over the period.
Free cash flow2 was £0.0 billion, down £1.9 billion from the same period last year as lower payments for taxation were offset by lower dividends received from associates and investments and higher capital expenditure (£3.9 billion compared to £2.3 billion last year) associated with the Project Spring investment programme.
Net debt as at 30 September 2014 was £21.8 billion, (or £18.6 billion taking into account the Verizon loan notes) compared to £13.7 billion at 31 March 2014. Net debt includes the impact of the acquisitions of Ono in July 2014 for £5.8 billion and Cobra Automotive in August 2014 for £0.2 billion.
The Board is recommending an interim dividend per share of 3.60 pence, up 2.0% year-on-year, in line with our intention to increase the full year dividend per share annually.
Europe
Service revenue declined 6.5%* in H1, reflecting ongoing pressures from competition, regulation and weak economies. However, trends are showing signs of stabilisation, with Q2 service revenue growth of -5.0%* (Q1: -7.9%) reflecting sequential improvements in almost all European markets.
Mobile service revenue declined 7.3%* (Q1: -9.0%*; Q2: -5.6%*). The main factors behind this improvement include the growth of our contract customer base over recent quarters (aided by lower churn), the benefits to ARPU of 4G and increased data usage, a more stable pricing environment in some markets, and a weak prior period.
Revenue from fixed services declined 2.5%* (Q1: -2.8%*; Q2: -2.1%*), with growth in Spain, Italy and Portugal offset by continued declines in Germany and the UK. KDG continued to grow strongly, driven in part by 108,000 broadband net additions. Fixed revenue in Europe now accounts for 23.7% of total service revenue (compared to 18.1% in the prior year).
Organic EBITDA fell 16.3%* and the EBITDA margin reduced to 28.3%, representing a decrease of 0.4 percentage points, or 3.0* percentage points on an organic basis. This reflects the decline in revenue, increased customer investment and the cost impact of Project Spring, partly offset by a reduction in other operating expenses.
AMAP
Organic service revenue in the AMAP region, which accounts for 30.5% of total service revenue, increased by 5.7%*, with continued strong growth in most markets. The region continues to benefit from strong customer growth, increased usage of voice and data services, and effective marketing and pricing strategies. In the first half the customer base increased by 11 million to 313 million, and voice and data usage increased 9% and 110% respectively. During the period the pace of service revenue growth improved from 4.7%* in Q1 to 6.8%* in Q2, particularly driven by India, Turkey and Egypt. The contribution from data services increased notably, with the number of data users up 29% compared to last year, to 103 million.
Organic EBITDA increased 5.3%* and the EBITDA margin was 30.2%. The EBITDA margin fell 0.3 percentage points on both a reported and organic basis, as increased operating costs from Project Spring and inflationary pressures offset the scale benefits of continued revenue growth.
Strategic and commercial progress
Project Spring
Our two year programme to invest £19 billion to accelerate and extend our network and service differentiation in our key markets is progressing well. We are on track to meet our planned network deployment targets, with 21,000 4G sites and 38,000 new high capacity backhaul sites, added since last September. As a result the 4G network in Europe now covers 59% of the population, up from 32% a year ago, and 82% of data sessions take place at speeds greater than 3 Mbps. Over the same period in India we added approximately 12,400 3G sites and now provide 3G coverage across 89% of targeted urban areas. In the fixed business we have also deployed high speed next generation network technology to pass a further 1.6 million households in Europe. In terms of customer service, 26% of the targeted 8,000 stores across the Group have been refurbished so far, and our investments in IT and digital platforms have helped to improve the customer experience and reduce call centre call volumes.
Our investment in the network is delivering clear improvements in network quality. Dropped call rates across Europe have reduced 0.19 percentage points year-on-year to 0.71% and the average call set up success rate improved from 98.8% to 99.7%. Independent network tests in 20 Vodafone European and AMAP markets show that we have the best or equal-best networks for 3G data in 15 markets and for voice in 18 markets.
Our Project Spring investment programme is also delivering further innovation and enhancement to services. High Definition voice technology, for exceptionally clear mobile calls, is now live in 15 markets; 4G carrier aggregation, which bonds together multiple spectrum blocks to increase mobile data speeds significantly is live in the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, and will be operational in more European markets by March 2015; and Voice over LTE ('VoLTE'), which reduces call set up times and provides more stable and high quality calls using 4G technology, is currently being trialled in several European markets. Innovation is also taking place in our fixed business. In Germany, for example, KDG, has started to deploy its high speed 200 Mbps cable broadband product as an addition to the standard 100 Mbps offer.
Consumer
The take-up of data services continues to grow, and data traffic growth on our networks is accelerating. We now have 165 million data users across the Group, driving a 77% year-on-year growth in data usage in H1 (59% in Europe and 110% in AMAP). In India alone we now have 57 million data users, of which 14 million are using 3G.
Our 10.5 million 4G customers across the Group use, on average, 2 to 3 times the amount of data as compared with 3G customers driven by the improved user experience offered by 4G data connections. As a result 4G now accounts for 21% of data traffic in our European markets, compared to 16% a year ago. We continue to enhance our 4G propositions with a mixture of attractive music, sport and TV content to increase adoption and usage. We now have content deals in 10 markets and 4G customers that buy content services typically use significantly more data than those without bundled content.
Our Vodafone Red plans, which offer unlimited calls and texts combined with generous data allowances, are now used by 16.1 million customers, with 3.9 million added in H1. Our Vodafone Red plans account for around half of service revenue in the consumer contract segment in Europe and typically lead to both higher data and voice usage as compared to standard plans, and the ARPU dilution from customers migrating to Red plans continues to stabilise. During the last quarter we launched Vodafone Red across India, taking the number of Vodafone markets to 21. We also introduced Vodafone 'Red +' plans, which enable several customers to share one large data plan across a number of devices, in the UK and New Zealand, with more markets to follow later in the year.
Our transition from a predominantly mobile company to a unified communications provider is well advanced. Our fixed broadband customer base grew to around 11.2 million (10.5 million in Europe) at the end of the period, including 1.6 million customers gained from the acquisition of Ono in Spain in July 2014, making us one of the largest fixed broadband providers in Europe. Fixed service revenue across the Group now accounts for 18.7% of total service revenue.
The process of integrating KDG in Germany and Ono in Spain remains on track. In Germany cross-selling of fixed and mobile services and joint marketing of integrated plans is underway, the migration of DSL customers to cable has begun, and network integration has commenced. In Spain cross-selling started in August, the migration of DSL customers to fibre has commenced, and from 1 September one common leadership team manages both the fixed and mobile businesses.
Our fibre deployment plans in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland are progressing. We have recently launched a combined fixed broadband and TV service in the Netherlands, and are announcing today our plans to launch residential broadband services in the UK in Spring 2015, leveraging the infrastructure acquired with Cable & Wireless Worldwide ('CWW'). Taking into account our wholesale agreements we have access to fibre passing 42 million homes across Europe, representing 29% of households, of which 4.4 million households actively use our fibre services.
During the last quarter, we announced the acquisition of an additional 73% of the share capital of Hellas Online ('HOL') for a total cash consideration of €72.7 million (£57 million), taking our interest to 91%. HOL is a leading provider of fixed broadband and telephony services in Greece and will accelerate our unified communications strategy in the Greek market. The transaction is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of the 2014 calendar year, following which Vodafone Greece will extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining shares in HOL. The purchase price implies an enterprise value for 100% of HOL of €311 million (£242 million).
We continue to drive adoption of a range of innovative consumer services to differentiate our offerings and deliver commercial benefits including incremental revenue and lower churn:
·      Our money transfer service, M-Pesa, which operates principally in emerging markets, now serves 18.5 million active customers, up 16% on last year. During the period the M-Pesa product portfolio was enhanced with the introduction of our savings and loans proposition (M-Pawa), in partnership with the Commercial Bank of Africa, and our merchant proposition (Lipa Kwa M-Pesa), both in Tanzania.
·      Our mobile payment service for European markets, Vodafone Wallet, expanded to the UK and Italy, taking the number of markets to five.
·      Two million customers now take our mobile security services to protect against viruses and harmful websites in two markets - Italy and Portugal.
Enterprise
In Enterprise we continue to focus on strategic growth areas, as corporate customers look to mobility to improve the productivity of their workforces and to enhance the value of services they provide to their own customers. Revenue at Vodafone Global Enterprise, which provides services to multinational companies, rose 1%* in Q2, supported by a number of significant contract wins including new services for British Gas, Aviva and Robert Bosch. In machine-to-machine, in which we are a global market leader, revenue growth was 24%*. The acquisition of Cobra Automotive Technologies, which was completed in August, expands our M2M capability beyond connectivity and significantly strengthens our telematics and application services capabilities.
We are also executing on our plans to become a key unified communications provider to businesses. 24% of our Enterprise service revenue in Europe is now from fixed line, as we invest in and enhance the platforms acquired with CWW to take services such as Cloud & Hosting and IP-VPN into new geographical markets. Vodafone One Net, our cloud-based integrated fixed and mobile platform for small and medium sized companies, is now used by 3.6 million customers, representing an increase of 11% year-on-year.
Organisational efficiency
We continue to use the benefits of our global reach and scale to standardise and simplify the way we do business to both improve our cost efficiency and improve customer service. We continue to centralise procurement within the Group; 15,000 employees work in lower cost shared service centres, as compared to 13,500 in March 2014; and the number of customers now using our MyVodafone mobile self-care app increased by 68% to 9.8 million, which helps to reduce calls made to call centres and in turn customer care costs.
Outlook and guidance3
The overall performance of the Group in the first half of the current financial year has been in line with our expectations. Competitive, macroeconomic and regulatory pressures, particularly in Europe, continue. However, we are seeing some signs of stabilisation in our commercial performance and operating trends, and some markets are beginning to demonstrate the early benefits of our Project Spring investment programme.
We anticipate that our investments will begin to translate into further improvements in network performance and customer perception over the coming quarters. In the medium term, this will become more consistently evident in key operational metrics such as churn and ARPU; and subsequently into revenue, profitability and cash flow.
We now expect EBITDA for the 2015 financial year to be in the range of £11.6 billion to £11.9 billion, and free cash flow to be positive, after all capex.  Guidance excludes Ono.

latest views of the Airports CommissionHeathrow and Gatwick new runway costs 'underestimated'
 
Plans to build new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick will cost substantially more than the bidders have estimated, a report says.
The Airports Commission says a second runway at Gatwick would cost £2bn more than the bid suggests.
Two separate plans to expand Heathrow are predicted to cost £3-4bn more.
The commission has been tasked with weighing up where a new runway should be built to meet rising capacity demand in the South East of England.
It is considering three options - a second runway at Gatwick, a third runway at Heathrow, or an extension to one of the existing Heathrow runways.
Alternative proposals, including building new airports near Oxford or in Thames Estuary, have already been ruled out.
Analysis: Richard Westcott, transport correspondent, BBC News @BBCWestcott
This report goes into a lot of technical detail about the pros and cons of each runway scheme. But, what it doesn't do, what it can't do really, is quantify the politics of it all.
Heathrow splits MPs. Cabinet members like Justine Greening, Phillip Hammond and Vince Cable have spoken against expansion in the past. Officially, the Liberal Democrats don't want any new runways at all, not unless another one is closed elsewhere.
Then, there's the rumour that the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was once prepared to resign as energy secretary over plans to expand Heathrow. Although, it's thought his thinking may have changed recently.
Meanwhile, many business leaders support Heathrow and have told the chancellor as much.
And I haven't even mentioned Boris Johnson, who's regularly called Heathrow expansion a disaster… and he could well be one of the airport's neighbouring MPs after the election.
Whatever Sir Howard Davies recommends, it's the politicians that will have to deliver it. And, that's the hard part.
No decision made
The commission has released its latest analysis of the three shortlisted plans at the beginning of a three-week public consultation period.
But the head of the commission, Sir Howard Davies, said no decision had yet been made.
"We have not yet taken a view on which proposal strikes the most effective balance between the assessment criteria," he said.
"It is important first that we provide an opportunity for this evidence to be examined, challenged and improved. This consultation gives everyone with an interest in the issue of airport expansion that opportunity."
However, the report does suggest that all three bids have underestimated the costs involved.
It also suggests that landing charges to airlines would need to increase in order to pay for the expansions.
Airports Commission Chairman Sir Howard Davies on the new report
The BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott said higher landing charges could mean higher fares for passengers.
According to the commission's analysis, Gatwick's plan to add a second runway is the quietest and easiest to deliver.
But, expanding Heathrow is seen as more likely to deliver a bigger boost to the economy, and create more jobs.
Sir Howard is not due to issue his final recommendation to the government until the summer of 2015 - after the general election.
Gatwick identified three options for a second runway, but the Davies Commission shortlisted Option 3, which would allow fully independent operation.
Predicting the future
Sir Howard said the three options for expansion presented "an interesting choice of airport model".
"If you look at the last 10 years or so, you can see it's low cost traffic that has grown much more quickly than the full service, all singing all dancing model [such as British Airways and KLM]. That's a big element of the debate - how the world is going to look in 10 year's time - that's the tricky bit," he told BBC's Radio 4.
Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said on Tuesday that airlines are increasingly opting for new planes that fly direct from smaller airports, doing away with the need for major hubs such as an expanded Heathrow. He also said expanding Gatwick would cost taxpayers less.
"As the Commission underlines Gatwick can actually be delivered by 2025. We have a safeguarded site with little risk and no complex construction across major motorways. Our new runway can be funded without a penny of taxpayers' money at a time when there are a lot of other competing priorities for public funds," he added.
However Heathrow's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, says expanding his airport would benefit the UK economy.
"Only Heathrow can get us to the growth markets of the world such as China, only Heathrow can help us to double our export volumes because Heathrow already handles over a quarter of all Britain's exports - Gatwick less than 2% - but also only Heathrow can be a solution for the whole UK, not just London and the south-east," he added.
The Board of Airline Representatives (BAR), the industry body representing the majority of airlines operating to the UK, said costs were an important factor in the final decision.
"Since airlines and ultimately the travelling public fund the vast majority of the UK's airport infrastructure, unlike road and rail, airlines will be closely examining the Commission's findings on the business case and cost model for each of the Gatwick and Heathrow options," said BAR chief executive, Dale Keller.
 

Jet plans to lease one more plane to EtihadJet Airways says plans to lease one more plane to Etihad
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 13:41 IST
Private carrier Jet Airways on Monday said it is likely to lease one more Boeing 777-300 ER to its equity partner Etihad.
Etihad Airways , which holds 24 per cent stake in the Naresh Goyal-led carrier, has already taken on lease six planes from Jet Airways.
"We may lease one more Boeing 777 aircraft to Etihad on a short-term basis," Jet Airways Vice-president for Aeropolitical, Government and International Affairs Gautam Acharya said during a post-earnings analysts call in Mumbai.
The airline has leased altogether nine aircraft to Etihad and Turkish Airlines, he said, adding, "Four Boeing 777-300ERs and two A330s are leased to Etihad, while three Boeing 777-300ERs are with Turkish Airlines."
Etihad had recently said it was planning to take some more planes from Jet . "We are finalising plans to introduce two aircraft before the end of the year," Etihad had said.
One of the three aircraft leased to Turkish Airlines is coming back, and which may go to Etihad on lease, Acharya said.
The Mumbai-based full service carrier has 113 planes in its fleet, of which 26 are owned by the carrier and the rest 87 are leased.
The country's second-largest airline by market share, Jet cut down its consolidated loss by a whopping 95.7 per cent at Rs 43 crore in the three months to September on the back of a Rs 305 crore one-time income from the sale of its loyalty programme to Etihad and better operational efficiency.
Besides, on a standalone basis, it flew back into profit with Rs 69.82 crore profit against a net loss of Rs 891 crore in the year-ago period.
The operational restructuring initiatives with route and network rationalisation are already yielding dividends on the domestic and international network, the airline's Chief Executive Cramer Ball had said at the Q2 earnings.
The organic network expansion, coupled with enhanced global connectivity through alliances and code-share pacts, had also helped in increasing international passenger traffic, Ball had said in the result statement over the weekend.

Talk Talk s efforts to sell its customersBUSINESS REVIEW
Strong year-on-year progress in financial performance
We have made strong progress during the half towards our FY17 financial targets of 4% compound annual revenue growth and 25% EBITDA margin.
H1 EBITDA grew strongly year-on-year (+44.7%) to £110m (H1 FY14: £76m) with EBITDA margin up 360bps to 12.6% (H1 FY14: 9.0%).  We grew revenues by 3.3%, with an acceleration to 3.6% in Q2 (up from 3.1% in Q1), helped by higher growth in customer numbers, ARPU growth of 1.8% (up from 0.3% in Q1), and continuing strong growth at TalkTalk Business.
We reduced operating costs as a percentage of revenues by 60bps and SAC by 12%.  As a result, operating free cashflow more than doubled to £44m (H1 FY14: £20m) and net debt to EBITDA reduced to 2.25x from its peak of 2.33x six months ago.
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 4.6p (H1 FY14: 4.0p), with the 15% year-on-year increase reflecting our confidence in the strategy, growth prospects and long term cash generation potential of the group.
Moving from selling one product to four
Based on our experience in the last year we made a pro-active decision in Q2 to broaden our trading approach and changed the mix of our SAC and marketing investment to drive growth across all four consumer products - broadband, TV, mobile and fibre.  As a result in H1 we added 25,000 broadband customers, 64,000 mobile customers, 101,000 fibre customers and 300,000 TV customers. 
As a result of our broader trading strategy we added fewer TV customers in Q2 than in previous quarters.  This still represents the fastest growing TV base in the UK - adding more customers than the rest of the market combined.  At the same time we have delivered stronger quarterly growth in each of broadband, mobile and fibre than we have done in the last four years.  The economics of triple play customers (in-contract payback, modest ARPU uplift and material churn reduction) are compelling and we remain on track for the vast majority of our customers to take TV over the next few years.
This revised trading approach not only gives us immediate ARPU and churn benefits but also gives us greater upsell opportunities for the future from a larger base.
Continuing to improve customer experience and churn
At the same time as growing customer numbers and revenue, we continued to improve our customers' experience, with complaints to Ofcom down by 30% year-on-year in the half and call volumes down 24%. This improvement and the rising proportion of customers taking additional products such as TV, mobile and fibre, enabled us to reduce year-on-year churn in Q2 to 1.4% (Q2 FY14: 1.7%; Q1 FY15: 1.4%).  
Driving product growth whilst reducing SAC
We have delivered the accelerating growth in our broadband base and in additional products whilst simultaneously reducing total SAC costs and costs per add.  Total SAC and marketing costs peaked in H1 FY14 at £174m and have come down by 12% year on year to £153m.
Cost per add in TV has come down to £125, down from £130 in H2 FY14, which in turn was down from £170 in H1 FY14 thanks to an increase in self install and a higher mix of Essentials TV.  Broadband, mobile and fibre cost per add also reduced thanks to greater use of lower cost online sales channels.  Online sales now account for 44% of sales, up from 33% a year ago.  This gives us a very sound platform to drive further growth at lower cost per add in the second half of the year.
Strongest organic broadband net adds in four years (H1: +25,000, Q2: +15,000)
H1 saw the strongest organic growth in our broadband base in the last four years and reflects a greater focus on our compelling value broadband proposition against a backdrop of intense marketing activity, particularly at the beginning of the UK football season.
We added 86,000 fully unbundled customers to our on-net base during the half with our legacy broadband only (-41,000) and off-net (-20,000) bases continuing to decline in line with established trends.  As a result we grew our total broadband base by 25,000.
We continue to see opportunities to grow market share in broadband connectivity by leveraging the scale and superior economics of our network and now expect broadband growth to continue to accelerate through the second half.
Following the end of the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire Virgin Media's National brand customers. These are DSL customers outside Virgin Media's cable footprint but are substantially on-net for our own unbundled network, and represent a good strategic acquisition that will accelerate the growth of our broadband, TV and fibre bases.  The National base stood at 97,700 at the end of September 2014.  We expect that a substantial proportion of these customers will be migrated onto our network through 2015.
Accelerated mobile (H1: +64,000, Q2: +40,000), quad-play launched
Our mobile base grew by 64,000 during the half and by 40,000 during Q2 (Q1 FY15: +24,000) to 348,000 driven by strong take-up of both handset and SIM only offers. 
With 9.5% of customers now taking a mobile product from us, we are beginning to see the emergence of strong triple (voice, broadband and TV) and quad-play (voice, broadband, TV and mobile) demand in our base.  We recently launched our first quad-play bundle in which mobile is included as standard for all Plus TV customers.  All new and existing Plus TV customers will receive a mobile SIM worth £90, giving 100 minutes, 250 texts and 200MB of data a month, at no extra cost.  The inclusive mobile package will cover the needs of the average TalkTalk Mobile customer, with free calls between family members and to TalkTalk mobiles on the same account
In addition we launched Talk2Go, our proprietary Android/iOS app that allows VOIP calls over customers' fixed line connection.  This will allow customers to make full use of their fixed-line minute allowance on mobile devices and with our Follow Me service, customers can pick up landline calls on their mobile when out and about - in the UK or abroad.
Growing fibre take-up (H1: 101,000, Q2: +67,000)
We added 101,000 fibre customers during the half and 67,000 during Q2 (Q1 FY15: +34,000), our strongest ever quarter of fibre growth.  With 8.5% of our base now taking fibre, we expect that demand will grow steadily with heightened awareness of the product and growing bandwidth usage.  It is clear that at the right price, customers see value in the proposition.  We expect the introduction of a margin squeeze test by Ofcom during 2015 to lead to lower wholesale fibre costs in due course, which in turn will enable us to drive uptake further.
Continued strong growth in TV (H1: +300,000, Q2: +115,000)
We added 300,000 net new customers to our TV base and 115,000 during Q2 (Q1 FY15: +185,000), taking the total base to 1.2m or 33% of our fully unbundled customer base.  Net adds momentum has been driven by upsell to Essentials TV and customers new to TalkTalk (26.2% of TV additions in Q2).  TVOD volumes grew 88% year-on-year to 456k with average ARPU stable at c£4.  TV Boost penetration during the half continued to trend down as expected, with the growing mix of Essentials customers in the base, but with average ARPU stable at c£10.
We continued to develop our content offer on YouView during the half and built upon our existing wholesale relationship with Sky.  We reached a new multi-year agreement to broaden and extend the distribution of Sky's premium movies and sport content to our TV customers. In addition to the linear channels, this includes the right to offer customers catch up content for both Sky Movies and Sky Sports.  It also includes new channel Sky Sports 5 (Champions League and European football) and access to Sky Sports Box Office on a pay-per-view basis.  This builds on our existing relationship to offer Sky entertainment content and access to live sports on NOW TV on a day-pass basis.  This has led to a material increase in customers watching and purchasing Sky boosts, with TV Starter take-up +660% year-on-year driven by Sky 1 and Sky Living; Sky Sports +250% year-on-year driven by the success of Sky Sports F1 and the introduction of Sky Sports 5; and Sky Movies Boost +155% year-on-year driven by the success of Sky Movies on Demand.
We added 16 further new channels during the half, including Premier Sports, two Brazilian and eight African channels.  We also added a number of unique TV boosts not available on any other UK Pay-TV platform, including TV Box (Universal Studios), and Collections from ITV (a boxset proposition offering a great range of comedy, drama and entertainment classics).
Following the addition of Netflix to the YouView platform last week, we expect to rollout Netflix access to all TalkTalk set-top boxes early in the new year, with pre-registration for existing customers already open.
TalkTalk Business - 9.3% growth in Corporate revenue driven by 55% data revenue growth
We continued to see strong demand for our competitively priced data products for businesses, with 55% revenue growth in the half helping drive overall Corporate revenue growth of 9.3% year-on-year (Q2 FY15: +8.5%).  We won further new contracts to supply Ethernet and Ethernet First Mile connectivity as a result of which we added over 4,000 new Ethernet and EFM lines during the half, taking the installed base to over 21,500.
In addition we launched our first ever above-the-line marketing campaign for Business Broadband aimed at the SoHo and SME markets, highlighting our compelling price proposition versus BT (£10.50 per month for unlimited data and calls, including unlimited to mobile numbers, compared to £16 per month for the equivalent product from BT). We also launched a free voice app called Talk2Go which allows customers to use existing fixed line minutes on their mobile free of charge as well as free app to app calls, delivering even further value to our Business Broadband proposition. We have seen a strong response which underpins our confidence in the substantial upside opportunity for TalkTalk Business in the Business Broadband market.
We continued to deepen our relationships with existing customers with Iceland expanding its data network to include next generation voice services from TalkTalk Business, and SSE Telecom launching Ethernet into its substantial B2B customer base.  In addition with a strategy to sign up business partners that have a sizeable presence in the market but little or no trading with us, we have gained agreement from three large business partners to take our Ethernet and Broadband products, and expect to announce them publicly over the coming months. These wins further demonstrate the value and service our clients/business partners are seeing from TalkTalk Business as an alternative to incumbent carriers.
Making TalkTalk Simpler delivering progress on operating costs, £7m saving
We have made further progress in Making TalkTalk Simpler, with cost savings of £7m in the half.
Tariff simplification
We have accelerated our exit from legacy consumer tariffs such as SMPF.  Our AOL customer base will be rebranded to TalkTalk in H2. Supporting infrastructure has been simplified with systems and exchanges decommissioned and we have also made significant progress in TalkTalk Business with 65% of live TTB tariffs eliminated so far.
Systems transformation
TalkTalk Business operational systems have been simplified and our new business CRM systems are now live. In consumer we have delivered billing system upgrades, our new fault diagnostic tools will go live in H2 and we are accelerating the consumer CRM changes.
Leveraging data
We have also made progress in leveraging value from our data. Key dashboard reporting has been launched for our consumer teams, whilst work continues to better assure data in TalkTalk Business. We have also made our supporting infrastructure simpler and cheaper to operate, with 3rd party systems and support decommissioned during H1.
Brilliant self service
300,000 customers have downloaded the service centre App since launch 11 months ago.  The App allows customers to view their package details and bills on the go, check their mobile allowance and diagnose faults remotely.  Over 84% of our customer base has now registered with MyAccount allowing them the convenience of managing their account online at a time and place that suits them.  In Q2 1.4m customers interacted with us online using their MyAccount.  Only 6% of those customers subsequently needed to contact us by telephone. Our new online welcome centre helps new customers through the process of joining TalkTalk: it explains the engineer visit, go-live dates and provides contextual help and information to the customer including an explanation of the first bill. This has reduced early life calls and customer satisfaction for this experience is above 70%.
Driving Growth beyond 2017
We are ideally placed to benefit from the market shift to quad play.  We already have a strong, and accelerating quad-play proposition, and we are laying the foundations for sustained quad-play growth beyond our FY17 medium term targets.
We have made good progress on our fibre to the premise joint venture in York.  Fujitsu has been appointed as the infrastructure contractor and we commenced the first phase of digging to build the network out from our points of presence to our cabinets two weeks ago.   We are on track to start connecting customers to our Ultrafast product in York next year.  We are excited about bringing affordable 1Gig services to consumers and businesses in York and should the trial be successful, we see the potential to build a pure fibre network to 10 million households. 
We expect the proportion of customers taking mobile products in addition to fixed line from us to grow significantly, and over time we expect to use TalkTalk's 4G spectrum to build an in premise small cell mobile network that will both improve our customers' experience and reduce costs.
 
FY GUIDANCE
·     Revenue, Overheads and Pre-SAC EBITDA
We continue to expect FY15 revenues to grow by at least 4%, with H2 seeing the benefits of higher rates of customer growth, pricing activity and continuing growth in data revenues at TalkTalk Business 
Overheads as a percentage of revenue are expected to fall below the level reported for FY13, driving Pre-SAC EBITDA margins ahead of those reported for FY13
·     SAC & Marketing and Headline EBITDA
We expect strong year-on-year growth in EBITDA and EBITDA margin 
We now plan to deliver higher volumes of broadband, fibre and mobile customers and lower volumes of TV than anticipated earlier in the year
This growth is likely to require additional SAC investment of £20m-£25m, which would drive a more modest reduction in year-on-year SAC than envisaged in our previous margin guidance of 16%-17% at the beginning of the year
·     Net debt
Capex is expected to be within our guideline of 6% of revenue and working capital is expected to show outflows similar to FY14 as we see continuing strong growth in FY15 whilst also reducing costs
Cash exceptional items relating to Making TalkTalk Simpler and our acquisition of the Virgin Media National base are expected to be £30m-£35m
·     Dividend
While we shall continue to invest for growth in FY15, we are confident of achieving our medium term financial targets and accordingly, expect to grow the FY15 dividend by no less than 15% as previously indicated
FY15 - FY17 GUIDANCE UNCHANGED
We remain on track to achieve 4% CAGR in revenues (FY14-FY17) and 25% EBITDA margin by FY17.
We expect revenue growth to be supported by growth in total customer numbers, ARPU progress from disciplined pricing and promotional activity, and growing scale in TV, mobile, and fibre.  We also expect TalkTalk Business revenues to grow at a faster rate than the group average, driven by data products and new product innovation. 
Revenue growth is a key component of our EBITDA margin target. There are two other components:  SAC and overhead reduction. 
We expect to reduce SAC by requiring fewer gross adds to maintain our customer base as a consequence of lower churn from growing TV, mobile and fibre penetration and better customer service; and by reducing costs per add as a result of increased levels of self service and, over time, the falling costs of technology to provide TV. 
Our Making TalkTalk Simpler programme is a key enabler of overhead reductions.  This will make it simpler for our customers to engage with us, whether it is to buy products and services, to manage their bills, or to resolve problems.  To achieve this simplicity we will reduce the number of tariffs and access methods we use; reduce the complexity of our systems; make better use of data; and drive a self-service model.  These initiatives are expected to deliver further savings in excess of £40m by FY17.
 
Headline Profit & Loss
Revenue and margin
H1 revenue grew 3.3% year-on-year to £871m (H1 FY14: £843m) with an acceleration from 3.1% in Q1 to 3.6% in Q2, on track to deliver at least 4% revenue growth in FY15 and our medium term target CAGR of 4% by FY17.
On-net revenue increased 5.9% to £648m (H1 FY14: £612m) with broadband customer growth of 25,000 in H1 and the continued take up of new products including TV, mobile and fibre. This growth in the base combined with price inflation more than offset the continued decline in voice usage and the change in the VAT treatment of value line rental.
Corporate revenue increased 9.3% to £177m (H1 FY14: £162m) with strong growth in data products (+55%) offsetting the continued and expected decline in voice revenues.
Off-net revenues, at £46m (H1 FY14: £69m) reduced in line with our expectations as a result of the continued decline in the voice only and off-net base, and off-net voice usage.
Gross margin increased 3.2% year-on-year to £480m (H1 FY14: £465m) driven by customer growth and price inflation offset by promotional activity and the continued decline in voice usage.
EBITDA
EBITDA increased by 44.7% year-on-year to £110m (H1 FY14: £76m) with EBITDA margin increasing to 12.6% (H1 FY14: 9.0%) and on track to deliver our medium term target of 25% by FY17.
Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reduced to 24.9% (H1 FY14: 25.5%) driven by our ongoing efficiencies programme Making TalkTalk Simpler which has included a call volume reduction program and engineer efficiencies. These were partly offset by the continued and expected investment in our network to deliver additional backhaul capacity and resilience. 
SAC and marketing reduced by 12% year-on-year to £153m (H1 FY14: £174m) despite adding more customers and growth in the take-up of additional products such as mobile, fibre and TV. This was achieved through lower costs per add from higher online sales, and a higher mix of Essentials TV and self-install.
Exceptional items
Exceptional costs of £9m (H1 FY14: £8m) were incurred in the period, all related to the MTTS programme, predominantly redundancy, project management, migration and associated costs.  The current planned activity is expected to deliver over £40m of annualised savings by FY17.
Headline EBIT
Headline EBIT of £46m (H1 FY14: £18m) increased by 156% as a result of higher EBITDA offset by an increase in the depreciation and amortisation charge of £7m from continued capital investment in our network over the last year.
Interest and Tax
Finance costs were £3m higher at £12m (H1 FY14: £9m) predominantly as the refinancing activity completed in Q2 resulted in an accelerated amortisation charge for the previous facility fee (£2m).
The effective tax rate of 20% (H1 FY14: 22%) reflects the annual recognition of a further tranche of the tax losses acquired with Tiscali, based on our rolling forecast and in line with our agreement with HMRC.
Earnings per Share
Headline earnings per share increased by 2.1p year-on-year to 2.9p (H1 FY14: 0.8p)
 
Headline cashflow and net debt
Operating free cash flow increased by 120% year-on-year to £44m (H1 FY14: £20m).
Capital expenditure increased by 14.6% year-on-year to £55m (H1 FY14: £48m) representing 6.3% of revenues (H1 FY14: 5.7%) and included investment in our network and customer facing IT systems as we invested in our Making TalkTalk Simpler programme. Working capital outflow of £11m (H1 FY14: £8m) in the first half reflects the move in consumer payment profile away from the upfront payment of value line rental (VLR) and an increase in stock arising from the growth in our fibre and TV investment.
Interest cost of £13m was higher than the prior year (H1 FY14: £8m) due to payment of facility fees for the new debt facilities of £5m. Acquisition spend of £5m (H1 FY14: £3m) included £3m of funding for the YouView joint venture, and £1m for our Fibre-To-The-Premise joint venture with BSkyB and CityFibre.
Net share repurchases represent £1m of proceeds received on the exercise of options by employees (H1 FY14: £5m). In H1 FY14, share purchases were made by the Employee Benefit Trust of £24m (10m shares) to cover anticipated future option exercises. The dividend cost in the period was £74m, being payment of the final dividend for FY14 of 8.0p per share.
Net cash outflow of £58m during the half resulted in net debt increasing to £555m from £497m at 31 March 2014, while net debt to EBITDA reduced to 2.25x from its peak at the end of FY14.
Refinancing
In H1 FY15, the Group re-financed its debt to secure a £100m term loan, a £560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and a £50m bilateral agreement to replace the existing facilities that were set to mature in March and November 2015. The new term loan has a final maturity date of July 2019 with repayments during the term of £25m in January 2017 and £25m in January 2018. The RCF and the bilateral agreement both mature in July 2019.
In addition, in July 2014, the Group issued US$185m of US Private Placement (USPP) notes maturing in three tranches (US$139m in 2021, US$25m in 2024 and US$21m in 2026). The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under the agreement is at a margin over the US treasury rate for the appropriate period. The fair value of the notes is translated at the spot rate each reporting period. Cross currency swaps were taken out to hedge against foreign exchange rate movements.
Capital structure
The Board is confident that the Group's leverage, as measured by Net Debt/EBITDA, will fall over the medium term and that such a reduction will make it appropriate to consider a return of excess capital to shareholders in order to maintain an efficient capital structure.

SAT clubs KP Singh, others' petitions with main DLF case
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 02.36PM IST

DLF
(As an interim measure, SAT…)
MUMBAI: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today bundled the petitions from DLF promoter-chairman K P Singh and four others with the main petition that the realty major has filed with the quasi judicial body on October 22 and put off the hearing on the matter to December 10.
DLF chairman K P Singh, his son and vice-chairman Rajiv Singh , younger daughter and whole-time director at DLF Pia Singh , company directors T C Goyal and Ramesh Sanka had earlier moved the tribunal challenging the October 10 Sebi ban on them.
Market regulator Sebi had banned the company and six of its senior officials including the Chairman from accessing the capital markets for three years for alleged non-disclosure of three of its hundreds of subsidiaries in the 2007 IPO filing.
Admitting their petitions, the quasi-judicial body SAT directed Sebi to submit respond to these new bunch of petitions on December 6 and directed the petitioners to file their rejoinders on the 8th, and fixed December 10 for hearing on their petitions along with the main case.
On November 5, the tribunal had allowed DLF to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from its mutual fund investments to meets its working capital requirement and to service its debt, till December 31.
DLF had sought permission to redeem money locked in MFs after being slapped with the three-year ban by Sebi.
The final hearing in DLF's main appeal against the order would commence on December 10, prior to which Sebi and the company will have to file their replies with the SAT.
As an interim measure, SAT has allowed the company to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 767 crore in November and further funds worth Rs 1,039 crore in December.
"Sebi order did not ban DLF from continuing its business, but only barred it from accessing the capital markets for three years," a three-member SAT bench said explaining the rationale for the interim relief.
"It can be reasonably concluded that the appellant (DLF) should be allowed to use its own funds to meet its every day needs and other working capital requirements, including meeting its obligations to the creditors.
"Accordingly, this tribunal justifies the appellant's demand to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from MFs and also allow its lenders to de-freeze/invoke pledged shares of its subsidiaries as and when required," Presiding Officer JP Devadhar had said.
The tribunal had also noted that Sebi counsel Rafique Dada did not object to the interim relief. "We are not opposing the plea for interim relief presuming that the tribunal is satisfied with the case made out by the appellant and not that we agree with all the points made," Dada said.
Sebi took action against DLF for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of 2007 IPO, which fetched it Rs 9,187 crore, the biggest IPO at that time.

Modi marches on  accommodates BJP s new faces in Centre  statesPM Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah give lift to new faces in Centre, states and party
Pratyush Ranjan , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 11, 2014
First Published: 12:16 IST(11/11/2014) | Last Updated: 15:16 IST(12/11/2014)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expanded his council of ministers and shuffled his leaders to strengthen his government’s agenda and kick-start the economy.

Modi, who took office in May after sweeping to power with a massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, now heads a 66-member council of ministers , with 26 ministers holding Cabinet rank.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajiv Pratap Rudy, JP Nadda, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who were earlier engaged in party affairs, are now a part of his team .
Their engagement at the frontline will put the onus on party president Amit Shah to create a new second line of leadership at a time when the going is good for the BJP.
As is perceived with Modi, there seems to be a plan in the manner in which leaders are being picked for the Centre and in states. Here’s a list of those rising through the ranks.
In Modi government
Manohar Parrikar , defence minister: He has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, health and family welfare minister: Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims to be a disciplined solider of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is seen as the spiritual and ideological guide of the BJP.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy , skill development and entrepreneurship, parliamentary affairs minister: He was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the single largest party after the recent assembly elections.
Mahesh Sharma, culture, tourism and civil aviation minister: A doctor, Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA. He is now the MP from Gautam Budh Nagar constituency in Uttar Pradesh.
Ram Shankar Katheria, MoS human resource development: A PhD holder and writer of books on social issues and uplift of Dalits, among others, Katheria's elevation as a MoS is being seen as a move which would help the party in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
Hansraj Ahir, MoS chemicals and fertilisers: He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. An active parliamentarian, Ahir has introduced a number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, MoS minority affairs, parliamentary affairs: A vocal BJP spokesperson, Naqvi has been the Muslim face of the party for long.
Giriraj Singh, MoS micro, small and medium enterprises: His emergence on the national political scene has been rather dramatic. A firebrand Bhumihar leader, he has influence over vast pockets in southern Bihar and election-bound Jharkhand. He was a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government in Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015.
Ram Kripal Yadav, MoS drinking water and sanitation: Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both houses of Parliament, where he had represented Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign in the state for the 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, MoS urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation: The singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol was a huge boost for the party.
Jayant Sinha , MoS finance: Sinha, is a former corporate insider with wide experience in governance and strategy consulting. He is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a BTech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, MoS water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation: He defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. He is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje cabinet to contest the elections.
Mohan Kundariya, MoS agricultutre: He is an influential leader from the Patel community and MP from Rajkot. A powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, MoS human resource development: A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academic and was a part of the party's anti-corruption campaign.
Vijay Sampla, MoS social justice and empowerment: It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to the Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, MoS home affairs: He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been a BJP member since 1988, and was the vice-president of the party’s Gujarat unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, MoS food processing industries: The lone woman inducted into the Modi cabinet in the expansion, Jyoti is an MP from Fatehpur. She defeated the Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life.

New faces in party
BJP president Shah has also carried out a major organisational reshuffle, giving important assignments to performers and bringing in new faces.
OP Mathur: The Rajasthan leader — who as election in-charge in Maharashtra polls won accolades — has been given charge of Uttar Pradesh. This is a job that Shah himself looked after in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.
Shrikant Sharma: As party secretary, he oversaw media affairs during the Lok Sabha polls. He has been given the charge of Himachal Pradesh, which the BJP lost to the Congress last year.
Vinay Sahasrabuddhe: Party vice-president and a close aide of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. He has been given charge of Madhya Pradesh.
Prabhat Jha: The Rajya Sabha MP will continue to oversee party affairs in Delhi while general secretary P Murlidhar Rao, another leader with RSS background, gets charge of Karnataka, which goes to poll in 2018.
Trivendra Singh Rawat: Former Uttarakhand minister and a Thakur leader, he worked closely with Shah as joint in-charge of Uttar Pradesh during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in-charge of poll-bound Jharkhand.
Shyam Jaju: The party secretary worked closely with Team Modi during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in charge of Uttarakhand.
Satish Upadhyay: He is president of the party’s Delhi unit and will be kept busy ahead of polls, most likely in January or February next year.
Chief ministers
Mohan Lal Khattar , Haryana: Khattar is a former RSS pracharak.
Devendra Fadnavis , Maharashtra: The 18th chief minister of Maharashtra was an active Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in college. In the ABVP, he started as a grassroots worker, painting walls and sticking promotional posters for established leaders.
Laxmikant Parsekar , Goa: A three-term MLA and former chief of state BJP. He started as a RSS worker.

The view of many GermansThe German way of stagnating
 
Are Scotland's new tax and spending powers fair?
In Germany, why is is that they seem to do most things better than the rest of the world, even economic stagnation and recession?
I was in the great port of Hamburg yesterday, part of the industrial powerhouse that is Germany, to get a sense of the mood of the country, shortly before the publication of official figures that will show the German economy is pretty limp.
In the second three months of this year, German national income contracted by 0.2%, and it is widely expected that it either flatlined or shrank a miniscule amount in the three months to the end of September.
So Germany is either in an official recession - albeit a mild one - or so close as to make precious little difference.
Surely therefore German business owners, economists and people would be gloomy. After all, in the UK, whose economy is growing at a world beating pace of 3% a year, the general mood is still on the grim side - opinion polls show we are a bit more upbeat than we were, but we are not exactly ready to partay (sic).
Now of course there was no science involved in the selection of the Germans to whom I spoke, so I am not claiming that my Hamburgers precisely capture the mood of the nation.
But it was nonetheless striking that everyone to whom I spoke - from the owner of a goodly sized "mittelstand" international manufacturer, to students, to workers and professionals - were all confident about the economic future, and felt their government was doing roughly the right thing.
More pertinently, they see the current slowdown as a temporary thing. And they apparently have no desire for the government to waver from its course of eliminating its budget deficit next year.
It is not clear to me whether Hamburgers are listening to to Mrs Merkel or she is listening to them - but either way she seems to be in tune with them to a degree that presumably would make Mr Cameron sick with envy.
Here is perhaps the most extraordinary difference between the UK and Germany.
German leader Angela Merkel's economic policy is apparently in tune with the mood of her nation
The UK national debt continues to rise pretty rapidly as a share of national income, despite putative austerity that divides the nation and the main political parties.
By contrast in Germany the national debt has already been falling as a share of GDP in recent months. and belt-tightening seems to be viewed with calm and equanimity, as more or less a national duty.
Now to be clear, this German sangfroid and - some would say - complacency is not necessarily good either for them or the rest of the world, in the long run.
There are those, such as Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), who fear the country has been making false economies, by cutting back on important infrastructure spending and investment - and that this will in time undermine its formidable productivity and competitiveness.
The DIW calculates that Germany's public sector and private sector need to make additional investments worth more than 100bn euros every year, just to maintain the existing stock of productive capital, road, rail and so on.
Despite the fact that Germany invests considerably more than the UK, Fratzscher believes Germany has been under-investing for well over a decade.
“Start Quote
The view of many Germans is that the likes of the UK, France, Spain and so on lived for years beyond their means”
End Quote
And then there is there is the question of the sustainability (a very German concept) of its basic economic model - which is to sell massively more to the rest of the world than it buys from the rest of the world.
The extraordinary thing is that in 2013, Germany had the biggest trade surplus in the world, of 206bn euros - bigger even than China's (by a fraction).
This dependence on exports means of course that when growth in the rest of the world slows, as it has been doing, growth in Germany has to slow. And that of course is what has been happening for most of this year - as much of the eurozone has hit the buffers (again) and China's attempt to become less dependent on debt-fuelled investment has seen its growth decelerating.
For Germany, there is the added factor of its close trading ties with shrinking and blackballed Russia.
So that is the short term cost to Germany of being so hooked on exports - although I have to say my experience in Hamburg yesterday was of a nation not unduly fussed about that.
Shipping containers at the port of Hamburg: Is Germany "hooked on exports"?
It is the rest of us who should perhaps be bothered.
When the world divided, as it did before the great crash of 2008, into great surplus-producing countries, such as China, Saudi and Germany, and great deficit-generating consuming countries, such as the US and UK, the monetary conditions were created for a dangerous rise in global indebtedness.
With the likes of Germany still attached to that surplus-maximising model, it becomes harder and more painful for the indebtedness of the consuming countries to be reduced to manageable and sensible levels.
Your response may be something along the lines of "hard cheese". That is, in my experience, the typical Germanic response.
The view of many Germans is that the likes of the UK, France, Spain and so on lived for years beyond their means. And it is therefore perfectly reasonable for them to make some sacrifices today, to get their (our) finances back in shape, at the level of state and households.
But if a surplus country like Germany isn't prepared to take steps to expand its own economy, by stimulating spending either by its people or government, then the steps necessary for a Spain or a France or an Italy to reduce indebtedness are even more painful.
The point is that the cuts they are forced to make aren't counterbalanced by extra demand for their goods and services from the likes of Germany.
In those circumstances, getting the debt down in the weaker consuming economies leads to international beggar-my-neighbour. Everyone tightens their belts. Global growth slows down. And all countries ends up poorer than necessary - even Germany.
So although German fiscal righteousness and attachment to prudence is completely understandable, it is not necessarily rational.
 

The European Court of JusticeEU 'benefit tourism' court ruling is common sense, says Cameron
 
Cameron: One last go at EU change
A European Court of Justice ruling backing Germany's attempts to restrict unemployed migrants' rights to welfare has been welcomed by David Cameron.
The UK prime minister said the decision on so-called "benefit tourism", which could set a precedent for other EU nations, was "simple common sense".
It could allow the UK to exclude some EU migrants from specific benefits.
Mr Cameron is under pressure to reduce EU migration and will outline his plans by the end of the year.
He has called for reforms to the principle of free movement of people within the EU - but has been told an "arbitrary cap" on numbers will not be accepted.
The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the government - so often at odds with the European Court of Justice in the past - was hailing the ruling as endorsing Mr Cameron's approach to reforming the EU.
Freedom of movement
But he said the "huge caveat" was that the decision could also be used to show "a big shakeup" of the system was not needed.
The government has already tightened the rules so EU migrants have to wait three months after arriving in the UK before they can claim child benefit and child tax credits.
David Cameron said on Monday he wanted the UK stay in a reformed EU
Migrants are also barred from claiming jobseeker's allowance after three months if they are not looking for work, and the prime minister has said he wants to go further.
He said the European court's ruling was "significant", adding: "It's a good step in the right direction:
"As I've said, the right to live and work in another country should not be an unqualified right; there should be rules about restricting benefits and this is good news."
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the "excellent" ruling backed the government's argument that free movement was not "an absolute right", and backed Britain's cased for tighter curbs on benefits for EU migrants.
Tuesday's ruling from the Luxembourg-based court relates to a case involving a Romanian woman and her son living in Germany who had been denied access to a non-contributory subsistence allowance from its social security system.
Analysis by Europe correspondent Chris Morris
This isn't a blanket ban on EU migrants claiming benefits - nothing like it.
The woman involved in this case, Elisabeta Dano, already receives child benefit in Germany.
But the European Court agreed that she could be denied access to a subsistence allowance available to jobseekers because she isn't actively seeking work.
The Court also said Ms Dano and her son could not claim a right of residence in Germany because they do not have sufficient resources to support themselves.
In response, the European Commission said it has consistently stressed that freedom of movement is about the right of circulation, not about an unrestricted right to claim benefits - and the European Court has confirmed this.
But ironically this ruling could make it more difficult for David Cameron to renegotiate Britain's ability to exclude some EU migrants from parts of the benefit system.
Other EU leaders could turn round and say that the Court has now made it clear that the UK (and others) can already do that under existing rules.
It said the defendant did not have sufficient financial resources to claim residency in Germany after the initial three months and therefore could not claim that the rules excluding her from certain benefits were discriminatory.
More broadly, it said the right of EU citizens to live and work in other member states - the principle of freedom of movement - did not stop states passing legislation of their own excluding migrants from some non-contributory benefits open to their citizens.
'UK competence'
National parliaments, it stated, have the "competence to define the extent of the social cover" offered in the form of certain non-contributory benefits.
The ruling says national parliaments have latitude when it comes to welfare rules
"The (EU) directive thus seeks to prevent economically inactive European Union citizens from using the host member state's welfare system to fund their means of subsistence," it said in a statement.
"A member state must therefore have the possibility of refusing to grant social benefits to economically inactive European Union citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member state's social assistance."
Officials at the Department for Work and Pensions are considering what impact the ruling could have on the UK.
It only applies to non-contributory benefits, where the claimant does not make a contribution through the tax system.
BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan said calculating the number of EU nationals claiming benefits in the UK was not easy, but according to the government's estimates, they make up 2.5% of all working-age claimants.
More than half are claiming jobseeker's allowance, the benefit most likely to be affected by the ruling, he said, while about 40,000 EU nationals getting sickness and disability benefits could also lose out.
Labour backed the judgement, saying only people who contribute to the economy should be able to fall back on the welfare state.
Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves urged ministers to extend the three-month waiting time for benefit claims and stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependants living abroad.
The European Commission has said it supports action by member states to tackle abuse of the benefits system by migrants but that it will not countenance restrictions on freedom of movement and labour across Europe.
 

Experimental flight of GSLV Mark 3 in Decem...Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle
(Several factors, including…)
NEW DELHI: India will conduct an experimental test of its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark 3 in mid-December, ISRO Chief K Radhakrishnan said Tuesday.
The satellite launch vehicle will have a capacity of carrying approximately four tonnes of load, and will be able to launch heavier satellites in space, Radhakrishnan said giving the 50th Foundation Day Address at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA).
"In mid-December, we will have the experimental flight of the GSLV Mark 3. It will not launch a satellite in this flight, and will be passive in the upper stage," said the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief.
"It will be ready for developmental flight in two years," he added.
The vehicle is 42.4 metres tall compared to the other GSLV which is 49 metres. It will be a three-stage vehicle.
Development for the GSLV Mark 3 began in the early 2000s, with the first launch planned for 2009-2010.
Several factors, including the April 15, 2010 failure of the ISRO-developed cryogenic upper stage on the GSLV Mk II, have delayed the programme.
Pointing out that the cryogenic engine used in the launch vehicle, developed totally indigenously, make India one of the few countries with the technology, Radhakrishnan said India still lagged behind several other countries in the capacity of its launch vehicles.
"China has launch vehicles with 5.5 tonnes capacity, Europe has 11 tonnes capacity launch vehicle, US has 13 tonnes capacity launch vehicles and Russia has nearly 10 tonnes capacity vehicles," he said.
The ISRO chief said the long term target is to make a launch vehicle with 12 tonnes capacity.

Lesson from Chhattisgarh: Cash-for-sterilisation drive maybe masking grave tragedyprint
Eight women died after botched sterilisation surgery at Bilaspur district in Chhattisgarh. (Shutterstock)
The death of eight women in botched sterilisation surgeries in Chhattisgarh brings back into focus a long-running, contentious state-run programme that is neither transparent nor clinically safe, nor even greatly beneficial in stabilising India’s population.
 
Back in the 1970s, the government was so worried about the exponential growth in population that it launched a compulsory sterilisation programme which saw unwilling men hiding in fields and on trees to avoid getting vasectomies.
 
In many cases, school teachers trying to meet family planning targets pressured fathers of their students to sterilise, before a public outcry drove authorities to abandon these desperate attempts.
 
That coercive campaign was replaced with a new, free choice policy which emphasised education of women and health care rather than demographic control.
 
But, in practice, women and men are often coerced, forced or bribed into accepting tubal ligation.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.
 
A typical sterilisation camp in villages throws up dire images of surgeries rushed through in unhygienic conditions: Typically, half a dozen tables set next to each other, blood-stained sheets, health staff without protective masks and tools only rinsed with hot water.
 
Even paying women to undergo sterilisation is a form of coercion in a country blighted by decades of poverty and illiteracy and where the poor still see an extra child as an extra pair of hands. Also, paying a bonus to doctors and officials for every surgery raises as much an ethical question as the prospect of perpetuating coercion.
 
Excessive focus on sterilisation may actually be contributing to a population boom. The drive to promote sterilisation limit the contraceptive choice, with spacing methods for young couples - pills, intrauterine devices and condoms - getting neglected.
 
Given that India is a young country, limiting the contraceptive choices of the young maybe slowing down the fall in growth of the population.
 
Many states also violate the population policy of 2000, which called for a target-free approach to population stabilisation. To meet the goal of population stabilisation, many states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have fixed targets especially for sterilisation.
 
In India, population control remains a delicate issue, with politicians being wary of promoting family planning too vigorously, mindful of the lessons of history.
 
In 1977, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was punished by voters for imposing the Emergency. But her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Our sterilisation programme still remains mired in controversy. Although there may be merit in stabilising the population, it is time to break the awkward silence around a controversial state programme before it becomes a grave human tragedy.
 

Fadnavis keeps Plan B ready as Shiv Sena  BJP spar in HouseWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

Treasury asks top civil servants to find £30bn in public service cuts
Whitehall called upon to produce examples of how deeper reductions could be imposed a year after next general election
Jump to comments (…)

Whitehall’s most senior mandarins have been asked by the Treasury to draw up details of how an extra £25bn-£30bn in public spending cuts could be imposed a year after the next general election, according to cabinet insiders.
The cuts being sought from permanent secretaries would cover the two years after the existing agreed spending review period comes to an end in April 2016, and so would cover the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18.
It had been known spending cuts of this order would be required in the two years as part of the Treasury deficit-reduction plan, but it had not been known that the Treasury was already seeking detailed examples of proposed cuts. An indication of government thinking is expected in the autumn statement on 3 December.
Some cabinet ministers are aghast that plans are being drawn up privately for cuts going so deep into the next parliament and believe a public debate should be under way now rather than make plans in private before the election. “We need a public debate around all this, and not for this to be decided in a private conversation between the treasury and the civil service,” a source said.
One is understood to have told his permanent secretary not to cooperate with the exercise that started in the late summer, partly because they think the scale of the cuts being planned is not justified.
The cabinet minister acknowledged that senior civil servants have their own careers to consider so it may be that the work is going on anyway without the agreement of elected ministers on the basis that it forms part of the contingency planning and horizon scanning process that applies after the election. The source added that David Cameron was being deeply misleading about the scale of the cuts needed in the next parliament.
The cuts being planned for the second parliament are likely to be tougher to sell politically partly because the public is not as prepared as in 2010 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Tax receipts are also lower than had been anticipated, partly because of changes in the labour market, such as an increase in the number of young people in low-paid employment and in the numbers of self-employed.
A commitment by Cameron to protect spending on the NHS from cuts would mean that the impact will be felt more severely elsewhere. Cuts will again squeeze the police, the Ministry of Defence, legal aid and the business department including further education funding, student maintenance loans and science research.
One source said: “The planned cuts would have a massive impact on departments. You could see the Department of Communities and Local Government facing eventual cuts since 2010 of 80%.” The source added that this would have a devastating impact on the housing budget and on local council services.
George Osborne, the chancellor, has vowed to run an absolute surplus in the public finances by 2018-19 and may want detailed ammunition on how cuts could be made so he can control the baseline in any election debate about tax and spending.
An analysis on Monday suggested that spending cuts in the next parliament would be deeper than expected. The Financial Times said cuts would be closer to £48bn between 2014-15 and 2018-19 rather than the £25bn mentioned by Cameron, partly because the prime minister had excluded cuts required in 2014-15 and 2018-19.
The consequence is the combined annual budget of non-protected departments such as local government and defence will come down by a third in real terms from £144bn in 2014-15 to £96bn in 2018-19. Osborne has said he could reduce these cuts by as much as £12bn if he can find cuts to working-age welfare.
Nick Clegg, speaking at the CBI conference in Birmingham yesterday, hinted at the fragile state of the public finances by saying “the nascent recovery is at a very delicate stage”. But the deputy prime minister said he differed from the Tories who want to complete the deficit reduction by the 2017-18 timetable through spending cuts alone. This plan was “neither economically sensible and socially sustainable”. He added: “It would lead in my view to very, very deep cuts in policing, in the business department and in social care. It would also penalise the working-age poor”.

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra today said it has increased prices of its passenger and commercial vehicles from this month by an average of 1 per cent, in the range of Rs 2,300 to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom), to partially offset the impact of rising input costs.
“We have been holding back on the price hikes for a while but now it has been necessitated to partly offset the impact of rising input costs,” Mahindra & Mahindra, Chief Executive Automotive Division and International Operations, Pravin Shah said in a statement.
Farm Equipment Sector (FES), a part of $16.5 billion Mahindra Group, has also increased prices of its tractors effective from November 2014.
“The increase is in the range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 depending upon the model. The price hike has been necessitated owing to increase in commodity prices and conversion costs,” the company said.
Mahindra sells a range of passenger vehicles including the Scorpio, Bolero and XUV500 and commercial vehicles like Alfa and Gio. It also markets a range of tractor models like Arjun and Yuvraj.
Mahindra shares today closed at Rs 1,260.65 apiece on the BSE, up 2.35 per cent from its previous close.

China unveils sophisticated stealth fighter aircraftChina unveils sophisticated stealth fighter aircraft
Reuters
Tweet
ZHUHAI/BEIJING, Nov 11:  
China unveiled a sophisticated new stealth fighter jet at an air show on Tuesday, a show of muscle during a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama for an Asia-Pacific summit.
China hopes the much-anticipated J-31 stealth aircraft, developed by the Aviation Industry Corp of China (Avic), the country's top aircraft maker, will compete with U.S.-made hardware in export markets.
The twin-engine fighter jet was unveiled at the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in the southern city of Zhuhai, an annual event at which China shows off its military technology, a Reuters witness said.
The J-31 conducted a demonstration but was not put on display afterwards although a mock-up version was on show.
An Avic spokesman declined to comment on any orders for the aircraft.
"We were told not to do any promotion for the plane," said the spokesman, Fu Mingyao. He did not elaborate.
There are slated to be at least two more J-31 demonstrations at the show, Avic officials said.
China hopes the J-31 will compete with the U.S.-made F-35 stealth aircraft as China works to strengthen its standing as an arms producer, according to China military watchers and state media reports.
"Experts predict that the J-31 will make rapid inroads in the international market in the future, and will undoubtedly steal the limelight from the F-35," the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily reported on its website in August 2013.
It said the aircraft would be particularly attractive to countries that are cut off from U.S. arms exports.
The J-31 is about the same size as the F-35, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a report this year.
Stealth aircraft are key for China's air force to evolve from a mostly territorial air force to developing the ability to carry out both offensive and defensive operations, the Pentagon said in the report about developments in China's military.
The J-31 is China's second domestically produced stealth fighter. Analysts say development of stealth aircraft enable China to better project its power as it takes on a more assertive stance in the East China and South China seas.
President Xi Jinping has been pushing to strengthen China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces.
Obama, attending an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in Beijing, is due to meet Xi on Wednesday.

Jammu West PDP candidate release own electionmanifestoPrint
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: November 11, 2014 5:20 pm
Call it an attempt to avoid controversial Kashmir centric issues in pre-dominantly Hindu inhabited areas of Jammu, or its strategy to rake up local issues constituency-wise so as to woo electorate in the forthcoming assembly polls, a senior Peoples Democratic Party leader and its candidate for Jammu West constituency, Sarv Daman Bhasin, on Tuesday came up with his own election manifesto for the people of the area.
Significantly, while the PDP is yet to release its election manifesto for the state even when first phase of polling in 15 assembly constituencies falling in Ladakh, besides part of Valley and adjoining Jammu region is fixed for November 25, the Jammu West constituency is going to polls in the fifth phase on December 20.
Dhaman, who described it his written “vision document” for the people of his constituency, said it also had the approval of the party high command who, too, would be coming up with its own state specific “vision document” soon. A five member committee headed by senior party leader Dr Haseeb Drabu, after taking a feed back from its candidates about the problems facing people in their respective constituencies, is in the process of finalizing it, he added.
Admitting that it was the first ever incident of making constituency specific written promises by the candidate of a recognized political party in the state, he said that while PDP will be working for overall development of all the three regions of the state and its people, he was only spelling out his priorities for the constituency once he was elected by the people. All the contesting candidates will be making various promises to people of their constituencies apart from their respective party manifestoes, he only has made those promises in writing, he added.
The PDP, who had withdrawn support pulling down Ghulam Nabi Azad government ahead of time in the protest against allotment of land in South Kashmir Himalayas to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board in 2008, is trying to make inroads in pre-dominantly Hindu inhabited areas of Jammu region. During the 2008 assembly polls, the people annoyed with PDP, Congress and National Conference opposition to the allotment of land to Amarnath Shrine Board, had elected the highest ever 11 BJP candidates to the Legislative Assembly.

Aligarh Muslim University in controversy over denying library access to UG students  VC rejects sexist approachchargePrint
By: Press Trust of India | Aligarh | Posted: November 11, 2014 4:52 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:13 pm
The Aligarh Muslim University vice chancellor on Tuesday came under attack over his controversial remarks regarding the access of undergraduate girls to a varsity library with HRD Minister Smriti Irani having termed the matter an “insult to daughters”.
AMU VC Zameer Uddin Shah courted controversy as he turned down a demand of students of the varsity’s Women’s College for access to its main library, saying there would be “more boys” in the library if girls were allowed there.
Taking a strong view of the matter, Irani said, “There are some reports which hurt you as a woman and also agitate you that when we attained freedom there was a belief that education and constitutional rights were same for all… And now we get reports that amounts to an insult to daughters.”
Joining the chorus of disapproval over Shah’s comment, Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah said his statement was “appalling” even as the new MoS in the Ministry, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, averred that such remarks are “in bad taste and not acceptable in a civilised society”.
“I do find it appalling, especially on the day of Maulana Azad’s birth anniversary… 62 years ago, Azad focussed on girls’ education… I am really surprised. This day, somebody talks like that as the head of an institution, it is shocking,” Heptullah said.
The AMU has cited space constraints for not allowing access to the library to the said students while refuting the charge of having a “sexist approach”. But Heptullah said that the vice chancellor should take steps for expanding the library so that more girls can be accommodated.
Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said, “Prohibiting somebody from going (to the library) is not right. Arrangements should be made so that all students can go to the library.”
Terming Shah’s statement as “regressive and antediluvian”, National Commission for Women chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam wondered if it was “legal for them (AMU) to bar any student from accessing such services in a university”.
All India Democratic Women’s Association general secretary Jagmati Sangwan termed Shah’s statement ‘unfortunate’ and called for action against people making such remarks.
Reactions also poured in from corporates with Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar Shaw saying in a tweet, “AMU’s Curbs on Women Using Library is a slur on system”.
Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti also criticised the decision, saying it reflected “anti-women mentality” of the university authority.
“Restricting entry of girl students in library of a Central university reflects that the university authority maintains anti-women mentality,” said the Minister of State for Food Processing Industries while talking to reporters in Lucknow.
“Women of all sections of the society have freedom to get educated and progress. They should get equal opportunity,” she said.

report from Reuters.Global banks prepare for un-level playing field
LONDON (Reuters) - Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) plans to cut up to 100 retail branches in 2015, or 8 percent of its network, to help save $400 million a year to improve profitability.
The bank is under pressure to improve performance after three profit warnings this year and a 30-percent plunge in its shares, and is holding three days of meetings with investors in Hong Kong to spell out its plans.
"We recognize our recent performance has been disappointing and are determined to get back on to a trajectory of sustainable, profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital," Finance Director Andy Halford said in slides accompanying his presentation to investors.
Ten years of record earnings for Standard Chartered came to an abrupt halt in summer 2012 when it had to pay $667 million for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. It has since been hit by a surging bad debts in key markets such as China and India.
Standard Chartered said in its slides that returns at its retail bank were being held back by high costs and that it aimed to cut 80-100 branches, out of 1,248 it had at the end of June.
Halford said the bank was aware of investor concerns, including whether its cost cutting plans went far enough and whether its capital was high enough. He also acknowledged their concerns over a rise in bad debts and non-performing loans and whether management was doing enough to tackle problems.
"We understand and are responding to the challenges we are facing. You will see further progress in 2015," he said.
The slides said the bank aimed to increase assets under management in its wealth management and private banking businesses by 10 percent or more next year, from $66 billion and $56 billion, respectively, at the end of June.
It is also aiming to get more out of its corporate finance bankers. It wants that business to show a 10 percent or more increase in deals and a similar rise in revenues from its eight priority markets and in revenues per banker.
In retail, where Standard Chartered has more than 10 million customers in 34 countries, it plans to put more focus on its 1.6 million priority retail customers and 400,000 business clients.
At 0553 EDT, Standard Chartered shares were little changed.

Dictating the culinary choices of students
Janaki Nair
universities and colleges
With a new government led by Narendra Modi in place, the ‘Bharatiya Sanskriti Rakshaks’ have been emboldened to demand separate vegetarian mess in institutions of higher education
A recent attempt to revive culinary segregation, reportedly among the well-fed denizens of institutions of technical learning, with the endorsement of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), is designed to control what students eat on campus. In response to the anguished plea purportedly by some parents of youngsters who join IITs, IIMs and medical schools across the country, the MHRD has thought fit to ask these august institutions to report as to what steps they are taking to safeguard Bharatiya sanskriti (Indian culture).
The immediate provocation is what the complainants — one being Shankarlal Satendra Kumar Jain, speaking on behalf of parents — call the propagation of Paschyatik sanskriti (western culture) through the sly introduction of eggs, meat and fish into the diets of the hard-working students who make it to these institutions (at least one complaint has come from Kota, Rajasthan, which hosts the academic centres that prepare students to crack the tough entrance exams to these institutions).
In a letter sent to several institutions of higher learning, the ‘Bharatiya Sanskriti Rakshak’ as the group describes itself, claims that previous complaints to the MHRD fell on deaf ears, and met with the response: “IITs, etc are institutions of learning, not for [saving] religion.” With the new government led by Narendra Modi in place, the ‘Bharatiya Sanskriti Rakshaks’ have been emboldened to demand separate vegetarian mess in these halls of learning.
‘Meatarian cuisines’ not western
We know too well that “meatarian cuisines” (a term coined by social activist and academic Kancha Ilaiah) are no western imposition. It calls for a high degree of wilful ignorance on the part of Indians to make such an assertion.
The Kodavas’ famed love for pork (and rum), even at weddings, may make the Rakshaks shudder, but most wedding guests are happy eating it. The Nairs and Chettiars; Mangaloreans and Kurubas; Nadars (Hindu and Christian) and Gowdas; even the Gowd Saraswats are no closet ‘meatarians’. Enough said.
But here is incontrovertible evidence from K.S. Singh’s painstaking and meticulous Peoples of India project: “In spite of the higher value attached to vegetarianism, only about 20 per cent of [Indian] communities are vegetarian. There are vegetarians who eat eggs, fertilised or non-fertilised. There are also vegetarians who abstain from onion and avoid garlic. Men are mostly non-vegetarian; women consume alcohol in a number of communities. Smoking is common, chewing of tobacco and the use of snuff is also very widespread, and the chewing of betel is common in several communities.” He concluded: “We are, therefore, largely a drinking, smoking and meat-eating people.”
It is the dangerous ignorance of what happens, and is supposed to happen, in universities that is of more interest here. For some time now, feminists, among others, have made efforts to point out that a university is not, and cannot, be a family. It is structured precisely to encourage critical thinking about naturalised spaces such as the family, about such ascribed categories such as caste and religion. There is much learning in universities and institutes of higher education but, equally important, there is much unlearning too — of habits, of attitudes, of stereotypes and of prejudices — as students of all castes, tribes, regions, languages and sexualities mingle, in the process learning tolerance for others.
Cultivating tolerance
Tolerance is not just a passive putting up with but an active acceptance of, and engagement with, difference. This is why legions of students, in different parts of the country accept the imposition of one regional cuisine as a culinary limitation of their mess cooks, rather than as a perpetration of violence on their food cultures. They realise that new institutional spaces fashion whole new ways of being. So many students set aside their taste for mustard sauce, fermented fish, coconut gravies, and goat head curry until they can go home to satisfy their taste buds.
It is striking that the call for the “separate” mess comes a full circle from a century ago, though emerging at a very different point. In the early twentieth century in the princely state of Mysore, for instance, caste-based hostels were established as a way of ensuring greater inclusion of those previously excluded from institutions of elementary and higher education.
Adi Karnatakas, Lingayats, Kurubas and Vokkaligas were able to enter schools and colleges in the big towns only because of the sectarian hostels in these places. The preservation of their distinctive food cultures was the premise on which families allowed attendance at school. (They still retained some injunctions against women’s education).
We have travelled a long way from those days: our democratic republic carved out a new space in the university system, through which new futures could be imagined. After a brief interregnum of communal dining, are we returning to a newly secularised caste order? And is it just a co-incidence that this call comes at a time when we may be justifiably proud of the greatest achievement of all: namely, that our students and faculty members are finally reflecting the complex mix of tribe, caste, region, religion, gender, and sexuality that constitutes our democratic republic?
There are clearly many reasons to urgently educate the petitioners, especially since their ignorance contradicts the other current move to ensure a requisite level of patriotic pride in the (largely imagined) ancient past while striving to achieve global rankings. Even Ayurveda, with which our present Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan is so enamoured, is replete with ‘meatarian’ recipes: anthropologist Francis Zimmermann reminds us that Ayurveda sanctions the use of deceit, if necessary, to urge those who are hesitant to eat meat for therapeutic purposes.
Will institutions capitulate to the new demand? Will the petitioners next demand information about the food habits of the teachers, and staff and whether they are of a satvik or a tamasik quality? We don’t know yet, but if they do, it will be an aggressive assault on civilisational values, and not their protection.

TOPICS
Telugu cinema
‘Naa Bangaru Talli’ deals with trafficking but is an entertaining thriller fit for a family audience, say Sunita Krishnan and Rajesh Touchriver
Naa Bangaru Talli is a film not many had heard of before the announcement of National Awards this year. The film bagged the National Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu for 2013, its lead actress Anjali Patil (more popular now as Fanny from Finding Fanny) received a special mention from the jury and music director Shantanu Moitra received the National Award for Best Background Score.
For director Rajesh Touchriver and producer Sunita Krishnan, the awards should have made the distribution of the yet-unreleased film a cakewalk. It didn’t.
Crowd funding
Sunita, who spearheads the organisation Prajwala that works relentlessly to rescue women and children from sex trafficking, had nothing more to stake.
“We approached different producers and since they didn’t show interest, we funded it ourselves. I lost a lot of things I owned, including my house. I didn’t have anything else I could stake. So we went in for crowd funding,” she says.
Naa Bangaru Talli is scheduled to release on November 21 and the team is beaming. “Many distributors told us they liked the film but weren’t willing to back it for release. We had no star in our film,” Rajesh recalls.
The film narrates the true story of a father and daughter whom Sunita encountered through her work. “This story is an example of truth being stranger than fiction,” says Sunita.
Rajesh looked around for an actress who could play the protagonist. “There are hardly any Telugu speaking girls in the Telugu film industry. We have actresses from Kerala, Tamil Nadu or the North. Most of them are here to become stars and their fee was beyond our budget. I sought help from a friend who is a professor at the National School of Drama. He suggested Anjali Patil who then had done Delhi in a Day. This was before she had done Prakash Kha’s Chakravyuh,” he says.
The film was shot in Rajahmundry, in both Telugu and Malayalam. The Malayalam version Ente opened to critical acclaim.
Rajesh and Sunita describe Naa Bangaru Talli as a thriller fit to be watched by a family audience. “Films on trafficking could be dark and depressing. But this one isn’t,” he says. To some extent, this had to do with Sunita. “I am a movie buff and watch films first day first show; but I don’t like art films. In fact, I couldn’t sit through Piravi, one of Rajesh’s early Malayalam films,” she says.
Not an art film
Sunita was clear that if she was using cinema as a tool to talk about trafficking, it will have to be in a format accessible to masses. “It has to be entertaining, offering a transformative experience. The credit goes to Rajesh for translating this powerful and complicated story into an entertaining thriller,” she says.
She has watched Nagesh Kukunoor’s Lakshmi and Pradeep Sarkar’s Mardaani and says, “Mardaani dealt with the criminal side to trafficking whereas we have a human relationship story.”
Eight international awards and three national awards came as rewards to the challenges they faced while making the film. “In the last 20 years, one has been working with a mission to make the world safe for women and children. Through my work, I’ve been able to make a few thousands or lakhs of people aware if the problem. Cinema is a great tool to reach a much wider audience. I knew nothing about filmmaking; I didn’t realise it would be a greater challenge to release the film. We threw the film back at the universe and the universe conspired beautifully to make it happen through crowd funding,” she smiles.

Will RBI succumb under pressure to cut ratesMahesh Nayak      Follow @MaheshNayak    Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 09:39 IST

Mahesh Nayak
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hasn't been obliging the market with a rate cut. In September, when all ingredients were in place for a rate cut, the RBI didn't lower rates and made it clear that it's not going to bite the bullet unless it sees inflation at comfortable levels, especially food inflation. The RBI has set consumer price index (CPI) target for January 2015 at 8 per cent and 6 per cent for January 2016. With CPI falling for the past four months and at 6.46 per cent for September, the RBI in its policy announcement on December 2 could cut rates.
The rate cut could be due to the pressure from the government who wants the RBI to ease monetary policy to boost growth. Captains of corporate India too have been vocal that high interest rates are hurting their business and growth. Last week, HSBC Services PMI data was disappointing with the data falling on the back of weaker growth in the new business orders. The data fell to 50 in October 2014 from 51.6 in September 2014. A level above 50 shows an expansion.
There are reports that the government will set inflation targets for the RBI. This is bad news if the RBI is dictated by the government, but it would be an appropriate time for the RBI to cut rates for accelerating India's growth engine. Why the RBI would be in a comfortable position to cut rates is because of a sharp fall in global crude oil prices, which was not anticipated a few months back. Global crude oil prices have dropped from $110 per barrel to $82 per barrel last week. Second, gold prices also have lost ground, falling to a four-year low . The fall in commodity prices is a big positive for markets and a stable rupee that is hovering around Rs 60-62 against the dollar augurs level for India, giving the RBI the comfort to consider a rate cut.
Meanwhile, this week the market will keep a close eye on macro-economic data starting with the Index of Industrial Production for September on Wednesday. For August, IIP was at 0.4 per cent. On Wednesday, the government will also announce CPI data for October. The market expects the CPI to surge to 7.15 per cent. For September, CPI was at 6.46. On Friday, the government will announce WPI data for October. The market sees inflation to rise to 3.79 per cent for October, compared to 2.38 per cent for September.
Quarterly results of Tata Steel, BPCL, Cipla, DLF, Hindalco Industries, Tata Motors, BHEL, ONGC, SBI and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries will also be in focus. The week would also see some action in stocks that would move in and out of the MSCI India index. The changes will come on effect on November 25. Some of the stocks like AIA Engineering, CMC, Federal Bank, City Union Bank, Prism Cement, Reliance Capital and Sintex Industries will be included in the MSCI Global Small Cap Index.

Bang & Olufsen aims to build technology products you won t need to trade in0
A. What’s really interesting about the Apple conversation is that, when Steve Jobs wrote his autobiography, he talked about two brands very specifically. He talked about the Museum of Modern Art, and he talked about Bang & Olufsen as the company that he wanted to model Apple after, in terms of beautifully functioning products. Of course Bang & Olufsen products have all the technical specifications, but they’re emotionally appealing. There’s something soulful about them.
Q. And Apple took its inspiration for the iPod from a Bang & Olufsen phone with a wheel scroll.
A. Exactly. When you think about the sleekness and the thinness of the iPhone and the tactile nature, those were things that Bang & Olufsen has been doing for 89 years. When the company was started in 1925, technology was just technology, and design was just design. The founders of this company put the two concepts together — something that was quite unheard of at that time.
Q. You’ve said Bang & Olufsen has an open, collaborative approach to innovation as opposed to some of its competitors’ closed approach. How does your approach work?
A. Bang & Olufsen works with a wide range of outside designers. That gives us more visibility on what’s happening outside our own four walls. Other electronics brands have an in-house staff of a thousand designers that are coming up with this and that in a very insular way.
Innovation sometimes is perceived as trickery and gimmicks. When you see new products being introduced into the market just because it’s time to introduce something new, that’s not at all how Bang & Olufsen operates. Our products are virtually evergreen, and as a result, we spend much, much more time in the design and the ideation and the testing phase than most other brands in our field because we are not under pressure to crank out 50 products a year. We’re under pressure to crank out a game-changing product. How often is a new iPhone coming out? As a consumer, what is your perception of that?
Q. It seems weekly — what do you think?
A. That’s my point. Are you releasing just because you have to release something? Or is what you’re releasing something that you feel endures for 10 or 15 years? Our products live in people’s homes. They don’t become technology-stale in a year or two. The design of our products needs to be timeless.
Q. Bang & Olufsen recently has begun unveiling its redesigned, sensory-experience stores. Yet last year the company closed 125 of its shops in Europe.
A. The closures had a very positive impact on the business because we were able to gain more customers in these fantastic experience stores as we transition them from the stores that maybe weren’t up to our new guidelines.
Q. Will Chicago get one of these new stores anytime soon?
A. You will have to stay tuned.
Q&As are edited for length and clarity.

PM Modi grows skill set in Cabinet reshufflePM Narendra Modi adds new talent to squad in Cabinet reshuffle
Kumar Vikram     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 09:34 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
A celebration of talent marked Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's much-awaited overhaul of his Council of Ministers on Sunday. The 21 new faces in Modi's team featured a Harvard MBA, a man who began as a plumber and worked his way up, two PhDs, an Olympic silver medallist, a chartered accountant and a trained pilot. The strength of the Council of Ministers went up from 45 to 66, with 27, including the Prime Minister, of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with independent charge and 26 Ministers of State. The Modi overhaul didn't ignore political imperatives either.
Ministers were sworn in from major states where Assembly elections are due in the next two years: Bihar, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. Modi's politics is tending to getting broadbased and this was reflected in a Dalit face each from Punjab and Haryana. Modi also addressed the labels of 'insipid' and 'talent crunch' that the Cabinet sworn in on May 26 had drawn from critics.
Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena kept away from the swearing-in ceremony, apparently incensed at being offered only one junior ministerial post in the form of Anil Desai, who was promptly recalled. Thackeray later vented at a press meet, also conveying his displeasure at Suresh Prabhu's induction into the Cabinet and threatening a Sena in the Opposition benches of the Maharashtra Assembly if the BJP leaned on Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party.
Portfolios were announced late on Sunday well after the swearing-in ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan. The big changes were defence to former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar , and railways to former Sena leaderturned-BJP member Suresh Prabhu. Former Congress leader from Haryana Birender Singh was given charge of rural development, panchayati raj and drinking water, held by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari after the unfortunate death of BJP's Maharashtra strongman Gopinath Munde. Major demotions included D.V. Sadananda Gowda who lost railways to Suresh Prabhu, Ravi Shankar Prasad who lost the law ministry to Gowda but retained telecom, Dr Harsh Vardhan who lost health and family welfare to J.P. Nadda but was moved to Science and Technology as a possible first step towards being the chief ministerial face in the BJP's upcoming Delhi Assembly campaign and Prakash Javadekar who lost Information and Broadcasting to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
First-time MPs who were rewarded include Jayant Sinha who has become a junior minister in the finance ministry and Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore who has been similarly placed in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
The new-look Modi Cabinet is a mix of ability and experience. Leaders like Manohar Parrikar and Jayant Sinha are IIT graduates but they also have strong political backgrounds. And there is Suresh Prabhu, whose skills as an administrator were recognised by none other than Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
TRACK RECORD
Others who bring in dollops of experience and a proven track record of organisational skill are J.P. Nadda, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, and Ram Kripal Yadav.
Parrikar, an alumnus of IIT-Bombay, was tipped to take over as the next defence minister, though there was also buzz that he could be given charge of the home ministry, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh moving to defence. Jayant Sinha, the son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, studied at IIT-Delhi and Harvard in the US. Given his background that also includes a substantial stint with McKinsey and Company, the buzz was that he could be given the post of Minister of State in the Finance Ministry.
Similarly, Prabhu has been appointed as Modi's ' lead sherpa' to assist the Prime Minister at the upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane. He had built a reputation of being a reformer as power minister in the Vajpayee government.
Dr Mahesh Sharma, the BJP MP from Gautam Buddh Nagar Lok Sabha seat, was inducted into the Cabinet despite being a firsttime MP. He has served as an MLA in Uttar Pradesh and is an established doctor in the Noida region.
Singer-turned-politician Babul Supriyo, who represents Asansol constituency of West Bengal, was also given the status of Minister of State and given urban development. Hansraj Ahir, among the first to expose the coal scam, was sworn-in as Minister of State and given chemicals and fertilizers.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy, making a comeback, was sworn in as a Minister of State with independent charge. The commercial pilot has been general secretary of the BJP and proved his organisation skills in the recent Maharashtra Assembly polls.
The 53-year-old Nadda is known for organising time management workshops for BJP workers and prefers to work behind the scenes. Along with Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, he is known to be part of the group of leaders that makes all major decisions in the party and is expected to act as a bridge between the party and the government.
While selecting names for the first expansion of his council of ministers, Modi tried to balance regional and caste considerations. Keeping in mind Assembly elections in Bihar next year, RJD rebel Ram Kripal Yadav was inducted with the aim of wooing the sizeable Yadav votebank in Bihar. Other representatives from Bihar were Rudy and Giriraj Singh. Singh, slammed for his controversial comment asking Modi's critics to move to Pakistan, represents the powerful Bhumihar community. He is a first-time minister.
Chaudhary Birendra Singh, a prominent Jat leader from Haryana, was inducted to give representation to the state. Supriyo is one of two BJP MPs from West Bengal, where the party hopes to make a dent in state polls in 2016. Representation from Rajasthan, where BJP won all 25 seats in the Lok Sabha polls, went up from one to three with the inclusion of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Sanwar Lal Jat.
STATES
Several states got greater representation through the new faces, including UP (Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Mahesh Sharma), Gujarat (Mohanbhai Kalyanjibhai Kundariya), Andhra Pradesh (Y.S. Chowdary) and Telangana (Bandaru Dattatreya).
The new selections for the council of ministers bore the distinct stamp of the RSS. Many of the new ministers, including Parrikar and Nadda, have deep roots in the BJP's ideological mentor.
A new minister making waves is Vijay Sampla, who worked as a plumber in Saudi Arabia. Similarly, the only woman to be included in today's exercise was Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti. The saffron-robed 47-year-old was sworn in as a minister of state.
The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Vice President Hamid Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson P.J. Kurien, Modi and his Cabinet colleagues, BJP president Amit Shah and party patriarch L.K. Advani. Chief Ministers of BJPruled states like Vasundhara Raje, Raman Singh, Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP were present, No one from the Congress attended the ceremony.

Pizza Hut Launches Curry Crust PizzaPizza Hut launches curry crust pizza amid revamp
Katie Little CNBC
Pizza Hut
Pizza Hut is getting amenu makeover.
The new menu includes 10 new crusts, such as honey sriracha, and themed ones like "Get Curried Away;" sauce additions like garlic Parmesan; and premium ingredients, including fresh spinach and cherry peppers harvested from the Peruvian highlands. Customers can add curry flavor to the pizza crusts and select from four "drizzles," including balsamic and buffalo.
There will also be "skinny" pizzas for the calorie-conscious.
The world's biggest pizza chain launches the new menu nationwide Nov. 19.
"Today's consumer is always looking for new flavors," chief marketing officer Carrie Walsh said during a phone interview.
Pizza Hut found customers wanted more customization and mashups of flavors, similar to what's available on the trendy food truck scene.
They also wanted lower-calorie pizza. A recent test of "skinny" versions proved successful enough that the brand has decided to expand them nationwide.
Diners can choose to customize their pizzas with a skinny crust or order one of five new Pizza Hut skinny creations, which clock in at 250 calories or fewer per slice and feature a thinner crust.
Gone are the old Pizza Hut logo and box to modernize the 56-year old chain. Workers will also get a new look, ditching the former polo shirts and khakis in favor of jeans and t-shirts.
"I definitely see it as more of a proactive step in pushing the category to new places," Walsh said. She admits some of the flavors "push the envelope."

Panel to Meet on Tuesday to Decide on Coal Reserve Price: ReportGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: An inter-ministerial panel is likely to meet on Tuesday to discuss the methodology for fixing reserve price for auction of coal blocks.
The committee, comprising Secretaries of the ministries of finance, power, steel, law, mines, petroleum, industrial policy and promotion, and coal, is to decide on the auction start price or reserve price for allotting coal blocks whose allocation was cancelled by the Supreme Court recently, sources said.
The government had in 2012 constituted an IMC to consider and examine the formulation of methodology for fixing floor/reserve price of coal blocks to be allocated through auction.
Based on recommendations of consultant Crisil, it proposed allotting coal blocks only to government companies or to power plants with tariff-based bidding, to ensure that the benefit of cheaper domestic coal is passed on to consumers.
However, after the Supreme Court cancelled allocation of 204 coal blocks in September, it was felt that there would be many existing power plants, which were linked to these mines, or power plants, which have no tie-up for coal and would either have cost-plus power purchase agreements (where tariff is fixed by power regulator) or would have contracted agreements to sell electricity on the basis of bid tariff.
Sources said it was felt that the methodology decided by the IMC previously needs to be reopened and a new one be adopted.
The Supreme Court had on September 24 cancelled allocation of 204 coal blocks to various companies between 1993 and 2009. Out of these, 37 are running coal mines and another five are ready to produce by April.
Sources said the government wants to clear all roadblocks and meet conditions precedent for the new owner of the mines, which will be decided through an e-auction, to takeover operations of the 42 mines from April next year.
The 37 running mines produced about 38.14 million tonnes of coal in 2013-14, while the five others are likely to chip in with another 5.85 million tons.
Keen to avoid any supply disruption, the government on October 21 promulgated an ordinance to revert half of these 42 mines to the government entities that were the original allottees. The remaining 21 will be put on auction in the first phase of bidding that will be open for end users in power, cement and steel sectors.
If the winner of these 21 mines is different than the one already operating, the existing owner will be paid compensation and operations handed over to the winner, they said.

ABB sees big opportunity in renewable energy sector
V Rishi Kumar
Madhav Vemuri, Country Service Manager, ABB India Ltd. - PV SIVAKUMAR
Looks to push solar water pumps
Hyderabad, November 10:  
Power and automations solutions company ABB is eyeing the renewable energy sector in the country with its range of products and integrated solutions.
Madhav Vemuri, Country Services Manager, ABB India, said several States in the country are facing power deficit and seeking to bridge the deficit by setting up new power projects and installing solar photovoltaic units, both grid connected and away from grids. They are also taking to solar water power pumps.
Vemuri, who was here to take part in an energy summit held recently, told BusinessLine that demand for solar water pumps is growing in States which are seeking to empower farmers to energise pump sets in remote locations.
Demonstrating how solar pumps function in isolation and provide hassle-free experience to farmers, Vemuri said various solutions developed by ABB, such as pump drives and panels that help manage these pumps, enable farmers to even manage them remotely using mobile applications.
Referring to the renewable energy segment, he said ABB is a key player in the segment working with various players in the solar, wind and hydro power generation sector. Their products include inverter systems, electrical balancing of plant and local networks.
Government push
The use of solar-powered pump sets is being advocated by the Central and several State Governments as they would be able to provide water where there is no power line, and also in places where there is inadequate supply. The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Governments are especially encouraging setting up solar pumps.
Most of the remotely located pump sets use diesel generation sets, which are very expensive. Therefore, it is a lot more attractive to set up solar units, Vemuri said.
Energy efficiency
On the energy efficiency initiatives taken by the energy-intensive units in the country such as cement, paper and pulp industry, he said ABB is working with several large companies in India to improve efficiencies through automation. The savings brought about by using new technology solutions are quantifiable for companies.
The consumption of energy could be brought down significantly, he added. With the Government, the Confederation of Indian Industry and various players in the manufacturing sectors seeking to improve efficiency and working in a collaborative manner, Vemuri felt energy efficiency is getting into a mission mode.

Draft Note Floated on Relaxing FDI in Medical Devices: ReportGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: The Commerce and Industry Ministry has circulated a draft Cabinet note for inter-ministerial comments on liberalising foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in medical devices.
The government is looking at relaxing the policy for the cash-starved medical devices sector to attract more investments and boost domestic manufacturing, sources said.
"After the ministry receives comment from all the concerned departments and ministries, the DIPP (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) would prepare the final note for consideration of the Cabinet," they said.
The medical devices sector currently falls under the pharmaceutical category and is accordingly subjected to FDI limits and other conditions, such as the mandatory government approvals.
Government allows 100 per cent FDI in pharma sector. While FDI is permitted through automatic route in the case of greenfield investment or new venture, approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) is required in the case of brownfield or in existing companies. Besides, there are several other riders also.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry wants to put the sector under automatic approval route, they added.
FDI in medical devices sector is permitted through the government-approval route and the industry has been demanding that it be put under the automatic route.
"India badly needs FDI in medical devices and equipment sector. The industry is not modern and there is no threat of mergers and acquisitions from multi-national firms as domestic companies are not big unlike drug firms. So it should not be subjected to FDI limits and other restrictions," sources added.
As per estimates, India imports about 70 per cent of its requirement of medical devices. The industry size is about $7 billion in the country.
Medical devices include wide range of products such as sutures, implants and surgical instruments.

Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, who unveiled a draft policy on civil aviation today, said the government will list state-run Airports Authority of India and Pawan Hans in the next six months. He also signaled that loss-making national carrier Air India may be privatised in future.
Here is your 10-point cheat-sheet about the draft aviation policy:
The listing of Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans on stock exchanges will improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said today.
State-run AAI manages 125 airports across the country. Among them are 11 international and 81 domestic airports. It also owns stake in some of the country's premium airports located in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
Pawan Hans, one of Asia's largest helicopter companies, has a fleet of 47 helicopters. The government owns 51 per cent stake in the company, the remaining 49 per cent is owned by another state-run company ONGC.
Pawan Hans provides helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations. It also provides charter services for promotion of tourism.
Both AAI and Pawan Hans are profitable companies. During 2013-14, AAI reported a profit of Rs 796 crore. AAI is expected to double its net profit for the current fiscal year to more than Rs 1,400 crore, sources said. Pawan Hans reported a net profit of Rs 11.70 crore during 2012-13.
Mr Raju said it is essential to ensure that Air India achieves its full potential. To achieve this, the government had decided to form an expert committee, which will decide on privatisation or other solutions, the minister said. For 2013-13 fiscal year, Air India reported a net loss of Rs 5,389 crore.
The government will also review the 5/20 guideline. The archaic rule makes it mandatory for a carrier to have 5 years of domestic flying experience and 20 aircraft to become eligible to fly on international routes.
Mr Raju said he will intensify efforts to get states to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which currently ranges between 4-35 per cent. Jet fuel constitutes over 40 per cent of an airline's operating costs.
The draft policy entails measures to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode (public-private partnership) and improve passenger facilitation.
The civil aviation policy is expected to come into force early next year after consultations are done and an approval from the Union Cabinet is in place.

Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants. ( Mary Ellen Podmolik )
The proposal, named the Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance, would require building owners who want to sell their properties to take one of three routes to dispose of them. They can negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days to try to find a buyer who would maintain the building’s affordable status for 15 years. If that kind of transaction falls through, the owner has 120 days to try to sell the building to any buyer and if no sale occurs, the owner must again try and sell the building to an owner who would maintain it as affordable.
Or, an owner can bypass that entire process if he deposits into an SRO preservation fund a sum that amounts to $20,000 for each unit in the building.

Displaced tenants who lived in a building for at least 32 consecutive days would receive $2,000 to $8,600 in one-time relocation assistance, depending on the circumstances. A tenant who has to move because of unsafe building conditions would be entitled to $10,600 in relocation assistance.
Representatives of SRO building owners complained Monday during testimony at the committee meeting that the city is unfairly singling them out for tougher regulations than other landlords.
Some fair housing advocates meanwhile testified the plan makes it too inexpensive for real estate developers to get rid of affordable housing in neighborhoods like Uptown that have long been battlegrounds for gentrification.
The most recent draft of the proposed law would not apply to building owners who had sought city permits before June 25 for demolition or conversion to market-rate housing. The tweaked proposal also gives owners a year to formally close on the sale of a building. Also, the proposal more specifically states that preservation fees collected under the ordinance could be tapped to offer forgivable loans to rehab existing SROs or grants to prospective buyers who want to maintain the buildings as affordable housing.
Housing advocates estimate that Chicago has lost more than 2,200 rooms of housing for very low- and low-income residents during the past three years. In July, the Chicago City Council passed a six-month moratorium on the issuance of any building permits tied to the conversion or demolition of SRO buildings while aldermen devised rules governing redevelopment of the buildings.

A Chinese General s View on Whether China Is a Challenge to Americareddit
According to Thucydides, an Ancient Greek historian and author of "History of the Peloponnesian War," the rise of a big power is usually accompanied by a mortal war against the ruling power. It was the rise of Athenian power and the fear it inspired in Sparta that ultimately made the Peloponnesian War inevitable. That is the "Thucydides' Trap" people have been worrying about.
Recent studies by Harvard University scholars also indicate that since 1500, 11 of 15 cases of power transition between rising and ruling powers ended in war.
Why will China's rapid progress and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation transcend the historical fatalism of the "Thucydides' Trap"? Why is it possible for rising China and the present-day world's sole superpower, the United States, to avoid an all-round showdown in the form of war?
This is not the outcome of China's one-sided benign wishes. Nor is it the outcome of the mercy and benevolence of the hegemonic United States. The essential changes in the conditions of our time make it possible for the transition of power between China and U.S. to be peaceful. And it has to be peaceful.
NEW REALITIES
There are two unprecedented realities in our time: The first significant reality is that, in contrast to the mutually isolating and antagonistic relations between big powers in the past, globalization has deepened the mutual interests of countries. This is particularly true of those of the major powers which are increasingly interdependent.
The global village is increasingly becoming a community of common destiny. The development of all countries are closely interconnected. One country's gain may not necessarily be others.' But one country's loss will definitely not just be its own.
Though China's progress has inspired fear of the decline of American hegemony, the United States has at the same time pinned its hopes on China's tremendous market in order to escape its economic crisis.
Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and famous scholar Joseph Nye wrote in a recent article that the increase in contemporary power should be looked at from a "positive sum", rather than "zero sum," perspective.  "There may be times when a more powerful China is good for the U.S. (and for the world)," he wrote.
CHINA NOT CAUSING US DECLINE
The decline of American hegemony is definitely not caused by China. Just as British scholar Arnold Toynbee pointed out, the decline of an empire derives from its excessive outward expansion and worsening internal troubles. Instead of a challenge to the United States, China's development is winning both time and space necessary for the soft-landing of American hegemony.
WAR IS USELESS
The second significant reality of our time is that, thanks to scientific and technological progress, the development of means of war has surpassed the purpose of war. The efficacy of war is on the decline.
As a military superpower, the United States has  world's largest war apparatus. America's stock of weapons of mass destruction alone suffices to destroy humanity dozens of times. And once is enough to annihilate us all.
Despite the considerable gap between Chinese and U.S. militaries, China's existing defense forces and strategic counterstrike capabilities suffice for equivalent destructive counterattacks against any aggressor that seeks to harm its national security and core interests by force.
In spite of its military superiority, the United States has no guarantee that it can escape destruction or unaffordable consequences when attempting to destroy others. It is safe to say there will be no winner in an all-round war between China and the United States.
China's ascent would surely suffer a severe blow.  But it will also be out of question that American hegemony will become a thing of the past. This certainly is not the outcome the Americans want.
Nothing can hold back China's advancement and the nation's rejuvenation. China will continue to grow stronger. But the increase in China's strength constitutes no threat or challenge to any country.
China has neither the interest, nor the need, to fight the United States for hegemony or leadership. China just wants to realize its dream of national rejuvenation, bid farewell to its humiliating modern history, and truly become a country of national strength with harmonious ethnic relations and a happy and content populace.
American suspicions over a stronger China are thus unwarranted. As long as one can abandon historical biases, the mutual opportunities of the broad Pacific can be seen right before one's eyes. The great countries and nations of China and the United States have every reason to avoid facing each other on a collision course, escape the historical fatalism of confrontation between big powers, and to maneuver a win-win scenario together.
Of course, this entails strenuous endeavors by the cool-headed and far-sighted healthy forces on both sides. The Chinese wings of goodwill calls for an American counterpart to fly high.
Peng Guangqian is a Major General and Deputy Secretary-General of China's National Security Forum.

An autobiography and some inconsistenciesUpdated: November 10, 2014 23:48 IST
An autobiography and some inconsistencies
Makarand Waingankar
cricket
In Tendulkar’s memoir, it is the silence that seems to speak the loudest
Indian cricket has seen many ‘boy Bradmans’ over the years who faded away under severe test of senior-level cricket. A curly-haired boy from the maidans of Bombay proved to be the rare exception. Since his performance in the Sportstar Trophy as a thirteen year-old, millions of people have followed his every move.
Sachin Tendulkar, the boy wonder, who cracked the code of batsmanship would finally expound his craft and life in a memoir. After all it was the poetry of his batting that caught the eyes of the world.
Besides, it could not have been easy for a young man playing cricket in a corner of Mumbai to keep his head and heart while immersed in the glamorous and public world of cricket.
Essaying such a narrative would at once have been insightful and inspirational not only for every aspiring ‘Tendulkar’ but connoisseurs as well.
An expectation that is fair considering the colossal career that is magnified not only by statistics but also by being unparalleled in modern cricket — a hundred international centuries and two hundred Test matches in a career of 24 years.
The twist is that there is no tale, at least not the ones we all expected to read.
Greg Chappell may have erred on a few decisions. No coach or captain claim to be perfect.
However, if Chappell did offer him the captaincy ‘a few months before the World Cup,’ should not Tendulkar be duty-bound to report the same to the Chairman of the Selection Committee Dilip Vengsarkar, since it was the prerogative of the Committee to select the captain? Should not Tendulkar have discussed the issue with Rahul Dravid, who was then his partner in international cricket for the 11th season? Instead it is Tendulkar’s autobiography, like a lost post, that has delivered this message to Dravid.
Apparently, Chappell was invited to Tendulkar’s home in the first half of 2006, nearly 10 months before the 2007 World Cup. How can such duration be termed as ‘a few months’? Chappell was accompanied by physiotherapist John Gloster and a conversation ensued over lunch, the context of which is missing from the ‘revelations’ that Tendulkar makes. One gets the impression of a sinister design underlying the Chappell bashing, with disgruntled elements from the team backing Tendulkar’s claims.
Chappell’s home visit does not seem to be the only inconsistency in the memoir. As Tendulkar writes after the Barbados Test match which India lost from a winning position, he was pacified by Kumble and Srinath in his room. An intriguing fact — Srinath had left the tour before the first Test because of shoulder injury. He was in South Africa consulting a doctor when the third Test at Barbados was lost. How could he then have consoled Tendulkar in his room?
Three years of research doesn’t seem to have been sufficient for Tendulkar and perhaps his ghost-writer to the get the facts right. Unfortunately, the focus of the memoir seems to have been to be revealing rather than insightful. Strangely, issues regarding the craft seem secondary to a man who shied away from all controversies throughout his career.
However, even if that was the aim; which seems uncharacteristic of the dignified, and almost diffident, willow-wielder, why has the match-fixing saga, surely Indian cricket’s darkest period, not been dealt with in the book?
At the time of the scandal Tendulkar was an established star of the team. In the memoir, it is the silence that seems to speak the loudest leaving connoisseurs desiring that the gaps be filled like only Sachin Tendulkar could have.

Five things we learned from the FBIs big report on crimeBy Mark Berman November 10 Follow @markberman
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, left, along with FBI Director James Comey, center, and Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole, right. (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency)
The FBI on Monday released its annual report on crime in the United States, giving us a wide-ranging look at a variety of horrible things that happened in the country last year. If you want to know how many people were killed, or how often a car was stolen, or what part of the country recorded the most arrests for selling heroin, this is your kind of read.
Here are five key details in this year’s report, including what the FBI’s new definition of rape means for these statistics.
1. A lot of people were arrested. Most of them were white men.
White men made up a significant majority of the people arrested in the United States last year. A hefty majority of all people arrested were white (68.9 percent), with more than twice as many white people arrested (6.2 million) as black people (2.5 million).
Men, in general, continued to dominate the arrest records kept nationwide. Nearly three-quarters of all people arrested last year  — 73.5 percent — were men. (That is actually down from two decades ago, as men accounted for 80 percent of all arrests in 1995.) Men also made up an even larger percentage of  people arrested for violent crime (79.9 percent), arson (8.03 percent), robbery (86.6 percent), murder and manslaughter (88.3 percent).
Women made up a majority in just one category (prostitution, as women accounted for 67 percent of those arrests). The only other category where women came close to matching the number of men arrested was embezzlement, which was nearly evenly split between men and women (51.6 percent to 48.4 percent).
2. Good news: Fewer people were arrested. Bad news: More minors were arrested in killings.
Overall, the numbers offered some glimmers of hope for society. The number of violent crimes declined, for example, dropping from 1.2 million to 1.1 million in 2013 after inching up a little a year earlier. Murders, robberies, aggravated assaults — all down .
#FBI Uniform #Crime Report released. Figures show reductions in violent & property crimes. http://t.co/jQhQSry2gf pic.twitter.com/nDuXbaa4vn
— FBI (@FBI) November 10, 2014
However, there were some particularly worrisome numbers. Younger people were committing fewer robberies, assaults and burglaries, and overall they were charged with fewer crimes. But the number of people age 17 or younger  who were arrested on murder or manslaughter charges increased to 485 last year from 425 a year earlier. That number also rose for people age 14 or younger, going up to 63 from 47 a year earlier. And this came as the overall number of arrests in murder and manslaughter cases declined ever so slightly (to 6,742 from 6,763 the year before).
3. We are giving up on our addictions to counterfeiting and breaking curfew.
If you look back at the past full five years, the overall number of crimes has solidly dipped to 5.6 million from 6.7 million in 2009. That’s good! There are drops in every category listed here . For example, the number of arrests over forgery and counterfeiting dropped to 25,000 from 35,000 in that period. There are a few unusual numbers, though. Fewer men were arrested in every category (admittedly, men had a head start, given how many of them got arrested each year). Women, meanwhile, showed slight upticks in arson and buying or having stolen property.
The biggest drop overall came in the number of arrests for breaking a curfew or disregarding loitering laws. The number was cut in more than half since 2009, a surefire sign that we are becoming more cognizant and respectful of the dangers of loitering.
4. The average amount stolen during burglaries was $2,322. The average amount stolen during robberies was $1,170. 
Burglaries were apparently much more lucrative than robberies last year. The average value stolen during burglaries was roughly the same whether a home ($2,315) or an office or business ($2,344) was burgled. Robberies, though, offered far less in the way of money taken, with a big exception: banks, where an average of $3,542 was stolen during more than 5,600 robberies.
5. This report uses the FBI’s new definition of rape — but doesn’t know exactly how many sexual offenses were carried out. 
The Justice Department said in 2012 that it would change the FBI’s definition of rape so that it covered more forms of sexual assault and didn’t just cover the rape of women. Rape had been defined since 1929 as “the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will,” but that definition was dropped starting last year. So this is the first installment of the FBI’s crime statistics report to include the new definition.
However, not every state and local agency that feeds into the FBI’s numbers were able to change how they record these kinds of sexual assaults, so some were able to report assaults using only the older definition. The FBI estimates that the number of sexual assaults last year increased by 41.7 percent to 38,250 with the inclusion of the rapes of men and sexual assault with an object, among other things. The bureau came up with this number by looking at sexual offenses (including rapes of men and other kinds of assault) in the National Incident-Based Reporting System. This number “ can be used to generally understand ” how sexual offense statistics are likely to rise, according to the report, at least until the FBI figures out how to determine a representative sample of such assaults.
(And, of course, these are only reported rapes, which means that the number does not reflect the sexual assaults that occur and do not get reported.)

ING Vysya, L&T Finance in Focus on Merger Buzz
NDTV | Updated On: November 11, 2014 15:10 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
ING Vysya Bank shares fell on high volumes on Tuesday after a media report claimed that L&T Finance Holdings has sought approval from the Reserve Bank to acquire the private lender.
In a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange, L&T Finance Holdings termed the report as "speculative", but added that the company keeps evaluating opportunities on both organic and inorganic basis.
L&T Finance Holdings, a non-banking financial company, was among the 24 applicants to apply for a banking licence. However, it lost to IDFC and Bandhan Financial Services when licences were granted earlier this year.
Global brokerage Maybank says if the deal goes through, it will help L&T Finance enter the banking business. However, the transaction is likely to happen at a premium to current market price, it added.
The brokerage says rumors about ING Vysya Bank's takeover have emerged in the past as well, but pointed that the promoter (ING Group) has maintained its stake at nearly 43 per cent.
"The current market cap/branch for ING Vysya Bank is at Rs 24 crore, which is attractive. HDFC Bank had acquired Centurion Bank of Punjab at Rs 24 crore/branch in 2007," the brokerage added.
Maybank has a "buy" on with ING Vysya Bank with a target price of Rs 825.
As of 03.06 p.m., L&T Finance Holdings shares traded 3.2 per cent higher at Rs 72.25, while ING Vysya Bank shares were down 2 per cent lower at Rs 710. The Bank Nifty was up 0.70 per cent.

Kiss of Love  protests rattle Narendra Modi s conservative IndiaLetters to  the editor
A mass-kissing campaign against moral policing in a southern Indian city has swept the country, advertised via Facebook, as urban youngsters challenge a deeply conservative society.
Dozens of ‘Kiss of Love’ activists stole kisses and blocked traffic near a metro station in New Delhi at the weekend, outnumbering a handful of right-wing protesters who see such public displays as a threat to Indian culture.
“It’s not about just kissing,” said 26-year-old research scholar Pankhuri Zaheer, one of the organisers. “It’s about … inter-caste marriages, inter-religious marriages, live-in relationships.”
Minor scuffles broke out between the rival groups as the police steered the rally away from the Delhi office of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a radical group considered the ideological parent of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
The ‘Kiss of Love’ activists shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and affiliated Hindu groups seen as self-appointed moral guardians forcing traditional mores on people with a Western outlook.
Police foiled the initial Nov. 2 protest in southern Kerala state by stopping participants reaching the venue. But the Facebook ‘Kiss of Love’ community page got over 110,000 likes and sparked similar demonstrations in cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.
In Kolkata in eastern India, about 100 university students marched last week, carrying posters saying: “Right to love is our democratic right.”  Another protest is planned in Kerala early next month.
Not everyone is endorsing the campaign on the ‘Kiss of Love’ community page. “Love is a personal thing. Enjoy it and don’t make a drama out of it,” reads a comment by Raghu Sharma.
Modi has not yet commented on the protests.  But a spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, affiliated to his party, said: “Our Indian culture does not permit us displaying such kinds of affection in public spaces.”

Attach no meaning to Modi s meet with LoneLetters to  the editor
Government sought to downplay the meeting that former Kashmiri separatist leader and People’s Conference leader Sajjad Lone had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi here, saying no meaning should be read into it.
“No meaning should be read into Sajjad Lone’s meeting with the Prime Minister,” said Arun Jaitley, Minister for Finance and Information and Broadcasting.
To buttress his point, he told reporters that leaders of every political group in Kashmir have held meetings with the Centre.
Lone met the Prime Minister earlier in the day during which the two are believed to have discussed the possibility of his working with BJP after the upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.
“Did the Chief Minister there or the PDP leaders never meet the Prime Minister? One has to meet up with leaders of political opponents in a democracy also. I find no meaning in this,” Jaitley said.
There is speculation that Lone might align with BJP after the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir starting November 25.
Lone maintained after the meeting that he had apprised the Prime Minister as a Kashmiri about the difficulties being faced by the people of the Valley due to the September floods.
Lone, who is reportedly had many meetings with top BJP leaders, has decided to revive People’s Conference founded by his father Abul Gani Lone, who was killed by Pakistan-based militants, and his party is contesting from 12 seats in Kupwara and Handwara.
BJP has lunched a “mission 44-plus” in J&K to form its own government in the state and if need be seek the support of some smaller parties in the Valley in achieving its goal.

Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) gained on Tuesday despite the Reserve Bank of India tightening rules dealing with bad loan and provisioning norms. Brokerages say most NBFCs already fulfil the new rules announced by the central bank on Monday.
IDFC was up nearly 3 per cent, L&T Finance Holdings gained 2.5 per cent while LIC Housing Finance was up 2.3 per cent. (Also read: Why L&T Finance is up Today)
Shares of SREI Infrastructure Finance and Religare Enterprises fell today.
The central bank has increased the minimum capital requirements and has also reduced the number of days to recognise a loan as bad debt. The new guidelines will be applicable in a phased manner. ( Read full story )
TT Srinivasaraghavan, managing director at Sundaram Finance, told NDTV, "We have already switched to 120 days norms of NPA recognition two years ago and we already have a tier-1 capital of 12 per cent." Shares of Sundaram Finance were up 1.7 per cent.
Morgan Stanley says the new guidelines remove uncertainty and is thus positive for NBFCs, while Credit Suisse says the new rules remove major overhang for NBFCs. However domestic brokerage Kotak said non-performing liabilities may rise sharply but it did not mention any figure.

Digvijay Singh  Nitin Gadkari face-off in courtLetters to  the editor
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Digvijay Singh traded charges in a Delhi court which was hearing a defamation complaint filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader against the veteran Congressman who stood by his statement.
The proceedings began with Gadkari ruling out any possibility of reaching any compromise with Singh, saying he would not withdraw his complaint unless the Congress leader takes back his statement of 2012 on his alleged business links with the then MP Ajay Sancheti.
“I have nothing to do with Sancheti. If he (Singh) knows anything about it and gives any proof, I am ready to give all my shares to him. Otherwise he should take his statement back.
“My reputation is very high. Credibility is the biggest strength of a politician,” Gadkari told Metropolitan Magistrate Gomati Manocha on being asked if there was any possibility for compromise in the matter.
Sticking to his stand, Singh, who has been summoned as an accused in the case, said, “In my life I have never withdrawn my statement”.
The criminal defamation complaint was filed by Gadkari in 2012 against Singh, who had alleged that the former BJP chief had business links with the then MP Ajay Sancheti.
The magistrate had earlier issued bailable warrant against Singh for his failure to appear before it but later on cancelled it after he turned up and gave an undertaking to remain present in the court today.
It had also asked Gadkari to remain present in the court, saying otherwise it would dismiss his complaint.
Suggesting that the two politicians settle the matter, the magistrate said in public life one should rise above all this.
“You should rise above all this otherwise for how long will this go on,” the magistrate said, adding that if they do not want to compromise, the court will proceed with framing notice against the accused.
To this Singh said, the court can go ahead with its proceedings.
During the hearing, Gadkari claimed that not even a single kg of coal has been extracted from the mine so where is the point of earning any profit by Sancheti.
“He (Singh) is talking non-sense,” Gadkari said.
To this Singh asked, “Is (Gadkari) he defending Sancheti? I stand by my statement made earlier.”
The court fixed November 24 for hearing further arguments on the point of framing notice.
During the hearing, senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, who appeared for Singh, argued that no charge was made out against his client as Gadkari had not stated in his statement recorded earlier in the court that he was present in the press conference when such averment was made.
“Gadkari does not say that the statement was made in his presence. No witness and reporter was produced in the court to say that they had heard Singh making such statement or that they recorded it,” the counsel said, adding that the media reports were inadmissible.
Senior advocate Pinky Anand, who appeared for Gadkari, said if Singh says he has not made any statement against the BJP leader, the client would withdraw the complaint.
Singh was earlier granted bail in the case by the court which, after finding “prima facie” evidence against him, had directed him to appear before it as accused for the offence punishable under section 499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the IPC.
It was also alleged in the complaint that Singh had accused Gadkari of pocketing sum to the tune of Rs 490 crore in the coal block allocation to Sancheti.
Gadkari, in his statement recorded in the court, had denied having any business ties with Sancheti and had said that Singh levelled “totally false and defamatory” allegations against him to “give the impression that I have been responsible for allocation of the coal mines” to Sancheti.
The BJP leader, in his petition, had sought Singh’s prosecution under sections 499 and 500 of the IPC.
In his petition, Gadkari had alleged that Singh had levelled defamatory allegations against him to lower his dignity and to malign and tarnish his image.

Jammu West PDP candidate release own election manifestoPrint
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: November 11, 2014 5:20 pm
Call it an attempt to avoid controversial Kashmir centric issues in pre-dominantly Hindu inhabited areas of Jammu, or its strategy to rake up local issues constituency-wise so as to woo electorate in the forthcoming assembly polls, a senior Peoples Democratic Party leader and its candidate for Jammu West constituency, Sarv Daman Bhasin, on Tuesday came up with his own election manifesto for the people of the area.
Significantly, while the PDP is yet to release its election manifesto for the state even when first phase of polling in 15 assembly constituencies falling in Ladakh, besides part of Valley and adjoining Jammu region is fixed for November 25, the Jammu West constituency is going to polls in the fifth phase on December 20.
Dhaman, who described it his written “vision document” for the people of his constituency, said it also had the approval of the party high command who, too, would be coming up with its own state specific “vision document” soon. A five member committee headed by senior party leader Dr Haseeb Drabu, after taking a feed back from its candidates about the problems facing people in their respective constituencies, is in the process of finalizing it, he added.
Admitting that it was the first ever incident of making constituency specific written promises by the candidate of a recognized political party in the state, he said that while PDP will be working for overall development of all the three regions of the state and its people, he was only spelling out his priorities for the constituency once he was elected by the people. All the contesting candidates will be making various promises to people of their constituencies apart from their respective party manifestoes, he only has made those promises in writing, he added.
The PDP, who had withdrawn support pulling down Ghulam Nabi Azad government ahead of time in the protest against allotment of land in South Kashmir Himalayas to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board in 2008, is trying to make inroads in pre-dominantly Hindu inhabited areas of Jammu region. During the 2008 assembly polls, the people annoyed with PDP, Congress and National Conference opposition to the allotment of land to Amarnath Shrine Board, had elected the highest ever 11 BJP candidates to the Legislative Assembly.

Rupee Ends Lower at 61.55 Tracking Broad Dollar Rally

Rupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Mumbai: The rupee weakened for a fourth session in five on Tuesday as the dollar resumed its recent rally while profit-taking at the BSE Sensex failed to provide the local unit much impetus.
The dollar climbed to a seven-year high against the yen on Tuesday after a Japanese government official told Reuters that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was likely to delay a planned sales tax increase.
The index of the dollar against six majors was up 0.2 per cent while most Asian currencies too weakened against the dollar.
Traders are now looking ahead at the consumer price data due post-market close on Wednesday amid rising expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may opt for earlier-than-anticipated rate cuts if inflation falls faster.
A Reuters survey of economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October, a record-low, dragged by a sharp drop in food and oil prices.
"Retail inflation will be important for markets. The strike tomorrow may have impact volumes to some extent. But broadly 61 to 62 per dollar range on the rupee to continue," said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign exchange trading at HDFC Bank.
Dealers are bracing for low volumes across all markets in India on Wednesday as unions at most banks have called for a nationwide strike that is expected to leave trading rooms with minimal staffing but not shut down activity altogether.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.55/56 per dollar compared with 61.4950/5050 on Monday. The rupee had hit an intra-day low of 61.6750 on Friday, its lowest level since October 17.
The Sensex edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Traders will continue to monitor the dollar's moves as well as foreign fund flows.
Foreign investors have bought shares worth a net $1.3 billion in November, taking total inflows so far in 2014 to $14.96 billion. Net inflows into debt in the year stand at $22.9 billion.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.89, while the three-month was at 62.45.

J-K Congress slams Modi-Sajjad LonemeetingSajjad Lone out side PM residence after meeting with Narendar Modi in New Delhi on Monday. (Express photo by Anil Sharma)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: November 11, 2014 5:38 pm
Describing ex-separatist leader Sajjad Lone’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi as ‘shaddy’, the Jammu Kashmir Congress spokesperson Shafiq Mir said that it has unmasked BJPs nationalistic drama that this party can go to any extent for the sake of political gains.
Terming the development surprising and unfortunate, Shafiq Mir said that the people who patronised separatism and have been promoting terrorism in the state for the past two decades have been invited by the Bhartiya Janta Party on “evening Tea” at the level of prime minister that too without any accountability. This development shows this party can go up to any extent for the sake of political gains which they call mission 44, he said, adding that they will, however, never succeed in their designs as the people of the state are wise enough to decide their future.
He also expressed surprise that the BJP, which has been in the past two decades exploiting whole nation in the name of separatism in Jammu Kashmir, has for the sake of power now forging  “unholy alliance” with such groups who have always been on war with India. The Congress leader cautioned and also warned the Central government against any attempt to launch any such person in the state as it will have dire consequences.
He said the top most priority of the Central government should be free and fair elections in the state irrespective of who so ever comes to power. The BJP’s so called “mission 44’’ slogan indicates that this party can go up to any extent to grab the power which will have dangerous consequences in the future.

Article 370 part of BJPs agenda: JitendraSinghPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: November 11, 2014 6:09 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 6:19 pm
Asserting that BJP’s stand on Article 370 is “very clear”, Union Minister Jitendra Singh today said all issues, including the provision, which have been part of the party’s manifesto, will be on its agenda.
“All issues (including Article 370) which have been part of the BJP manifesto all these years will be part of the agenda. They will continue to be so,” the Minister of State, PMO, told reporters while inaugurating BJP Media Centre here for its “Mission 44+”.
Singh was replying to a question if BJP has dumped the issue of Article 370, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir, during the upcoming Assembly elections.
“The ideological issue (Article 370), toward which you point to, BJP’s stand is very clear on it and it is known to you,” he said.
“But in each election at each given time, you have to prioritise and you have to go by the aspiration of the people.
The aspiration of the people as of now, in 2014, in November and December, when we go to polls, is to liberate this state and people from years and years of mis-governance, corruption and misappropriation of Central funds,” Singh said.
To a question on some sitting BJP MLAS resigning from party to fight against it, he said, “I do not want to indulge into a debate over it. There is inner party democracy in BJP. It is the only party which is not governed by dynasty or family.”
“There is selection of panels and it is being approved by the Parliamentary Board. Everybody should consider himself as a contestant, but once a candidate is announced, the party and its leaders and worker forces stand by the candidate,” he said.
On a question if the party here is banking solely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said, “Across party lines, it is being accepted by one and all that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country now. Can you deny him that privilege which he enjoys by virtue of his popularity. Having said that I also add that you should not underestimate the wisdom of the voter of this country –they are going to judge us by our performance,” he said.
“People vote to our governance model of government with transparency, accountability and development,” he said.
On setting up a media cell, he said, “BJP is the only party which has shown the era of high-tech media campaign.
Before the last general elections, ours used to be a high-tech media cell. A media high-tech cell was set up in BJP central office”.
“From our models, other political parties took a cue. we have been on the forefront in this media campaign,” he said.

Modi, who took office in May after sweeping to power with a massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, now heads a 66-member council of ministers , with 26 ministers holding Cabinet rank.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajiv Pratap Rudy, JP Nadda, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who were earlier engaged in party affairs, are now a part of his team .
Their engagement at the frontline will put the onus on party president Amit Shah to create a new second line of leadership at a time when the going is good for the BJP.
As is perceived with Modi, there seems to be a plan in the manner in which leaders are being picked for the Centre and in states. Here’s a list of those rising through the ranks.
In Modi government
Manohar Parrikar , defence minister: He has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, health and family welfare minister: Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims to be a disciplined solider of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is seen as the spiritual and ideological guide of the BJP.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy , skill development and entrepreneurship, parliamentary affairs minister: He was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the single largest party after the recent assembly elections.
Mahesh Sharma, culture, tourism and civil aviation minister: A doctor, Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA. He is now the MP from Gautam Budh Nagar constituency in Uttar Pradesh.
Ram Shankar Katheria, MoS human resource development: A PhD holder and writer of books on social issues and uplift of Dalits, among others, Katheria's elevation as a MoS is being seen as a move which would help the party in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
Hansraj Ahir, MoS chemicals and fertilisers: He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. An active parliamentarian, Ahir has introduced a number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, MoS minority affairs, parliamentary affairs: A vocal BJP spokesperson, Naqvi has been the Muslim face of the party for long.
Giriraj Singh, MoS micro, small and medium enterprises: His emergence on the national political scene has been rather dramatic. A firebrand Bhumihar leader, he has influence over vast pockets in southern Bihar and election-bound Jharkhand. He was a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government in Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015.
Ram Kripal Yadav, MoS drinking water and sanitation: Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both houses of Parliament, where he had represented Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign in the state for the 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, MoS urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation: The singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol was a huge boost for the party.
Jayant Sinha , MoS finance: Sinha, is a former corporate insider with wide experience in governance and strategy consulting. He is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a BTech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, MoS water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation: He defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. He is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje cabinet to contest the elections.
Mohan Kundariya, MoS agricultutre: He is an influential leader from the Patel community and MP from Rajkot. A powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, MoS human resource development: A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academic and was a part of the party's anti-corruption campaign.
Vijay Sampla, MoS social justice and empowerment: It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to the Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, MoS home affairs: He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been a BJP member since 1988, and was the vice-president of the party’s Gujarat unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, MoS food processing industries: The lone woman inducted into the Modi cabinet in the expansion, Jyoti is an MP from Fatehpur. She defeated the Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life.

New faces in party
BJP president Shah has also carried out a major organisational reshuffle, giving important assignments to performers and bringing in new faces.
OP Mathur: The Rajasthan leader — who as election in-charge in Maharashtra polls won accolades — has been given charge of Uttar Pradesh. This is a job that Shah himself looked after in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.
Shrikant Sharma: As party secretary, he oversaw media affairs during the Lok Sabha polls. He has been given the charge of Himachal Pradesh, which the BJP lost to the Congress last year.
Vinay Sahasrabuddhe: Party vice-president and a close aide of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. He has been given charge of Madhya Pradesh.
Prabhat Jha: The Rajya Sabha MP will continue to oversee party affairs in Delhi while general secretary P Murlidhar Rao, another leader with RSS background, gets charge of Karnataka, which goes to poll in 2018.
Trivendra Singh Rawat: Former Uttarakhand minister and a Thakur leader, he worked closely with Shah as joint in-charge of Uttar Pradesh during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in-charge of poll-bound Jharkhand.
Shyam Jaju: The party secretary worked closely with Team Modi during the Lok Sabha polls. He is now in charge of Uttarakhand.
Satish Upadhyay: He is president of the party’s Delhi unit and will be kept busy ahead of polls, most likely in January or February next year.
Chief ministers
Mohan Lal Khattar , Haryana: Khattar is a former RSS pracharak.
Devendra Fadnavis , Maharashtra: The 18th chief minister of Maharashtra was an active Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in college. In the ABVP, he started as a grassroots worker, painting walls and sticking promotional posters for established leaders.
Laxmikant Parsekar , Goa: A three-term MLA and former chief of state BJP. He started as a RSS worker.

The Chhattisgarh lesson: Cash-for-sterilisation drive maybe masking grave tragedyprint

The death of eight women in botched sterilisation surgeries in Chhattisgarh brings back into focus a long-running, contentious state-run programme that is neither transparent nor clinically safe, nor even greatly beneficial in stabilising India’s population.
 
Back in the 1970s, the government was so worried about the exponential growth in population that it launched a compulsory sterilisation programme which saw unwilling men hiding in fields and on trees to avoid getting vasectomies.
 
In many cases, school teachers trying to meet family planning targets pressured fathers of their students to sterilise, before a public outcry drove authorities to abandon these desperate attempts.
 
That coercive campaign was replaced with a new, free choice policy which emphasised education of women and health care rather than demographic control.
 
But, in practice, women and men are often coerced, forced or bribed into accepting tubal ligation.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.
 
A typical sterilisation camp in villages throws up dire images of surgeries rushed through in unhygienic conditions: Typically, half a dozen tables set next to each other, blood-stained sheets, health staff without protective masks and tools only rinsed with hot water.
 
Even paying women to undergo sterilisation is a form of coercion in a country blighted by decades of poverty and illiteracy and where the poor still see an extra child as an extra pair of hands. Also, paying a bonus to doctors and officials for every surgery raises as much an ethical question as the prospect of perpetuating coercion.
 
Excessive focus on sterilisation may actually be contributing to a population boom. The drive to promote sterilisation limit the contraceptive choice, with spacing methods for young couples - pills, intrauterine devices and condoms - getting neglected.
 
Given that India is a young country, limiting the contraceptive choices of the young maybe slowing down the fall in growth of the population.
 
Many states also violate the population policy of 2000, which called for a target-free approach to population stabilisation. To meet the goal of population stabilisation, many states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have fixed targets especially for sterilisation.
 
In India, population control remains a delicate issue, with politicians being wary of promoting family planning too vigorously, mindful of the lessons of history.
 
In 1977, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was punished by voters for imposing the Emergency. But her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Our sterilisation programme still remains mired in controversy. Although there may be merit in stabilising the population, it is time to break the awkward silence around a controversial state programme before it becomes a grave human tragedy.

S Korea ferry tragedy: Captain gets 36-year in jailSouth Korea court jails captain of doomed ferry for 36 years
By By Ju-min Park | Reuters –  Tue 11 Nov, 2014

GWANGJU South Korea: The captain of a South Korean ferry that capsized in April killing 304 passengers was jailed for 36 years on Tuesday after a court found him guilty of negligence, but was acquitted of homicide for which prosecutors had sought the death penalty.
The court convicted the ship's chief engineer of homicide for not aiding two injured fellow crew members, making him the only one of four facing homicide charges to be found guilty on that count, and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
The remaining 13 surviving crew members of the ferry Sewol were found guilty of various charges, including negligence, and handed down prison terms ranging from five to 20 years.
Cries and shouts of anger and disbelief erupted in the packed courtroom in the southern city of Gwangju as the verdict and sentences were read.
"Judge, this is not right," a woman screamed in anguish as some of the other family members broke down in tears.
"Is this how little the lives of our children were worth?" another said. "The death sentence is not enough for the crew."
Video footage of the crew abandoning the vessel after instructing the passengers, mostly teenagers, to remain in their cabins had caused outrage and calls for harsh punishment.
The victims' families issued a statement after the verdict, saying they were devastated by the decision and justice had failed.
"Our hope was miserably destroyed" Park Jong-dae, father of one of the children who died, said in the statement read outside the courthouse, urging the prosecutors to appeal and seek punishment that it said fitted the crew's crime.
A prosecutor involved in the case said his team would appeal against the decision on all 15 crew members, calling the rulings "disappointing," particularly the not guilty verdict against three senior officers including the captain on homicide charges.
VESSEL OVERLOADED
The overloaded Sewol capsized while making a turn on a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju. The vessel was later found to be defective, with additions made to increase passenger capacity making it top-heavy and unstable.
The ferry operator also loaded the ship with excess cargo and not enough water in the ballast tank to maintain balance, causing it to list sharply when it made the ill-fated turn on April 16 and sink rapidly.
Only 172 of the ferry's 476 passengers and crew were rescued. Of the 304 confirmed dead or still listed as missing, 250 were school children. The government announced earlier on Tuesday it was halting the search for the nine still missing as conditions at the wreck have become too dangerous.
The public outcry provoked by the tragedy had led to concerns over whether the crew would be able to get a fair trial, especially after the prosecutors charged four of them with homicide.
They had sought the death penalty for the captain of Sewol, Lee Joon-seok, who is in his late 60s and instead faces the rest of his life in prison.
The crew on trial have said they thought it was the coastguard's job to evacuate passengers and that they were not adequately trained for that role, but most admitted they did not do enough.
Lee, the captain, has apologized to the families of the victims and said he never intended to harm anyone. He pleaded to be spared of the homicide charge, saying he did not want his children to live with a killer as their father.
Executives of the ferry operator and shipping regulators are on trial on various charges of negligence.
The man considered the head of the business empire that owned the ferry company was found dead in June, amid the country's largest manhunt to capture him to try to hold him accountable for mismanagement that many feel led to the ferry disaster.

The birth of planets caught on camera
IANS
scientific exploration
ALMA, a high-resolution interferometer, has snapped a protoplanetary disk around star HL Tauri
Using an international astronomy facility, astronomers have captured what is claimed as “the best image ever” of planet formation around an infant star.
The image was captured during the testing and verification process for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array’s (ALMA) new high-resolution capabilities.
This new image reveals in astonishing detail the planet-forming disk surrounding HL Tauri, a Sun-like star located approximately 450 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus.
The ALMA uncovered never-before-seen features in this system, including multiple concentric rings separated by clearly-defined gaps.
These structures suggest that planet formation is already well underway around this remarkably young star. HL Tauri is no more than a million years old.
“The fact that we can see planets being born will help us understand not only how planets form around other stars but also the origin of our own Solar System,” said astronomer Crystal Brogan.
All stars are believed to form within clouds of gas and dust that collapse under gravity. Over time, the surrounding dust particles stick together, growing into rocks, which eventually settle into a thin protoplanetary disk. Once these planetary bodies acquire enough mass, they dramatically reshape themselves into tighter and more confined zones.

Protesters Set Mexican Presidential Palace On FireMexico Protesters Set Presidential Palace On Fire

(Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Sunday condemned violent protests over the apparent massacre of 43 students after demonstrators set fire to the door of his ceremonial palace in Mexico City on Saturday night.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans have taken to the streets to protest the government's handling of the case of the missing students, and last night protesters in central Mexico City set fire to the door of the National Palace.
"It's unacceptable that someone should try to use this tragedy to justify violence," Pena Nieto told reporters at the airport in Anchorage, Alaska where he was en route to China. "You can't demand justice while acting with violence."
The students were abducted by corrupt police in southwestern Mexico in September. Though the government said on Friday it looked as though the students had been killed, then incinerated by gangsters working with the police, it stopped short of confirming their deaths for lack of definitive evidence.

Pena Nieto's trip to China has infuriated protesters and relatives of the students, who believe he cares more about Mexico's business interests than trying to deal with the gang violence that has ravaged much of the country for years.
The trip to China has faced problems since before it began.
On Thursday night, Mexico abruptly canceled a $3.75 billion contract to build a high-speed train line that it had awarded to a Chinese-led consortium after opposition lawmakers accused the government of rigging the process.
The group led by the China Railway Construction Corp were the sole bidders for the project and lawmakers said the government had acted to help the consortium and its Mexican partners, some of which have close ties to the president and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
The government denied the accusations.
Grupo Higa was one of the Mexican partners in the rail consortium and on Sunday a local news site noted that a subsidiary of the company, Ingenieria Inmobiliaria del Centro, had built a $7 million seven-bedroom house for Pena Nieto and his family just before he became president.
The house, which features marble floors and underground parking, has never been disclosed in financial records that Pena Nieto has made public and it is in fact still owned by the Grupo Higa subsidiary, the report from Aristegui Noticias said.

However, the president's office said in a statement on Sunday that the house was acquired in 2012 from Ingenieria Inmobiliaria del Centro by Pena Nieto's wife, actress Angelica Rivera, and that she spoke openly about the property last year.
Separately, China on Sunday said it believed China Railway Construction Corp had followed Mexico's bidding rules and requirements and it hopes Chinese companies will continue to participate in Mexican infrastructure projects.
Another protest took place on Sunday, which included people who had walked more than 100 miles to Mexico City from Iguala, Guerrero, where the missing students were abducted. The protest congregated peacefully in the central Zocalo square.

Narendra Modi s  Make in India  push to depend on Chinese steelNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India’s steel consumption is expected to grow at its fastest pace in five years next year on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s infrastructure push, but a scarcity of raw materials means it will be at the expense of another key goal – curbing imports.
In his triumphant election campaign, Modi criticised the last government for exporting iron ore but importing steel. But his first five months as the prime minister has coincided with a surge in imports of both, denting his high-decibel drive to make India an export powerhouse.
India’s steel imports from China, the world’s biggest producer of the alloy, doubled in April-September from a year ago though the country has enough capacity to meet its demand.
While India’s consumption is expected to rise, China will continue to see a downtrend, likely leading to a flood of cheap steel from China just as Modi pushes ahead with a signature ‘Make in India’ initiative to boost industry.
Charged by the strongest electoral mandate in three decades, Modi has staked his reputation on making India an export hub, launching his pet campaign with much fanfare in September with a lion as its logo.
Soaring steel imports, however, underscore the challenges Modi faces in realising his dream. Steelmakers, such as JSW, are clamouring for higher import tariffs.
“The ‘Make in India’ slogan has to be true for steel also,” said Ravinder Bhan, deputy general manager of marketing at state-owned Steel Authority of India. “Let steel firms get iron ore and other raw materials. But that’s not happening.”
India, Asia’s third-largest economy, has become a major importer of iron ore and coal despite having big reserves of both at home. Once a top exporter, India is now bringing in shiploads of iron ore due to court action against illegal mining that has stifled supply, while coal behemoth Coal India is struggling to boost production.
The shortages mean that India’s steel industry is running at 80 percent of capacity. But the World Steel Association expects Modi’s pro-business plans – building 100 new ‘smart’ cities, creating new logistic hubs and residential townships – to spur steel demand that has been weak in recent years.
CHINA IMPORTS JUMP
World Steel expects India’s demand to rise 3.4 percent to 76.2 million tonnes in 2014, after growth of 1.8 percent in 2013. Structural reforms and improving confidence will support a further 6 percent growth in 2015, it said.
Indian steelmakers such as JSW, Tata Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, however, run the risk of being priced out by their Chinese competitors.
“The global market is such that the only thing that you can do is take some protective action to save the (Indian) industry,” said A.S. Firoz, chief economist at a Steel Ministry unit. “Otherwise you can’t decide what the global prices will be or at what price China will export steel.”
A Steel Ministry spokesman said he had no immediate comment on whether authorities would consider raising tariffs, although a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the issue was being looked into.
China, the world’s largest steel producer, rolls more steel in a month than India, the fourth largest producer, manages in nine months. But a slowdown in China means it is set to end with a surplus of about 100 million tonnes a year.
“MADE OUTSIDE INDIA”
A tonne of reinforcement steel produced in India for use in buildings can cost up to 15,000 rupees ($244) more than that from China, according to Firoz.
Shipments into India jumped 33 percent to 4.19 million tonnes in April-September from a year ago, with imports from China leaping 108 percent to 1.34 million tonnes. Total steel imports in the fiscal year to next March 31 could nearly double to 9 million tonnes, JSW predicts.
“Through ‘Make in India’, Modi is saying that India should be the hub for the rest of the world and of course to meet our full demand,” said N.C. Mathur, president of the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association.
“Instead something made outside India is coming into the country. That’s a big threat. It’s a week after week, month after month survival issue.”

CEO ordered to pay almost $1 billion in divorceCEO ordered to pay almost $1 billion in divorce

Judge orders Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm to pay nearly $1 billion in divorce
CEO ordered to pay almost $1 billion in one of the largest divorce judgments in U.S. history
An Oklahoma County judge has ordered Continental Resources Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm to pay nearly $1 billion in a divorce judgment, according to a court filing made public on Monday.
In one of the highest value divorce judgments in U.S. history, Special Judge Howard Haralson found that oil magnate Hamm should pay his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm a total of $995.5 million.
Although the divorce award could make Sue Ann Hamm, 58, one of the 100 wealthiest women in the United States, according to Forbes' rankings, it is far smaller than the amount her lawyers sought.
'Quick update," said the subject line of the email Jan. 10, 2012. ( Becky Yerak )
The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a 9-1/2 week divorce trial ended last month.
In a 2010 divorce settlement, casino magnate Steve Wynn agreed to transfer 11 million shares in Wynn Resorts, then worth $741 million, to his ex-wife Elaine, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Obviously the woman has not spent one cent on any cosmetic surgery. The woman is ugly. Jeez, a billion? She must be a good cook or something. That man could have had the finest escorts in the world and still had money for a small market sports franchise. But that woman, wow, what a dog!

Sue Ann Hamm's lawyers had contended that the court should split up most of the wealth tied up in Harold Hamm's stake in the Oklahoma City-based company he runs and founded, Continental Resources. His 68 percent stake in the firm is worth about $13.8 billion.
An award under the $1 billion mark may allow him to avoid selling any big chunk of equity in the company to fund the divorce.
To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock, or around 1/6th of the shares in Harold Hamm's name. That decision does not require him to sell shares.
Judge Haralson ordered Hamm, 68, to pay his ex-wife about one-third of the funds, or $322.7 million, by the end of 2014, the filing says.
Hamm will be required to pay the rest of the judgment, about $650 million, in installments worth at least $7 million per month, according to the filing. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25 million since the case was filed in 2012, the court said.
After trading slightly higher after news of the judgment came out, Continental shares traded lower, falling 1 percent to $54.58 per share around 3 p.m. in New York.
Analysts who cover the company said the divorce judgment may come as a relief to some of Continental's other shareholders, who had worried that a multi-billion dollar award could force Hamm to sell a major chunk of the company quickly, potentially depressing the value of the shares or eroding his control of the firm.
"With this rather small settlement, it just removes some of the uncertainty," said Mike Breard, analyst with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. "And there's already enough uncertainty around energy stocks right now with the oil price drop."
Continental did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jaitley defends new ministers  rejects Congs charge of taintPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:43 am
After having skipped the oath taking ceremony on Sunday, the Congress on Monday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing him of inducting what it called “tainted” people in his council of ministers, a charge strongly rejected by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
The Congress also linked party president Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh’s absence with the frosty ties. Congress said the absence of its leaders at the ceremony cannot be seen in isolation, and indicated the worsening government-opposition ties which would reflect in Parliament.
“I don’t think this question should be asked to a party which has been denied Leader of the Opposition status in Lok Sabha. Rather this should be directed to their allies Shiv Sena and SAD… The ruling party also should do some self-introspection as to why such a situation has arisen,” AICC communication department head Ajay Maken said when asked about absence of party leaders at the ceremony.
The Congress targeted MoS for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Y S Chowdary. Maken claimed his Sujana Towers Ltd had defaulted on repayment of Rs 316.61 crore of loan with the Central Bank of India.
Jaitley rejected the charge as baseless. “They have said that TDP representative Y S Chowdary has Non-Performing Assets of his company. One of his many companies was making losses. One account was in difficulty. The bank restructured it; he is paying back all the instalments (and) has a regular account today,” he said.
He also rejected Maken’s charge that another minister Ram Shankar Katheria has 23 criminal cases registered against him. Katheria is an MP from Agra. Jaitley said under the Akhilesh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh, “every BJP worker in the state has a criminal case filed against him.”
“These are cases arising out of political agitations. Not cases out of some crime or moral turpitude,” Jaitley said.
The Congress also said the reshuffle lacked rationale. “What happened to this government’s minimum government, maximum governance mantra. And the much-talked about synergy among related departments?” Maken asked. “If the ministers for Railways and Health were changed because of lack of performance or incompetence, it means the BJP Government has been a failure all this period,” Maken said.
Jaitley countered saying unlike during the Congress time, the PM now has the last word in the choice of the ministers. “He has chosen his team after checking the credentials and the facts related to each one of them”.

Why Australia  Brazil and others want Indian...Argentina
(India’s cattle population…)
NEW DELHI: Climate change is spurring something positive for India: growing overseas demand for indigenous cattle, which the government is keen to support. Markets from Australia to Brazil are seeking India's cattle for their resilient qualities such as tick resistance, heat tolerance and the ability to flourish even with inadequate feeds.
"There is demand for Indian cattle in the international market. Brazil and Australian want Indian breeds," agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said. "Climate change will reduce productivity in all cattle. Drop in milk yield will be maximum in exotic breeds, not so in local Indian cattle."
The germplasm — genetic material including sperm and embryos — of cows from Gujarat's Gir to Andhra Pradesh's Ongole are some of the varieties that are in demand for their superior milk producing ability. The minister said government support could help to improve the quality of local breeds of cattle and increase milk production.
India's cattle population declined 4% to 190.9 million, according to the 19th livestock census in 2012, the most recent. The number of indigenous cattle dropped 8.9% to 151.1 million from 166 million in 2007.
The government has set up the Rashtriya Gokul Mission to promote the conservation and development of indigenous cattle breeds through professional farm management and superior nutrition, recognising the potential to enhance their productivity.
The size of the export market for cattle is difficult to estimate and demand exists from tropical countries in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia , according to Satyajit Khachar, a breeder of Gir cows from the former princely state of Jasdan in Gujarat. Khachar has exported cattle embryos and semen to Brazil.
"Indian breed cows are in demand in Brazil and Argentina due to their sturdy qualities and high milk yield," Khachar said. He added that it was "very economical" to export Gir and Kankrej breeds of cows, both from Gujarat, and Ongole cattle, which are known to be resistant to mad cow disease.
"Cattle like Gir and Ongole with good breed characteristics will get you Rs 5-6 crore in Brazil. A Kankrej cow from Kutch will fetch Rs 40-50 lakh. Indian breeders have been exporting embryos, which fetch Rs 2 crore," Khachar said. Khachar and cattle breeders from Brazil had invested in a laboratory in Bhavnagar district and last exported in 2010 and 2011.
"I would like to further export, but the process to get permission is very long," Khachar said. The government has also received a request from the Nepal government for 1,000 cattle from India for cross breeding, ministry officials said.
Hundreds of Gir cattle were exported to Brazil in 1927, where they are called 'jir' and used for milk and meat. Indian cattle, including the Gir and Ongole varieties, were used in the development of the American Brahman breed of cattle.
The government allows export of germplasm, heifers and calves and live full-grown cattle only for breeding and rearing and not for scientific purposes, a government official said. Most indigenous cattle — represented by 37 well-recognised breeds such as the Sahiwal (found in Ferozepur and Amritsar districts of Punjab), Red Sinhi, Gir, Rathi, Hariana, Kankrej, Ongole, Tharparkar and Deoni — are sturdy, resistant to disease and able to thrive under extreme weather conditions and nutritional deficiency.
A senior official of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, under the agriculture ministry, said that the protection, development and preservation of indigenous cattle and their progeny was a focus of the national livestock policy.

SAN FRANCISCO  — Google has signed a 60-year lease on a former Navy dirigible hangar smack in the middle of Silicon Valley, NASA said.
The Internet company will pay $1.16 billion in rent to the federal government for access to the 350,000 square foot structure, called Hangar One.
First announced on Feb. 10, the deal was finalized on Monday.
A Google subsidiary, Planetary Ventures LLC, will use Hangar One for research and development of technologies related to "space and aviation, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies" according to NASA.
The property includes three aircraft hangars, an airfield flight operations building, two runways and a private golf course.
The property is 3 miles from Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
Google plans to invest more than $200 million in improvements to the property, including rehabilitating the hangars and creating an educational facility where the public can explore the site's legacy and the role of technology in the history of Silicon Valley.
The site is part of the former Moffett Federal Airfield on the San Francisco Peninsula.
Preservationists have been fighting to save the historic structure for years.
Moffett Field's Hangar One is a well-known landmark, clearly visible on the drive down Highway 101 from San Francisco to San Jose.
The hangar is a part of the nation's early aviation history. The Navy built it at Moffett  in 1932 for the USS Macon. It served as the West Coast base for the U.S. lighter-than-air aviation program.
NASA said the hangar will be used for research and development "related to space exploration, aviation, rover robotics and other emerging technologies."
The Navy transferred ownership of the hangar to NASA in 1994 after Moffett was decommissioned.
"As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.
"We want to invest taxpayer resources in scientific discovery, technology development and space exploration — not in maintaining infrastructure we no longer need. Moffett Field plays an important role in the Bay Area and is poised to continue to do so through this lease arrangement," he said.

Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) has raised National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty's target to 9,600 for 2015 from its 2014 target of 8,000 and said that macroeconomic data and earnings should lift markets.
Consensus earnings growth estimates of 15 per cent for FY16 and FY17 will be met, UBS said in a note.
The global financial services company expects lower rates and reforms to drive growth recovery.
UBS economists see 10-year bond yield at 6.5 per cent by end-FY16, down from 8.2 per cent currently.
UBS remains 'overweight' on banks, oil and gas, power, telecom and media stocks. It has upgraded consumer discretionary and pharmaceuticals to "neutral" from "underweight"
However, the banking services company has downgraded small and mid-caps to 'neutral' from 'overweight' and has cut IT services to 'underweight' from 'neutral'.

Currency Hedged ETFs Outperform, Pick Up Inflows as Dollar Gains
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 13:29 (IST)
ECB Weighs Further Action as Economic Picture Darkens
New York: US investors who believe the dollar's 2014 surge will continue are pouring money into exchange-traded funds that invest in foreign markets but hedge the currency part of the bet.
BlackRock Inc, WisdomTree Investments Inc and Deutsche Bank AG are among the companies starting new currency-hedged funds this year to take advantage of a flow of some $3.9 billion into currency-hedged ETFs so far this year.
There are now 35 US listed currency-hedging ETFs managing $19.3 billion in assets, compared with only about $6.7 billion in assets in 2011, meaning total assets in currency hedged ETFs have nearly tripled over the past three years, according data from Lipper and ETF.com.
A currency hedged ETF strips out the foreign currency return of a given fund by investing in foreign currency forward contracts, and rolling those contracts, typically on a monthly basis.
The largest asset gatherer has been the WisdomTree Hedged Europe ETF, which since January has added about $2.6 billion, growing four-fold to $3.5 billion.
So far, the dollar's rise has made that strategy pay off handsomely. For example, investors who bet on Japanese stocks via the unhedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF have lost 0.7 per cent over the past three months, as the yen sank against the dollar. Its hedged counterpart, the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF, is up about 12 per cent.
"Sometimes currency is not that relevant in the scheme of things, but times like now, when currencies are moving very quickly...it can make all the difference," said Art Laffer Jr., a Nashville investment manager who now has about 25 per cent of the global equity strategy he runs in currency hedged ETFs.
He bought the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Germany ETF earlier this year and also owns the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund. He would hedge more of his foreign stocks portfolio if he could find more individual country funds offering that add on, he said.
DOLLAR SURGE
The US dollar soared to a seven-year high against the yen last week and reached its highest level in more than two years against the euro on Thursday, November 6.
"We're a couple of years into a prolonged multi-year cycle" of dollar strengthening, said Dodd Kittsley, head of ETF strategy at Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management in New York, noting that historically, periods of dollar strength and weakness run roughly 6 to 8 years long.
"We have a lot of conviction because of the massive divergence in central bank policy," he said, referring to the way the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank have signaled their intent to further monetary policy easing, at the same time that the US Federal Reserve reigns in its stimulus program.
Deutsche has several currency hedged ETFs; its Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity ETF, has nearly quadrupled in assets since January, and now holds just under $1 billion in assets.
Currency-hedged ETFs like these are mainly aimed at investors who want to bet on foreign stocks; those who are less interested in those foreign markets and just want to bet the dollar will strengthen could buy a currency-focused ETF such as the PowerShares DB Bullish Dollar Index Fund or the WisdomTree Bloomberg US Dollar Bullish Fund. The PowerShares Fund is up 8.13 per cent so far this year, while the WisdomTree Fund is up 5.73 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL
Still, while developed markets like Europe and Japan have proven to be attractive regions for US investors to currency hedge, the same is not true of countries such as Brazil and Mexico where high interest rates can bite into the cost of currency hedging and weigh on returns.
"We haven't seen a lot of uptick in emerging markets currency hedging yet," Kittsley said. "The cost of hedging tends to be a bit more" in countries like Brazil and India, where interest rates are higher than in the US The cost of currency hedging is roughly akin to the spread in interest rates between an investor's home country and the country where the currency is being hedged.
In Europe and Japan, where the interest rate differential is much smaller, the cost is trivial. In fact, with foreign interest rates lower than in the United States, investors can actually be paid slightly for the hedge when going from the euro or yen to US dollars.
That's why Omaha-based Scott Kubie of CLS Investments, a registered investment advisory firm with more than $6 billion in managed assets, has decided to stay in Japan and developed Europe with his currency hedged ETFs.
"It makes more sense to do currency hedging in Europe and Japan than it does in emerging countries," said Kubie, who owns the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF and Deutsche X-trackers MSCI Europe Hedged Equity ETF.
About 20 per cent of the international exposure in his portfolio is now currency hedged, said Kubie. "I would see us increasing it over time."

Samsung leads India smartphone mkt  Xiaomi jumps |  Data tariffs may fall 20%Samsung
(Motorola, which is now a…)
NEW DELHI: Korean smartphone maker Samsung continues to dominate the India smartphone segment with 25% market share in the third quarter of 2014, followed by Micromax and Karbonn with 20% and 10% market share respectively with China's Xiaomi making rapid strides, according to Counterpoint research.
Motorola, which is now a Lenovo company, remained the fourth largest smartphone vendor while Sony closed the quarter at the fifth spot.
"Samsung led this price band during the quarter but the share is being chipped away by Micromax, Lava and the new entrants such as Motorola and Xiaomi," Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint research, said in a statement Tuesday.
With just two months of sales, Xiaomi raced to capture 1.5% share of the Indian smartphone market and is on track to double its market share sequentially, according to Counterpoint research's Market Outlook service.
Xiaomi will join the trend of undercutting bigger rivals such as Samsung with a high value-for-money offering similar to what Motorola, Micromax and ASUS have been offering over the previous quarters, the firm said.
The quarter was marked with major milestones crossed by Motorola, Sony and Lava (excluding Xolo) charting their growth story in this high-growth important market. These brands are now shipping more than a million smartphones per quarter joining the likes of Samsung, Micromax and Karbonn. Motorola's leaner go-to-market strategy coupled with its portfolio of Moto X/G/E phones at competitive price points is being received very well by urban consumers.
Sony's 1 million mark was driven by Xperia C, Xperia M dual and the Xperia Ultra T2 devices. Indian brand LAVA (excluding Xolo) also joined the million smartphone club shipping 1 Million units of its Iris sub-branded smartphones for the first time in India in a single quarter (3Q 2014).
The research firm predicts Xiaomi, Xolo, Gionee and Intex are in line to join the 'million smartphone club' in coming quarters.
The Cupertino vendor Apple crossed 1 million units of cumulative iPhone shipments for the first time in its fiscal year ever for India market. "This is a notable feat for Apple as it captured almost half of the high profit premium segment, taking share away from Samsung," the firm said. The Indian smartphone market grew a healthy 64% annually. "India smartphone market still has a room for vendors to grow exponentially as it expands deeper beyond urban India. The 6,000 to 8,000 INR price band is driving this trend and contributed to almost 30% of the total smartphone sales in Q3 2014," Pathak said.
The firm expects that three out of four smartphones in the country will be 3G smartphones going forward.
In the overall mobile phone market (smartphones + feature phones), it's a very close race between Samsung and Micromax for the top spot, as Samsung regained the lead from Micromax this quarter after the Indian vendor surpassed the Korean giant in Q2.
Samsung held 15.1% share of the overall handset market, while Micromax had 14.5% share, followed by Microsoft-Nokia 11% share. Karbonn stood at fourth spot with 9.6% share, while LAVA (excluding XOLO) captured fifth spot with 7.9% share.

Mercedes-Benz to revive Maybach S 600 limo...Daimler
(Daimler, which owns the…)
FRANKFURT: Daimler on Tuesday said it will launch new top end versions of its Mercedes-Benz S-Class , including a sports utility vehicle and a high-end luxury limousine adorned with the Maybach brand.
Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, said it would unveil the new Mercedes-Maybach S 600 limousine at the Guangzhou Motor Show and Los Angeles Auto Show this month, confirming a Reuters report from April.
In 2012, Mercedes-Benz stopped making Maybach limousines after the vehicles, which were based on a unique design and costing around $380,000, failed to selll heavily enough.
At the time, Maybach vehicles were marketed as a separate brand from Mercedes-Benz. Among the owners were rap stars, oligarchs and royals including Russia's Roman Abramovich, musician Jay-Z and King Juan Carlos of Spain.
The new jointly branded Maybach-Mercedes is expected to sell well in China, the United States, Russia and Japan, said Ola Kaellenius, the Mercedes-Benz executive responsible for marketing and sales.
In a further step, Mercedes-Benz said it would also launch a new system to label its various model series to help customers understand the company's ballooning range of vehicles.
Jens Thiemer, Head of Marketing Communications for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars said that Mercedes-Benz sports utility vehicles (SUV's) would be sold under the common "GL" brand.
In the coming months Mercedes will add SUV versions of their existing line of sedans, including compact, midsize and larger models which will be branded GL A-Class, GL C-Class and GL E-Class, Thiemer said at an event in Stuttgart.
"Later in 2016 there will be a GL S-Class," Thiemer added.

CHENNAI: Google is bringing an internationally tried and tested application to India, targeting small firms that are looking to leave a digital footprint.
The app is primed to draw business owners who own smartphones, but do not use online platforms to popularise their ventures.
"We are looking at the local cab operator, the grocer, the small-time real estate developer, education companies and the like," said Suryanarayana Kodukulla, Head of Small and Medium Businesses, Google India.
Once a business uses the app to register basic details, Google throws it up as one of the results of a search query.
For Google, which is offering the app for free, it is an investment to grow the ecosystem. "The more India goes online, the merrier it is for us," he said.
Google's India commitment is backed by statistics that point to a rapid adoption of the Internet. There are over 48 million Small and Medium Businesses in India, and the number of companies with websites number in lakhs only.
"We are setting up a call centre to help businesses with any queries they may have in using the app," he said. The overall advertisements market in India, about $7 billion, has a growing portion of digital marketing. With over 1,200 business associates who help Google in taking its products to its customers, the company is hoping to increase penetration in India with this app.
Google India has already started a drive called India Get Online to help business set up a website. It has incorporated over 3 lakh online portals so far.

Centrestates disparity persists over key aspects of GSTCentre, states disparity persists over key aspects of GST
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Differences between Centre and states over some key provisions of the Goods and Services Tax remain, with the Empowered Committee insisting that threshold turnover for levying GST be retained at Rs 10 lakh and petroleum be kept out of the purview of the new tax regime.
The Empowered Committee of state FMs, which met here today, however expressed hope that the GST could be rolled out by April 1, 2016, notwithstanding the hitches.
Talking to reporters, GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said that the Centre had written to him suggesting that the threshold annual turnover for levying GST should be increased to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.
The states had in August decided that the threshold be fixed at Rs 10 lakh and had informed that to the Centre.
“In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the Empowered Committee should be reviewed.
The Centre suggested that the limit should be Rs 25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs 25 lakh, Rs 10 lakh limit should be increased.
“But finally the Committee took a decision that they will go by the decision that is already taken that is Rs 10 lakh,” Rather said, adding that the final call on threshold will be decided by the GST Council.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The Finance Ministry is in the process of preparing a Cabinet note on the GST Bill.
States want that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST. The states are yet to receive the draft constitutional amendment bill from the Centre.
“States have already said that petroleum, alcohol, tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for response from Centre. We have not received the revised draft Bill. We will discuss and offer our comments (after we receive it),” Rather said.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan today raised concern over the safety of satellites due to space debris and batted for a comprehensive space policy for the country.
At a time when space assets are becoming part and parcel of daily life, its safety must be ensured, said Radhakrishnan, who is also the secretary of the Department of Space.
"There are so many thousands communication satellites and less than 100 various other types of satellites. What happens to those elements after their work is over. This is a new area of study.
"Are we able to catalogue them? Are we able to predict their movement? Are we able to see whether our actual satellites are safe from them?... How do we move them to safety? If we can tackle that or if we can identify arrival of debris, a spacecraft can itself move out of the place," Radhakrishnan said.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman was delivering a lecture on 'Contribution of India's Space Programme in Nation Building' at Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis here.
He added that there are nearly 15,000-16,000 space debris scattered in the space.
"Debris are also created intentionally and also generated unintentionally. When we depend on space assets to be part and parcel of our lives, it is essential to ensure their safety.
He said efforts are being made at the international level to deal with this problem.
"There are groups in the international arena which are looking at the issue of intentional creation of space debris through guidelines and general arrangements. There are groups, experts looking at these debris and how to deal with it," he said.
Radhakrishnan also said that government was looking to have an overall space law for the country. "In January 2015, we are going to have a workshop on this. We are working with a Hyderabad-based institute and the International Institute of Space Law School," he said.
The ISRO chief said policies related to different aspects like space and remote sharing of remote sensing data was in place, but there was a need to have an overall policy.
"In the country, we have a policy on satellite, we have a SATCOM policy, which is there is on our website. For remote centre data dissemination, what kind of data can be given to which agency, we do have a policy and it is well known. An overall space law for the country is what we are trying to evolve. The workshop is supposed to provide light on the issue," he said.
Radhakrishnan said that when it comes to human space module and robotics India is not been able to make inroads as compared to other countries, but the country would master the art and the space agency is working towards it.
"India is making the beginning by looking at the difficult technology in this area. We are going to, by December 2014, have a test flight of our GSLV Mark III.
"It's a crew model we have prepared for the human space module. It's an unmanned crew model. As it enters the atmosphere we wish to know what happens to it and how does it stand," he said. PTI PR SMN 11111725 NNNN

Narendra Modi wants cabinet colleagues to allocate work to juniorsPrint

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who expanded his Council of Ministers earlier this week, wants his Cabinet colleagues to distribute work to their juniors.
The strength of the NDA government, which was 45, has now gone up to 66 after the Prime Minister expanded his Council of Ministers and reshuffled portfolios on Sunday.
Of this, 27 including the Prime Minister are of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with independent charge and 26 Ministers of State.
Chaudhary Birender Singh, who took over as the Minister for Rural Development, Drinking Water and Sanitation and Panchayti Raj, today said he would implement Modi’s directive in a proper way and allocate powers vested in him to his junior ministers.
“I and my three colleagues will sit together every Wednesday and discuss issues related to the ministries. I will ensure that ministers of state in my ministries enjoy the same power as those vested in me,” Singh told reporters here.
Singh has three juniors in the Ministry.
While Sudarshan Bhagat is the Minister of State for Rural Development, Nihal Chand is the Minister of State for Panchayati Raj and Ram Kripal Yadav is the Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation.
“We will see that our Ministers of State are equally empowered,” Chaudhary said.
Several Ministers of State in the erstwhile UPA had complained to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about hesitance of cabinet ministers to allocate work to their juniors.
As Modi’s Council of Ministers got ready to be sworn in on May 26, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had sought to put cold water on the enthusiasm of a host of to-be Ministers of State, saying “being MoS is like standing in a cemetery”.
“Advice to some being sworn in today: Being MoS is like standing in a cemetery — there’s a lot of people under you but no one is listening!” Tharoor had said in a tweet.
Tharoor was the Minister of State for HRD in the Manmohan Singh Ministry.

Obama  Chinas President Xi hold talks in BeijingBarack Obama, right, follows China's President Xi Jinping as they enter a room for a meeting after participating in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. (AP Photo)
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: November 11, 2014 6:33 pm
President Barack Obama opened two days of talks Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a sprawling garden compound next to the Forbidden City, telling the Chinese leader he wants to take the relationship “to a new level.”
“When the U.S. and China are able to work together effectively, the whole world benefits,” Obama said.
Obama said he hoped for productive, candid talks of the kind they held last year at the Sunnylands estate in California, where the two leaders aimed to forge a close personal bond during hours of meetings and a long stroll through its manicured gardens.
Xi, speaking through a translator, sought to portray their relationship as one that would only grow over time, drawing on a metaphor about how a pool begins with many drops of water.
Beams of red and blue lights lit up Zhong Nan Hai, the imperial gardens near Tiananmen Square that serve as the center of power for China’s government and the Communist Party of China. After Obama arrived in his motorcade, Xi greeted the American president on a chilly evening with a handshake and led him on a ceremonial walk over a brightly lit bridge, explaining the history of Zhong Nan Hai through a translator.
After the evening meeting with Obama, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, Xi hosted Obama for a private dinner.
The intimate evening set the stage for formal, in-depth talks that Obama and Xi were to hold on Wednesday. The meetings between the two leaders followed an Asia-Pacific economic summit, hosted by Xi, that Obama attended along with leaders from nearly two dozen other countries.

Article 370 part of BJPs agenda: Jitendra SinghPrint

Asserting that BJP’s stand on Article 370 is “very clear”, Union Minister Jitendra Singh today said all issues, including the provision, which have been part of the party’s manifesto, will be on its agenda.
“All issues (including Article 370) which have been part of the BJP manifesto all these years will be part of the agenda. They will continue to be so,” the Minister of State, PMO, told reporters while inaugurating BJP Media Centre here for its “Mission 44+”.
Singh was replying to a question if BJP has dumped the issue of Article 370, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir, during the upcoming Assembly elections.
“The ideological issue (Article 370), toward which you point to, BJP’s stand is very clear on it and it is known to you,” he said.
“But in each election at each given time, you have to prioritise and you have to go by the aspiration of the people.
The aspiration of the people as of now, in 2014, in November and December, when we go to polls, is to liberate this state and people from years and years of mis-governance, corruption and misappropriation of Central funds,” Singh said.
To a question on some sitting BJP MLAS resigning from party to fight against it, he said, “I do not want to indulge into a debate over it. There is inner party democracy in BJP. It is the only party which is not governed by dynasty or family.”
“There is selection of panels and it is being approved by the Parliamentary Board. Everybody should consider himself as a contestant, but once a candidate is announced, the party and its leaders and worker forces stand by the candidate,” he said.
On a question if the party here is banking solely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said, “Across party lines, it is being accepted by one and all that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country now. Can you deny him that privilege which he enjoys by virtue of his popularity. Having said that I also add that you should not underestimate the wisdom of the voter of this country –they are going to judge us by our performance,” he said.
“People vote to our governance model of government with transparency, accountability and development,” he said.
On setting up a media cell, he said, “BJP is the only party which has shown the era of high-tech media campaign.
Before the last general elections, ours used to be a high-tech media cell. A media high-tech cell was set up in BJP central office”.
“From our models, other political parties took a cue. we have been on the forefront in this media campaign,” he said.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

McDonald s Drops Rights to "You Deserve a Break"reddit
It's likely more symbolic than significant, but 43 years after the slogan was written for McDonald's first national TV campaign, putting the brand on the map, McDonald's Corp. has abandoned its trademark for "You deserve a break today." Ad Age rated it the top advertising jingle of the 20th Century. Now it can be yours.
Keith Reinhard, the legendary ad man who created "You deserve a break today" in 1970, recently recalled that a McDonald's exec asked how long he thought the campaign would last. "I said, 'You should stop running this campaign when people no longer deserve a break,'" Reinhard, now chairman emeritus of DDB Needham, told Advertising Age .
Reinhard was a creative director at Chicago agency Needham, Harper & Steers in 1970 when it was among the agencies invited to pitch McDonald's national ad account, which was valued then at an impressive $35 million. Last year it reportedly spent $1.43 billion on U.S. advertising, with DDB Needham still its lead U.S. agency.
If you think that "You deserve a break today" is a bit corny, realize that a McDonald's executive raised that same objection when the line was pitched. He was overruled. "[McDonald's Corp. Founder and Chairman] Ray Kroc said in his high-pitched voice, 'Nothing wrong with a little corn!'" Reinhard recalled him saying. "And I knew we were in good shape."
Reinhard-whose book Any Wednesday was published earlier this year-has said that part of the power of the line he wrote was that "You deserve..." granted consumers permission to indulge in a fast-food meal at McDonald's. And the lyrics were particularly appealing to Kroc, who was a stickler about cleanliness:
Grab a bucket and mop,
Scrub the bottom and top.
There is nothing so clean
As my burger machine!
With a broom and a brush
Clean it up for the rush
Before you open the door,
Put a shine on the floor!
When we've finished, what then?"
Start all over again!
Tell me, what does it mean?
At McDonald's it's clean!
You deserve a break today!
So get up and get away!
To McDonald's! McDonald's! McDonald's!
"You deserve a break today" was first used in 1971 in a TV commercial that featured actor John Amos--later the father on Good Times, the adult Kunta Kinte in Roots and other roles--dancing with a bucket and mop. Sidney Woloshin composed the music for the jingle (despite frequent erroneous reports that Barry Manilow wrote the words and/or music), a credit that was the lead to Woloshin's obituary in 2000.
"You deserve a break today" was revived for ads in 1981 and 1982 after Chicago's Leo Burnett replaced DDB Needham as lead agency. In 1995, Burnett tweaked it as "Have you had your break today?" and that was the line's last hurrah.
In July 1997, McDonald's sales were struggling. Ed Rensi stepped down as president of McDonald's USA. And the McDonald's account, then $400 million, was returned to DDB Needham.
Several years ago, McDonald's abandoned its trademark claims to "We do it all for you," one of the many memorable ad slogans it has used over the years. But "You deserve a break today" was the first real tagline, the iconic one and the one that many people still can hum.
McDonald's again finds itself struggling to ensure its relevance. Sales are down again. Mike Andres was named president of McDonald's USA in August, succeeding Jeff Stratton, who stepped down. "You deserve a break today" wouldn't necessarily put the brand back on the tracks now, but it's probably worth remembering that what first made the brand relevant was its slogan's commitment to simple, clean operations and to being a tasty reward for everyday living.

Why HR needs a role in business strategyWhy HR needs a role in business strategy

Hey, has anybody called HR to this meeting?
With most companies touting their people talent as a strategic advantage, it’s high time that HR too played a pivotal role in strategy
Strategic work today is considered to be a high profile role in any organisational set-up. While most of the functions like sales, finance and marketing are perceived to add value to the business strategy of an organisation, the human resource (HR) function is often thought of to be lacking in strategic outlook. Even research (HR Outlook: A variety of leader perspectives, Jan 2013) conducted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a professional association for HR management professionals showed that nearly one in five (18 per cent) business leaders are unaware of HR's contribution to business strategy.
Additionally, 18 per cent say senior HR professionals have no involvement in business strategy at all. These results are not different from reality in India. There are very few companies that have their HR heads as board members.
Given that every company today considers its “talent” as a strategic advantage, is it not strange that the HR policy makers are yet to get a “strategic” role. HR's ability to influence wider business strategy is often at the heart of many recent discussions about the function's purpose and potential. In fact, according to a global study conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2012, 70 per cent of CEOs want their HR directors to be a key player in strategic planning. And HR as a function has the luxury of being one of the only functions to touch every part of an organisation, from the highest authorities in the board to people on the shop floor.
The days of HR only being about implementing processes and managing employee relations are a thing of the past. There is an increasing need for HR to play much more meaningful roles. This implies driving the conversation around business direction, including things like where to invest in resources and top-level talent issues, such as leadership development, and how to develop and manage the talent pipeline. But how can all these be achieved?
Understand business: An HR strategy can never be created in isolation (without considering the business and other factors); otherwise, it's just the usual HR functions. It is important for the HR professional to understand where the business is heading, what kind of talent is needed, when is it needed, in which location/s, for which customer, and at what cost. Such knowledge would help develop an effective people strategy to help the business achieve its defined goals. And thus, changing the role of HR professionals to that of a strategic enabler. The HR director must become more accountable for defining, managing and implementing the people strategy of the organisation and support in the efficient running of an organisation.
Leverage the power of data: Relevant data makes any statement more believable. If HR wants to play a role in the strategic space, it is important for them to understand and talk relevant numbers. According to a research conducted by Korn/Ferry,a leading talent management firm, ‘What makes an exceptional HR leader,’ released in July 2013, global business leaders list commercial acumen as the most valued competency for HR professionals.
Honestly, it is not just about meeting the expectation of business leaders but also about having right time data and the ability to understand it to help in better decision making.
Technology & change management: In today’s world, when every sphere of life is impacted by technology, it is equally important for the HR leader to leverage the vast potential of new age technological innovations. The days when role of technology was limited to automation of processes are long gone. With social media coming in, technology can be used as a sourcing tool, as well as to engage employees across locations. It is high time that the HR plays the role of a change and transformation agent and benefit from technology. Smart use of technology systems would result in efficient talent management and help HR in playing a significant role in strategic decision making.
Match strategy with action: It is essential for HR professionals to ensure that there is a clear line of thought between business strategy and HR actions. They need to think of appropriate ways of ensuring that services are delivered effectively and think through new plans and strategies for enabling businesses in achieving their goals. Excellence in HR operations is the basis for the HR professional to perform effectively.
One thing that can help here is to take a judicious decision about outsourcing some transactional activities like payroll, compliance, document management and query managementso that the bandwidth that is released can be utilised for strategic tasks. If the above four discussions are considered, there would be fewer barriers for HR being a strategic player. If the HR professionals think holistically about their projects, understand the business and talk to stakeholders from different functions in business terms with real analysis, nothing can stop them from being the strategic enablers in an organisation.
The emphasis once again needs to be on basics, focus on analysis before solutions, set clear objectives, and evaluate outcomes among other management tactics. The journey from staff room to the board room would then be a much easier ride!

Why US visa rules can see a flight of talent from IndiaWhy US visa rules can see a flight of talent from India
Rajkamal Rao

Allowing the spouse of a H1-B visa-holder to work will open the floodgates
With India’s economy growing consistently for nearly two decades now, retaining talent has been tough for Indian companies. 
It is not uncommon to hear about employees jumping ship for the flimsiest of reasons – because jobs for qualified individuals are always to be had.
Changes in US immigration law shouldn’t ordinarily affect Indian companies but if new US rules take effect as proposed, competition for talent is now expected to come from companies in the US.
I learned of a young Indian couple that had earned dual (BE/M.Tech) degrees from IIT Bombay nearly five years ago.  They had considered pursuing PhD degrees at elite US institutions but dropped the idea fearing that the path would be too limiting. They wanted to stay in India and grow. He works for Goldman Sachs and she for Microsoft in Bangalore. 
The investment bank had made several offers to him to relocate to their New York offices to work in their M&A division on an H-1B visa with a promise to sponsor him for a green card. 
But he had spurned the chance because that would have forced his wife to get an H-1B visa of her own, which is not easy. 
And she did not want to give up her exciting career to support his.
Work-life conflict
Couples considering moving to the US have lived through this work-life conflict for as long as the H-1B programme been in existence. US law allows employers to bring in qualified individuals from abroad on temporary work visas, called H-1Bs.  But it fully ignores the H-1B spouse and grants no privileges at all – other than the right to live with the H-1B employee as a dependent.
No longer. 
The Obama administration has quietly made public its intention to use “Executive Authority” to issue new rules for H-1B spouses.
  As the Hill newspaper reported in May, “One of the rules would allow dependent spouses to request employment authorisation as long as the H-1B visa holder to whom they are married has started the process of becoming a permanent US resident.”
This is huge.
By proposing to grant every H-1B spouse the automatic ability to work, the administration will virtually double the number of H-1B visas at a time when H-1B visas are exceedingly scarce.  
The new rules can have a profound impact on employees, families and employers that have operations both in India and the US.     
Spelling trouble
Even pure-bred Indian companies with limited US presence will find this proposed rule particularly troublesome. 
Until now, Indian managers could rest knowing that the prospect that their star resource would bolt to the US was relatively slim because the resource wouldn’t be able to secure work privileges there even if the resource’s spouse had an H-1B visa. 
The resource would have to quit a promising career in India altogether or be forced to change career plans (such as study in the US or even stay home) – hard choices to make for anyone.
In the US, critics are furious at the Obama administration for asserting Executive Authority on a matter that is currently before the US House of Representatives (This body is under Republican Party control whereas the US Senate and the White House are led by Democrats.)
US Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) issued a statement saying that the 100,000 new guest workers will further flood a slack labour market and pull down wages.
“It is good news for citizens in other countries who will be hired. But for struggling Americans, it will only reduce wages, lower job opportunities, and make it harder to scrape by. Who does the Administration represent?”
With the rule change, the Goldman Sachs employee stuck in Bangalore is now free to go to the US because his smart wife can easily find employment in the New York tech industry.
Republican winds
Note that the spouse doesn’t even have to be in a STEM (science, tech, engineering, maths) field.
The only requirement is that the main H-1B visa winner should be in one.
The proposed rules are yet to be officially signed by Obama.  And with all polls predicting that the US House will stay in Republican control after the US mid-term elections and some saying that even the US Senate might switch to a Republican majority, Obama will face strong headwinds to fulfill his promise of acting unilaterally.
But were the rule change to go through, Microsoft can expect a resignation letter shortly from that smart Bangalore lady and must be prepared to lose out on a stellar resource. 
Unless it gets proactive and offers the couple great careers in Redmond – opportunities that even Goldman Sachs can’t match in New York. 
This is what talent management has become in today’s global economy.

Supreme Court Agrees To Hear New Challenge To ObamacareSupreme Court Agrees To Hear New Challenge To Obamacare

Obamacare once again faces death before the Supreme Court.
The justices announced Friday they will decide on a lawsuit claiming that the language of the Affordable Care Act doesn't allow the government to provide tax credits to low- and moderate-income health insurance consumers using the federally run Obamacare exchanges operating in more than 30 states . The lawsuit contends that the ACA only permits subsidies to be distributed by state-run exchanges.
President Barack Obama's administration maintains this argument is baseless and that Congress always intended these subsidies to be available nationwide.
A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, King v. Burwell, would utterly devastate Obamacare.
The chief aim of the law is to expand health insurance coverage and offer financial assistance to families that can't afford it. Since most states declined to set up their own health insurance exchanges, the federal government was left to set them up instead. As a result, more than two-thirds of the people who had signed up for health insurance of April 30 purchased their insurance from a federal exchange. Among all enrollees, 85 percent received subsidies to help pay for it -- that's almost 5 million people. The average value of these tax credits was $264 a month , which represents a discount off the sticker price of more than three-quarters.
The Supreme Court is taking up the case -- a decision that required the consent of at least four of the nine justices -- despite the fact that no appeals court has decided in favor of the plaintiffs. The Obama administration had asked the court to hold off on hearing the King lawsuit or similar cases including Halbig v. Burwell , given there was no split decision at the appeals level.
In 2012, the high court voted 5-4, including Chief Justice John Roberts, to uphold the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that nearly every U.S. resident obtain health coverage or face tax penalties.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a press conference Friday that administration officials "continue to have high confidence in the legal argument," and that it's common sense that people in all states should be eligible for financial assistance under the Affordable Care Act.
"The congressional intent here is quite clear," Earnest said.
A Supreme Court decision against the Obama administration would essentially trigger huge price increases for the health insurance held by millions of consumers, but the consequences wouldn't stop there.
Absent financial assistance, many fewer people would be able to afford coverage and likely would drop their insurance or never purchase it. Higher prices also would discourage healthy people who are cheaper to insure from buying policies, leaving a sicker pool of customers on insurers' books. That, in turn, would force health insurance companies to raise rates further, driving even more people out of the market. The industry term for this phenomenon is "death spiral."
The plaintiffs in these lawsuits are zeroing in on a brief phrase included in the Affordable Care Act : "exchange established by the State," and asserting it makes distributing tax credits through a federal exchange illegal.
The Obama administration counters this language amounts to little more than a typo, at worst. The totality of the statute and the legislative history of its drafting plainly demonstrates Congress always intended to provide tax credits to people using any form of health insurance exchange, the administration and its supporters argue.
Last week, five Democratic lawmakers who helped author the law published an op-ed in the Washington Post on the subject. "None of us contemplated that the bill as enacted could be misconstrued to limit financial help only to people in states opting to directly run health insurance marketplaces," wrote Sens. Tom Harkin (Iowa) and Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Reps. Sander Levin (Mich.), George Miller (Calif.) and Henry Waxman (Calif.).
Congress could easily rectify the uncertainty about what the statute says by passing legislation to alter the language, but has failed to do so. And the Republicans poised to take control of the full Congress next year remain focused on attempting to repeal Obamacare or otherwise damage it, not move bills to make it function better. States also could choose to set up exchanges to ensure their residents can receive subsidies, but none of the ones that have failed to do so are poised to change course.

Domestic car sales decline 2.55 pct in Oct  motorcycle sales down 8.73 pctMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
Car sales in India fell 2.55 per cent in October as purchases remained subdued during the festival season, marking the second consecutive month of decline.
According to the data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic car sales in October this year stood at 1,59,036 units as compared to 1,63,199 units in the same month of 2013.
“Festival season has been subdued as compared to last year. Also, the sentiment has become positive but unless we have some real economic growth kicking in, we might not see automobile sales going up,” SIAM Deputy Director General Sugato Sen told reporters here.
He added that sales would remain subdued for the next two months but may see some revival starting early next year.
“Though we might see some revival in sales early next year, the passenger vehicle segment and passenger cars are expected to grow at sub-5 per cent this fiscal,” Sen said.
In August, SIAM had forecast a growth of 5-10 per cent in passenger vehicles and cars for the current financial year.
Car sales in the country grew from May to August this year after a prolonged slump which lasted over two years. The sales, however, declined 1.03 per cent in September.
In October, market leader Maruti Suzuki India posted a growth of 1.95 per cent in domestic passenger car sales at 80,589 units as against 79,040 units in the same month last year.
Rival Hyundai Motor India saw its sales grow by 5.34 per cent to 37,894 units as compared to 35,973 units in the same month last year.
Honda Cars India witnessed a decline of 8.45 per cent in domestic sales of its passenger cars at 10,186 units as against 11,127 units in the year-ago month.
Homegrown auto major Tata Motors’ sales were down 12.33 per cent at 9,594 units as against 10,944 units in October 2013, while utility vehicles major Mahindra & Mahindra’s sales during the month declined by 13.64 per cent to 19,029 units as against 22,035 units last year.
Motorcycle sales last month declined 8.73 per cent to 10,08,761 units from 11,05,269 units a year earlier, according to SIAM data.
“Motorcycle sales will remain subdued till the end of the year. It follows a pattern. Last year sales were up in October but fell in November and this year sales were up last month and fell in October,” Sen said.
Market leader Hero MotoCorp saw its sales dip 11.42 per cent to 4,91,190 units as against 5,54,545 units in the same month last year.
Bajaj Auto registered sale of 2,04,281 units as against 2,28,998 units last year, down 10.79 per cent. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) witnessed a decline of 5.73 per cent at 1,62,204 units as against 1,72,075 units in October 2103.
According to SIAM, the total scooter sales in October 2014 stood at 3,83,885 units as compared to 3,46,171 units in the same month last year, up 10.89 per cent.
Scooter market leader Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India posted a growth of 6.05 per cent at 1,99,466 units as against 1,88,075 units in the year-ago month. Hero MotoCorp scooter sales were flat at 59,498 units in October as against 59,579 units last year.
Chennai-based TVS Motor Co saw its scooter sales zoom by 64.75 per cent to 67,248 units as against 40,818 units last year.
The total two-wheeler sales in October declined 3.61 per cent to 14,61,712 units. Sales of commercial vehicles declined 2.97 per cent to 59,165 units in October, SIAM said.
“CV sales have picked up as fleet owners have started getting ready as the sector has started to witness some activity,” Sen said.
He added that with activities taking place again in sectors like mining and infrastructure, the segment is witnessing some much needed growth.
Total sales of vehicles across categories registered a decline of 3.84 per cent to 17,87,146 units in October from 18,58,594 units in October 2013, SIAM said.

Karachi Stock Exchange hits all time high at 31 332pointsThe Karachi Stock Exchange hit an all time high of 31,332 points today signalling growing confidence of foreign and local investors in the strong performance of the Pakistan’s economy.
In an all time high, the KSE 100-share index gained 402.25 points to hit 31,332 points.
Financial analysts said that the KSE index moving past the 31,000 points mark was a very positive sign for the economy.
Earlier on November 5, the benchmark KSE index of 100 shares closed at 30,593 points, while throughout last week the KSE index has shown gains due to increased trading of shares.
The previous peak of 30,474 points had come in July, but the exchange plunged in August after the protests and sit-ins by opposition leaders Imran Khan and cleric Allama Tahirul Qadri in Islamabad.
“The surge today shows that the recent steps taken by the government for economic gains, plus the approval by the IMF last week in Dubai to release the last tranche of loans, have boosted confidence of the investors,” market analyst, Intikhab said.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to release the additional USD 1.1 billion aid to Pakistan after its December review, saying it was satisfied with the strong fiscal performance of the country during the last financial year and its improving economic indicators.
“Economic indicators (of Pakistan) are improving, with growth expected to reach 4.3 per cent in fiscal year (FY) 2014/2015, inflation on a downward trajectory, and credit to the private sector expanding at a robust pace,” the IMF had said in a statement last week.
Ratings agency Moody’s had also upgraded the country’s outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’ in July, citing its improving external liquidity position and commitment to reforms.

Groupon Getaways launches app for browsing  booking travelGroupon Pages, a community of profiles for local businesses, launches nationwide Wednesday with more than 7 million listings of merchant information, reviews, tips and deals. The majority of those listings cover businesses that have never worked with Groupon. ( Amina Elahi )
“Consumers are currently woefully underserved by existing travel apps unless they know specifically where they want to go and when they want to go,” Goodall said.
The app, available for iOS and Android, allows users to browse trips by theme and to search for hotels in a map view. Groupon offers bookings at 25,000 hotels worldwide.
Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said he thinks the app is a “clever” idea.
“We are living in a world where apps meant for specific tasks or services tend to be more successful,” Bhatia said. “We’ve seen that with companies like Facebook.”

WSJ: GM Placed  Urgent  Order For Replacement Switches Before It Told Public About Deadly ProblemGM Ordered New Switches Months Before It Told Regulators About Issue: WSJ
Reuters
reddit
NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ordered half a million replacement ignition switches almost two months before it alerted federal safety regulators of the issues that prompted a recall of millions of vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing email exchanges between the automaker and its supplier Delphi Automotive Plc.
The email exchanges, which took place in mid-December 2013 between a GM contract worker and Delphi, indicate GM placed an "urgent" order for 500,000 replacement switches on Dec. 18, a day after a meeting of senior executives, the newspaper said. GM announced its recall in February 2014. (http://on.wsj.com/142qQhn)
Representatives for GM and Delphi Automotive did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the matter.
"This is simply mind-blowing in its raw evilness," said Bob Hilliard, lead counsel for the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the Federal Multi District Litigation against General Motors.
"GM should have notified its customers immediately to take all weight off of their keychains. By the time GM actually ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making the decision to place the order," Hilliard said in a statement.
GM has faced criticism for waiting 11 years to begin recalling millions of cars with ignition-switch problems that have been linked to fatalities. The switch in question can slip out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags. The defect led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year.
So far, 61 claims have been deemed eligible for compensation, including 30 deaths and 31 injuries.
A federal judge in Manhattan has set Jan. 11, 2016, for the first trial in consolidated litigation against General Motors over a series of safety issues, including a faulty ignition switch.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Dempsey undermines Obama administration criticism of Israeli actions in GazaBy David Bernstein November 10
Back in July, Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin Rhodes suggested to CNN’s Candy Crowley that Israel wasn’t doing enough to avert civilian casualties in Gaza.  “I think you can always to more. The U.S. military does that in Afghanistan. ” On August 3rd, ten people, including an undetermined number of civilians, died when an Israeli shell landed on a street near an UNRWA school, leaving the school and its grounds completely undamaged. Before the incident could be properly investigated the U.S. State Department issued a harsh condemnation: “The United States is appalled by today’s disgraceful shelling outside an UNRWA school in Rafah… We once again stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties.”
I pointed out the hypocrisy of these statements  at the time , but administration supporters claimed that the U.S. is in fact more careful about civilian casualties than Israel. Further accentuating my point, last week Join Chiefs Chairman General Martin Dempsey stated  “that Israel went to extraordinary lengths to limit … civilian casualties” in the Gaza operation. In fact, Dempsey said, the Pentagon sent a team to learn what it could from Israel’s operations, including lessons about how to limit civilian casualties.
Incredibly, when asked about Dempsey’s statement, State Department spokesperson Jan Psaki asserts “it remains the broad view of the entire Administration that [Israel] could have done more and they should have taken more – all feasible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.” First, Dempsey is an Obama appointee, so the idea that the “entire Administration” agrees with this is nonsense. Second, we have the informed judgment of America’s top military commander against State Department civilians who don’t even bother to wait until the facts are established before condemning Israel, plus Benjamin Rhodes, whose only claim to military knowledge that he’s been serving as President Obama’s mouthpiece on foreign policy matters since 2007 (“My main job, which has always been my job, is to be the person who represents the president’s view on these issues.”) Is Psaki really inviting us to make this comparison?

Facebook Messenger now has 500 million usersPrint
By: Tech Desk | Posted: November 11, 2014 11:05 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:34 pm
Facebook on Tuesday announced that its Messenger app is now being sed by at least 500 million people every month. The app, launched in 2011, had shot into the new recently when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted “forcing” users to download the new app, instead of messaging withing the Facebook app.
A post by Peter Martinazzi, Director of Product Management, said Facebook was “more committed than ever to make it the best possible messaging experience”.
“Messenger was the first of our standalone apps, and unlike our core Facebook apps, it focused on one use case – messaging. With Messenger, you can reach people instantly. It is just as fast as SMS but gives you the ability to express yourself in ways that SMS can’t.”
Facebook said it continued to improve speed and reliability and updates to Messenger ship every two weeks.
In an informal Q&A session last week, Zuckerberg had said “asking folks to install another app is a short term painful thing, but if we wanted to focus on serving this [use case] well, we had to build a dedicated and focused experience.” He said the primary purpose of the Facebook app was News Feed, but messaging was this behavior people were doing more and more.

New wearable device can track your dietLetters to  the editor
Monitoring your diet is about to get a whole lot easier, thanks to a new device that automatically tracks what you eat.
Sensors and software used to track physical activity are increasingly popular, as smartphones and their apps become more powerful and sophisticated, but, when it comes to food, they all rely on the user to report meals.
Dr Edward Sazonov, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at The University of Alabama, hopes to change that through development of a sensor worn around the ear that would automatically track diet, giving medical professionals and consumers accurate information that can be missed with self-reporting.
“Weight gain comes from an unbalance of the energy we take in versus the energy we expend,” Sazonov said.
“We can estimate diet and nutrient intake, but the primary method is self-reporting. The sensor could provide objective data, helping us better understand patterns of food intake associated with obesity and eating disorders,” said Sazonov.
Already proven viable, the device will be updated, further miniaturised and validated in a more formal, robust experiment in the community.
Called an Automatic Ingestion Monitor, or AIM, it has potential to monitor eating by automatically detecting and capturing imagery of food intake and to estimate the mass and the energy content of ingested food.
The sensor feels vibrations from movement in the jaw during food intake, and the device is programmed to filter out jaw motions, such as talking, that are not coming from drinking or eating. Estimates of energy intake would be taken from the pictures of food or drink.
In a study, the AIM will be tested against the accuracy of an alternative method, the use of a doubly-labelled water to track energy use by humans.
That method measures the body’s elimination rate of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen added to the water, a process that can take two weeks. The information can be used to estimate how many calories a person consumes over a period of time.
However, this method is expensive and requires medical specialisation, and, unlike the proposed AIM, does not track eating behaviour.
The information provided by AIM could be used to improve behavioural weight loss strategies or to develop new kinds of weight-loss interventions.
In addition, the AIM could also provide an objective method of assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological and behavioural interventions for eating disorders.

Proving the truth of F. Scott Fitzgerald's maxim that the very rich "are different from you and me," the CEO of energy giant Continental Resources (CLR) has been ordered to pay his ex-wife nearly $1 billion in a divorce settlement.
Harold Hamm must pay Sue Ann Hamm $995.4 million in "property division alimony," under the order issued Monday by Oklahoma County Judge Howard Haralson after a more than two-month divorce trial.
The 79-page ruling directs Harold Hamm, 68, to pay $322.7 million to Sue Ann Hamm, 58, by the end of the year, with minimum payments of $7 million each month starting in January to pay off the remaining balance.
Harold Hamm was awarded more than $2 billion in marital assets, including more than 122 million shares of Continental stock valued at nearly $1.3 billion. The ruling enables him to keep his hold the bulk of his roughly 68% stake in the company.
Among the holdings the order awarded to Sue Ann Hamm were the couple's marital home in Oklahoma and most of its contents, with a combined value of more than $4.9 million, and a Carmel Valley, California ranch valued at nearly $17.5 million.
However, Harold Hamm was awarded ownership  of "Star" and "Uno," two horses stabled at the ranch. They were valued at valued at $401,808, according to the order.
Although Sue Ann Hamm sought support alimony, Haralson denied that claim, noting that her share of the marital estate "represents a substantial sum of money."
"No evidence was presented by petitioner that demonstrated a need on Wife's part for support above and beyond what she is receiving as her share of the marital estate," the judge wrote.
Harold Hamm spurred Continental's growth and built his fortune by pioneering fracking in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation.
The couple had been married since 1988, and they had no children. Sue Ann Hamm filed for divorce in 2012, and the case went to trial in August. Haralson ordered transcripts in the divorce case to be sealed and not released "except upon court order."
Although Hamm's marital split is large, it isn't the most expensive. Russian oligarch Dmitri Rybolovlev, dubbed the "Fertilizer King," was ordered to pay his ex-wife Elena roughly $4.5 billion in May. That judgment "is not final and has not entered into force," Rybolovlev's lawyer, Tetiana Bersheda, said after the decision, adding that it was subject to two legal appeals.
"This is a fair and equitable outcome to the case. Out of respect for my family, we will have no further comment on the matter," Harold Hamm wrote in a statement emailed Monday to Forbes magazine, which estimated his post-ruling net worth as $14 billion.

No Stock Limits on Commodities in Regulated Warehouses: FMCGold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
New Delhi: In a big relief to commodity futures market players, the government has exempted commodities kept in regulated warehouses from the purview of stock limits imposed by state governments to curb hoarding under the Essential Commodities Act.
This was one of the key reforms that commodity markets regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) was pushing with the Consumer Affairs Ministry for last few years.
In a latest circular, the Commission said: "Department of Consumer Affairs has informed that the commodities kept in regulated warehouse (registered by the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority) have been exempted from stock holding limits under the Essential Commodity Act, 1955."
The exemption has been given subject to the condition that these warehouses publish the information of stock available with them on a real time basis, it said.
The Department of Consumer Affairs has also issued an advisory to all the state governments in this regard and asked the commodity exchanges to inform all market participants about the development.
Currently, there are four national and six regional level commodity exchanges in the country.
SMC Comtrade Chairman and Managing Director D K Aggarwal said, "This was a long pending demand. Many traders were not hedging big quantities due to stock limits issue. Now this step will encourage genuine volumes in essential items in the commodity exchanges."

BJP says open to support from any party  except Congress in MaharashtraPrint
The remark by Rajiv Pratap Rudy indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of NCP. (Source: PTI photo)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:50 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:52 pm
As its government braces for a trust vote in Maharashtra on Wednesday, BJP on Tuesday said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is “responsible for the mess”, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
“Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around,” he said.
Asked about Sharad Pawar’s NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
“Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government,” he said.
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Rudy was speaking after taking over as Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs along with Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Parliament House on Tuesday in the presence of Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
In a sudden move yesterday, a day after its chief Uddhav Thackeray served an ultimatum to BJP to come clear within two days on the issue of taking NCP’s support for survival of its  government, Sena submitted a letter to the Assembly Secretary asking him to accord its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde Leader of Opposition status.
Hours later, however, Uddhav said the decision to stake claim to LoP’s post was taken because Congress wanted the position on the ground that Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA and, if that were to happen, “we would have been left nowhere”.
After BJP and Sena, Congress is the third largest party in the Assembly with 42 MLAs.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition, the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.

The Super Bowl ad sales machine appears to have slowed a bit.
The overall ad sales environment is pinched, and NBC is asking a record $4.5 million for 30-second Super Bowl ad slots. The network says it has at least 10 30-second slots left to sell. That leaves the ad time about 90% sold, and NBC says it expects to sell some of it up to a week before the broadcast Feb. 1.
"We are not impervious to general market trends," says Seth Winter, executive vice president of sales and marketing at NBC Sports Group and NBCUniversal News Group. "Companies want to be able to respond to unique marketing conditions, so some are waiting until the last minute to commit to something of this magnitude."
The Super Bowl remains the kingpin of broadcast advertising.   No other TV ad time costs more, reaches more viewers or can equal its powerful links to social media and pop culture.   But slots run at $4.5 million — about $500,000 more than for the last Big Game on Fox — and there seems to be at least some reluctance among major advertisers to pony up.
"Generally, the Super Bowl is indicative of the overall marketplace," Winter says. "We all understand the market this fourth quarter is slower and less healthy for broadcast and cable TV."
He says the network is very firm on its $4.5 million price tag for advertisers purchasing a single slot and $4.4 million for advertisers buying more than one 30-second unit. "Some advertisers have undergone restructuring or cutbacks and are concerned about making the investments the Super Bowl requires," he says.
Super Bowl ad sales were not hurt to any large degree, Winter says, by the National Football League image issues from players involved in very public domestic violence incidents.  He says just one advertiser privately mentioned that as a reason for not returning.
The slower sales may explain why there are so many newer advertisers — about 10 to 12 who have purchased 15 slots, Winter says. He declined to name any of them, but he describes many as "digital businesses." Two rookie Super Bowl advertisers have publicly announced: Mofie, the battery-phone casemaker, and Loctite, the gluemaker.)
There will be fewer automobile advertisers, which may be because there are fewer major auto launches timed around the 2015 contest, Winter says. "If they're not launching, they may not feel compelled to be there," he says.
Also fewer this year, he says: "technology hardware" and "healthier snacks."
What you will see, he says, are ads for movies, beer, soft drinks, fast food and insurance.
Winter says the majority of ads will be 30 seconds, but viewers can expect some 60-second ads.

Eveready Industries Q2 Net Rises Over Four-Fold to Rs. 17.64 CroreBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Battery maker Eveready Industries India Ltd today reported over four-fold jump in standalone net profit at Rs 17.64 crore for the quarter ended September 2014 on the back of higher margins and lower finance costs.
The company had reported a net profit of Rs 3.7 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, it said in a statement.
Eveready's net sales during the quarter under review stood at Rs 354.29 crore, up 10.94 per cent, from Rs 319.33 crore in the corresponding period of 2013-14.
Commenting on the performance, the company said: "Though the volume remained flat, due to poor monsoon, battery operations remained healthy and contributed to the EBITDA margin expanding to 10.4 per cent during the quarter under review from 8 per cent in same quarter of the previous year."
"Reduction in finance costs from Rs 10.12 crore in the same quarter of the previous year to Rs 7.93 crore in the quarter ended September 2014 also contributed to higher profits in the review period," it added.
Overall expenses stood at Rs 324.89 crore as against Rs 304.54 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Eveready Industries shares closed 1.68 per cent higher at Rs 148.20 apiece on the BSE.

Govt sets ball rolling for its first full Budget; focus on black moneyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The government has begun working on the blueprint for its first full-fledged Union Budget early next year, which includes steps for curbing black money and encouraging voluntary disclosure, a definite time frame for the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), measures to trim the fiscal deficit and incentives for the MSME and manufacturing sector that would help boost growth.
“There has been some discourse on what should be included in the Budget and reviving growth and curbing deficit are key priorities. Another top focus area is likely to be the issue of black money and how it can be curbed, but it is too early right now,” said a person familiar with the development, adding that the Budget may also include some announcement on voluntary disclosure of unaccounted income.
The finance ministry has already begun initial work on the annual financial exercise with discussions on the revised estimates for 2014-15 and the Budget estimates for 2015-16 but a final shape on policy announcements would be made closer to the Budget presentation in February next year.
But finance ministry officials are hopeful that the model and timeline of the GST would be worked out by then and a formal announcement on its roll out can be included in the next Budget.
“It is on top of the agenda and we are hopeful of a consensus on the GST by then,” said an official.
However, the other tax reform — the proposed Direct Taxes Code — is unlikely to be taken up at present by the government. “It is on the back burner right now. Even when the BJP was in the Opposition, it was not in favour of the proposed Code. So it will have to be reviewed again,” said the first source.
The Union Budget 2015-16 is, however, expected to continue with the thrust on fiscal consolidation by focussing on trimming of subsidies as well as higher efficiency in government expenditure.
The first report of the Expenditure Management Commission is also expected by then and will provide key inputs for curbing the deficit.
The report of the Fourteenth Finance Commission will also be another key input for the Budget on not only devolution of taxes between the Centre and the states but also on fiscal consolidation. The commission, led by former RBI governor YV Reddy, is expected to submit its report by December.
Meanwhile, continuing with its focus on reviving economic growth, the Budget is also likely to include more measures for manufacturing, in particular micro, small and medium enterprises. “The basic idea is to carry on with the measures that have been started by the NDA government in this sector to boost manufacturing growth that in turn would revive the economy and create jobs,” said the person.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in September this year unveiled the ‘Make in India’ campaign aimed at making India a global manufacturing hub. Since then, the government has also announced new initiatives on labour to attract more companies.

The small change that can save you thousands of dollars a year in health costsBy Jonnelle Marte November 11 Follow @jonnelle
(Photo from Flickr used under Creative Commons license from TaxRebate.org.uk )
Welcome to open enrollment season. That time of year when you get e-mail after e-mail from your employer reminding you of all the changes you need to make to your benefits.
Of all the decisions that need to be made around now, one that often gets looked over is the chance to open a health savings account.
Most people can probably feel their eyes glaze over at the sound of the term. After all, you’ve probably got your hands full trying to make sure that your plan still covers the medication you need and the doctor you like to visit (that’s if you aren’t just closing your eyes and hoping nothing has changed).
But for some workers, ignoring the tax-deferred accounts is about equal to turning down a check for several thousand dollars. For a family saving the maximum of $6,550, it can translate to more than $2,000 a year in tax savings.
Sure, they’re kind of a pain to use. And you can only use them if you have a high deductible health plan. You need to figure out how much money you might spend next year on health care. Keeping track of receipts on small purchases may not seem worth the savings. But the process doesn’t have to be all that complicated.
Here’s seven things you need to know to make sure you get the biggest, fattest tax deduction off your health spending.
1. Figure out how much to save. Health care being what it is, it’s not easy to know how much you’ll spend each year. Find yourself in a car accident and you may easily wipe out what you put into the account, leaving you with hundreds or thousands of dollars more in medical bills — that you won’t get to pay with pre-tax dollars. Save too much, and you might wish you had that cash around to pay for that iPad you’ve been eyeing. The good news is that any money that isn’t spent in one year can be rolled over to pay for next year’s medical bills.
Some people might simplify the math by putting at least enough money into the accounts to cover the maximum out-of-pocket health expenses they might face for the year, says John Barkett, director of health policy affairs for Towers Watson, a human resources consulting firm. For a family with a $6,000 deductible, for instance, setting aside at least that much into the account can help them be sure they’ll have the cash on hand to pay for copayments and other bills until their full coverage kicks in – and they’d save the money throughout the year instead of scrambling to cover big bills when they come up.
2. Know what’s covered. It’s easy to shrug off the HSA with the assumption that chances are low that you’ll face a major accident in the coming year. And if you’re preparing for a costly procedure like a surgery, signing up can be a no brainer. But the tax-free accounts can also be used to pay for minor medical expenses , like doctor’s visits, eye glasses, bandages, birth control and breast pumps. Over-the-counter drugs can also qualify if people get prescriptions for them. But if you make a mistake, any money used inappropriately would be taxed and may be subject to an additional 20 percent tax penalty.
3. Understand how to take the money out. Keeping track of these small expenses may seem like a pain. Generally, people need to file a claim to be reimbursed for cash spent on a qualifying expense. (Who wants to file a reimbursement claim for $9 spent on bandages?) But some plans will make it easier to access the cash by providing a debit card that can be used to pay for expenses directly. Still, holding on to receipts may be a good idea on the chance that the IRS audits the account at the end of the year.
4. Calculate the tax benefits. Like with any tax break, people in higher tax brackets will save more than people with lower incomes and lower tax rates, says Carolyn McClanahan founder and director of financial planning at Life Planning Partners. But you don’t need to be rich to see the savings add up. People struggling to figure out if the savings will be worth it for them can use calculators to help them crunch the numbers. JPMorgan Chase offers a simple calculator , and Aetna has a more advanced tool , but chances are your insurance company provides its own calculator. Consider a family contributing the maximum $6,550 each year. In the 25 percent tax bracket, they would save more than $1,600 in federal income taxes for the year. In the 35 percent tax bracket, they would save close to $2,300.
5. Roll over the extra cash — all the way to retirement. If you don’t use all of the money in your HSA one year, the savings can be rolled over and used in the following years for qualifying health care costs. “You may be healthy this year, but one day you’re going to have some costs,” Barkett says. “And when that day comes, you’re going to want to pay for those costs with dollars you didn’t have to pay taxes on.”  People who don’t use all of the savings can eventually use the cash to pad their retirement savings. After age 65, account holders only have to pay income taxes on distributions just as they would with a traditional IRA.
6. Name a beneficiary. Like a retirement account, HSA funds can be passed on to a spouse or a family member after the original owner passes away. A spouse can inherit the account and continue to use the funds, tax-free, on qualified medical expenses. For other beneficiaries, the account will stop being an HSA and the person will pay taxes on the account.
7. Look into other options. Some people who don’t qualify for HSAs may be able to use similar accounts that come with slightly different rules. For instance, flexible spending arrangements let workers stash pretax money that can be used to cover health expenses, but with FSAs, some people can roll over up to $500 from one year to the next. Medical Spending Accounts can be used by people who are self-employed or who get insurance through a small business.

Border calls for end to T20 internationals
"I'd hate to see the 50-over game wither and die, I really think it's a wonderful game of cricket," Border said.

SYDNEY - Former Australia captain Allan Border has called for an end to Twenty20 internationals outside the World Cup and hopes the 50-over game will not be allowed to "wither and die".
Australia's domestic international season began last week when they played three T20s against South Africa with both sides fielding weakened sides in front of disappointing crowds.
To follow that are a five-match ODI series against the Proteas, a four-test series against India, a triangular ODI series also featuring India and England as well as the Feb. 14-March 29 one-day World Cup.
With some fearing that 84 days of international cricket in one summer is close to saturation point, Border made it clear which format he felt was surplus to requirements.
"I wouldn't be playing T20 international cricket at all, I would save that for a World Cup every two years," Border said in an interview with ABC radio.
"I think there is enough domestic Twenty20 cricket to fill the programme out quite nicely ... there's Twenty20 competitions in basically every country."
"Why we have to play international Twenty20 cricket as well as that?"
Border led Australia to the first of their four 50-over World Cup triumphs in 1987 and played 273 matches in the format for his country, retiring before internationals were played in Twenty20.
"I'd hate to see the 50-over game wither and die, I really think it's a wonderful game of cricket and I think the World Cup coming up in Australia and New Zealand will be an absolute ripper," he said.
"I think that would be a shame, I think the 50-over game is a superior game to 20-over cricket."
"I prefer the 50-over game as far as the ebb and flow, the bowler is in the contest a little more, and you can have little periods where you bat or bowl yourself out of the game and then bat or bowl yourself back into the game."
"That's very difficult to do in 20-over cricket."

Let's say you're a veteran with lots of free time — and big ambitions to rake in plenty of pay-back for your service to your country.
Well, some of America's biggest and most patriotic brands have three words of advice for you:  go for it.
If you play your cards right on Veterans Day — and some other days, too — here's how freebie-seeking veterans and active military can cash in. This list is not comprehensive — and some require military ID or have other requirements.

Here are the four more airports India could soon privatiseView Photo

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The government has rekindled plans to privatise four airports and will also list Airports Authority of India, the state-owned airport operator, on the stock market, the civil aviation ministry said on Monday.
The announcements form part of a draft set of reforms which the ministry hopes will aid growth in the aviation sector.
Millions more Indians are flying each year in one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets, but the government wants to speed up the process by expanding airports and boosting air connectivity in remote areas.
The ministry said airports in the cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Jaipur will be developed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model, without setting a timeline for when they will tender out contracts to the private sector.
Four airports - Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore - have already been privatised.
"Government’s objective is to develop more airports in the PPP mode, with appropriate modifications to ensure competitiveness in costs," the ministry said.
The UPA government, which lost power in May, sought bidders in 2013 for the privatisation of six airports, but disagreement among government officials over the terms of a PPP deal, opposition and missed deadlines scuppered the plans.
The ministry said it will list the Airports Authority of India, which operates 46 domestic and 15 international airports, to improve efficiency and transparency, and sell shares in state-owned helicopter company Pawan Hans.
The ministry is also "reviewing" guidelines which restrict airlines from flying international routes in order to encourage the entrance of more carriers, and will take steps to "rationalize" aviation taxes, which have made aviation turbine fuel up to 45 percent more expensive than internationally.
The government has no immediate plan to sell off loss-making national carrier Air India, local media also reported on Monday.

Ask Matt: Are profits looking upAP
Q: Are corporate profits looking up?
A: Third-quarter earnings season is just about wrapped up. What’s important now isn’t what companies said about the past, but what’s expected for the future.
Earnings came in better for the September quarter than investors though. Profit rose 8.9% during the quarter based on the reports from more than 450 of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, says S&P Capital IQ. That’s ahead of the 6.7% profit growth investors were expecting for the quarter as of Oct. 1.
So far, 83 companies have issued guidance for what they expect to earn in the fourth quarter. Of those, 45 companies have warned that the quarter isn’t looking at good as they thought earlier, while 22 say the fourth quarter is looking better. That ratio of negative-to-positive outlooks is 2, which is slightly better than the long-term average of 2.4, S&P Capital IQ says.
But overall, investors don’t appear to be all that optimistic about profit growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Currently, analysts are calling for 7.1% growth during the quarter ended in December. And expectations for this critical last quarter of 2014 are down from the 12.1% growth that was expected back in October. Analysts are instead looking closely at the first quarter, when the S&P 500 is expected to post 9.1% earnings growth.

President Barack Obama opened two days of talks Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a sprawling garden compound next to the Forbidden City, telling the Chinese leader he wants to take the relationship “to a new level.”
“When the U.S. and China are able to work together effectively, the whole world benefits,” Obama said.
Obama said he hoped for productive, candid talks of the kind they held last year at the Sunnylands estate in California, where the two leaders aimed to forge a close personal bond during hours of meetings and a long stroll through its manicured gardens.
Xi, speaking through a translator, sought to portray their relationship as one that would only grow over time, drawing on a metaphor about how a pool begins with many drops of water.
Beams of red and blue lights lit up Zhong Nan Hai, the imperial gardens near Tiananmen Square that serve as the center of power for China’s government and the Communist Party of China. After Obama arrived in his motorcade, Xi greeted the American president on a chilly evening with a handshake and led him on a ceremonial walk over a brightly lit bridge, explaining the history of Zhong Nan Hai through a translator.
After the evening meeting with Obama, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, Xi hosted Obama for a private dinner.
The intimate evening set the stage for formal, in-depth talks that Obama and Xi were to hold on Wednesday. The meetings between the two leaders followed an Asia-Pacific economic summit, hosted by Xi, that Obama attended along with leaders from nearly two dozen other countries.

Iraq War Veterans Sue Major Banks For Allegedly Aiding EnemiesIraq War Veterans Sue Major Banks For Alleged Role In Deadly Military Attacks

(Adds four banks declining to comment in paragraph 3, adds law  professor in paragraphs 10-11)
By Alison Frankel
NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Wounded U.S. veterans and  family members of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq sued five  European banks on Monday, seeking to hold them responsible for  shootings and roadside bombings because they allegedly processed  Iranian money that paid for the attacks.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New  York, named Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG  , HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland  Group Plc and Standard Chartered.
Barclays, Credit Suisse, RBS and Standard Chartered declined  to comment. HSBC did not respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was brought under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act, a  1992 law that permits victims to bring private suits against  alleged financiers of militant operations.
The lawsuit alleges the banks conspired with Iranian banks  to mask wire transactions in order to evade U.S. sanctions. The  Iranian banks then funneled more than $100 million to militant  groups that operated in Iraq at Iran's direction, according to  the suit.
The militant groups included a Shi'ite militia in Iraq,  Kataib Hezbollah, as well as Quds Force, the overseas arm of  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the suit says.
Since 2009, the five banks have agreed to pay about $3.2  billion to the U.S. government to resolve allegations that they  handled money in violation of sanctions against nations such as  Iran, Libya and Cuba. All the banks signed deferred prosecution  agreements with the U.S. Justice Department in addition to  settlements with U.S. banking regulators.
The agreements did not allege a link between the  transactions, which the U.S. government viewed as unlawful, and  militant operations.
Patrick Farr, a California-based plaintiff whose son Clay  was killed by a roadside bomb in February 2006, said the lawsuit  has given him "a sense that I was able to do something, hold  someone accountable for his death."
The case faces major obstacles, said Jimmy Gurule, a Notre  Dame University law professor. The Anti-Terrorism Act does not  specifically permit conspiracy claims, and federal courts in New  York have previously refused to permit cases to proceed unless  they allege a direct link between banks and militant attacks.
The law also bars claims for wartime injuries. "The law was  not intended to give a private right of action to soldiers in a  military conflict," Gurule said.
UNIQUE USE OF 1992 LAW
The suit is the first case under the Anti-Terrorism Act in  which former U.S. soldiers seek damages against international  banks. It is also one of the first to be crafted as a conspiracy  case.
The lawyers who filed the suit, Gary Osen and Tab Turner,  were part of a team that tried an Anti-Terrorism Act case  against Arab Bank earlier this year in Brooklyn.  Jurors found Arab Bank liable for financing 24 Hamas attacks in  Israel and the Palestinian Territories between 2001 and 2004.
That case linked Arab Bank specifically to wire transfers to  alleged Hamas leaders and payments to Palestinians killed,  injured and imprisoned in the anti-Israel uprising.
The new lawsuit does not assert a direct connection between  the European banks and the allegedly Iran-directed attacks  carried out in Iraq. Instead, the complaint claims that the  banks indirectly facilitated the attacks by entering into  agreements with Iranian banks to mask U.S. dollar wire  transactions sent through the United States.
"Each defendant understood that their conduct was part of a  larger scheme engineered by Iran," Osen said in an interview. At  a minimum, he said, the banks were "deliberately indifferent"  about the transactions they processed for Iran.
Osen said that through press accounts, declassified U.S.  military reports and documents posted by WikiLeaks, he built a  file on attacks on U.S. forces that were traceable to Iran. One  of the boldest attacks took place in January 2007, when  attackers dressed as American soldiers infiltrated a compound in  Kerbala, Iraq, and killed five U.S. military personnel.
Charlotte Freeman, whose husband Brian was one of the  soldiers killed in Kerbala, said she and her mother-in-law  decided to join the case to make a statement. "I never suspected  these big banks would turn a blind eye," she said. "Even if the  case doesn't get that far, at least the story is told. It needs  to be exposed."

That is one of the findings of a new study that shows that after years of steady increases, rental car customer satisfaction has hit a plateau.
Customer happiness declined by a point from 2013, according to J.D. Power 's 2014 North American Rental Carl Satisfaction study, released early Tuesday (today).
On a 1,000-point scale, overall satisfaction ranked 774 for 2014.

That may be a bit of a relief in an industry hampered by inventory and operational issues.
Inventory was tighter, said Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power, based in Westlake Village, partly because of the number of product recalls that took cars out of service. As a result, car rental rates increased an average of $5 a day.

Recalls that reduced inventory also affected wait times, he said, which is also key to customer satisfaction. This survey showed that customers spent 43.4 minutes getting and retrieving their car (which includes pickup, return and shuttle ride). That's an increase from 40.8 minutes from the 2013 survey.
Of the six factors evaluated in satisfaction, costs and fees ranked as most important, followed by pickup process (No. 2), return process (No. 3) and the shuttle bus (No. 5). The rental car itself ranked fourth, and the reservation process was No. 6 in importance in the evaluation.
At the top of the customer satisfaction class: Enterprise and National ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, at 805 and 797 on the 1,000-point scale.
At the bottom: Thrifty and Dollar scored 734 and 725, respectively.
But don’t automatically assume that the bottom two are of lesser quality.
Instead, it could be the kind of customer those companies attract — a customer that is traditionally more difficult to please.
Customers who are price-driven are less satisfied, the study shows — by 34 points on average.
That’s often the case no matter what the product, Garlick said. "We find people who are driven by price as a primary factor are always among the least satisfied in every industry,” he said. “With hotels it’s the same thing."
Surprisingly, the group thought to be part of what might be termed the “fussy” generation — the millennials (which Power identifies as those born between 1977 and 1994) was more satisfied than other “generational” customer groups.
Garlick thinks it could be the respect (or lack thereof) accorded to these younger travelers that contributes to their perception as more critical.
“The fussiness, the petulance, whatever you want to call it, is simply a myth,” he said.

Narendra Modi wants cabinet colleagues to allocate work tojuniorsPrint

By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 7:03 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 7:07 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who expanded his Council of Ministers earlier this week, wants his Cabinet colleagues to distribute work to their juniors.
The strength of the NDA government, which was 45, has now gone up to 66 after the Prime Minister expanded his Council of Ministers and reshuffled portfolios on Sunday.
Of this, 27 including the Prime Minister are of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with independent charge and 26 Ministers of State.
Chaudhary Birender Singh, who took over as the Minister for Rural Development, Drinking Water and Sanitation and Panchayti Raj, today said he would implement Modi’s directive in a proper way and allocate powers vested in him to his junior ministers.
“I and my three colleagues will sit together every Wednesday and discuss issues related to the ministries. I will ensure that ministers of state in my ministries enjoy the same power as those vested in me,” Singh told reporters here.
Singh has three juniors in the Ministry.
While Sudarshan Bhagat is the Minister of State for Rural Development, Nihal Chand is the Minister of State for Panchayati Raj and Ram Kripal Yadav is the Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation.
“We will see that our Ministers of State are equally empowered,” Chaudhary said.
Several Ministers of State in the erstwhile UPA had complained to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about hesitance of cabinet ministers to allocate work to their juniors.
As Modi’s Council of Ministers got ready to be sworn in on May 26, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had sought to put cold water on the enthusiasm of a host of to-be Ministers of State, saying “being MoS is like standing in a cemetery”.
“Advice to some being sworn in today: Being MoS is like standing in a cemetery — there’s a lot of people under you but no one is listening!” Tharoor had said in a tweet.
Tharoor was the Minister of State for HRD in the Manmohan Singh Ministry.

Samsung leads India smartphone mkt  Xiaomi j...Samsung
(Motorola, which is now a…)
NEW DELHI: Korean smartphone maker Samsung continues to dominate the India smartphone segment with 25% market share in the third quarter of 2014, followed by Micromax and Karbonn with 20% and 10% market share respectively with China's Xiaomi making rapid strides, according to Counterpoint research.
Motorola, which is now a Lenovo company, remained the fourth largest smartphone vendor while Sony closed the quarter at the fifth spot.
"Samsung led this price band during the quarter but the share is being chipped away by Micromax, Lava and the new entrants such as Motorola and Xiaomi," Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint research, said in a statement Tuesday.
With just two months of sales, Xiaomi raced to capture 1.5% share of the Indian smartphone market and is on track to double its market share sequentially, according to Counterpoint research's Market Outlook service.
Xiaomi will join the trend of undercutting bigger rivals such as Samsung with a high value-for-money offering similar to what Motorola, Micromax and ASUS have been offering over the previous quarters, the firm said.
The quarter was marked with major milestones crossed by Motorola, Sony and Lava (excluding Xolo) charting their growth story in this high-growth important market. These brands are now shipping more than a million smartphones per quarter joining the likes of Samsung, Micromax and Karbonn. Motorola's leaner go-to-market strategy coupled with its portfolio of Moto X/G/E phones at competitive price points is being received very well by urban consumers.
Sony's 1 million mark was driven by Xperia C, Xperia M dual and the Xperia Ultra T2 devices. Indian brand LAVA (excluding Xolo) also joined the million smartphone club shipping 1 Million units of its Iris sub-branded smartphones for the first time in India in a single quarter (3Q 2014).
The research firm predicts Xiaomi, Xolo, Gionee and Intex are in line to join the 'million smartphone club' in coming quarters.
The Cupertino vendor Apple crossed 1 million units of cumulative iPhone shipments for the first time in its fiscal year ever for India market. "This is a notable feat for Apple as it captured almost half of the high profit premium segment, taking share away from Samsung," the firm said. The Indian smartphone market grew a healthy 64% annually. "India smartphone market still has a room for vendors to grow exponentially as it expands deeper beyond urban India. The 6,000 to 8,000 INR price band is driving this trend and contributed to almost 30% of the total smartphone sales in Q3 2014," Pathak said.
The firm expects that three out of four smartphones in the country will be 3G smartphones going forward.
In the overall mobile phone market (smartphones + feature phones), it's a very close race between Samsung and Micromax for the top spot, as Samsung regained the lead from Micromax this quarter after the Indian vendor surpassed the Korean giant in Q2.
Samsung held 15.1% share of the overall handset market, while Micromax had 14.5% share, followed by Microsoft-Nokia 11% share. Karbonn stood at fourth spot with 9.6% share, while LAVA (excluding XOLO) captured fifth spot with 7.9% share.

Centre-States Differences Persist Over Key Aspects of Goods and Services TaxMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Differences between the Centre and states over some key provisions of the Goods and Services Tax remain, with the Empowered Committee insisting that threshold turnover for levying GST be retained at Rs 10 lakh and petroleum be kept out of the purview of the new tax regime.
The Empowered Committee of state FMs, which met here on Tuesday, however, expressed hope that the GST could be rolled out by April 1, 2016, notwithstanding the hitches.
Talking to reporters, GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said that the Centre had written to him suggesting that the threshold annual turnover for levying GST should be increased to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.
The states had in August decided that the threshold be fixed at Rs 10 lakh and had informed that to the Centre.
"In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the Empowered Committee should be reviewed. The Centre suggested that the limit should be Rs 25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs 25 lakh, Rs 10 lakh limit should be increased."
"But finally the Committee took a decision that they will go by the decision that is already taken that is Rs 10 lakh," Mr Rather said, adding that the final call on threshold will be decided by the GST Council.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill. The Finance Ministry is in the process of preparing a Cabinet note on the GST Bill.
States want that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST. The states are yet to receive the draft constitutional amendment bill from the Centre.
"States have already said that petroleum, alcohol, tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for response from Centre. We have not received the revised draft Bill. We will discuss and offer our comments (after we receive it)," he said.
The Empowered Committee also reviewed the revenue neutral rate for the GST, comprising C-GST and S-GST, as suggested by a GST sub-committee.
The sub-committee had suggested S-GST rate at 13.91 per cent and C-GST rate at 12.77 per cent.
As regards the items exempted from the purview of GST, the committee suggested that they should be mentioned in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
Mr Rather said the states have made it clear to the Centre that while preparing the draft GST Bill the views of the states should be respected.
"I have made it abundantly clear to the Government of India because that will be in the true spirit of cooperative federalism. States should be carried along. If all goes well, the Constitutional Amendment Bill is carried in Parliament by both the Houses, I think the 2016 target roll out date is achievable," he said.
The Centre is planning to provide Rs 13,000 crore on account of CST compensation to states for dues till March 2010 and is likely to seek Parliament approval for the same in the ensuing Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 24.
"States have said that compensation should be constitutionally provided," Mr Rather said.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of value-added tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As per the compensation mechanism, the Centre would bear 100 per cent of the loss accrued to states in fiscal year 2010-11 on account of lowering of CST. However, for fiscal years 2011-12 and 2012-13, the Centre would give 75 per cent and 50 per cent of the losses to the states.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.
Hinting that GST Constitutional Amendment Bill may be introduced in the ensuing Winter session of Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the government was in the final stages of talks with states on the issue.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Using strategic HRM, not technical terms, is the way forward
As an invited speaker for a Human Resources conference at a leading B-School in Kochi, I chose to speak on “Managing and Measuring HR contribution.” HR function is working hard and meeting many milestones in most companies. However, there is always a disconnect between the perception of HR and the CEO and the leadership team on its contribution. There are reasons for this disconnect.
HR is concerned with best efforts whereas business uses the language of best results. For example, whether it is attrition control or improving employee engagement, HR reports on what they “did” while business measures what HR “delivered.”
HR tracks and reports on initiatives and target KPIs, most of which are efficiency-focused like cost of hiring, lead time to hire, training man-days and so on. However, business is seeking to witness contribution to strategic priorities of the company such as building capability, increasing leadership bench and competitive intelligence on the talent market.
HR is busy with managing marginal performers, which is necessary. Business is worried about retaining top talent and leveraging them for growing the business.
Given this situation, HR has to introspect on how it can redefine its contribution and be an equal business partner, perception-wise.
Bridging the gap
I proposed the following approach for defining and demonstrating their contribution. It is a systematic process of building confidence and delivering value. The approach comprises four key steps:
Build a strong mindshare: With the CEO and the leadership team on their business priorities and what contribution they would like to see from HR. I propose that HR doesn’t need a ‘strategic plan’ of its own, but would rather gain from embracing the strategic plan of the company and business leaders.
Build necessary capabilities in HR: For example, ability to leverage technology including social media, big data that sits within the HRIS is critical. Business leaders are no longer happy with “reporting statistics” but demand “predictive analytics” from the gigabytes of data that HR systems generate. The HR function continues to produce reams of MIS that mean nothing much for the business leaders.
Contribution: HR leaders can define what business deliverables they can impact with HR interventions. Beyond recruiting and inducting people, tracking performance appraisals and monitoring training man-days, HR has to scale its contribution to business-value creating activities. Managing recruitment to retirement constitutes the lifecycle and is purely what may be called as ‘technical HRM.” What business values is a focus on “strategic HRM.” HR has to think hard about enhancing productivity, increase competitiveness,facilitating geographic expansion and create a culture of innovation so the competition shifts from mere execution to innovation.
Measuring HR value creation: HR must build the ability to measure its value creation on higher order contribution. For several decades now, HR has been measuring things that lend themselves for easy measurement. Understandably, strategic HR contribution is difficult to do and even more so when it comes to measuring and reporting to the business. There are ways and tools for constructing an HR scorecard that reflects and measures the strategic HR contribution. In other words, the HR function can determine its maturity by the quality of the HR scorecard it maintains and measures.
By redefining its contribution in strategic HRM terms, HR can assert its value and retain its chair at the strategy table.

Will new Railways minister Suresh Prabhu deliver where Sadananda Gowda failed PollNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Suresh Prabhu today took over as the new Railway Minister and said rail safety and customer service would be his priorities, as he seeks to unleash the true potential of the transport behemoth.
“We have faced lots of challenges in running the railways in the past. We do have potential which has not been properly utilised,” he told reporters after assuming charge.
Prabhu, who took oath as a Cabinet minister yesterday shortly after he joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Shiv Sena, replacing SD Sadananda Gowda who was shifted to the Law ministry in the reshuffle.
“The Prime Minister has decided that the condition (of railways) has to change…Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety as passenger safety is increasingly becoming an area of concern,” he said.
Observing that the people have reposed lot of faith in the government, he said the steps they undertake in railways will be seen in due course of time.
“What we will do will be seen in due course of time, so no announcement will be made is the announcement,” he said.
Prabhu said the economy is also dependent on railways.
Railways are an integrating factor for the economy and, “if we work in this direction we can propel economic growth,” he said.
With the public transporter having the largest workforce in the country, Prabhu said addressing their concerns will also be high on his agenda as they are the driving force behind the railway’s journey.

The Biggest Threat To Gov t Computers: Federal EmployeesFederal Government Struggles To Keep Pace With Cyberattacks, Ignorant Employees
 | By                                                                MARTHA MENDOZA

They have clicked links in bogus phishing emails, opened malware-laden websites and been tricked by scammers into sharing information.
Federal employees and contractors scattered across more than a dozen agencies, from the Defense and Education departments to the National Weather Service, are responsible for at least half of federal cyberincidents each year since 2010, according to an Associated Press analysis of records.
One was redirected to a hostile site after connecting to a video of tennis star Serena Williams. A few act intentionally, most famously former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who downloaded and leaked documents revealing the government's collection of phone and email records.
Then there was the contract worker who lost equipment containing the confidential information of millions of Americans, including Robert Curtis, of Monument, Colorado.
"I was angry, because we as citizens trust the government to act on our behalf," he said. Curtis, according to court records, was besieged by identity thieves after someone stole data tapes that the contractor left in a car, exposing the health records of about 5 million current and former Pentagon employees and their families.
At a time when intelligence officials say cybersecurity now trumps terrorism as the No. 1 threat to the U.S., an AP review of the $10 billion-a-year federal effort to protect sensitive data shows that the government struggles to close holes without the knowledge, staff or systems to keep pace with increasing attacks by an ever-evolving and determined foe.
While breaches at businesses such as Home Depot and Target focus attention on data security, the federal government isn't required to publicize its own data losses, with news of breaches emerging sporadically.
On Monday, the U.S. Postal Service said it was the victim of a cyberattack and that information about its employees, including Social Security numbers, may have been compromised. And last month, a breach of unclassified White House computers by hackers thought to be working for Russia was reported not by officials but The Washington Post. Congressional Republicans complained even they weren't alerted to the hack.
"It would be unwise, I think for rather obvious reasons, for me to discuss from here what we have learned so far," White House press secretary Josh Earnest later said about the report.
To determine the extent of federal cyberincidents, which include probing into network weak spots, stealing data and defacing websites, the AP filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests, interviewed hackers, cybersecurity experts and government officials, and obtained documents describing digital cracks in the system.
"It's a much bigger challenge than anyone could have imagined 20 years ago," said Phyllis Schneck, deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs a 24/7 incident-response center responding to threats.
Fears about breaches have been around since the late 1960s, when the federal government began shifting its operations onto computers. Officials responded with software designed to sniff out malicious programs and raise alarms about intruders.
And yet, attackers have always found a way in. Since 2006, there have been more than 87 million sensitive or private records exposed by breaches of federal networks, according to the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, which tracks cyberincidents at all levels of government through news, private sector and government reports.
By comparison, retail businesses lost 255 million records during that time, financial and insurance services lost 212 million and educational institutions lost 13 million. The federal records breached included employee usernames and passwords, veterans' medical records and a database detailing structural weaknesses in the nation's dams.
Marc Maiffret, a hacker turned cybersecurity expert, said "today's a little scarier" than when he was breaking into systems in the '90s. Malware and viruses can be purchased or rented, so advanced coding skills aren't required. And there's more mischief to be made, because the government depends on technology for everything from missile targeting to student loan processing.
"There's also a much bigger allure to use these skills to make money, in a criminal sense," said Maiffret, co-founder of the cybersecurity firm Beyond Trust, whose customers include the military.
From 2009, when the government began breaking out different types of incidents, to 2013, the number of reported breaches just on federal computer networks — the .gov and .mils — rose from 26,942 to 46,605, according to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team or US-CERT, which helps defend against cyberattacks.
Last year, US-CERT responded to a total of 228,700 cyberincidents involving federal agencies, companies that run critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants, dams and transit systems, and contract partners. That's more than double the incidents in 2009. And employees are to blame for at least half of the problems.
Last year, for example, about 21 percent of all federal breaches were traced to government workers who violated policies; 16 percent who lost devices or had them stolen; 12 percent who improperly handled sensitive information printed from computers; at least 8 percent who ran or installed malicious software; and 6 percent who were enticed to share private information, according to an annual White House review.
Internal documents released to the AP show how workers were lured in.
U.S. Department of Education employees — who had been warned repeatedly: "Think Before You Click!" — received an email a few weeks before Christmas 2011. "Your Amazon.com order of "Omron XEZ-740V Fat Loss" has shipped!" said the subject line, suggesting they click on a link.
"Unfortunately, several of your co-workers have fallen victim to this particular attack," said an urgent message from an incident response team. The department did not release information to the AP about any resulting damage. Meantime, reported cyberattacks at the agency have increased from 10 breaches with actual data loss in 2011 to 89 in 2013.
Reports from the Defense Department's Defense Security Service, tasked with protecting classified information and technologies in the hands of federal contractors, show how easy it is for hackers to get into DOD networks.
One security analyst, when notified that an account appeared to be infected with a virus, looked at the user's history and found he was redirected to a hostile site after trying to play a tennis video. Another military user sought help after receiving messages that his computer was infected when he visited a website on schools. Officials tracked the attacker to what appeared to be a Germany-based server.
"No matter what we do with the technology ... we'll always be vulnerable to the phishing attack and ... human-factor attacks unless we educate the overall workforce," said Eric Rosenbach, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security.
In June, the General Accountability Office released a scathing review of smaller federal agencies' protections. One problem was not fully implementing security training programs for staff.
Email encryption, which protects the contents of messages, is one way the government is seeking to shore up cybersecurity. Fifty-one percent of all federal agencies in 2013 reported using a federally approved encryption service, up from 35 percent in 2012. But some departments, including State, reported zero percent compliance with any approved encryption provider. The State Department wouldn't comment, citing security concerns.
Federal systems grow more susceptible to attack as the government's online offerings expand to user-friendly websites and apps, experts said.
At a hacking convention in Las Vegas in August, Joe Abbey, the director of software for Arxan, an app security service, showed how easy it can be to break in.
Abbey demonstrated how someone could take an iPhone from a doctor who had downloaded a free .gov app to track Medicare and Medicaid payments, run several malicious files and return the device. From that point on, he said, the thief could track every payment and medical record entered.
"This now exposes everything that's inside this app," he said.
Another challenge is that cybersecurity experts are expensive and in short supply. A June study by RAND found the federal government, which doesn't pay as well as private firms, is particularly short-handed.
There are some 90,000 federal information technology security workers, one-third of them contractors. And while the government is projected to hire thousands more and spend $65 billion on cybersecurity contracts between 2015 and 2020, many experts believe the effort is not enough to catch up with a growing pool of hackers whose motives vary.
There are government-sponsored attacks: Cybersecurity firm Mandiant this year tracked Iranian-based hackers targeting several unidentified U.S. government agencies, while the Pentagon last year said Chinese government hackers stole plans for more than two dozen U.S. weapons systems, including an F-35 fighter.
A cyberattack similar to other hacker intrusions from China penetrated computer networks for months at USIS, the government's leading security clearance contractor, before the company noticed earlier this year, officials told the AP. The intrusion compromised the private records of at least 25,000 Homeland Security employees.
Thieves interested in selling valuable data also dig in. Others have less nefarious motives. In February 2013, someone broke into the Emergency Alert System, broadcasting warnings about a zombie attack in California, Michigan, Montana and New Mexico.
Jeremy Hammond, of Chicago, considers himself an activist who hacks to expose wrongs or promote social justice. He is serving 10 years in prison for breaking into the networks of security think tank Stratfor, whose clients include the departments of Homeland Security and Defense.
"I hacked a lot of stuff but the government, they're hacking all over the world," Hammond said in an interview from prison.
Only a small fraction of attackers are caught. Last year, the Justice Department filed 146 cases under the government's computer hacking statute. On Oct. 20, the FBI announced the arrest of a National Weather Service employee accused of illegally downloading sensitive files from the National Inventory of Dams in 2012.
For every thief or hostile state, there are tens of thousands of victims like Robert Curtis.
He declined to talk about specifics of his case. According to court records, a thief in September 2011 broke into a car parked in a San Antonio garage and stole unencrypted computer backup tapes containing Social Security numbers and medical information of Pentagon employees and troops. The car belonged to an employee of a federal contractor tasked with securing those records.
Ever since, criminals have tried to get cash, loans, credit, emergency funds — even establish businesses — in Curtis' name. He and his wife have frozen bank and credit accounts. His credit union once transferred $32,500 out of his account. That, he got back.
Curtis described the experience as "devastating." This summer a lawsuit brought by victims against the contractor, the Defense Department and a military health insurer was dismissed.
"It is very ironic," said Curtis, himself a cybersecurity expert who worked to provide secure networks at the Pentagon. "I was the person who had paper shredders in my house. I was a consummate data protection guy."

2014: Marching Forwardreddit
As 2014 winds down I thought I would look at the biggest trends during the last calendar year.
For me the most important accomplishment of the peoples' climate marches around the world was the large number of business leaders (along with usual and predictable politicians and celebrities) who were out embracing the cause. The idea that people are expecting (and in some cases demanding) action by businesses as well as governments and multinational bodies (like the United Nations) may be an important trend, as organizations like The B Team seek to transform business from within.
While some of the media chose to cover the event and issues that inspired it, others chose instead to focus on optics such as the ironic amount of litter left behind by those who were marching against environmental degradation.
That brings me to a disturbing trend I see continuing and accelerating. More and more of the media are attempting to grab attention and eyeballs by using tabloid tactics and sensationalism, rather than through powerful, credible, accurate reporting of news and information.
While I do appreciate that it is difficult to take a complex story and make it understandable, but whether the story is about the violence that broke out between Hamas and Israel, the Ebola virus or climate science, but all too often -- particularly in the American media -- the desire to attract and maintain an audience results in pandering to that audience with increasingly loud and hyper-dramatic rhetoric and opinion masquerading as information.
When the media puts out information that is false or inflammatory it is akin to a company releasing a defective or dangerous product to the marketplace. Doing it unwittingly is a failure of corporate governance. To do either knowingly is a failure of ethics. Either way, it's a failure of these businesses to take responsibility for their actions and products.
On the other hand, the year ended with some positive trends as summarized in ' The Evolution of the Chief Sustainability Officer ' report by the Weinreb Group.
The role of the chief sustainability officer has transitioned from being responsible for the tactical implementation of environmental and social initiatives toward developing strategies that deliver simultaneous benefits for stakeholders and shareholders. Sustainability is increasingly recognized for its ability to deliver both topline growth as well as bottom line productivity savings.
CSOs are spearheading innovation in order to meet the need for sustainably designed products and processes that meet radically different criteria rather than focusing on incremental improvements. This means that sustainability is increasingly tied areas like procurement, Research & Development, design, marking and waste management.
CSOs are actively engaged in communication of their company's sustainability agenda to both internal and external stakeholders, sending powerful messages to stakeholders ranging from employees to customers about the company's values and priorities.
While moving in the right direction, I believe a greater focus on engaging with constituents in dialogue and actions (rather than 'sending' messages to them) are necessary.
The report notes that more CSO are reporting directly to the CEO. Being part of the senior leadership team sends an important message because it both demonstrates and ensures that sustainability is an integral part of the business strategy.
Many CSOs are chosen from long-term company employees rather than new hires from the outside. This may be due to the recognition that success requires sustainability be embedded into all corners of the business and therefor it relies on the leader's ability to understand the business and effectively persuade directors and managers to take ownership of the company's sustainability actions and achievements.

Is China Making Trouble or Making Peacereddit
BEIJING -- As presidents and prime ministers gather in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the nature of China's rise again captures the world's headlines. Simmering tensions between China and Japan and in the South China Sea combined with the American "pivot" to Asia have been used by some to produce a narrative that China is a destabilizing force for the region and the world.  Many have accused China of being a free rider and troublemaker.  Nothing can be further from the truth. On the contrary, China has been a linchpin for stability and development in this important region.
First, the economics. In the past three decades, while lifting 600 million of its own people out of poverty, China has played a leading role for the entire Asian economy. Now China is the largest trading partner with almost all Asian countries, driving a large number of job opportunities. East Asia's economy alone accounts for a quarter of global GDP. China's contribution to world economic growth has increased from only 1.35 percent in 1978 to one third since 2010.
During the financial crises in 1997 and 2008, with per capita GDP much lower than most countries involved with the crises, China played an indispensible role in stabilizing the regional and global financial system rather than taking advantage of the crises as predicted by some China-threat advocates.
In regional security, Deng Xiaoping led China on a path to helping maintain regional peace and stability. At the beginning of Deng's reform, he put forth the proposal of "Shelving Disputes and Joint Development" in dealing with complicated and sensitive territorial and maritime disputes.  This approach was innovative and contributed to decades of peace by keeping Asia's state-to-state relations from intractable conflicts. His strategic vision aimed at providing room and time for common development, which would in turn make the pie much bigger for common interests. If everyone has more to lose from conflicts, peaceful settlements of disputes are more likely. After the Cold War, many regions of the world became mired in costly and bloody conflicts. Asia was spared of such development in no small measure due to Deng's strategy.
The same strategy also drove China's unconventional approach toward ASEAN, the regional grouping of China's Southeast Asian neighbors. Instead of playing the traditional great power game of divide and conquer or resisting the formation of any effective bloc of surrounding powers, China cooperated with the northward expansion of ASEAN to include all of China's closest neighboring countries in the Indo-China peninsula. This is almost unheard of in the history of international relations.
In addition, China became the first major country to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, thereby providing the region with negative nuclear security assurance. In fact, for a long time, China and the gradually expanding ASEAN countries enjoyed stable and cooperative relations.  In particular, both respected the ASEAN Way -- the so called "Three No's" - non-intervention, no-use-of-force, and no hurry (in resolving disputes).  This incremental approach underwrote a long period of peace. It was actually the Obama's administration's "pivot to Asia" that disrupted this process of common development and unnecessarily sowed discontent by pushing conflicts to the front and center.
"It was actually the Obama's administration's 'pivot to Asia' that disrupted this process of common development and unnecessarily sowed discontent."
After the Cold War, in clear contrast to the U.S., China took a non-ideological approach to international relations. This has made China a stabilizing force in regional and global affairs.  This has been demonstrated by China's balanced relations with both Russia and the U.S.
In the years after the Cold War, China and Russia resolved all border disputes through long and painstaking negotiations -- no one predicted this success. China led the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which plays an increasingly important role in maintaining stability in Central Asia.
As to China-U.S. relations, despite differences in ideology and interests, the two countries have developed an interdependence that is a cornerstone for global stability.
Many have credited the United States and its alliance system as the guarantor of Asian security for the region's recent peace and prosperity. That, of course, is a valid claim. But it is also true that, after winning the Cold War, the U.S. as the world's remaining superpower has maintained a strong presence in all regions of the world including the Middle East, Africa, and eastern Europe. It begs the question, then, how come none of these regions came close to achieving the same peace and stability as in Asia?
We are now in a new era.  China's rise has gone beyond anyone's expectation in its speed and scale.  It is indeed an unprecedented development in the history of the world. Pessimists would say that such an emergence of a new power had never been accommodated peacefully by an existing world order. But such pessimism is unwarranted. China's past behavior points to a more optimistic future. It is time for those who have been willfully ignoring or distorting the facts to play a more constructive role.

Woman stripped and paraded on donkey in Rajasthan village
The panchayat pronounced the 'punishment' after she was accused of killing her nephew by his wife and other family members.
By Sudhanshu Mishra | Mail Today –  Tue 11 Nov, 2014

JAIPUR: A 45-year-old woman was stripped naked, face blackened and paraded on a donkey on the order of a panchayat at Thurwal village, around 8 km from the temple town of Charbhuja in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district.
The panchayat pronounced the “punishment” after she was accused of killing her nephew by his wife and other family members.
Rajasmand Superintendent of Police (SP) Shweta Dhankar said the trouble started after Vardi Singh died on November 2. “The circumstances of his death could not be known as the villagers cremated his body without informing the police,” the SP said, adding that Singh’s widow suspected that her husband’s aunt killed him.
She then approached the local panchayat that heard the case publicly and declared the victim guilty. The woman was stripped and her head shaved at a place in the middle of the village on Saturday. The panchayat members blackened her face and forced her to sit on a donkey. The woman was then paraded through the village for an hour on Saturday evening, Dhankar said.
Thirty people were arrested and nine put under preventive detention on Sunday immediately after the victim’s husband Udai Singh lodged an FIR at the local police station. On Monday, a court sent 26 accused, including a woman, to police remand.
Police said the woman was shifted to a shelter home with protection and was being counselled.
“The woman is in a state of shock. We have provided her security,” the SP said.
A large contingent of police force was deployed in the village. The accused have been booked under various charges, including those related to sexual harassment and unlawful confinement.
The district collector and the police superintendent visited the village on Sunday.

Maintain hold on Bata India; upside limitedFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘hold’ on Bata India and a September 2015 target price of R1,200 per share, based on 25x 1-year forward P/E (the sector’s 5-year mean). We cut our CY14-15 EPS by 2-5%, and lift CY16 EPS by 1.4%. Bata’s nine months CY14 core EPS was below expectations, at 64% of our previous CY14 forecast.
We recommend investors to wait for better entry points and buy the stock on declines (below R1,200 levels) for a more favourable risk-reward. The stock is trading at 39.9x CY14 P/E and 31.3x CY15 P/E, leaving limited room for any share price upside in the near term. Bata continues to execute well in terms of new product launches (especially in the mid-range to premium-end segments), marketing and store rollouts, and it should benefit from any spending upturn given its high operating leverage. But we believe that the risks of a delayed recovery in consumption and high retail costs are not adequately priced.
After a period of lull in the past three quarters, when net sales growth was stuck in high single digits, Bata India’s net sales growth rebounded to 13.1% y-o-y, 2.8% above our expectation. The company continues to maintain its target of opening 100 new stores in CY14 (99 new stores opened in CY13). We estimate an same store sales growth (SSSG) of 8% in Q3 versus a low of 5% in the last few quarters. Note that its SSSG levels stood at 14-15% a few years back.

Delhi: DDA housing scheme draw gets delayedComments
The much awaited draw for Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme has got further delayed.
The draw of lots, which was initially scheduled to be held on November 5, was postponed to November 10 after delay in the processing of applications. DDA vice chairman Balvinder Kumar had told Hindustan Times on Sunday that the draw is likely to be held on November 12 after successful trial runs but the land development agency has now discovered that there are still a lot of discrepancies in the applications submitted for the housing scheme.
DDA has now provided more time to applicants for checking out their applications online and get errors rectified, if any. “It has been decided to provide another opportunity to the applicants by DDA so that they can check discrepancies in application filed by them and the data displayed on our website,” said a DDA spokesperson.
Applicants can visit the DDA website  to check their applications online and in case of any discrepancy in the details submitted, they can report these directly to the Director (Systems), DDA at 011-24694157 to get the errors rectified.
The spokesperson said that this has been necessitated as even till Monday DDA is receiving corrections from the banks. DDA is facing problems from some banks such as Punjab National Bank, the data on applications received from which are still incomplete.
The total number of applications received by DDA for the housing scheme now stands at 10,08,700. DDA is yet to give a new deadline for holding the draw of lots.
DDA has started holding trial runs of the draw of lots from Monday and will continue as an effort is being made to compress the time being taken for the draw, the spokesperson said. On Monday, data of nearly five lakh applications were used to conduct a mock draw. “Initially, the data was taking more time for the draw and now it is being reduced to a minimum possible,” she said.

AMU VC under fire  denies banning women from libraryComments
Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor Lieutenant General Zameer Uddin Shah said on Tuesday he was not "sexist" after reports emerged that he turned down a demand of students of Women's College for access to the university's Maulana Azad Library, saying there would be "four times more boys" in the library if they were allowed in.

Shah found himself in the middle of a storm on Tuesday as human resource development minister Smriti Irani said the AMU V-C's reported remark not only hurt, but also agitated her as a woman. She termed the remark an "insult to daughters".
Irani's reaction came even as the HRD ministry on Tuesday prepared to seek explanation from Shah regarding his remark, saying it amounted to "disrespect to women".
Defending himself even as a debate raged on, Shah said: "These reports are completely wrong. I said there is no space for even a single seat in that library. We are not sexist and we also want women empowerment and certainly don't want to segregate our girls.
"In the women's college we have given grants of Rs. 11 lakh so that the library could be improved with air conditioners like in the Maulana Azad library. Every book which is there at Maulana Library is already available online for the girls," he added.
A female student at the university said on condition of anonymity that the issue of women's safety could not be used as a reason for the varsity not allowing them inside the library.
A faculty member, however, said it was unnecessary to blow up the issue on gender lines. "The issue isn't that simple. There are girls at AMU who come from conservative Muslim families and then there are gender issues. So it's difficult to balance both," he said.
AMU public relations officer Rahat Abrar, too, said the decision over library access did not arise out of a gender bias. "35% girls study in AMU, much more than any other college," he said, insisting the varsity had a favourable environment for female students.

Chhattisgarh: Botched sterilisations kill 9 women  4 docs suspendedEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Even though it means missing an opportunity to gain sales, dozens of retailers are again taking a stand and keeping their doors shut to give their workers a break and their reputations a boost.
They're pushing back against "Black Friday creep," in which the historic kickstart to the holiday shopping and deal season has been getting earlier and earlier until stores started opening on Thursday.
According to a National Retail Federation survey, of those consumers who have or will go shopping during the Thanksgiving holiday times, 31.8 percent said they planned to go shopping on Thursday.
But they won't be showing up at any of these stores. The growing list of retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving this year includes American Girl, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath and Beyond, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Burlington Coat Factory, Costco, Crate & Barrel, Dillard’s, DSW, GameStop, Hobby Lobby, HomeGoods, Home Depot, Jo Ann Fabrics, Lowe’s, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Petco, Pier 1, Publix, REI, Sam’s Club, Sur La Table, Talbots, T.J. Maxx, and Von Maur Department Stores.
Last year, home improvement chain Menard's took out full-page ads just to advertise that they'll be closed on Thanksgiving.
Video: Sears, Macy’s and Kmart and announced last year they they would be opening their doors on Thanksgiving day. NBC News’ Stephanie Gosk filed this report in 2013.
Retailers who do keep the doors shuttered say they're recognizing the value of family.
"First, we want our associates to have that time to spend with family," said Tara Raddohl, a Sam's Club spokeswoman, "Second, our members have told us they want that day to spend with their loved ones."
It's so against the trend that one chain had to start sending out press releases just to deal with the influx of media attention they received for not opening on Thanksgiving.
“Some of life’s most cherished traditions begin with family and friends. As a family-owned business since 1872, we value most the opportunity to spend quality time with loved ones on Thanksgiving and other holidays,” said Jim von Maur, president of Von Maur, an Iowa-based department store chain with 30 stores in 14 states, in the press release.
"The exceptional service and character our associates display day in and day out has been shaped by the likes of their parents, grandparents and friends," he said. "Giving them the opportunity to spend the holidays with those who have made such a lasting impact on their lives is a tradition we’ll never break."
Melody Wright, the store's Chief Operating Officer, questions whether stores that open on Thanksgiving are even making any more money.
"Most consumers say I have to spend X dollars and this is where I'm going to get it," she said. That amount is going to be the same whether it's spent on Thanksgiving, or four days before Christmas, she said.
A tiny camera hidden at the front door of over 1,000 retailers to count who comes and goes agrees. Last year, data from these ShopperTrak devices showed there was about the same number of shoppers going into stores on Thanksgiving as a normal Thursday in November, said company founder Bill Martin.
"They're getting sales on Thursday at the sacrifice of Friday, Saturday or Sunday," said Martin.
Because of the deals they have to offer to induce shoppers and because of overhead costs, "they're not making a lot of money as a result," he said.
Despite this, many stores, fearful that customers' wallets will be emptied by another store opening for Black Friday before they do, have continued an opening-hours arms race that accelerated during the recent economic downturn.
Target, Macy's, Kohl's, Sears and other retailers have announced opening hours of 6 p.m. J.C. Penney has tried to beat them all by opening at 5 p.m. This week, beleaguered electronics store RadioShack said they'll be opening at 8 a.m.
Their shoppers won't be visiting any of Von Maur's stores the same day. That's fine by Wright.
"If that means we make less profit on that particular day, we're willing to live with that," she said. "We've never been tempted that you would sacrifice the importance of family and holiday tradition and try to convince yourself that it will be more profitable."

ESPNs condemnation of Artie LangeBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 11 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Artie Lange on SiriusXM last month. (Anna Webber/Getty Images for SiriusXM)
Last week, the comedian Artie Lange, apparently short on material, decided to live-tweet an elaborate and racially charged sexual fantasy about ESPN2 “First Take” hostess Cari Champion. The response to Lange’s little bit of performance art followed what is by now a predictable pattern: Comedy Central canceled Lange’s upcoming booking on its late show “@midnight ” and  ESPN barred him from the network.  Lange ( who has struggled with mental illness and addiction ) has both apologized and painted himself as a victim of political correctness, trying to strike a delicate balance between his corporate employers and his decidedly rowdier fan base.
But even well-established cycles can throw off interesting new insights, and l’affaire Lange is no exception. Roxane Gay made the sharp point that “It wasn’t enough that [Lange] made his desire public. He had to place it directly in view of the object of his temporary affection,” assuming that Champion would be interested in his desires. The writer and comedian Lindy West argued that there was something extraordinary about Lange’s acknowledgement that he is operating in a different market than the one he came up in, one where outsider voices are now allowed to say, “This world is mine as much as it is yours.”
What was most striking to me, though, about the news cycle that followed was ESPN stepping up to defend Champion and the terms in which the network phrased its response. “His comments were reprehensible and no one should be subjected to such hateful language,” ESPN said in an official statement on behalf of the company as a whole . “They objectify and demean one of our valued employees under the thin guise of ‘comedy’ and are offensive to all of us. We will not dignify them with any other comment.”
Sports broadcasting has a long and risky tradition of treating female reporters as objects rather than as newsgatherers. It is a tradition to hire attractive women as sideline reporters , and different networks and different programs tend to require varying   levels of journalistic competence and doggedness from the people who hold those roles. Even if the networks are sending pros out on the field to get real stories, the idea that physical appearance is a significant qualification diminishes the reporting of real journalists, and it reinforces the idea that all women on sports broadcasts exist at least in part to act as decoration.
Champion is not the first female broadcaster to experience the ugly consequences of what happens when an observer takes that idea to its logical conclusion. In 2010, a man who stalked reporter Erin Andrews and recorded clandestine nude videos of her without her consent was sentenced to prison . Lange did not commit a crime against Champion, but unlike Andrews’s stalker, Lange made his audience complicit in his act of Twitter voyeurism.
ESPN likely spoke up about Lange’s harassment of Champion because Lange is a public figure with a significant following. To let his comments go unacknowledged would suggest to a very large audience that his behavior is all right, that female reporters really are objects to be done with and spoken about if they were not human.
But Twitter and other social media platforms make it exceptionally easy for people without Lange’s follower count to make themselves seen and heard. They, too, can tag Champion on a tweet and make her choose between limiting her use of a valuable platform, doing the work of moderating her mentions and simply absorbing the trash that comes her way. Artie Lange may be a figure worth speaking up against, but plenty of other people can have the same effect.
Increasingly, I think big journalism organizations will have to consider how they want to defend their employees against the worst consequences of a world in which the barriers between the famous and their fans or enemies are lower than ever. Making clear and unambiguous statements against harassment is a high-profile gesture but a very low-cost one. Investing the time and resources to help high-profile employees manage their social media accounts is a rather more significant commitment.
And changing the perception that female reporters are really on sports TV to be attractive? That is a whole new ballgame.

NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman's return to Earth means that humanity is without a social media guru in space. But fear not, for soon another American astronaut, Terry Virts, will make the journey to the cosmos, and from the looks of it, his social media game is strong.
Wiseman (aka @Astro_Reid ) spent more than five months on the International Space Station conducting research and helping to care for the station — oh, and taking amazing selfies and epic landscape shots. He became the Internet's space darling . Wiseman even took the first space Vine !

He returned Sunday with German Alexander Gerst (aka @Astro_Alex , a pretty decent social media space guy himself) and Russian commander Maxim Suraev.
Virts blasts off for the ISS on Nov. 23 and will be aboard the space station for more than five months. He will conduct at least two spacewalks during that time, according to NASA , while also helping to support hundreds of experiments in the station's laboratory.
But before he departs our planet, Virts has been in Russia training with his crew-mates -- an astronaut from the European Space Agency and another from the Russian Federal Space Agency. Virts, aka @AstroTerry , has been tweeting and 'gramming photos of his final weeks on Earth, which leads us to expect great things from him once he begins his orbit.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

How AT&T Can Make Your Life MiserableI Experienced The Dreaded AT&T 'Throttling' Firsthand
Posted:
reddit
Last month, when I was in California for a work trip, my phone suddenly became useless. Even though I was in downtown San Francisco, the data connection was so slow that it was pretty much impossible to download email, use apps, browse the Web or load photos on Instagram.
I was being "throttled." AT&T had deliberately slowed down my data speed because I used more than five gigabytes during a billing cycle, even though I have had an unlimited data plan since 2009. (AT&T no longer offers unlimited data plans, but I have renewed my contract, so I've been allowed to keep it.)
AT&T began throttling in 2011. But the policy was thrust into the spotlight this week, when the Federal Trade Commission sued the telecom giant for slowing data speeds, sometimes by more than 90 percent, for unlimited data customers without "adequately disclos[ing]" the policy.
“AT&T promised its customers ‘unlimited’ data, and in many instances, it has failed to deliver on that promise,” FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement announcing the lawsuit . “The issue here is simple: ‘unlimited’ means unlimited.”
AT&T shot back, calling the suit "baseless" and pointing to a press release and "2,000" subsequent news articles when the company made the changes in 2011.
"[B]efore any customer is affected, they are also notified by text message," Wayne Watts, AT&T's senior executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement Tuesday.
The FTC said AT&T has throttled 3.5 million customers a total of 25 million times. I'm one of those customers.
Here's the thing. Even though I've gone over five gigabytes in four of the last five months, I've only gotten one text message from AT&T warning me that I was approaching the threshold. That was in May. Last month, my phone slowed without warning.
When I reached out to AT&T about why I only got a text message that first time, and I didn't get a text message each time I approached five gigabytes in a month, the company pointed to an obscure page on its website informing customers that their "speeds may be reduced without another text message reminder."
The company also said I had received a notice with my bill in summer 2011 announcing the changes. But as the FTC points out in its lawsuit , the notice doesn't "disclose the degree to which the customers’ data speed would be reduced,
and the impact that the reduced speed would have on customers’ ability to use their device."
"We stand by the statement from earlier this week," Mark Siegel, AT&T's executive director of media relations, told The Huffington Post in a phone call. "And we stand by what is available on our public website about how we handle our unlimited data customers."
AT&T could easily send texts each time customers approach the five gigabyte threshold. After all, the company sends texts when your bill is due, when it's paid, if you are going over your voice minutes and when it's added a cell tower in your area. Or it could send an email. I've received at least seven emails from AT&T this month, five for promotions or trying to get me to upgrade.
But throttling is something AT&T appears to want to keep quiet. Researchers hired by the company to conduct focus groups about throttling suggested not talking too much about it, according to the FTC lawsuit.
From the FTC lawsuit :
The researchers observed that “[t]he more consumers talked about it the more they didn’t like it.” This led the researchers to advise that “[s]aying less is more, [so] don’t say too much” in marketing communications concerning such a program.
AT&T says it throttles customers to manage network congestion. But the FTC says throttling happens even when the network isn't congested. AT&T doesn't throttle those people on its other data plans who use significant amounts of data, the FTC says in the lawsuit.
AT&T seems to use throttling to encourage unlimited data customers to sign up for tiered data plans, which make them pay for as much data as they use and can be more expensive for heavy users. Those who quit AT&T's unlimited data plans, the FTC points out, have been hit with early termination fees in the hundreds of dollars.
Verizon also has customers holding onto unlimited data plans, even though it doesn't offer them anymore. The company announced over the summer that it would throttle heavy unlimited data users during peak times, but backed off after receiving widespread criticism, including from the chairman of the FCC .
Unlimited data customers are not as valuable to the companies as those with tiered plans because they will pay the same each month regardless of how much data they use, forever. Data use is predicted to explode to 9.1 gigabytes a month in 2018, from 1.4 gigabytes per month last year, according to Cisco .
Bekim Ukperaj, who works at a golf course in Stamford, Connecticut, and admitted he uses his phone "a lot," said he regularly exceeds five gigabytes of monthly data and is throttled. AT&T said it sent Ukperaj two text messages in January 2013 as he neared the data threshold, and included the throttling notice in his bill in 2011. But Ukperaj said he doesn't remember any notification that he was nearing five gigabytes. He now uses a tool on his LG G2 smartphone to alert him when he's getting close.
"A warning would have been nice in all those previous months I didn't alert myself," Ukperaj said, adding that sometimes his phone was useless for weeks while it was throttled. Ukperaj said that when he renewed his unlimited data contract in December, AT&T representatives didn't warn him that he could be throttled. "You'd think that if you renewed your contract, they'd say something more about the data limiting," Ukperaj said.
AT&T's 4G LTE network typically has download speeds of five to 12 megabits per second (Mbps), according to the FTC. When I was throttled in September, my download speed was cut to a slow 0.17 Mbps, rendering most of the functions on my smartphone useless.
Results of a speedtest while being throttled (left) and before being throttled (right).
"You're looking at data speeds that pretty much predate the smartphone era," Bill Menezes, an analyst who specializes in mobile networks at Gartner, the technology research firm, said when he reviewed the results of the speed test I conducted while being throttled in September.
Frank Guido, a Staten Island, N.Y.-based photographer, was so frustrated with his throttled data speed of 0.46mbps that after dealing with it for only two days he called AT&T and switched to a data plan he now shares with family.
"I'm away from home days at a time for my job so I can't live on Edge speed," he said, referring to the older, slower network.
He was an AT&T unlimited data subscriber who regularly went over five gigabytes a month, though he only first noticed his phone's data connection was slow over the weekend. He said that he has never received a text message or an email telling him he'd get throttled if he went over a certain number of gigabytes.
But after the FTC lawsuit was announced, he called to switch back to his unlimited data plan. Because AT&T no longer offers the plan, his request has to be approved by management. He'll find out in early November if AT&T approved the switch.

This Is What Our Cash Could Look Like If It Didn t Celebrate Dead  White Menreddit
Americans swap photos of dead politicians for goods and services every day. If those same images are starting to bore you, designer Travis Purrington offers an innovative alternative design.
As part of a master's thesis design project at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland, Purrington developed new versions of U.S. currency. He based his designs on his study of other world currencies and America's currency history.
Purrington told The Huffington Post that, in his research, he found that the nation's founders did not intend to be immortalized on bills, as they saw the practice as "monarchical." In fact, most of the figures on our current bills were not added until the early 1900s . Purrington said it only seems right that our currency should focus on modernized American ideals and virtues instead.
"This isn't to dissolve the proud history of the USA," Purrington wrote in an email to HuffPost. "But the original Congress saw a danger in venerating men on money."
The $1 bill is notably absent from Purrington's designs. Some advocacy groups have said that using a dollar coin instead of a bill would save the government lots of money.
Purrington's bills vary slightly in size, much like the Euro system, which makes it easier to see how much money you have in your wallet.
Take a look at his redesigns. Remember, these are just hypothetical, and Purrington is in no way affiliated with the U.S. government. But still, we can always dream.

Raising Rich Kids: Money and the Teenage BrainCyndi Lauper had a hit in the 1980s called "Money Changes Everything." She has a point. It may or may not buy happiness, but access to money does change things, including endowing the person with power.
Now, take a teenager and give them that power. What happens?
Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan and other teen stars who have crashed to earth in a shower of tabloid sparks, may only be doing what a great many teenagers would be doing -- if they could.
There are teenagers like Justin Bieber on every block. But imagine the kid who cuts your lawn suddenly being rich.
The same teen brain that convinces its host that he won't get caught if he throws a party at the house while mom and dad are away now lives in a mansion, with a Lamborghini outside. Woohoo!
It's long been said that by age 5 or 6, a child's brain is 95 percent of its adult size . But neuroscientists, enlightened by MRI technology, are discovering it is still changing -- creating connections, adding and shedding cells. That process is particularly active in the prefrontal cortex -- the part that makes judgments like drag racing through residential neighborhoods.
Dr. Jay Giedd at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, led studies that found the teen brain development was a process of adding and pruning. Significantly, he said, brain cells at that age are influenced by what the teen does. If they play sports or music, the brain cells will make connections that help with that. If they sit on the couch and play video games or are shopping all the time, then the cells will be hardwired for those activities.
The only real moderating influence -- as it is for any teenager -- is the parents. But instilling discipline and values can be a daunting exercise for some parents. For a whole host of reasons it is difficult for some parents to tell their child they can't buy the latest Prada handbag or have the car at night.
Some parents -- like the Lohans -- are simply not up to the job. Others -- like the parents of Britney Spears or Amanda Bynes -- may have had their job complicated by what appear to be mental problems.
Still, for every Justin Bieber, there is a Ron Howard, Natalie Portman or Jodie Foster -- child stars who navigated the rocky shoals of teen years into successful adulthood. Actor Rance Howard, in an interview, said he raised well-adjusted child star sons, Clint and Academy-award winning Ron, by removing their money from the family's life.
Let's hope rich kids will find their way. But romping in a mountain of money like most kids play in a pile of leaves -- and in the case of celebrities who are surrounded by an entourage of dependent cheerleaders --  will not make it easy. As the developing cells of the teenage brain react to the world around them -- money does change everything.

Govt support needed to counter China abroad: MittalPTI Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Enterprises, delivering the keynote address at the India Global Forum in New Delhi on Monday.

economy, business and finance
Indian companies will need active help from the new government in expanding overseas, but such support has been lacking in the past as against China, which has always put its might behind its enterprises, industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal said on Monday.
“We are facing might of Chinese state wherever we go abroad,” said Mr. Mittal.
Mr. Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of USD 100 million for a project.
“I conveyed it in MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and officers in PMO (Prime Minister Office) but nothing moved after that. I could only convey. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of USD 1 billion to Sri Lanka, which helped its companies,” Mittal said at the India Global Forum in Delhi.
He said Indian companies started venturing abroad and investing big after Tata acquired European steel firm Corus in 2006 and soon it was followed by acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.
“Indian companies are making big investments abroad. Some of them are extremely successful, some moderate and some are in the process. In Africa, I have seen good amount of goodwill for India. Though we cannot match the amount of money they (China) commit in Africa but government can support Indian businesses there,” Mr. Mittal said.
Mr. Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the new government but more needs to be done.
Wockhardt Chairman Habil Khorakiwala said that Indian companies have brought down price of HIV drugs by about 98 per cent in Africa, which was earlier unaffordable for people there.

The difficult art of economic diversificationThe difficult art of economic diversification
CP CHANDRASEKHAR
Indonesia provides a stark example of an economy that diversified its pattern of trade and domestic production, only to relapse back into a dependence on primary exports
November 10, 2014:  
Indonesia, like India, has a brand new government. Expectations are running high for the new President Joko Widono (or Jokowi, as he is popularly known) who has promised not only to restore output growth to the high rates previously experienced before the latest downturn, but also to do so cheaply (in fiscal terms).
The economic recovery is widely expected to come about through measures such as ending corruption and easing the rules for doing business so as to attract new foreign investment.
Meanwhile, the poor are to be assisted through an expanded programme of social transfers and protection in terms of health insurance and similar measures.
How successful such a strategy will be in achieving its declared goals is yet to be seen.
Yet, it is important to remember that output growth per se cannot and should not be the aim, especially if it is speedily shown to be unsustainable because of reflecting boom-bust commodity or credit cycles, or if it is not associated with a sustained diversification away from primary production that is necessary for improving aggregate labour productivity and wage incomes.
In this matter, there are salutary lessons to be drawn not only from other developing countries, but from Indonesia’s own experience over the past three decades.
Manufacturing concerns
Historically, Indonesia was an exporter of primary commodities, dominantly fuel as well as agricultural goods such as rubber and palm oil.
In the period from 1980 to just before the East Asian crisis of 1997-98; however, it experienced a significant increase in the share of relatively labour-intensive manufactured goods exports.
These were dominantly textiles and clothing, footwear and furniture, but there were also some “high-tech” manufactured goods such as electronic goods and components and some machinery.
As Chart 1 shows, this meant an increase in the share of manufactured goods to total merchandise exports from only 2 per cent in 1980 to more than 50 per cent just before the Asian crisis.
That crisis affected the Indonesian economy drastically, causing massive declines in output and increases in poverty.
But it also had longer term effects on the very structure of the economy, reflected not only in varying trends of savings and investment ratios but also in the composition of trade.
Thus, after a slight spurt around the year 2000, the share of manufactured goods in total merchandise exports has been declining continuously.
The share fell from more than 56 per cent in 2000 to only 34 per cent in 2011. (Data are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators online.)
A serious decline
Chart 2 shows how the absolute rate of growth of such manufacturing exports, which had been incredibly dynamic at more than 40 per cent annual increase (in US dollar terms) in the boom period of 1986-92, slowed down considerably thereafter.
In the most recent year, there has even been an absolute decline. This is true also for labour-intensive exports such as textile and garments, in which Indonesia’s recent poor performance cannot be blamed only on globally depressed demand, since several Asian competitors have done much better despite that.
Chart 3 suggests that the relative decline of manufacturing was more serious, because it also affected the so-called “high tech” manufacturing exports, whose share of total manufacturing exports first rose until the turn of the century and then stagnated and subsequently fell.
Remarkably, an economy that had seemed to achieve a significant degree of productive transformation in terms of moving away from low value-added primary production to manufacturing, relapsed back into dependence upon primary goods, albeit a slightly different set of such goods compared to earlier.
While fuel exports had dominated the previous era, their recent expansion reflected global price rises rather than increased oil and natural gas production.
Indeed, the country is now a net importer of fuel, rather than a net exporter.
However, exports of palm oil and various agricultural raw materials, as well as of coal, have risen rapidly and become more important than ever.
With manufacturing now accounting for only around one third of total goods exports, and high tech exports forming a dwindling share of even those, Indonesia has once again become an economy dependent on primary production.
Lessons of the fall
So what happened? Three apparently unrelated processes worked to effect this trend, with two of them related to policy choices.
First, the Asian crisis led to significant financial liberalisation in the worst affected countries.
Indonesia had an open capital account ever since Suharto’s coup in 1966, but the extensive deregulation of domestic finance after 2008, the major offers to liberalise financial services made under the GATS and the opening up of the economy to foreign purchasers of domestic assets such as land and real estate as well as securities led eventually to capital inflows that were directed not to productive investment but to capital gains.
Second, this was then combined with the global boom in primary commodities, led by substantially increased demand from China.
This created a boom in certain sectors, both mineral and agricultural. Indonesia therefore experienced a Dutch Disease of sorts, whereby the combination of capital inflows and a commodities boom generated higher real exchange rates and caused a shift in incentives away from tradeable to non-tradeable activities.
This put further pressure on manufacturing production for exports and for domestic consumption.
Third, the further liberalisation of trade within the ASEAN community – and the ASEAN trade deal with China – involved additional trade liberalisation that increased the import intensity of both domestic production and consumption.
Despite the fact that Indonesia has a potentially very large domestic market, domestic production of a very wide range of manufactured goods is no longer competitive or viable.
Because this in turn means dynamic losses in terms of learning and productivity improvements, it becomes even harder to revive manufacturing under such conditions.
Indonesia therefore provides an object lesson for developing countries, of the difficulties in sustaining a process of economic diversification to move the economy and employment to higher value added activities.
It will be interesting to see how many countries actually learn from this lesson, including Indonesia herself.

Apple security flaw sets stock on fireApple security flaw sets stock on fire

AFP/Getty
A new major security flaw found with Apple (AAPL) operating systems Monday is lifting shares of the company that found the problem.
Shares of FireEye (FEYE) closed up $1.61, or 5.3%, to $32.23 after the security company discovered the latest and potentially most dangerous security problem with Apple’s operating systems that power iPhones.
The flaw, present in both iOS7 and iOS8 allow hackers to easily steal user’s personal data. The attack, which FireEye calls a “Masque Attack” allows hackers to install software on Apple devices. This attack comes just after last week’s WireLurker attack that also breaks through Apple’s security to steal users’ data.
This rash of security problems comes at a bad time for Apple, as the company attempts to convince users to entrust it with critical financial payment data — not just emails and contact lists. Savvy marketing has long convinced Apple devices are immune to security problems — a belief that continues to erode as Apple market share increases and the devices become a more attractive target to hackers.
Apple investors, though, remain undisturbed and keep sending the stock to all-time highs. Shares of Apple fell a bit Monday by 15 cents to $108.86.

Dozens Dead In Nigeria School Bombing AttackBombing At Nigerian School Assembly Leaves Dozens Dead, Including Students
 | By                                                                ADAMU ADAMU and MICHELLE FAUL

POTISKUM, Nigeria (AP) — Disguised in a school uniform, a suicide bomber set off explosives hidden in a backpack during an assembly Monday at a high school in northern Nigeria, killing at least 48 students and wounding 79 others.
It was the latest attack by suspected Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls earlier this year.
Soldiers rushed to the grisly scene, spattered with body parts, but were chased away by a stone-throwing crowd angry at the military's inability to halt a 5-year-old Islamic insurgency that has targeted schools and killed thousands.
The Islamic militants — whose name means "Western education is sinful" in the local Hausa language — have intensified the tempo and deadliness of attacks since the government announced last month that the group had agreed to a cease-fire and that the schoolgirls would be released imminently. Boko Haram's leader has denied any cease-fire deal and the girls have not been set free.
Monday's bombing came one week after a suicide attack in Potiskum, the capital of Yobe state, killed 30 people taking part in a religious procession by moderate Muslims.
Some 2,000 students had gathered for a weekly assembly at the Government Technical Science College when the explosion ripped through the school hall, survivors said.
"We were waiting for the principal to address us, around 7:30 a.m., when we heard a deafening sound and I was blown off my feet. People started screaming and running. I saw blood all over my body," 17-year-old student Musa Ibrahim Yahaya said from his hospital bed, where he was being treated for head wounds.
Survivors said the bomber hid the explosives in a type of backpack popular with students. Months ago Nigeria's military reported finding a bomb factory where explosives were being sewn into backpacks in the northern city of Kano.
Hospital records showed 48 bodies and many body parts were brought to the morgue. Seventy-nine students were admitted, many with serious injuries that may require amputations, health workers said. The hospital was so overcrowded that some patients were crammed two to a bed.
The victims all appeared to be between the ages of 11 and 20, a morgue attendant said.
The U.S. strongly condemned the attack.
"Our sympathies and thoughts are with the victims and their families of these latest egregious assaults on innocent civilians by those bent on fomenting violence, extremism and insecurity in northeastern Nigeria and the region," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the suicide bombing and expressed outrage at "the frequency and brutality of attacks against educational institutions in the north," U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said.
"These repeated and relentless attacks on children and schools are attacks on the future of Nigeria, a country that already has the largest number of children out of school in the world," UNICEF said.
Ban demanded an immediate halt to "these abominable crimes" and called for the perpetrators to be swiftly brought to justice and adequate security measures to protect civilians, Haq said.
The Yobe state government ordered the immediate closure of all government schools in the area.
Potiskum was once the home of one of Africa's biggest cattle markets and a booming grain market that attracted traders from neighboring countries before a state of emergency was declared in May 2013 in Yobe and two other northern Nigerian states, where Boko Haram has attacked schools and villages and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in its fight to impose an Islamic state.
Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam said he was heartbroken by the loss of life during Monday's attack, and denounced the failure of emergency rule. "Instead of forcing insurgents and criminals to flee, the insurgents are forcing innocent people to flee and making life miserable," he said.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan owes an urgent explanation to people living under a state of emergency while attacks increase, the governor said.
Garba Alhaji, the father of one of the wounded students, said the high school did not have proper security. "I strongly blame the Yobe state government for not fencing the school," he said, adding that just three months ago a bomb was discovered in the school and removed by an anti-bomb squad.
The government of Jonathan, who is running for re-election in February, has promised more security for schools.
Boko Haram attracted international outrage with the April kidnapping of 276 mostly Christian schoolgirls as they were taking exams at a boarding school in northern Nigeria. Dozens of the girls managed to escape, but 219 remain missing. Boko Haram has said that the girls have all converted to Islam and been married off to extremist fighters.
Many Nigerians are angry that Boko Haram has increased attacks and bombings since Oct. 17, when the government claimed to have brokered a cease-fire. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has denied negotiating a truce.

Snapdeal -- the Flourishing Company America Passed On -- Offers a Lesson About Immigration Reformreddit
After graduating from Wharton in 2007, Kunal Bahl wanted to become an entrepreneur. He couldn't get a visa, so he had to return home to India. He started Snapdeal in February 2010 with the ambition of building India's Groupon. Then he saw an even greater opportunity -- to turn Snapdeal into India's Amazon.com. Snapdeal already has more than 25 million customers and sells goods from 50,000 merchants. With the $625 million that Japan's Softbank has just invested in it, it is surely on its way.
The sad part for America is that instead of creating jobs here -- where he really wanted to be -- Bahl created thousands of jobs in India. Bahl is no longer looking to U.S. companies as his model. His new goal is to build the Indian version of Alibaba, the innovative Chinese ecommerce marketplace, which enjoys market capitalization of $275 billion. As Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, is doing, Bahl is pondering which Silicon Valley companies to acquire. Over drinks at the INK India conference in Mumbai last weekend, Bahl and I discussed the pros and cons of Snapdeal's acquiring Groupon, which has market capitalization of around $5 billion. We agreed that there were better Silicon Valley companies to acquire -- and that he should think bigger.
Gone are the days when the United States was the only land of opportunity and when entrepreneurs dreamed of being acquired by a Silicon Valley company. The bigger opportunities now lie in countries such as India, China, and Brazil, and their entrepreneurs are becoming confident that they can take on Silicon Valley. The world's best and brightest students once came to study in the United States with the expectation of starting their careers and settling here. Now, upon graduation, they buy one-way tickets home.
The immigration gridlock has already hurt U.S. competitiveness and will worsen the damage if our political leaders don't soon reach a compromise. The good news is that with the Republican Senate victory, immigration reform may finally have a chance.
Contrary to popular belief, it isn't the Republicans who have been the barrier to skilled immigration, it is the Democrats -- because they demanded all or nothing, without compromise. Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.), chairman of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, confirmed this to me in an online debate . He insisted that his party would not agree to increase the numbers of visas for skilled workers unless the Republicans agreed to legalize the more than 10 million immigrants who are in the country without documentation. To make matters worse, the Democrats insisted on a path to citizenship for the undocumented, and this turned the legislation into a poison pill that the Republicans simply would not swallow.
What the president needs to do now is to end the stalemate. He needs to support smaller pieces of legislation on matters in which the parties are in agreement. He shouldn't poison the waters further with tactical executive orders that put Band-Aids on the immigration mess; he should carve immigration up into pieces that are debated on their individual merits. Agreement is possible.
Both sides realize the importance of having more technology companies, so legislation such as the Startup Visa Act should be a no-brainer. It will allow entrepreneurs such as Kunal Bahl to start their companies in the United States and create local jobs. There is as well broad support for providing permanent-resident visas to science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates. And then there is the issue of H1B visas for experienced engineers, doctors, and scientists. If abuse of the system can be curbed, there will be broad support for expanding the numbers of visas. The Startup Visa alone could create as many as 1.6 million jobs and boost the nation's annual gross domestic product by 1.6 percent within 10 years, according to the Kauffman Foundation's estimate . Providing permanent resident visas to the more than one million people who are stuck in immigration limbo will allow them to buy houses and invest in their communities. Increasing the numbers of H1Bs will help to alleviate the shortage of doctors in some parts of the United States and allow Silicon Valley to hire the talent it desperately needs.
The most contentious debates are over the plight of the undocumented, low-skilled workers. The Republicans and Democrats have both, in the past, supported the DREAM Act -- which provides basic human rights to the millions of undocumented children who live in the shadows of U.S. society. If presented with stand-alone legislation, the majority of our political leaders would surely support this. As well, both sides agree that it is impractical to deport 10 million undocumented immigrants. Compromises are possible, for example, with a new visa class that allows these people to stay in the United States legally, pay taxes, and return home when they need to. The issue of citizenship could be deferred for a few years until the wounds of the immigration battles have healed and Americans can reach for consensus on what is right and what is wrong. The immediate outcome for America and Americans in general will be very beneficial.
It's time for the political quagmire and stalemate to give way to compromise and good governance. Immigration reform surely cannot wait. President Obama should turn his party's Senate defeat into a victory for America.

After the Icy Handshake  What Comes Nextreddit
No one can mistake it for a budding bromance. When Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe posed for a photo-op while shaking hands on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, both appeared as if they would rather be anywhere else. But for now questions of discomfort are unimportant; rather, the significance lies in the fact that they met and expressed willingness to manage differences for the sake of healthier bilateral ties, which in the past two years have repeatedly plunged to new lows.
It may, for the moment, be a triumph of protocol over substance, but make no mistake: This meeting was a vital first step in thawing Sino-Japanese relations and lessening the potential for spiraling distrust between the world's second and third largest economies. The trick now is to build on it.
At the beginning of this year, it was unimaginable that Xi and Abe would ever agree to be photographed side by side. Bilateral ties, already in prolonged distress due to an intractable island sovereignty dispute, were in precipitous decline after China claimed an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea and Abe visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which commemorates Japan's war-dead, including World War II war criminals. After that, Beijing declared that Abe's actions had shut the door for dialogue.
The turnabout began in the middle of this year, when some in China began cautioning that hardline treatment of Japan might have significant costs. Japanese investment in China had plummeted and begun to migrate to Southeast Asia. Japan's direct investment in China fell by nearly a fifth in 2013, then dropped another 40 percent during the first half of 2014 from a year earlier.
Further, and partly capitalizing on Japanese anxiety about China's intentions, Abe advanced a controversial, muscular security agenda, building a stronger Self-Defense Force with fewer constitutional constraints and a freer hand to aid allies. In those moves, Beijing saw a more formidable regional rival emerging.
A diplomatic flurry then occurred, culminating in a four-point communiqué issued just before Xi and Abe met. The document states that the two sides acknowledge their different views on the disputed islands, which China calls Diaoyu and Japan calls Senkaku, and share "some recognition" on how to treat issues related to wartime history.
The communiqué is a classic product of diplomacy, as its vague language on the island dispute and subtle references to history are open to such varied interpretations that both sides can claim victory and deny concessions. That both issues were mentioned at all, however, given sensitivities in both Beijing and Tokyo, suggests that a basis exists on which more substantive talks can be developed.
Indeed, the most immediate effect of the Xi-Abe summit and the communiqué is the freeing up of room for political, diplomatic, security, economic and cultural exchanges. "We will be busy again receiving Japanese visitors", said a Chinese analyst at a think-tank specializing in Sino-Japanese relations. He went on to confess that for two years it had been considered too politically risky in China to engage Japan.
Another near-term dividend is the restart of talks to establish mechanisms aimed at avoiding accidental clashes between the Asia's two most powerful militaries. Their frigates and fighter jets have had numerous close encounters in the East China Sea, with each accusing the other of provocative maneuvers. Relying on the odds of an accident not occurring might have seemed to both an increasingly fraught strategy.
Two years ago, China and Japan were close to setting up a system synchronizing communications between defense ministries, command centers and frontline mariners and pilots, but Beijing suspended these talks when the island dispute reignited. With the slight thaw in political relations, China has relented and negotiations are said to be restarting by year's end.
The latest diplomatic breakthrough, on one level, might seem straight out of the worn playbook both China and Japan draw from in managing their frequent bilateral spats. But getting through from crisis to crisis is no longer enough to stem the long-term deterioration in bilateral ties as structural fault lines have developed and the stakes mounted.
Both sides view each other with deepening strategic mistrust. Beijing sees Abe's security agenda -- together with Washington's "pivot" to Asia -- as aimed at containment of China. Tokyo is far from assured that China's rapid military buildup is intended only for defense and is anxious that Beijing ultimately aspires to subvert the existing regional order and impose hegemonic rule. Strategic rivalry continues as the two countries compete for contracts, partnerships and hearts and minds in Asia-Pacific and beyond.
Now that Xi and Abe have had their icy handshake, China and Japan need to move forward. Hotlines are necessary, but so is continued leadership: for President Xi, to ensure that anti-Japanese nationalism does not dictate policy towards Tokyo; for Prime Minister Abe, to tamp down tendencies towards historical revisionism.
Not staggering moves, perhaps, but they would constitute definite progress.  And the region -- and the world -- would eagerly welcome them.

Dubious Digits: Is This Data Really That Accuratereddit
When numbers of any sort are presented, whether in mathematics, science, business, government or finance, the default assumption is that the data presented are reasonably reliable to the last digit presented. Thus, if a light bulb is listed as using 3.14 watts, then its actual usage is presumably between 3.13 and 3.15 watts, and certainly not 2.8 or 4.2 watts. Or if the average interest rate paid on a set of securities is listed as 2.718 percent, then a reasonable reader presumes that the actual figure is between 2.717 and 2.719 percent.
The total number of significant digits can vary widely, depending on context. Some studies require enormous precision -- the present authors have published research studies requiring numbers to be computed to tens of thousands of digits. In other contexts, only one or two digit accuracy is appropriate. In all these fields, presenting data to more digits of accuracy than is appropriate from the context can be deeply misleading, conveying much more reliability than is really present in the data.
Oil prices in 2040
The current authors got a good chuckle recently at a November 6, 2014 press report on the latest release of OPEC's World Oil Outlook . This press report noted that
By 2025, the nominal price will have hit $123.90, rising steadily to $177.40 by 2040. In real or inflation-adjusted terms the price will fall to $95.40 by 2020 and hit $101.60 by 2040, OPEC predicts.
Similarly over-precise figures from the OPEC report were presented in some other press reports, including at least one in a U.S. source . To double-check these figures, we checked the actual 2014 OPEC report, World Oil Outlook . Sure enough, these figures (including those in the quote above) are given there, on page 32.
With all due respect to the researchers in the OPEC organization, and acknowledging the considerable effort they have devoted to their analyses, it seems to us that such impressive precision in prices projected to 2020, 2025 and 2040 is simply not defensible. It is hard enough to anticipate the price of oil even a few months ahead -- for example, few if any analysts foresaw the huge drop in oil prices in October 2014. Any such predictions of future commodity prices (or stock prices, for that matter) are dependent on a large number of factors, from costs of exploration, refining and shipping, to highly hard-to-quantify effects such as natural disasters, international political events and economic reversals.
What's more, the technology of energy generation is changing rapidly and could drastically affect future oil prices. Already, fracking technology has dramatically increased U.S. oil and natural gas output , and is a major factor for the recent paradoxical drop in oil prices, in spite of horrific political developments in the Middle East. And if any of the incipient developments in fusion energy pan out commercially, which now appears significantly more likely than even a few months ago, then all bets are off -- by 2040, consumption of oil and other fossil fuels may be much lower than today.
In any event, we question the wisdom of repeating these figures, to the same precision, in press reports. An honest and well trained journalist would write something like
By 2025, the nominal price may exceed $120, rising steadily to over $170 by 2040. In real or inflation-adjusted terms the price is projected to fall to about $90 by 2020 and be over $100 by 2040, according to OPEC's estimates.
Press reports of government data
Another reminder of the vagaries of data in the national and international arena was the November 7, 2014 monthly release of employment data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Lost in the good news of the addition of 214,000 nonfarm jobs to the U.S. economy in October, as well as the drop in unemployment rate to just 5.8 percent (in stark contrast to much of Europe, by the way), was the fact, given at the bottom of the report, that the nonfarm employment figure for August had been revised from 180,000 to 203,000, and the figure for September had been revised from 248,000 to 256,000. In other words, an additional 31,000 persons had found work, a fact not mentioned in most press reports we have read. While such adjustments are routine for U.S. employment reports, they underscore the futility in reading too much precision into the monthly released figures -- they invariably will be further refined. So shouldn't this fact be more clearly communicated by the press?
Along this line, on November 4, 2014 the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that in the three months ending in September, exports of goods and services averaged $197.4 billion. Perhaps we do not fully understand the U.S. government's methodology here, but four significant figures for something as fluid as exports of goods and services seems a bit more than what can be statistically justified, particularly in a brief press report that lacks the full context of these figures.
National and international budgets
Citing figures to more precision than is justified, particularly in public news releases that can never be placed in proper context, is hardly a disease limited to North America. For example, the European Commission's financial framework for 2014-2020 lists its total budget as 959,988 million Euros, the sum of similarly precise figures for each of the seven years from 2014 to 2020. These figures are compared with similar figures for the period 2007-2013, also given to five- and six-digit precision. Is this data ever really reliable to this level of accuracy? And even if it is (which we doubt), what is the point of presenting such data to six-digit accuracy in a public overview statement?
Similarly, the Australian recently reported a bank's chief economist as predicting that GDP growth in Australia in the second half of 2014 to average "0.45 per cent" per quarter. Or, with a wink of the eye, should that be 0.46 percent?...
Other dubious digits in the news
It is not hard to find other examples. Here are a few:
On 14 Aug 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau soberly reported that at 2:29 pm, the U.S. population had reached 314,159,265 residents. While on one hard, the present authors were pleased to see the number Pi (= 3.1415926535...) once again in the news, nonetheless it is completely unrealistic to think that the American population can truly be pinned down even to within one million persons, much less to a single soul. Census figures are notoriously disputable, due to factors ranging from the influx or outflow of undocumented workers to the reluctance of some ethnic groups to respond to any census data collection.
Similarly, on 31 Oct 2011, the New York Times reported that the seven billionth human had arrived on the planet, according to the United Nations Statistics Division. At least the Times report quickly added that other organizations, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, had pegged this milestone four months later, roughly in February 2012.
On 5 Nov 2014, the California Policy Center, in a review of several financially stressed California cities, stated that the median income of Ione, California is $34,514. Are they sure this isn't $34,515 (smile)?
On 4 Nov 2014, the Dallas Morning News, quoting the National Association of Realtors, reported that there would be 5.38 million sales of preowned homes in the U.S. in 2016. Or should that be 5.37 million?...
On 5 Mov 2014, the Center for Responsive Politics reported that $113,479,706 was spent in the North Carolina Senate race. Maybe that is the current total, but why present it to nine significant digits?
Summary
While we can all be amused by examples such as those listed above, presenting data to appropriate levels of precision is serious business, particularly in contexts, such as public press communications, science policy, business or finance, where readers may not fully understand the full context, and might reasonably be misled. In particular, falsely precise predictions and/or projections undermine the whole rationale of scientific estimation. It is thus incumbent on the authors and producers of such data to only present data to levels of accuracy that can truly be rigorously justified. Otherwise, one is engaging pseudoscience, at the least, or worse.

Skin cancer treatment costs rose five times faster than for other cancersBy Elahe Izadi November 10 Follow @ElaheIzadi
(J Pat Carter/Associated Press file)
Skin cancer treatment costs skyrocketed in the past decade, rising five times faster than treatment costs for all other cancers, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Between 2002 and 2006, $3.6 billion a year was being spent on skin cancer treatment in the United States; during the following five years, that figure rose to $8.1 billion annually. That's an increase of 126 percent, while treatment costs rose by just 25 percent for all other cancers during the same time period.
The study, published Monday in the  American Journal of Preventive Medicine , underscores just how big of an economic burden skin cancer is to the U.S. health-care system, even though it is considered a mostly preventable disease.
One of the major reasons for this dramatic rise in dollars spent on treating skin cancer: The sheer number of skin cancer patients has also been on the rise, from 3.4 million annually during the first half of the study to almost 5 million from 2007 to 2011.
"It's clear that not enough has been done in terms of skin cancer prevention behaviors," said  Gery Guy of the CDC's Cancer Prevention and Control division and the study's lead author. Researchers looked at both nonmelanoma and the less-common melanoma types of skin cancer. "In a lot of these cases, skin cancer, for the most part, is preventable," Guy said. "We know sun safety and avoiding indoor tanning go a long way."
But it's not just that more people are receiving treatment; the cost per patient has also gone up, as more treatments are taking place in pricier hospital settings. From 2002 to 2006, it cost roughly $1,000 to treat the average skin cancer patient; treatment costs increased to $1,600 per patient during the following five years, according to the CDC study.
Patients may not be feeling the pinch in their own bills, as out-of-pocket costs have decreased slightly, while private health insurance and Medicare are both paying significantly more for skin cancer treatments, according to the study.
While it's been known that certain skin cancer rates have increased, that $8.1 billion figure for annual treatment costs surprised researchers. Measuring those costs "really gives us a sense through prevention efforts, how many cases could be prevented and how many health-care savings to our system could be incurred," Guy said.

Pizza Hut will serve pizzas with a twist in its biggest-ever menu makeover, apparently aimed at wooing 18- to 34-year-old diners, after two years of sagging sales.
The changes, to be unveiled in U.S. outlets on Nov. 19, will go up against customized pizzas with upscale toppings offered by Blaze Pizza, Pie Five, Live Basil and other “build your own” chains that aim to be the Chipotle Mexican Grill of pizza chains.
I only ate at a pizza hut only once and have never returned. Maybe a good place to go if living in small towns that doesn't have real pizza places.

“Our newest changes are the most significant we've made in our history,” said David Gibbs, who was named Pizza Hut global chief executive last week, in a statement.
The new menu includes sriracha, ginger and curry-flavored pizza crusts, with items such as “Hot and Twisted” and “Cock-A-Doodle Bacon,” and “Skinny,” 250-calorie per slice pies.
The 56-year-old chain will update its mobile ordering as well as its logo, delivery boxes and staff uniforms in the revamp. Sixty percent of its roughly 13,400 units are in the United States.
“In today's market, you have to take risks,” said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at restaurant consulting firm Technomic. Still, he added, “it is quite a bit of change in a short period of time.”
The changes appear to take direct aim at so-called Millennial diners, aged 18 to 34, who according to NPD Group spent $95 billion on food service meals and snacks in the United States in the year ending June 2014.
Pizza Hut's challenge is to lure Millennials, who are used to customizing their meals at chains like Chipotle and Subway, without alienating the older diners who are its main customers, Tristano said.
Plano, Texas-based Pizza Hut, which competes with delivery chains such as Domino's Pizza and Papa John's International, will continue selling familiar pizzas such as the Meat Lover's, Stuffed Crust and Supreme.
Domino's menu revamp started about five years ago. It admitted that its pizza fared poorly in taste tests and invited diners to try its new and improved recipe. The strategy worked. Since then, the chain has added pasta and other dishes.
It will be at least six months before the verdict comes back on Pizza Hut's changes, Tristano said.
Chipotle is backing a chain called Pizzeria Locale.

(A RBI deputy governor’s…)
MUMBAI: The Sensex and Nifty hit record intra-day highs on Monday as the expansion of the central council of ministers raised economic reform hopes further but gave up most gains toward the close as investors booked profits.
A RBI deputy governor's statement, indicating little possibility of an interest rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy , weighed on the market. India VIX, the benchmark gauge of protection against stock-market swings, surged nearly 22% intra-day, the year's secondbiggest gain. However, analysts said this was due to some unusual option trading and not a cause for worry.
"Monday's abrupt (jump) in India VIX was due to the sudden rise in option premium of some out-of-money strikes," said Siddarth Bhamre, head, equity derivatives , Angel Broking .
India VIX ended at 13.93, down 1.28%. Defensive stocks such as consumer goods and healthcare led gains as investors turned to safe havens amid a string of record highs on indexes.
The Sensex rose as much as 159 points in the morning session to a record 28,027.96, its fifth all-time high in six sessions, then ended at 27,874.73, six points higher. The Nifty ended at 8344.25, up seven points.
FIIs bought equities worth Rs 355 crore on Monday while domestic institutions sold Rs 315 crore, as per BSE provisional figures. "After a few initial upticks in the index, profit-taking retraced the entire gain. It was seen as a reaction to the statement made by the RBI's deputy governor indicating negligible possibility of a rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy," said Jayant Manglik, president, Religare Securities.
Among the top Sensex gainers, ITC rose 4.27% as the Prime Minister shifted Harsh Vardhan from the health ministry to low-profile science and technology and earth sciences. Vardhan was known for his anti-tobacco statements. This was ITC's biggest single-day gain since September 2013.
Railway stocks such as Texmaco Rail and Titagarh Wagon rallied after the appointment of new railway minister Suresh Prabhu stoked hopes for reforms and investment in the sector. Among the major losers, L&T fell 2% after the company posted earnings that fell below expectations for the quarter ended September. Investors also booked profits in ONGC and Tata Motors , which declined 3.8% and 2.1%, respectively.
Shares of Engineers India declined 12.32% to Rs 237 after company's net profit declined 47.44% to Rs 58.79 crore on a 16.02% fall in net sales to Rs 390.64 crore in the September quarter from the year earlier.

Sad music evokes positive emotions: StudyPeople like listening to sad music because it actually evokes positive emotions such as peacefulness and tenderness, according to a new study.
The study by researchers at the Freie Universitat Berlin involved more than 770 people around the world.
Researchers found that sad music can evoke positive emotions, like peacefulness and tenderness, and offers four distinct rewards, ‘TODAY’ reported.
“People turn to sad music for comfort, and to deal with bad feelings, but also simply for pleasure,” Liila Taruffi, one of the authors, said.
“(Sad music has) potential to regulate negative moods and emotions, as well as to provide consolation. In this sense, sad music can play a role in well-being,” said Taruffi.
The biggest reward turned out to be that sad songs allow you to feel sadness without any of its “real-life implications,” researchers said.
Another important reward was “emotion regulation”. Many respondents said that when they were in a bad mood, experiencing sadness through music made them feel better afterwards and provided an emotional boost.
Taruffi noted that may be because the songs help them to express and release their emotions.
“Sad music promotes and creates a space for reflection and reappraisal of personal experiences, thoughts and feelings,” she added.
The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Sesa Sterlite Expects to Restart Karnataka Iron Ore Mine Soon
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 13:46 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Sesa Sterlite Ltd, India's top private iron ore miner, expects to "soon" resume mining in Karnataka and produce at its court-set limit of 2.29 million tonnes in the year ending March, a company official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The company in August stopped producing from its lone operational mine in the southern state pending the renewal of its licence, exacerbating a shortage of the raw material for users such as JSW Steel Ltd and Kalyani Steels.
JSW is already importing heavily and Kalyani Steels is now considering buying overseas. India was once the third-largest iron ore exporter before curbs on illegal mining choked the industry.
Aniruddha Joshi, a Sesa vice president, said the company's request for forest clearance from the Environment and Forest Ministry was at an "advanced stage" and that the mine's licence was expected to be renewed soon after.
Chaitanya Prasad, a spokesman for the Environment and Forest Ministry, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Following a court imposed ban of more than two years in Karnataka, Sesa restarted mining in the state in December last year, before being asked to stop again in August.
Sesa, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources Plc, produced just 300,000 tonnes from the mine in this fiscal year that began in April.

(Financials is their most…)
NEW DELHI: UBS, which sees the Nifty hitting 9600 levels by the 2015-end, is overweight on banks (private/PSU), oil and gas, power, telecom and media stocks.
Indian financials is their most preferred 'overweight' sector over the next 18 months as lower inflation and declining rates should support earnings growth and asset quality. Valuations remain attractive versus the historical trading range.
They expect private sector banks to gain market share due to their expanding reach, better client offerings and strong capitalisation ratios. State-owned (SOE) banks could benefit in the near term from lower credit costs, though capitalisation levels are a concern.
They are also positive on oil & gas sector. The key reforms rolled-out recently - gas price revision, diesel price deregulation, and potential steps to lower LPG subsidies -- have cleared a lot of policy uncertainties. UBS expects healthy earnings growth visibility for the sector over the next two to three years.
Here is a list of most preferred and least preferred stocks by UBS with a time-frame of 12 months:
The global investment bank is underweight on auto (2 wheeler) and consumer staples, while it is neutral on autos (four wheeler) and the cement sector.
UBS has turned 'underweight' to 'neutral' on consumer discretionary - given their view of a gradual recovery. They expect discretionary to recover moderately, more so in the second half of 2015, and UBS prefers it to consumer staples.
They turned from neutral to UW on IT Services. Revenue momentum seems to be slowing, with even stronger vendors such as TCS and HCL Technologies reporting softer than-expected QoQ growth in Q2 FY15.
UBS expects concerns of a sector-wide slowdown to increase. They believe that the demand cycle could be slower than expected and 2015 IT budgets would be more cautious than the street's current expectations, said the report.
They have turned from UW to neutral on pharmaceuticals. UBS had previously preferred IT services as a potential beneficiary of the rupee depreciation, but with a weaker outlook for IT now, their preferences have reversed.
UBS has also turned from OW to neutral on small and midcaps (SMIDs) - SMIDs had rallied after the elections on hopes that the growth recovery will accelerate. Their valuations relative to the large caps are now near historical highs.

A young person analyzes an older persons analysis of the much-dreaded selfie crazeBy Caitlin Dewey November 11 Follow @caitlindewey
A man takes a selfie as humanity goes up in flames behind him. Just kidding! That’s a protester taking a selfie at a protest in Brussels on Nov. 6, because selfies can also be powerful statements of identity/place/art. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)
There is surely no better symbol for our collective social media anxiety than the lowly selfie, that embattled crux of a hundred quiet culture wars. When a photographer takes a self-portrait, it’s art. When a 16-year-old girl does it, it’s narcissistic posturing. Are the kids alright? Are the Twitters destroying us? Has all of humanity dissolved into some vacuous, duck-faced puddle, never to rise again?
These are questions we’ve looked at before , of course. ( Many , many times before .) But Vanity Fair — fashionably late, as per its custom — has just seen fit to weigh in with an essay that  pins a huge range of perceived social evils on the selfie before admitting, harrumph-ingly, that the genre is here to stay. There’s something both fascinating and fraught about this particular criticism of the selfie: as an encounter between the old-school, establishment media and the new social wave; as a clash between young and old; as a sort of aggrieved negotiation between sneering traditionalists and modern reality. Whatever it is, it paints with a very broad brush. And so your author, a Young Person, popped the essay in Genius and made some notes of her own. (In some browsers, you may have to scroll over the text to see where the highlighted annotations are; in all browsers, just click the highlighted text to bring notes up.

NEW DELHI: US e-commerce giant Amazon's Indian arm is working on a business model to involve local grocery stores in its network so as to help working people collect their orders from these locations at their convenience.
"Amazon shared with me that they want to involve grocery stores in their business. They want to start delivery of products through grocery stores as it will help grocery stores have more footfall of potential customers," Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters after meeting with Amazon senior officials.
The model is aimed at providing convenience to working people who are not home during the day time when their orders are delivered. Amazon is looking to have partnership with the nearest grocery store where shipment can be left and customer can collect the product as per his convenience.
Amazon India Managing Director Amit Agarwal and Amazon Vice President for International Public Policy Monique Meche met the minister today.
"They want to contribute to Digital India programme. I Appreciated them and promised them support," Prasad said.
Grocery stores have been highly impacted due to emergence of shopping malls, and a rise in online shopping, especially in Tier 1 and 2 cities.
"We are continually evaluating new ways to enable fast and reliable delivery of a vast selection of goods at low prices to our customers," Amazon India spokesperson said.
The minister said that Amazon already has agreement with India Post and they are working to further expand the scope of services.
Amazon officials also shared with minister that they have plans to set up data centre in the country.
"They said that they want to set up data centre in India which is again a welcome step," Prasad said.
Amazon India spokesperson said that the company is evaluating the setting up of a Data Centre in India and "will share more details as and when we are ready".
The minister also met senior officials of Japan Bank for International Cooperation including Senior Managing Director Tadashi Maeda.
"This was my second meeting with Japan Bank for International Cooperation. They are consortium of banks and have expressed in making investment in India. Soon they will share with me their concrete plans," Prasad said.
The minister said that JBIC has interest in the entire infrastructure sector including electronics manufacturing, shipping and smart cities. PTI

Man accused in Carlesha Freeland-Gaithers abduction headed back to PennsylvaniaBy Sarah Larimer November 11 Follow @slarimer
A woman snatched off the streets of Philadelphia was rescued with the help of a GPS device that had been installed on the suspect's car by the dealer in case the vehicle needed to be repossessed, authorities said Thursday. (AP)
The man accused of abducting a 22-year-old woman in a terrifying attack that was caught on camera is expected to appear in a federal courtroom in Pennsylvania this week.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that 37-year-old Delvin Barnes is being transported to Philadelphia on Tuesday, and is due in court Wednesday .
Barnes stands accused of forcing Carlesha Freeland-Gaither into a Ford Taurus on a Philadelphia street earlier this month; the struggle made national headlines after investigators released footage of the attack.
Freeland-Gaither survived the incident and was found on Wednesday in Jessup, Md. , with Barnes, who was taken into custody.
Philadelphia police released surveillance video they say shows a man wanted for information regarding the apparent abduction of 22-year-old Carlesha Freeland-Gaither in the Germantown–Penn Knox section of the city Sunday night. (Philadelphia Police)
Last week, Barnes was moved from Maryland, where he was apprehended, to Charles City County, Va., where he is accused of abducting a teenage girl . The girl — who in October walked into a business, naked and smelling of bleach and gasoline — also survived that incident.
DNA evidence has linked Barnes to the case in Virginia, where he was convicted of robbery in 2001. In 2006, he was also convicted of aggravated assault in Philadelphia.
Barnes is being held at Riverside Regional Jail near Prince George, Va., where he has been placed on suicide watch . He will be turned over to the FBI on Tuesday and transferred to Philadelphia, where he’ll be arraigned Wednesday on a federal abduction charge, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch .
“Once he is tried on federal charges, he will be back here,” the Charles City County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Jayson Crawley told the Associated Press.
The sheriff’s office called the trial plan a “a coordinated tactical maneuver.”
“It was not clear when the charges issued in Charles City County may be brought to trial,” the Times-Dispatch added.

Nifty Closes Above 8 350 for First TimeYou are here: Home Market
Nifty Ends at Record High Ahead of Retail Inflation Data
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 16:57 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
The BSE Sensex edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Meanwhile, non-banking finance companies like Housing Development Finance Corporation also rose after the central bank unveiled rules on bad loans and capital requirements that came largely along expected lines.
Traders say volumes will remain muted until India releases data on Wednesday on retail inflation, which is expected to slow to a record low of 5.80 per cent in October, according to a Reuters poll.
That is expected to intensify calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review on December 2.
"Market is discounting a fall in inflation and a resultant decrease in interest rates," said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.
The Sensex rose 0.13 per cent to end at 27,910.06. The broader NSE Nifty rose 0.22 per cent to end at 8,362.65, also marking a record closing high.
Rate-sensitive stocks led the gains on hopes lower retail inflation data would enable the RBI to go for early rate cuts.
ICICI Bank ended up 1.6 per cent while HDFC Bank gained 0.4 per cent.
Among state-run banks, Bank of Baroda rose 2.7 per cent while Punjab National Bank advanced 3.4 per cent. Some auto stocks gained with Mahindra and Mahindra rising 2.4 per cent while Larsen and Toubro gained 1.1 per cent.
Non-banking finance companies also rose. India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans on Monday, but the rules were largely within expectations.
Housing Development Finance Corporation gained 1.2 per cent, while IDFC ended 2.7 per cent higher. Shriram Transport gained 4.9 per cent, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services rose 1.1 per cent.
However, among decliners, Jet Airways fell 2.5 per cent on profit-taking after Monday's 6.9 per cent surge after September-quarter results.

Rupee Ends Lower at 61.55 Tracking Broad Dollar Rally
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 17:21 (IST)
Rupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Mumbai: The rupee weakened for a fourth session in five on Tuesday as the dollar resumed its recent rally while profit-taking at the BSE Sensex failed to provide the local unit much impetus.
The dollar climbed to a seven-year high against the yen on Tuesday after a Japanese government official told Reuters that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was likely to delay a planned sales tax increase.
The index of the dollar against six majors was up 0.2 per cent while most Asian currencies too weakened against the dollar.
Traders are now looking ahead at the consumer price data due post-market close on Wednesday amid rising expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may opt for earlier-than-anticipated rate cuts if inflation falls faster.
A Reuters survey of economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October, a record-low, dragged by a sharp drop in food and oil prices.
"Retail inflation will be important for markets. The strike tomorrow may have impact volumes to some extent. But broadly 61 to 62 per dollar range on the rupee to continue," said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign exchange trading at HDFC Bank.
Dealers are bracing for low volumes across all markets in India on Wednesday as unions at most banks have called for a nationwide strike that is expected to leave trading rooms with minimal staffing but not shut down activity altogether.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.55/56 per dollar compared with 61.4950/5050 on Monday. The rupee had hit an intra-day low of 61.6750 on Friday, its lowest level since October 17.
The Sensex edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Traders will continue to monitor the dollar's moves as well as foreign fund flows.
Foreign investors have bought shares worth a net $1.3 billion in November, taking total inflows so far in 2014 to $14.96 billion. Net inflows into debt in the year stand at $22.9 billion.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.89, while the three-month was at 62.45.

Brings service providers online to help people plan, organise events
Hyderabad, Nov. 11:  
With online service providers gaining strength, two students of International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-H) have floated a start-up called YourEvent.co that lets people plan their events better and hire services online.
Started 18 months ago, the start-up has roped in about 500 service providers who take care of different aspects that make an event a success. The duo developed a technological platform that lets vendors to present their services to the customers.
“Now that we have created a platform for events in Hyderabad, we would like to fan out to Bangalore and Chennai in the second phase. We are targeting to add 5,000 vendors to the platform,” Harsha Bavirisetty, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of YourEvent.co, told Business Line.
“There are over 15,000 vendors that cater to events in Hyderabad alone. It is very difficult to find relevant vendors that suit your need and budget. Using our platform, you can find them with ease,” he said.
“People are increasingly buying things and services online. Our objective is to help them save the hassle of running around in looking for different vendors that make an event a success. We are not tagging every vendor to the list. We are vetting their services before taking them on board,” he said.
Alumni of Stanford and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) respectively and friends at IIIT (H), Harsha and Prasant Gopal (Chief Technology Officer) are planning to raise Rs 2 crore in the next 2-3 months to fund their expansion to other cities.
“Our website has generated leads worth about Rs 45 lakh and connected more than 40 vendors to their customers in last four months. We provide our vendors with an online dashboard to keep their profile updated on our website,” Prasant Gopal said.
Revenue model
Harsha said the company is working on a subscription model to sustain and grow the initiative. He felt that the commission model might not work in the long run and when they expanded to more and more cities.

No Cong invite to Modi for Nehru s 125th birth anniversary eventLetters to  the editor
The Congress has not invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to an international conference it is organising to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, joining the battle with Modi, who it accuses of trying to appropriate freedom movement leaders.
The two-day event to highlight the legacy and worldview of the first Prime Minister is being organised on November 17 and 18 and will be attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
“We have not given any invitation to the Prime Minister. We have invited all those who truly believe in democracy and the ideals of Nehru,” Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said replying to a volley of media questions about whether it has invited Modi and why not.
Interestingly, the party has put out the eulogising remarks about Nehru made by Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) first Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the website specially launched for the event today.
“Have we not acknowledged Atal Bihari Vajpayee. We are acknowledging all those who have said something meaningful. As a political party, we have our freedom to decide who subscribes to Nehru’s views,” he said.
Sources said that Congress will not invite any leader of BJP and its allies for the event.
The party has accused Modi of trying to appropriate leaders of the freedom movement like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Nehru by launching special schemes and diverting attention from their legacy.
There is already a National Committee for commemoration of Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary chaired by the Prime Minister, which was reconstituted after the new government came to power.
Sharma said the conference will discuss Nehru’s views on democracy, inclusion and empowerment in India and for the representative global order. It will provide a platform to reflect on Nehru’s worldview and legacy in the context of contemporary global challenges.
The event is being organised separately by the Congress even as the government has already indicated that it will organise Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary this year in a mega way to increase awareness about ‘Chacha Nehru’ through a number of initiatives like organising ‘Year of Bal Swachhta’.
“Is it not the duty of Congress to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru, who was its leader…we are not subordinate to the government…We are neither the petitioners before the government nor we will make a demand when it comes to upholding the dignity of freedom fighters and our leaders,” Sharma said.
He was asked whether the AICC is trying to make the occasion an issue of confrontation with the government and whether it will demand that the government celebrate the occasion in a better way.
The official committee, initially set up by the Manmohan Singh government also included Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who had opted out of the committee in May itself. The reconstituted committee has no member from the Gandhi family.
Referring to the books written by Nehru on India’s history, culture and ethos, the Congress spokesperson said, “Those who are claiming to be bigger have not even a chapter to their credit. I do not want to debate about individuals who are dwarfed by the even the very name of Nehru.”
Replying to questions on whether the Congress should not have extended the courtesy to the Prime Minister on this occasion when international leaders are being invited, Sharma shot back asking whether Modi himself had taken care of such courtesies.
“This government, beginning from the Prime Minister to others, is trying to usurp the legacy of leaders of our freedom movement and our leaders without subscribing to their views,” he said.
The view in the Congress is that the Modi government is hell bent on obliterating the vestiges of Nehruvian legacy.
“Those who think that Nehruvian view can be subverted are ignorant and illiterate about India’s freedom movement and the psyche of the its people. Nehru was too great and his legacy too powerful to be subverted by those who consider themselves larger than life,” Sharma said.
The New Delhi conference being organised by Congress will have two subject sessions — Inclusive Demcocracy and People’s Empowerment, and Nehru’s Worldview and a Democratic Global Order for the 21st Century.
The conference will conclude with a commemorative declaration, which will will capture the essence of the deliberations and convey a message of global import.
Eminent leaders participating in the event include former Presidents Hamid Karzai from Afghanistan, John Kufuor of Ghana, General Obasanjo of Nigeria, former Prime Minister Madhav K Nepal of Nepal and Dorji Wangmo Wangchuk, Queen Mother of Bhutan besides Asma Jehangir from Pakistan, veteran South African freedom fighter Ahmed Kathrada and leadership delegations from 11 political parties across the globe.
Besides this international conference, the Congress will hold another event on November 13 in the national capital marking the beginning of one year-long celebration of the event across the country during which NSUI and Youth Congress will launch signature campaigns, quiz and essay competitions in colleges and universities and other event on Nehru.

Mahindra  Tata Motors up prices to check costsMahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors up prices to offset rising input costs

Mahindra & Mahindra raised prices by up to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom) of passenger, commercial vehicles and tractors, while Tata Motors has hiked prices of its commercial vehicles in the range of 1-2 per cent.
NEW DELHI: Auto majors Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra today announced price increases in the range of 1-2 per cent citing higher input costs.
Mahindra & Mahindra raised prices by up to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom) of passenger, commercial vehicles and tractors, while Tata Motors has hiked prices of its commercial vehicles in the range of 1-2 per cent.
"We have been holding back on the price hikes for a while but now it has been necessitated to partly offset the impact of rising input costs," Mahindra & Mahindra Chief Executive Automotive Division and International Operations, Pravin Shah said in a statement.
The Mumbai-based company has increased prices of its passenger and commercial vehicles from this month by an average of 1 per cent, in the range of Rs 2,300 to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom).
Besides, Farm Equipment Sector (FES), a part of USD 16.5 billion Mahindra Group, has also increased tractor prices in the range of Rs 6,000-Rs 10,000 depending upon the model, staring this month.
"The price hike has been necessitated owing to increase in commodity prices and conversion costs," the company said.
When contacted a Tata Motors spokesperson told PTI: "From October to November the company has raised the prices of commercial vehicles in the range of 1-2 per cent across categories."
The company hasn't taken a decision yet on hiking passenger vehicle prices, the spokesperson added.
Tata Motors sells a range of commercial vehicles such as light CVs, buses and trucks. It also sells a range of passenger vehicles comprising models from entry level hatchback Nano to multi utility vehicle Aria.
Mahindra sells a range of passenger vehicles including the Scorpio, Bolero and XUV500 and commercial vehicles like Alfa and Gio. It also markets a range of tractor models like Arjun and Yuvraj.

Builders liquidity to improve after easing ...construction sector
(The Cabinet had relaxed…)
NEW DELHI: Rating agency Fitch today said the easing of FDI rules in the realty sector would improve the liquidity situation of developers and boost supply but could also result in increased price competition among the builders.
On October 29, the Cabinet had relaxed FDI rules in construction sector by reducing minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms.
"Relaxation of rules on foreign direct investments into India's property development sector, will improve developers' liquidity and speed-up project-turnaround times, but may also increase competition," Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The key amendments in the FDI ruled include allowing foreign developers to invest in smaller property development projects - with a minimum floor area of 20,000 sq meters compared to 50,000 sq meter previously.
The minimum foreign-investment threshold was also lowered to $5 million per project, from $10 million.
"These moves may encourage more foreign developers to tie-up with their domestic counterparts, which will improve domestic developers' liquidity and speed up project turnaround times," it added.
On the flip side, Fitch said the relaxed rules will also mean a higher supply of property projects and more price-competition among domestic developers, which will pressure profit margins.
"Thinner margins will reduce the cushion available to developers to cut prices and spur demand during economic downturns," it added.
In a more competitive environment, Fitch noted that factors like developers' track record of executing projects and on-time deliveries will become important differentiators for consumers.
In India, the rating agency said the property projects typically have long gestation periods compared to peers in a number of other Asian markets, resulting in higher leverage and weaker liquidity for most developers.
"Indian developers' average working capital cycles can be as long as five to six years, and with leverage (defined by Fitch as net debt/adjusted inventory) as high as 100 per cent," it added.
Comparatively, most Chinese property firms have average working capital cycles of less than two years, with leverage typically well below 50 per cent.
"Indian developers' limited access to capital compared to Chinese peers, and India's slower approval processes for the purchase and development of land parcels are mostly to blame," Fitch observed.

Renewal of mining lease fails to cheer Goa m...Renewal of mining lease fails to cheer up miners in Goa
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 06.57PM IST
(Miners in the state felt…)
NEW DELHI: Renewal of mining leases after a near two-year ban has failed to cheer up iron ore miners in Goa as production and other associate costs have outstripped plummeting global price of the steel-making raw material.
Miners in the state, which produces mainly low-grade iron ore and exports almost all of its output, felt that the key to solving the problem lies in reducing export duty of the raw material to zero from 30 per cent now.
"With the plummeting price of iron ore, it is certainly not a good idea to resume mining as we will have to put in one dollar from our own pocket for exporting one tonne of iron ore," said A N Joshi, Vice President (Corporate Affairs), Sesa Sterlite.
Apart from paying 30 per cent export duty, miners in the state are to pay 10 per cent of the sale value for Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund and 15 per cent royalty. On the other hand, the current price of Goan ore is USD 50 a tonne. Joshi said.
"All these make exports unviable and without getting them to exports, our product has no takers. It is thus a necessary to bring the export duty down to zero. Otherwise, renewing of the leases has no practical sense," he said.
Not finding enough domestic buyers for its low-grade iron ore, iron ore miners in Goa used to export almost their near production to China, the world's largest steel making nation.
The mining ban in the state was imposed in September 2012 and after 18 months, the Supreme Court gave its permission to resume mining in the state with an annual cap of 20 million tonnes on excavation.
In a respite to iron ore mining firms, state government had in the last week renewed 13 mining leases including one to Anil Agarwal-led Sesa Sterlite. These miners can begin tapping the ore after getting the necessary clearances from agencies concerned.
Those who got the state's nod for renewal of the miners are V M Salgaocar & Bros, Sociedade de Fomento Industrial Pvt Ltd, Chowgule & Co, Rajaram Bandekar, G N Agarwal Mining, Smt Geetabala Manohar Naik Parulekar Mines, Smt Kunda Gharse Mines, Sesa Goa and M/s Letho Ferro.
Of the 13 renewals, Salgaocar has four mining leases renewed, Fomento two, while others got renewed one lease each.
Suggesting solution for rationalising iron ore export duty, which is the primary reason for India's declining share in the export markets, Joshi had earlier said," Government is free to levy higher export duty when global prices are higher. Similarly, it should consider charging less when the price of the input is on the lower side."
"If the price is between USD 70-80 per tonne, export duty can be five per cent. At the same time, it can go up to even 50 per cent when the price is over USD 200 per tonne in the overseas market," he had said.
The rise in export duty coupled with mining ban in major producing states badly impacted shipments by Indian miners. As a result, the country lost its prominence in iron ore export markets and is now regarded as a fringe player.
India had exported 117 million tonnes of iron ore in 2009-10, which fell to 14 million tonnes in 2013-14. In the current fiscal, the country is likely to become a net importer of the raw material. PTI SSR NS 11111830 NNNN

Centre  states disparity persists over key aspects of GSTCentre, states disparity persists over key aspects of GST
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
Differences between Centre and states over some key provisions of the Goods and Services Tax remain, with the Empowered Committee insisting that threshold turnover for levying GST be retained at Rs 10 lakh and petroleum be kept out of the purview of the new tax regime.
The Empowered Committee of state FMs, which met here today, however expressed hope that the GST could be rolled out by April 1, 2016, notwithstanding the hitches.
Talking to reporters, GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said that the Centre had written to him suggesting that the threshold annual turnover for levying GST should be increased to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.
The states had in August decided that the threshold be fixed at Rs 10 lakh and had informed that to the Centre.
“In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the Empowered Committee should be reviewed.
The Centre suggested that the limit should be Rs 25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs 25 lakh, Rs 10 lakh limit should be increased.
“But finally the Committee took a decision that they will go by the decision that is already taken that is Rs 10 lakh,” Rather said, adding that the final call on threshold will be decided by the GST Council.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The Finance Ministry is in the process of preparing a Cabinet note on the GST Bill.
States want that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST. The states are yet to receive the draft constitutional amendment bill from the Centre.
“States have already said that petroleum, alcohol, tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for response from Centre. We have not received the revised draft Bill. We will discuss and offer our comments (after we receive it),” Rather said.

Obama  Putin circle each other warily in ChinaBarack Obama, Vladimir Putin circle each other warily in China
AP Nov 11, 2014, 08.01PM IST
BEIJING: On the surface, President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin were all niceties _ a pat on the back here, a pleasantry there. But away from the cameras, the two leaders circled each other warily at a global summit in China, coming face to face while relations between their countries continue to deteriorate.
The White House said Obama and Putin spoke three times Tuesday on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic meeting, tackling some of the tough issues that have strained their relationship, including Russia's provocations in Ukraine and support for Syria's embattled government. They also discussed the fast-approaching deadline in nuclear talks with Iran, in which the U.S. and Russia find themselves on the same negotiating team.
Unlike at some of their past meetings, Obama and Putin kept their deep-seated policy disagreements behind the scenes. But their public encounters suggested their relationship remains tense.
Picturesque Yanqi Lake, just outside of Beijing, became the venue for an awkward pas de deux between two of the most powerful leaders in the world. Entering an ornate, wood-paneled room for the start of the summit, Obama and Putin looked a bit like sidekicks to Chinese President Xi Jinping. The summit's host led the way, with the American on one side and the Russian on the other.
``It's beautiful, isn't it?'' Putin said in Obama's direction. Yes, it is, concurred a reticent Obama, avoiding eye contact with Putin and addressing his response to no one in particular.
As the three presidents came to a stop at the head of the table, Putin reached out to give Obama a slap on the back. But Obama had turned in a different direction, and it didn't appear that the Putin's hand landed on its intended target.
A few hours later, the two again found themselves in close quarters under an overcast sky as leaders planted trees in honor of their counties. Putin strode confidently up to his tree, ahead of Obama, who clasped his hands behind his back before picking up a shovel and greeting a Spanish TV crew with a wave.
Neither the White House nor the Kremlin offered much in the way of detail about the policy conversations Obama and Putin had on the sidelines of the summit. Putin's spokesman said only that the two had spoken a few times, touching on ``bilateral relations, the situation around Ukraine, Syria and Iran.''
The U.S. is furious over Russia's presumed role in fueling pro-Russian rebels in neighboring Ukraine. White House officials have accused Russia of sending heavy weapons to the separatists and shelling Ukrainian troops, and have denounced Russia's buildup of forces along the border.
A truce reached in September between the rebels and Ukraine's government is teetering, destabilized by what the White House calls a ``blatant escalation'' by Russia and rebel-organized elections in eastern Ukraine that the U.S. condemned as a ``sham.'' Vice President Joe Biden, in a phone call last week with Ukraine's president, vowed further U.S. sanctions against Moscow ``if Russia continued to willfully violate the terms'' of the cease-fire.
Russia's economy has taken a major hit following U.S. and EU sanctions _ the ruble has plunged by a third this year and hit an all-time low last week _ but Putin has dismissed the notion that he's hurting at the hands of the West. Addressing the Asia-Pacific economic summit here Monday, Putin said his government had the resources to stabilize its currency without taking any emergency measures.
``We want Russia to play a different role,'' Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Tuesday. ``We want Russia to be a stabilizing force on issues that we care about. But they're not going to be able to do that ... if they're violating the sovereignty of a country next door.''
Rhodes said Obama wouldn't not be seeking out a meeting with Putin while in Beijing _ nor in Brisbane, Australia, where the leaders will once again run into each other during a Group of 20 economic summit this weekend. ``Putin knows where we stand,'' Rhodes said, adding that Obama may discuss Russia's actions with other G-20 leaders.
For Obama and Putin, awkward encounters at international gatherings have become almost expected. But the optics have gained even greater attention as the Ukraine crisis has taken center stage.
In June, on the sidelines of D-Day anniversary commemorations in Normandy, France, Obama and Putin avoided each other during a group photo, with Obama even using Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as a buffer. The two later spoke briefly during a private leaders' lunch.
And during a formal meeting last year during a summit in Northern Ireland, Putin slumped in his chair and sat stone-faced as Obama tried to joke about the Russian leader's athletic ability. Obama later said Putin frequently looks like ``the bored kid in the back of the classroom.''

China s Record-Breaking Online Shopping Day In 6 Facts6 Facts About Singles Day, China's Record-Breaking Online Shopping Spree
Posted:
reddit
BEIJING -- Turkey Day and Santa Claus might spur Americans to shop till they drop, but China's hundreds of millions of online shoppers have their own reason to blow vast sums of hard-earned cash online.
Weeks before Americans splurge on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, China is in the midst of what has become the biggest online shopping bonanza on the planet: Singles Day. The recently invented holiday falls on Nov. 11 (11/11 -- get it?), and it originally gave the country's youth a chance to revel in socially stigmatized singledom.
But in recent years the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba has used steep discounts on its retail websites to turn the day into a shopping event that dwarfs its American and international counterparts.
Here are some things you might not know about China's Singles Day online shopping spree:
1. Alibaba single-handedly created the biggest online shopping day on the planet.
Celebrations of Singles Day have been around since the 1990s , but it wasn’t until Alibaba decided to offer steep Singles Day discounts in 2009 that the e-commerce bonanza was birthed, and in just five years the event has become the largest online shopping spree in the world. Alibaba told Tech in Asia that they weren’t trying to exploit youth hoping to shop off their singledom sorrows -- it just happens to be a catchy date that falls during a shopping lull between major Chinese holidays.

2. People are spending way more money than you can possibly imagine.
Alibaba reported that customers on its retail sites spent $2 billion in the first hour of Singles Day this year, almost equal to total online shopping by Americans on Cyber Monday. By midnight on Tuesday, Alibaba had reportedly raked in $9.3 billion in sales, four times the amount spent online during Cyber Monday in the U.S. and around three-quarters of all retail sales made at brick-and-mortar stores on Thanksgiving and Black Friday combined.
3. PR people at Alibaba sites like to measure the holiday in underwear.
The PR team from Tmall.com, Alibaba's main business-to-consumer retail site, has a strange tendency of bragging about the sheer mass of underwear sold during Singles Day. Last year the team reported that during the first hour of sales, the 2 million pieces of underwear sold would span 1,864 miles if laid end to end, and the 1.6 million bras sold would stack up to three times the height of Mount Everest.

4. China’s brands are emerging as the biggest winners this year.
Midway through the day, Alibaba reported that four of the top five brands as measured by gross merchandise volume were Chinese. At the top of the list was Xiaomi, the red-hot Chinese smartphone brand headed by ex-Googler Hugo Barra. Barra reported via his Twitter account that by the middle of the day, Xiaomi had sold 720,000 phones and topped $163 million in sales. The one non-Chinese brand in Alibaba’s top five was Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo.
5. Alibaba and retailers throw around huge amounts of money gearing up for the event
Last year Alibaba tripled spending on sales and marketing between the third quarter and the fourth quarter (when Singles Day falls). That money goes to web promotions, free mobile data for its customers and funky promotional videos like the one below. Retailers also take on enormous marketing, inventory and overtime costs to participate, all while competing with super-low prices on all goods. It’s an arms race that has many retailers worn out, but the hype and allure of drawing in new customers keeps bringing in more retailers.
6. Sites like Amazon are trying to get a bite of the action
Alibaba conjured the shopping holiday out of thin air, but other online retailers have been trying to get a piece of the action for years. Amazon has been trying to claw its way into Chinese markets for a long time, and this year it’s using its international shopping platforms as an enticement for Singles Day shoppers: Chinese shoppers normally relegated to the more limited selection on Amazon.cn will be able to make purchases off of China’s U.S. and international sites, with orders delivered as fast as three days.
This story has been updated with the final sales figures for Singles Day.

eBay India chief meets Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 08.29PM IST
(Minister of State for Commerce…)
NEW DELHI: eBay India Managing Director Latif Nathani today met Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the prospects of the USD 3 billion burgeoning ecommerce industry in the country.
Nathani said eBay has 50,000 sellers on its platform, of which 15,000 sell across the globe.
"That is a huge opportunity with the government charter of 'Make in India' because these 15,000 sellers are mostly artisans, craftsman and they are exporting India's products and India's culture abroad," he told reporters after the meeting.
He added: "This is closely aligned with the government's plan of 'Make in India' and I think the Minister was very receptive to what we are doing and appreciative of that."
It was an "introductory, courtesy meeting" with the minister, Nathani said, adding that eBay has been in India for nine years and "we are the largest market place in India, so wanted to talk with her about our history in India and about prospects of eCommerce".
Asked if the issue of allowing FDI in online retail came up for discussion, he replied in the negative.
"We do not talk about that because eBay doesn't get affected with the FDI policy," he said.
Besides the growing base of sellers, the global marketplace major is also betting big on mobile technology to propel its growth in the country.
"We are looking at significant expansion. We are very bullish on mobile commerce. For example, we have come out with new products on mobile web and mobile app. Mobile is a big area for us," he said.
A report by consulting firm Technopak estimates the USD 2.3 billion e-tailing market to reach USD 32 billion by 2020, driven by increasing Internet penetration. Other reports peg the current market to be closer to USD 3 billion.
The Indian eCommerce sector has been growing at a very fast pace with players like Snapdeal and Flipkart raising well over USD 4 billion from a range of investors including angel and private equity firms.
eBay itself is an investor in Snapdeal. The homegrown firm also follows the marketplace model and claims to have 50,000- plus merchants onboard.

No stock limit for warehouses attached to commexes  says FMC‘No stock limit’ for commex warehouses
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, November 11:  
Commodity market regulator Forward Markets Commission has exempted goods stored in the warehouses servicing commodity exchanges from the purview of stock holding limits imposed by State Governments.
Conditional exemption
Warehouses exempted from stock limit under the Essential Commodities Act have to make available data on goods stored in the warehouse on a real-time basis.
State Governments impose stock limits whenever prices of a particular commodity spurts in short span of time without any major reason.
Last year, the commission made it mandatory for all commodity exchange-accredited warehouses to register with the Warehouse Development Regulatory Authority.
Quoting from the Consumer Affairs Ministry notification, FMC said an advisory in this regard has also been issued to all the States.
Samir Shah, Managing Director, National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, said the exchange has long been arguing with the regulator and ministry that stocks stored in exchange-recognised warehouses play an economic role in price discovery and cannot be compared with that of hoarding.
Hindrance
“The stock limits imposed by State Governments often interfered in the price discovery process and posed a hurdle in convergence of spot and future prices,” he said.
The FMC order has bought in much-needed clarity and may bring back investors who were keeping away from the futures market for fear of a raid. It will also help resurrect volumes on the futures exchange that are on the downtrend since the government imposed commodity transaction tax last year. A few chana traders at Bikaner in Rajasthan and sugar producers at Kolhapur in Maharashtra recently faced the wrath of their respective State Governments after they implemented stock limits.
Anticipating clarity on warehouse stock limits to bring in volumes in long term, Shah said it would boost hedgers and traders confidence and bring them on the exchange platform over a period.

Kiss of Love  campaign meets wall of copsComments
The much-hyped ‘kiss of love’ campaign to protest against growing moral policing has fizzled out after the police rounded up 50-odd activists who were planning to march towards Marine Drive, the venue of the event. The police detained the organisers and sympathisers, including women, even before they could reach the venue of the symbolic protest against moral policing.

Just as the march began at around 4pm, the police team led by DCP (Law and Order), R Nishantini, took the organisers and sympathisers into custody and bundled them into a police van as they raised slogans against moral policing.
Though the organisers had claimed that 5,000 activists would take part in the event many pro-kiss activists backed out at the eleventh hour fearing violence. Since morning many anti-kiss drive activists had swarmed Marine Drive and assembled at vantage points insisting that they won’t allow the event come what may.
The police resorted to a mild lathi-charge to disperse the crowd that attacked two motor-cyle borne pro-kiss activists.  At least eight protesters and media personnel were injured in the ensuing scuffle. Traffic was disrupted for more than two hours.
Despite the police arresting them minutes before their march to the venue, pro-kiss activists claimed that their campaign was a run-away hit. “We succeeded in sending a strong message throughout the country that moral policing is worse than voyeurism. We got unprecedented support from many quarters. It is a strong warning to moral police,” said N Nandini, one of the activists.
Earlier, protesters on Sunday blocked roads leading to Kochi’s Marine Drive, the venue for ‘Kiss of Love’ — a mass-kissing campaign against alleged moral policing by right-wing groups.
The port city remained tense with suspected members of the Shiv Sena, Samastha Sunni Students Federation and other activist groups saying they would not let the event take place.
Around 1,000 policemen were deployed to prevent any untoward incident as those supporting the drive planned to march to the venue by 5:00pm.
The campaign was launched on social media after a coffee shop in north Kerala’s Kozhikode city was vandalised recently by a group of people who criticised the public display of affection by some couples there.
A day after the Kerala high court refused to intervene, the organisers said on Sunday they would go ahead with the protest, even as they were yet to get permission from the police.
Though the police had denied permission for the event, they said they would only intervene if it created a law and order problem.
Stressing that it was "not a kiss fest" but a gathering of like-minded people to raise awareness against moral policing, the organisers said they would next focus on creating awareness about the deadly AIDS.
'Free Thinkers', a Facebook group organising the programme, expected about 700-1000 people would participate.
"There is no question of backtracking. The protest will be held as scheduled at 5pm at the venue with participants holding placards," Rahul Pasupalan, IT professional and short film maker and Jijo Kuriakose, a researcher and members of 'Free Thinkers' had told reporters earlier in the day.
On Saturday, the organisers had received a shot in the arm with the Kerala high court refusing to interfere with the event after the state government assured action would be taken in the event of any illegal activities. Two petitions seeking to prohibit the event was disposed by the court recording the government's submission.
"This is not a kiss fest. It is a gathering of like minded people to protest against moral policing. We are independent thinkers and this is a gathering of the Facebook users," they said, adding young and old couple, parents and youngsters were all welcome to participate in the event, which is a platform to protest against moral policing.
Pasupalan said though they approached police four days back with a request for permission to conduct the event, they were yet to receive any intimation allowing or denying permission.
Pointing out that kissing and hugging was only a form of agitation they had chosen to raise awareness against moral policing, Rahul said it was precisely due to the novel form of protest they had adopted that so much heat had been generated.
"Isn't everyone talking about the event?" he asked.
"Because we selected this form of protest, everyone is discussing it. We want to create an awareness against moral policing," they said.
Jijo Kuriakose said the group would next focus their attention on creating awareness about the deadly AIDS.
Interestingly parallel to the ‘kiss fest’ a slew of other protests are expected to take place near the venue. Leading Malayalam literary critic M Leelavathy and Kochi Mayor Tony Chammany are among the main participants expected to join a parallel protest event being organized by the Kerala Students’ Union, student wing of the Congress.
The campaign was launched on social media after a coffee shop in north Kerala’s Kozhikode city was vandalised last week by a group of people who criticised the public display of affection by some couples there.
The attack came after a news channel owned by a political party carried a report on October 23 with visuals of “immoral activities” allegedly taking place at the establishment, showing young couples kissing and embracing.

Men have vivid  weird sexual fantasies compared to womenMen have vivid, weird sexual fantasies compared to women
IANS  Toronto, November 01, 2014
First Published: 18:47 IST(1/11/2014) | Last Updated: 18:59 IST(1/11/2014)
As per a research, men have more vivid and weird fantasies about sex than women. What's more is that they want them to come true in real life too.
(AFP Photo)
It also tells us that a significant proportion of women evoke fantasies associated with submission (being tied up, spanked, forced to have sex) but they do not want these to be realised in actual life.
Importantly, unlike men, women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire.
"Our main objective was to specify norms in sexual fantasies - an essential step in defining pathologies. As we suspected, there are a lot more common fantasies than atypical fantasies," said lead researcher Christian Joyal from Institut universitaire en sante mentale de Montreal, University of Montreal.
Pathological sexual fantasies involve non-consenting partners, they induce pain or they are absolutely necessary in deriving satisfaction.
For the study, researchers analysed a sample of adults willing to describe their sexual fantasies.
As a result, 1,517 adults (799 men and 718 women) responded to a questionnaire describing their sexual fantasies, as well as describing their favourite fantasy in detail.
Many women who express more extreme fantasies of submission (domination by a stranger) specify that they never want these fantasies to come true.
"The majority of men, however, would love their weird sexual fantasies to come true," they found.
"As expected, the presence of one's significant other is considerably stronger in female fantasies than in male fantasies. In general, men fantasize much more about extramarital relationships compared to women," researchers concluded.
Overall, these findings allow us to shed light on certain social phenomena such as the popularity of the book Fifty Shades of Grey with women, Joyal noted.
The findings appeared in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Micromax Canvas 4+ review: Good performance  but the value proposition is not that greatPrint
Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:05 pm | Updated: November 25, 2014 11:09 am
For the past year or so Micromax has been giving Samsung tough competition in the Indian hinterland with value for money smartphones. From the time it launched the Canvas Knight earlier this year, this Indian company has been clearly nurturing dreams of offering high-end specs at mid-range price points. The latest in this range is the Micromax Canvas 4+.
Specs: 5-inch HD AMOLED display |  MediaTek MT6592 1.7GHz True Octa core processor with 1GB RAM | 16GB internal storage expandable up to 32GB | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front | 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0 | Android 4.4.2 | 2000 mAh battery
Price: Rs 16,999
Design: Let’s just say this will remind you of the iPhone 3S once in a while. The phone as some bling factor thanks to the golden ring running around the bezel and golden flap on the back. The phone has a fixed back and the two SIMs and SD card go into flaps on the side. It is one of the lightest phones around, especially in this price bracket.
Display: The HD AMOLED display should be one of the selling points of this phone, but it isn’t. In the lock screen the display feels stubborn and need a good strong swipe to open. Inside, with dull colours like grey the pixels seems to show up and there is a matte finish like feel which is odd. The display is okay when the visuals are vibrant and colourful.
Performance: The octa-core processor makes this phone good for multi-tasking and some high-end gaming. There was no noticeable heating during the tests or even benchmarking. But don’t expect more than what you would from a mid range phone.
Software: Micromax still seems to believe in packing the phones with lots of software you might never use. This includes at least five Micromax apps and a few games. There is a camera widget that gives one touch access to features like selfie camera, dual shot using the front and back cameras as well as video. I also liked the simple lock screen that shows only clock.
Camera: This is among the few smartphones in this price range that gives you a 5MP front camera. This camera is good for selfies, though you will need to be in a well-lit area for the efforts to be successful. The rear camera is pretty decent too and has a totality that is rare in smartphone. The photos seem a bit underexposed, but in a good sort of way.
Storage: The phone has 16GB internal storage out of which roughly 11GB is available for users. The internal storage has a 2GB slot for system storage. You might want to buy a 16GB SD card with the phone.
Connectivity: No issues with connectivity, but we found that the FM radio seems to have antenna issues.
Battery: The battery will give you about 12 hours on a full charge. However, there seems to be apps that drain the battery quicker, like the FM radio.
Verdict: The Canvas 4+ has some good features that push the limits for the price range. But I doubt if it offers a great value proposition especially when there are other phones like the Lenovo Vibe X2 or Huawei Honor 6 offering much more at a slightly higher price tag. Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.

NEW DELHI: Government has formed three sub-committees to select heads of eight public sector banks, including Punjab National Bank , Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank .
The three sub-committees are scheduled to hold interviews of eligible candidates on November 14.
Earlier this month, the government had decided that each sub-committee will have two members and all candidates will have to go through all these screening panels separately.
The sub-committees have three outside experts. These experts are former Managing Director of State Bank of India (SBI) S Viswanathan , IIM Indore Director Rishikesha T Krishnan and former Chairperson and Managing Director S Panse , sources said.
Besides, other three members of screening committees are Department of Financial Secretary, Additional Secretary and an RBI Deputy Governor.
The final selection of candidates would be made by the appointment board chaired by RBI Governor and it will be based on the weighted average marks given by each sub-committees to ensure objectivity and transparency.
The selection process for Chairman and Managing Director of the public sector banks was changed following government scrapping the selections made by previous UPA regime.
Last month, the government cancelled selection of heads of six PSU banks and 14 executive directors made during the UPA tenure following a government-appointed panel finding irregularities in the process.
The eligibility criteria remains more or less same in the current fiscal.
Last time, 19 candidates appeared for interviews for six vacancies of Chairman and Managing Director (CMD).
Now, there could be about 16 eligible candidates for posts of eight CMDs, sources said.
Following shortlisting by the high level panel, the names of the candidates would be sent to Finance Minister and subsequently to the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC). In the mean time, the process for vigilance and other necessary clearances would be undertaken.

Union minister Nihal  accused of sexual assault  yet to receive summons  to skip courtappearanceNihal Chand flanked by SP Hari Prasad Sharma and Collector RS Jakhar at the Run for Unity event on October 31 in Ganganagar.
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: November 11, 2014 8:12 pm
Months after the Ganganagar Police told a lower court in the state capital that they could not find Union Minister Nihal Chand Meghwal to serve him a court summons in connection with his alleged involvement in a rape case, this summons is yet to reach Meghwal. The court hearing is slated for Wednesday morning.
Ganganagar superintendent of police Hari Prasad Sharma had told a lower court in August that since Meghwal had become a minister at the center, he could not be found at his Raisinghnagar residence in Ganganagar and the police did not know where he lived in New Delhi. The lower court had then directed Sharma to ensure that the summons is delivered before the next hearing slated for November 12.
In the past three months, the SP has participated in functions along with Meghwal and also posed for photo-ops but could not manage to deliver the summons. Meghwal has frequented his constituency on several occasions such as the Run for Unity campaign on October 31, to adopt a village, for inauguration ceremonies among others. He was in Ganganagar over the last weekend for a function, locals said.
On Tuesday, Sharma told the Indian Express, “It is the Station House Officer’s job to deliver the summons. He should know about it. I have no idea.”
Raisinghnagar SHO Narayan Daan said, “I have no memory of any such summons. Hundreds of them come and have to be delivered. I do not know anything about this.” Asked if he really does not remember of a summons for a Union Minister, Daan said, “We treat everyone equally. It does not matter whether it is for a commoner or a minister.”
Meanwhile Meghwal’s office confirmed that he is yet to receive any court summons and hence need not appear in court. On Tuesday, Meghwal took charge of the Panchayati Raj department as Minister of State shifting out of the Chemicals and Fertilizers ministry. After his name came up in a sexual assault case in June this year, it was speculated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would drop him from his team but no action has been initiated so far.
On Tuesday morning senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh tweeted that ‘Modi must respond. How can Rajasthan govt claim that a Minister in GOI can’t be traced? Good governance Mr. Modi.’ The state unit of Congress too has raised questions on the handling of the case.
Chandu Ram Yadav, the alleged victim’s lawyer said, “The police and the minister are making a mockery of law. They are looking for ways to avoid appearing before the court. Initially the minister went missing, now the summons has gone missing. We will still wait for continued…

#NokiaStory: 10 Nokia phones India will alwaysrememberPrint
Bye-bye Nokia! Here are 10 all-time favourite Nokia phones, we will always remember.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 7:53 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 7:57 pm
For well over a decade, Nokia was synonymous with the mobile phone across most of the world. We loved our old Nokia phones and for most of us it was the first mobile brand. Nokia phones were popular for its reliability, battery life and of course some of the models were good enough to be projectiles.
People loved the fact that a Nokia phone could easily last for over three years. However, this was not something Nokia might have actually wanted, as it lowered the refresh cycle ultimately hampering sales growth.
This is not the story anymore. With smartphones coming into the picture, there is nothing called a single favourite brand in the country. Also, after Microsoft acquired the brand, it is now officially dropping the Nokia tag.
So on the day Microsoft Device announced its first phone, the Lumia 535, to launch without the Nokia branding, we take a look at the 10 all-time favourite Nokia phones.
Did you own any of these handsets? Or, did we just miss your favourite Nokia phone? Feel free to share your #NokiaStory at the comment section below.

Bangalore college girl lodges rape complaint against army manfatherPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:40 am
A 19-year-old girl from Uttar Pradesh pursuing a commerce degree in Bengaluru has accused her father, a hawaldar in the Indian Army, of allegedly sexually abusing over the past five years. The complaint comes close on the heels of the havaldar filing a kidnap complaint against the girl’s boyfriend with whom she had eloped a month ago.
The Vidyaranyapura police in North Bangalore who registered a case on the basis of the complaint of the 19-year-old said that the girl had been reported missing a month ago after she ran away with a distant relative Amith Kumar Singh who was staying at their home. The girl’s father an army havaldar had attempted to crack down on his daughter’s relationship with Singh and had sent the youth back to UP last month.
However, his daughter also allegedly eloped with Singh resulting in the havaldar filing a police complaint of kidnap against Singh at the Vidyaranyapuram police station.
The girl recently returned home and told the police that she was not kidnapped and that she went with Singh of her own volition. She also provided proof that she was not a minor. The police had closed the kidnap case based on the statement of the girl. Police said the girl approached them again last week to file a complaint against her father. She has alleged in the complaint that she has been sexually abused by her father.
The police have taken up a case of rape based on the complaint lodged by the victim and further investigations are on to find out whether the allegations are true or false.
The Vidyaranyapura police said they had written a requisition letter to the Indian Army seeking permission to question the havaldar. “We are waiting for a reply from the Indian Army to interrogate and arrest the accused person,” an investigating officer said.

Chhattisgarh: Botched sterilisations claim 9 lives  4 docs suspendedEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

In Myanmar  PM Modi eyes regional connectivity booster shot fortradePrint

Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 11, 2014 8:50 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 8:54 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off his 11-day foreign tour on Tuesday afternoon with his first stop at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, where he held bilateral talks with President U Thein Sein.
The focus was on beefing up engagement in the areas of culture and commerce, with the Indian prime minister giving a strong push to improving regional connectivity as a booster to trade and increased people-to-people contact.
Modi landed here in a special aircraft and was given a ceremonial welcome. Tweeting after his bilateral meeting, Modi said that he and President Thein Sein had reviewed the bilateral relationship. “Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations…. We talked about strengthening ties in the fields of culture, commerce & enhancing connectivity.
On Wednesday, Modi will attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit and the following day, he will take part in the 9th East Asian summit on the first leg of his three-nation foreign tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh’s visit there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar. Among the leaders that he is slated to meet is Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
For the official talks, the agenda includes India’s keenness to ensure that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should focus on improving people-to-people contact, ramping-up trade relations and reinforcing the strategic engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
Issues on the anvil at the ASEAN summit meeting include review of an ambitious connectivity project to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand that was originally envisaged to be completed by end-2017, and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway project. Modi in a tweet earlier this week had said that India’s ties with  ASEAN are “deep rooted” and that strengthening relations with the nations in the grouping are an important part of its ‘Act East’ policy.
He said he looked forward to meeting leaders attending the two summits in Myanmar. “ASEAN is central to our dream of an Asian century, where India will play a crucial role. Am sure the meetings there would be fruitful,” Modi had said.
With the bloc’s plan to float an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, the free trade pact in services and investment signed in September between India and the ASEAN is expected to help bilateral trade climb to $100 billion by 2015, from $71.6 billion in 2012.
Modi is also said to be keen to tap the potential offered continued…

China seeks greater role in Afghanistan with peace talk push
Reuters Nov 11, 2014, 08.35PM IST

afghanistan
KABUL: China has proposed setting up a forum to restart stalled peace talks between Afghanistan and Taliban insurgents, the latest sign Beijing wants more of a say in its troubled neighbour's affairs as it frets about its own Islamist militant threat.
Documents seen by Reuters show that China put forward a proposal for a "peace and reconciliation forum" that Afghan officials said would gather representatives from Afghanistan, Pakistan, China and the Taliban command.
The Chinese plan, discussed at a recent meeting of nations taking part in the "Istanbul Process" on Afghanistan's future, comes as US-led combat troops prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan after 13 years of war.
Despite the military's efforts to rout the Taliban and al Qaeda, militants remain a major force, launching regular attacks on military and civilian targets, and previous attempts to bring them into the political mainstream have failed.
There is little to suggest so far that China will succeed where others have not, but its willingness to revive a bid to broker peace previously attempted by the United States indicates its role in Afghanistan is growing.
China's proposal has not yet been formally announced because Afghan President Ashraf Ghani wants more time to see whether the Taliban and Pakistan are willing to join in, according to his aides.
"This was a very, very important first step," said Daoud Sultanzoy , a former presidential candidate and now adviser to Ghani. "Once all the pieces are in place ... at a mature and opportune time there will be declarations."
China says it is not seeking to fill a void left by the US year-end withdrawal, and it already has a footprint in Afghanistan with financial support for counter-narcotics training and agreements to exploit oil and copper reserves.
Washington will also continue to be a major donor to Afghanistan and thousands of soldiers are expected to remain there in training and counter-terrorism roles.
China and Afghanistan are linked only by a tiny and barely passable mountain corridor, but Beijing's bigger security worry is that Uighur militants, who want a separate state in western China's Xinjiang region, will exploit the security vacuum left after the bulk of NATO forces withdraw to step up their fight.
Hundreds of Uighur fighters are believed to be holed up in lawless tribal areas straddling Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Senior diplomats in Afghanistan said China's proposal took participants by surprise at a recent conference in Beijing attended by Ghani, who was making his first official trip overseas as leader.
"ROLE OF FACILITATOR"
One of the envoys sent Reuters a copy of the draft on condition of anonymity.
"From the Chinese side it is a very positive attitude and they would invite the Taliban to China if Afghanistan agreed to it," said an Afghan official who travelled with Ghani. "They are offering to take the role of facilitator."
Afghanistan blames much of its instability on Pakistan, accusing it of sheltering militants, and wants Islamabad to commit openly to a peace process.
Afghan officials say they want a more public show of support from Pakistan, and are hopeful that the involvement of China, a close ally of Islamabad, will help bring it.
"China was invited to play the pivotal role that it can because China has a lot at stake for its own stability. Also China has a tremendous amount of clout when it comes to Pakistan," Sultanzoy said.
The Chinese government did not respond to a request for comment. However, the Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan stressed support for a peace process at a seminar in Kabul this week, taking the opportunity to remind Ghani of his promises in Beijing to fight militants threatening China.
Pakistan said it was ready to work with Beijing and others, but wanted details of the process to be clarified.
A peace deal is seen as the Afghan government's best hope for survival after the US-led combat mission that ousted the Taliban in 2001 ends, because its own forces will struggle to defend territory.
Analysts said China may have a better chance of succeeding in restarting the peace process than the United States, because of its close ties with Pakistan.
"There's no guarantee things will change, but it's certainly worth a try ... the relationship between China and Pakistan is much less tense than the US-Pakistani relationship," said Thomas Ruttig of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.
A spokesman for the Taliban offered no comment for this article, saying the group's political leadership would need to discuss the matter first.

Automotive Industry Auto Reviews Kia Motors Corp. Dodge Chrysler Honda Motor Co. Toyota Motor Corp.
Segment-leading handsomeness is all that distinguishes the 2015 Kia Sedona from its peers.
2015 Kia Sedona design can almost pass for a large crossover, and Kia wants it called a multiperson vehicle.
Aggressively restyled 2015 Kia Sedona gives minivan segment an edge.
Pop quiz: What kind of vehicle seats up to eight people and has a pair of sliding doors, seats that fold out of the way and a commanding view of the parking lot at your local Gymboree?
According to Kia, it's not a minivan.
The South Korean automaker recently began selling its 2015 Sedona "multipurpose vehicle," a third-generation people mover that starts at $26,795. It's aimed at rivals including the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan.
Kia, like nearly every other purveyor of minivans, swears the Sedona is too cool to be called a minivan.
Automakers maintain commitment to maligned minivan despite dwindling sales. ( Jim Mateja, Special to the Tribune )
Honda uses Run DMC and Judas Priest to sell its Odyssey; Toyota had a "Swagger Wagon" ad go viral online to the tune of 12.7 million views on YouTube; and Dodge has an R/T performance version of its Grand Caravan that its CEO calls the "man van."
Kia's new ad campaign uses the tag line "It's not a sports car, it's a Sedona." Lest Corvette owners start lining up for a trade-in.
Curiously, buyers seem to have much less problem with being seen in a minivan. Honda, Toyota, Chrysler and Dodge each sell at least 120,000 of them a year. Perhaps a Stuart Smalley intervention is in order for minivan makers: You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.
8
In Kia's defense, the new Sedona has the styling moxie to back up this otherwise silly identity crisis. By avoiding excessive body cladding between the wheels, squaring off the Sedona's profile, and moving the wheels closer to the corners, the 2015 edition can almost pass as a large crossover SUV.
That similarity matters to Kia, which says 54% of minivan shoppers — regardless of what they call the thing — are empty-nesters. Think grandparents with "active lifestyles" who still appreciate minivan practicality but also crave the style and amenities offered in many crossovers.
Unfortunately, segment-leading handsomeness is all that distinguishes the Sedona from its peers. Kia missed an opportunity to set itself apart from a pack of relatively stale competitors.
The inside of the Sedona is built for seven people in standard trim, with a pair of reclining captain's chairs in the second row and a bench in the rear (an optional eighth seat wedges in the middle of the second row). Every seat in the house is spacious enough for tall adults, if not particularly plush.
Our nearly loaded, $43,295 SXL tester included "first-class lounge seating" for the second row. In addition to reclining, the seats move side-to-side and fore-aft and each has a leg rest that pops out. Picture a La-Z-Boy recliner with less room for your legs and no tiny fridge built into the side.
This Sedona's third row flips and folds into the floor like all minivans should, though the heft of the seats makes this a chore, even for athletic adults. With the seats in place, their cubby in the floor of the trunk creates a useful cavern for gear.
0
The middle row doesn't disappear into the floor as in Chrysler and Dodge models, though the seat cushion does fold up, and the seat forward against the front seats. This means users don't have to remove the middle row to get a healthy amount of pure cargo room with the third row stowed.
Overall, the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna have more room for both people and cargo, while the Chrysler and Dodge models rank about the same as the Kia.
From the Sedona's driver's seat, things were similarly average. The cabin is quiet but the ride quality is harsh. A 276-horsepower V-6 is standard on all models, as is a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.
That power figure is similar to its peers', though the Sedona's acceleration felt sluggish. This was disappointing, especially since Kia uses a slightly more powerful version of the same engine in its (lighter) Cadenza full-size sedan to great effect.
Our SXL test model is rated at 17 mpg in the city and 22 on the highway, lagging just a bit behind most of its peers. In a week of mixed driving, we averaged 20 mpg.
$43,395 may sound like a lot for a minivan — sorry, multipurpose diaper wagon — but it's on par with others in the segment. Spend that much on the Sedona and you get lane departure warning, a 360-degree camera system, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, two sunroofs, an Infinity sound system, leather seats and power tailgate and side doors.
That's an impressive roster of options, though we'd like to see some sort of DVD entertainment system included in it. And Kia expects the average Sedona buyer to opt for the mid-level EX version, which starts at $32,995.
All Sedona models come with six air bags — including side curtain air bags for all three rows, ABS, traction control and brake assist.
This 2015 Kia holds its own, at least for now. Though it's less practical and efficient, the Sedona is a hipper alternative to its older, more conventional peers.
But its relevance won't last. Chrysler, which invented the minivan 30 years ago, is expected to debut a new model a year from now. Expect big things; as the segment's sales and innovation leader, it takes minivans more seriously than most.
And completely new versions of the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna won't be far behind. At that point, this lukewarm new Sedona could become an afterthought. No matter what Kia calls it.

Shiv Sena stakes claim to post of Leader of Opposition
Barely an hour after Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar declared that his party’s support to the BJP-led minority government in Maharashtra is unasked, unconditional and unilateral, the Shiv Sena announced that it has chosen to sit in the Opposition.
The Sena officially communicated to Assembly Secretary Anant Kalase that the leader of the newly elected Sena MLAs, Eknath Shinde, should be considered for the post of Leader of the Opposition.
However, that does not mean it is the end of the road for the two parties, as Sena’s announcement came with a teaser saying its talks with the BJP would continue. The party said that it has staked claim for the post of Leader of the Opposition only to ensure that the Congress does not bag it in case its negotiations with the BJP fail.
If the NCP sticks to its decision, the trust vote slated for Wednesday would be a mere academic exercise.
The BJP government needs at least 22 MLAs more to reach the magic number of 145 in the event the trust motion is put to vote. Sena, which has 63 members, on Sunday had declared that it would prefer to sit in the opposition if the BJP ‘seeks’ the support of NCP which has 41 members.
‘NCP decision in the interest of stability’
At a crowded press conference here on Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar kept up the suspense on his party’s strategy during the trust motion of the newly sworn-in BJP government, led by Devendra Fadnavis, on November 12.
The NCP’s unambiguous stance gave two more days for the BJP and the Shiv Sena to sort out their differences over the latter’s role in the Central as well as the State governments. However, the Sena went ahead with its decision on the plea that it had not heard from any of the BJP leaders on its role in the State government.
“We would take a call on the trust vote depending on our assessment about the stability of the Fadnavis government,” Mr. Pawar said, clearly implying that the NCP would vote in favour of the motion if necessary.
Mr. Pawar, who was at his witty best in the course of a 45-minute press conference, said that his party had extended its support to the Fadnavis government. “It is like the right of a voter. You cannot question the voter why he/she is voting and for whom the vote is cast,” he said.
“The NCP has taken a decision in the interest of stability of the State. Neither has anyone approached us for support nor have we discussed it with anyone,” he remarked in response to a question on the Sena’s demand that the BJP make its position clear on the support offered by the NCP.

Uddhav Thackeray attacks  dangerous-for-Hindus  AIMIM leadersLetters to  the editor
After Uddhav Thackeray hit out at All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), his party Shiv Sena today stepped up attack on the Hyderabad-based outfit,accusing it of poisoning the minds of minority community and demanded that Maharashtra government take strict action against it.
“The Owaisi brothers (MP Asaduddin and MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi) are in the habit of conceiving and spreading fundamentalist ideas. Both of them have poisoned the minds of Muslims in the country. After achieving success in Nanded Municipal Corporation, they now want to spread their wings to the Marathwada region,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.
In an apparent reference to AIMIM, which won two seats in recently held Maharashtra assembly elections, Uddhav had on Sunday said, “Forces which are dangerous for Hindus have raised their heads in the recent Assembly polls.”
Backing former Union Home Minister and senior Congress leader Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter Praniti’s comments seeking a ban on the outfit, the Sena said people should come forward and support her.
“Praniti Shinde has only conveyed the sentiments of the people of India. Only Shiv Sena has been against the working style of AIMIM. Now even the Congress is speaking against the party, which is admirable,” it said.
“The AIMIM has won two seats in the assembly polls and won second or third place in 14 constituencies across the state. This has emboldened them. (Devendra) Fadnavis government should take strict action against this party. Shinde has made her stance very clear, which cannot be ignored. Shiv Sena will stand firmly behind her,” it said.
AIMIM made its debut in Maharashtra walking away with substantial chunk of Muslim votes in many areas and winning two seats.
Though only two (journalist Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad and Waris Pathan from Byculla) of its 26 nominees won, it has rankled established parties in many constituencies.

Gold Falls by Rs 345 to Rs 26,050 on Weak Global Cues, Low Demand
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 16:26 (IST)
Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: Gold prices plunged by Rs 345 to Rs 26,050 per 10 grams in the national capital on Tuesday, tracking a weak global trend amid absence of demand from jewellers and retailers at domestic markets.
Silver remained under pressure and fell by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units.
Sentiment remained subdued largely in tandem with a weak trend in global markets where gold traded at a four-year low as surging dollar waned demand for the precious metals, traders said.
Besides, slackened demand from jewellers as well as retailers at prevailing levels at domestic spot markets too weighed on prices, they added.
Globally, gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell 0.16 per cent to $1,149 an ounce - the lowest level since 2010. Silver also slid 0.7 per cent to $15.50 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity tumbled by Rs 345 each to Rs 26,050 and Rs 25,850 per 10 grams respectively. It had lost Rs 55 in Monday's trade.
Sovereign declined by Rs 100 to Rs 23,700 per piece of 8 grams.
In a similar fashion, silver ready dropped further by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 535 to Rs 34,490 per kg.
Silver coins also fell sharply by Rs 2,000 to Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Mahindra Hikes Passenger  Commercial Vehicle PricesYou are here: Home Corporates
Mahindra, Tata Motors Up Prices to Offset Rising Input Costs
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 21:59 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Auto majors Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra on Tuesday announced price increases in the range of 1-2 per cent citing higher input costs.
Mahindra & Mahindra raised prices by up to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom) of passenger and commercial vehicles, and tractors, while Tata Motors hiked prices of its commercial vehicles in the range of 1-2 per cent.
"We have been holding back on the price hikes for a while but now it has been necessitated to partly offset the impact of rising input costs," Mahindra & Mahindra chief executive-automotive division and international operations Pravin Shah said in a statement.
The Mumbai-based company has increased prices of its passenger and commercial vehicles from this month by an average of 1 per cent, in the range of Rs 2,300 to Rs 11,500 (ex-showroom).
Besides, the $16.5-billion Mahindra Group's farm equipment sector (FES) also raised tractor prices in the range of Rs 6,000-Rs 10,000 depending upon the model, staring this month.
"The price hike has been necessitated owing to increase in commodity prices and conversion costs," the company said.
When contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson told PTI, "From October to November, the company has raised the prices of commercial vehicles in the range of 1-2 per cent across categories."
The company has not taken a decision yet on hiking passenger vehicle prices, the spokesperson added.
Tata Motors sells a range of commercial vehicles such as light CVs, buses and trucks. It also sells a range of passenger vehicles comprising models from entry-level hatchback Nano to multi-utility vehicle Aria.
Mahindra sells a range of passenger vehicle models including Scorpio, Bolero and XUV500 and commercial vehicle models like Alfa and Gio. It also markets a range of tractor models such as Arjun and Yuvraj.

Article 370 part of BJP s agenda: Jitendra SinghPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: November 11, 2014 6:09 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 6:19 pm
Asserting that BJP’s stand on Article 370 is “very clear”, Union Minister Jitendra Singh today said all issues, including the provision, which have been part of the party’s manifesto, will be on its agenda.
“All issues (including Article 370) which have been part of the BJP manifesto all these years will be part of the agenda. They will continue to be so,” the Minister of State, PMO, told reporters while inaugurating BJP Media Centre here for its “Mission 44+”.
Singh was replying to a question if BJP has dumped the issue of Article 370, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir, during the upcoming Assembly elections.
“The ideological issue (Article 370), toward which you point to, BJP’s stand is very clear on it and it is known to you,” he said.
“But in each election at each given time, you have to prioritise and you have to go by the aspiration of the people.
The aspiration of the people as of now, in 2014, in November and December, when we go to polls, is to liberate this state and people from years and years of mis-governance, corruption and misappropriation of Central funds,” Singh said.
To a question on some sitting BJP MLAS resigning from party to fight against it, he said, “I do not want to indulge into a debate over it. There is inner party democracy in BJP. It is the only party which is not governed by dynasty or family.”
“There is selection of panels and it is being approved by the Parliamentary Board. Everybody should consider himself as a contestant, but once a candidate is announced, the party and its leaders and worker forces stand by the candidate,” he said.
On a question if the party here is banking solely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said, “Across party lines, it is being accepted by one and all that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country now. Can you deny him that privilege which he enjoys by virtue of his popularity. Having said that I also add that you should not underestimate the wisdom of the voter of this country –they are going to judge us by our performance,” he said.
“People vote to our governance model of government with transparency, accountability and development,” he said.
On setting up a media cell, he said, “BJP is the only party which has shown the era of high-tech media campaign.
Before the last general elections, ours used to be a high-tech media cell. A media high-tech cell was set up in BJP central office”.
“From our models, other political parties took a cue. we have been on the forefront in this media campaign,” he said.

5 Ways to Make Your Startup More Diverse
Unlike many other tech companies, Pandora has struck a relatively balanced gender ratio. Here's how you can follow suit.

When Silicon Valley tech companies recently released demographic data of their employees, the results were, unfortunately, exactly what you'd expect. Facebook, Google and Apple all hover around a 70/30 men-to-women breakdown.
But it's not all doom and gloom.  Pandora , the Oakland-based Internet radio and music streaming service, reported a refreshing balance in its gender diversity with 51 percent male and 49 percent female employees. Pandora is also a huge supporter of our mission here Women 2.0. They helped us launch  City Meetup  in  Oakland  last summer and are an on-going sponsor for our monthly networking event. With company organizations like Pandora Women, Pandora Pride and Pandora Mixtape (a group for Pandora's employees of color), Pandora is headed in the right direction not only in gender diversity, but other aspects of  diversity  as well.
"When I think about all the different kinds of people who are listening to Pandora across the globe, our employees should look like them," wrote Pandora CEO  Tim Westergren  in a blog post on LinkedIn. "The diversity of our audience and artists are a great benchmark for us to use as we evaluate our own company. And it's clear there's work to be done."
Some news organizations heralded Pandora for leading the pack. Other publications pointed out the company still has a long way to go in regards to ethnic diversity and gender diversity in both technical roles and leadership. Most of these stories focused on the numbers and simply regurgitated the data with a bit of commentary. Few focused on how Pandora got here and what the company is doing to improve their diversity even more.
We spoke with Lisa Lee, who leads diversity at Pandora to learn more about what the company's up to. Lisa has been working in tech for the last eight years and previously worked in the non-profit sector with organizations that focused on communities of color. Most recently, she was the Diversity Program Manager at Facebook. Lisa joined Pandora last April to head up diversity initiatives. She was tasked with creating an overarching diversity strategy and executing it.
Here's some insight that Lisa offered us about how Pandora is tackling diversity from several different angles.
1. Start Prioritizing Diversity Early
The 9-year-old company has about 1,300 employees. Pandora is nowhere yet near the size they plan to be. They don't claim to have diversity totally "figured out." But they are making it a priority as they grow.
"It's amazing to see that a company at this size that has a lot of room to grow is conscious in the way they are thinking about that growth," Lisa told us. "They didn't hire me now that they're completely established. The company has a long way to go. They wanted to make sure that as they are scaling the company, diversity is one of their core values."
2. Invite Employees to Drive Diversity Initiatives
When Lisa joined the company last spring, she spent her first month simply listening and learning about what people were already doing. "I went around and talked to a lot of our business leaders and community leaders who are passionate about diversity. I tried to understand what diversity meant to them."
She asked them about some of the things they were proud of that had happened in the past and what else they would like to see in the future. Instead of instructing employees on what they should do, Lisa incorporated their opinions and insights as she drafted the company's diversity strategy. She told us that one main focus is empowering different employee groups so they can have a voice in the diversity dialogue, both in the company's culture and the way it conducts business.
3. Support the Surrounding Community and Get Involved
For Pandora, diversity extends beyond just the people who work inside its walls. Unlike most tech companies that have sprawling campuses outside of the city, Pandora is located smack dab in the middle of an urban environment. The organization is based in racially-diverse Oakland, and it's a priority to support the community around them.
"We consciously don't provide lunch to our employees," said Marta Riggins, who heads up talent, brand, and events at Pandora. "The community around us doesn't grow if we don't support them." By only offering stocked kitchens and catered meals on special days, such as days when there is a company meeting or a hackathon, Pandora encourages employees to leave the office and support local restaurants, many of which are women and minority-owned. When candidates interview at Pandora, they're given gift cards so they can explore the neighborhood and eat lunch out. Oakland Uptown has experienced significant growth over the last 10 years and there is a direct correlation with the company's rapid growth.
Pandora has also opened its doors to organizations in Oakland to make themselves available to the community. The company sponsors our monthly City Meetup networking events. Recently, they hosted Women Who Code for a hack night, Code Inclusion/PyInclusion, a class taught by Joy Dixon, a woman who is trying to bring more women of color to tech, and many other organizations looking to outreach to the east bay.
"Our vision for this year is to we leverage partnerships that already exist in the community and impact our immediate applicant pool in all areas, tech and nontech," Lisa said.
4. Think Beyond the Pipeline
The tech companies who are thinking about diversity seem to be heavily focused on the immediate pipeline with their recruiting efforts to bring more women and people of color in the tech door. Pandora is doing the same. But that's not all. They're also focusing on other stages of the pipeline.
Better gender diversity is not just about hiring more women, but also about helping support women who already work in the field.  Women leaving tech  is just as much of an issue as getting them there in the first place. Female employees are more likely to leave if they don't work alongside female management, mentors and colleagues.
So earlier this month, a group of Pandora female developers attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference to recruit, but also to bond. Lisa said initiatives like this are important for their employees to see such a strong community of tech talent outside of Pandora. When they are part of a community with other women who are also pursuing computer science and computer engineering, female employees are more engaged.
In addition, Lisa is actively working on a mentorship platform that's focused on internal employees and their access to other Pandora Women in different stages of their careers.
5. Pay Attention to Underrepresented Groups
When the "diversity in tech" conversation comes up, people often discuss gender diversity. In addition to ethnic and racial diversity, there are also other underrepresented demographics in tech that often get overlooked.
"Age is a big thing that people tend to overlook," Lisa said. "Many of the startup companies and bigger companies that went through the recent tech boom tend to trend younger. A company that's young in demographic impacts women and men who are looking to build families and who are looking for more balance in their lives because people are not as conscientious about the challenges people have outside of their jobs and the different roles they have to play." Lisa says "Pandora seems to have a fundamental understanding of this because the company was founded by musicians and many Pandora employees are very creatively active outside of work."
Another important group tech companies often overlook is veterans. "Being a veteran-friendly environment is not new to other industries," said Lisa. "But it's new to rapid-growth startups tech. There are some great transferable skills that we haven't even begun to tap into."
People with disabilities haven't been mentioned much as well. "Tech companies talk so much about reaching everyone and being able to makes things easier for people," said Lisa. "Just in the United States there are close to 50 million people with some type of long-lasting condition or disability. Innovating for everyone can't happen if your product isn't physically accessible."
For Oakland-based Pandora, Lisa said socioeconomic diversity is also something that the company thinks about and encourages other companies to consider to priority. San Francisco and the Silicon Valley may seem to be doing well wealth-wise, but there are so many pockets of disadvantaged communities right in all of our backyards. "How can we work with communities below the poverty line and make an impact through jobs?"
While Pandora is proud to report better diversity numbers than most tech companies, they're striving to do even better. They want to have more technical women on staff. They want better racial diversity among their employees. They want to be more involved in their surrounding community. Numbers aside, they strive to be a company where, like music, everyone's voice is respected and valued. And they're taking the right steps to get there.
How else can tech companies prioritize diversity?

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.

Progressives Have a Winning Economic Narrative -- and Democrats Who Used It Wonreddit
The big post-election consensus is that Democrats believe, as The New York Times put it, they were missing "a broad economic message to enthuse supporters and convert some independents."
So what would that missing narrative be? The point of a narrative is to give people an explanation of what they are experiencing that includes what is wrong, who is responsible, and what we can do about it.
Take a look at two explanations of what's happening that are very similar but different in important ways.
The first, from Republican message guru Frank Luntz, writing in The New York Times : "[F]rom the reddest rural towns to the bluest big cities, the sentiment is the same. People say Washington is broken and on the decline, that government no longer works for them -- only for the rich and powerful."
The second , from Democratic message advisors James Carville and Stan Greenberg, along with Page Gardner: "People believe that the rich are using their influence to rig the system so the economy works for them but not the middle class."
The big difference here is how the common sentiment among Americans -- that the rich call the shots -- is framed to suggest a solution. By focusing on the government, Luntz sets up the Republican push for limited government. Or as successful Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst said in a debate, "When Washington is picking... winners and losers, it's almost always our Iowa middle-class families that lose."
For Carville, Greenberg, and Gardner, the focus is on the economy being rigged. Or as one ad for Oregon's Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley said, "It is Jeff leading the fight to hold Wall Street and big banks accountable when they prey on working families and small businesses. "
Merkley won and so did Ernst. The explanation, according to progressive pundits, is that Democrats like Merkley who used a populist message -- which means they connected people's economic concerns to the rich and powerful who are responsible -- were successful while Dems who ran away from that message lost. As someone who has been leading the Progressive Economic Narrative (PEN) project, I really wanted to believe that. But as it seemed too easy, I decided to look at some campaigns and see whether it was spin or the truth. It turns out to be the truth.
The first case I looked at was Minnesota Democrat Al Franken's campaign. After eking out a victory in the great Democratic year of 2008, Franken won handily this year, even as Republicans took over the Minnesota House of Representatives. Imagine my smile when I quickly found Franken ads based on the key value statement in our Progressive Economic Narrative , "We all do better when we all do better." This was also a key theme of Minnesota's great progressive senator, Paul Wellstone.
Franken's progressive populism makes a key distinction when he uses the key word in that values phrase, "all." As he says in another ad,  "I work for all Minnesotans. Wall Street wasn't happy about that. But I don't work for Wall Street. I work for you."
The name of our Progressive Economic Narrative is "An America that works for all of us," which is central to the aspirational power of our story. However, what is needed for that message to win is to make it clear who is not included in "all of us" (i.e., the wealthy). A poll of voters last spring found that voters preferred "growing the economy" over "an economy that works for all of us" by 10 percentage points. By contrast, voters chose "an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy" over "growing the economy" by 22 points!
Merkley was also sure to name the villains of the economic story throughout his campaign, as in the Wall Street ad mentioned above.
So what about those Democrats who lost in purple states? I would have thought Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who founded the populist caucus when he got to Congress in 2007, would have run a populist campaign. Instead, Braley ran on working across the aisle to get things done in Iowa and not "letting the extremists from either party get in the way." Because voters are skeptical about anything getting done for them in Washington, his message fell flat.
Braley listed progressive issues, but without a narrative to link them together. His only villains were the "Koch brothers and their extreme agenda," but he didn't say what made their agenda extreme. Contrast that with how Merkley described "the billionaire Koch brothers," who want to give "more tax breaks to millionaires and reward companies that ship jobs overseas."
What about Mark Udall in Colorado, another Democrat who lost in a purple state that Obama carried? Udall built his campaign narrative around a war on women by his opponent Rep. Corey Gardner. He, like Braley, ticked off a list of progressive issues -- from minimum wage to pay equity to protecting Social Security -- without providing any framing story to link them together. He left out who the villains are in the story.
Udall also committed the ultimate narrative sin: delivering your opponent's story. Here's the closing line of a Udall ad: "I'm Mark Udall. No one -- not government, not Washington -- should have the power to take those rights and freedoms away." Voters who wanted the anti-government candidate chose the real thing!
Udall would have had a much broader audience for his "war on women" message if he framed it as part of a broader war on American families by the rich and powerful. It is easy to make opposition to pay equity or a woman's right to make her own decisions part of this broader story, which speaks to Americans' deep concerns about their families.
One part of the story I didn't see in the candidate ads was how Democrats should address Luntz's "blame government" narrative. The answer, as Hart Research pollster Guy Molyneaux explains in The New York Times , quoting almost verbatim from the Progressive Economic Narrative, is that "the important question facing America today is not how big government should be so much as who government should work for: corporations and the wealthy, or all Americans?"
As Molyneaux points out, "That is a debate Democrats can and will win."
What even progressive Democrats need to do better is tell a story about how to create that economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy. This is a matter of both clear narrative and bold policy.
The core of our economic theory is, as we say in the Progressive Economic Narrative, "working people and the middle class are the engines of the economy." Another version of this, popularized by the Center for American Progress , is "we build the economy from the middle-out, not trickle-down."
The story we are telling is that people are the job creators, not businesses. That raising the minimum wage is not just about fairness, but about creating economy-boosting jobs that put money in people's pockets to spend in their communities. "We all do better when we all do better" is not just a statement of values; it's the progressive belief about how the economy works.
Our narrative connects to policy with the phrase "we build a strong middle class by decisions we make together." Democrats need to step up with bold policies, many of which are already out there, waiting to be championed. Here are just three:
1.     A massive public investment to dramatically increase the use of clean energy  - which would at the same time tackle the challenge of climate disruption -- with a requirement that all the jobs created pay wages that can support a family.
2.     A $15/hr minimum wage that grows with productivity, so that workers get their fare share of the wealth they create. 
3.     A robust system of public financing that would allow candidates to win office without taking big campaign contributions from anyone, addressing the public's belief that the rich call the shots.
One thing Democrats had better not say is "Oh, what's the narrative? What do we say about the economy?" Progressives have a powerful narrative and bold solutions to create an America and an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy. Candidates who run on this have won and will win. And an America that runs on these policies will do to what too many Americans no longer believe is possible: provide a better life for our children.

CRPF jawan fires accidental shots inside ParliamentHousePrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:01 pm
Security agencies are probing an incident involving a CRPF jawan, posted in highly-secured Parliament building here, who allegedly fired as many as four bullets from his rifle “accidentally”.
Officials said the incident had occured a few days back when a security guard of the Parliament Duty Group (PDG) contingent of the paramilitary force allegedly fired the bullets when he was putting his weapon in the armoury.
They said the incident that happened inside the sensitive building zone was a case of “accidental firing” and no one was hit.
“We are conducting an inquiry into the incident. The Parliament complex is a sensitive place from security point of view and there is no place for error here and hence the trooper involved and his supervisor has been removed from security duties of the building,” Central Reserve Police Force Inspector General (Operations) Zulfiquar Hasan said.
Officials said the firing, in which at least four bullets were fired, occured when the trooper was alone near the armoury and was about to surrender his weapon as he was getting off from duty.
CRPF has created a special unit called PDG for guarding the complex and this unit draws some of the best jawans and officers from the force.
“This incident was surely a case of accidental firing but it is not being taken lightly and measures will be put in place so that such an incident does not occur again,” a senior officer involved in Parliament security duty said.
Parliament is set to hold its winter session from Novemebr 24.

A look at the top issues at Asian security m...A look at the top issues at Asian security meeting
AP Nov 11, 2014, 09.13PM IST
(A third of the world's shipping…)
NAYPYITAW: President Barack Obama and leaders from Europe and Asia gather this week in Myanmar to discuss territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the Islamic State group, Ebola and other issues that threaten to undermine regional security. Hot topics:
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA:
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which is of tremendous strategic importance to everyone, including Washington, are likely to be one of the most talked about issues, though no breakthroughs are expected.
A third of the world's shipping transits through the contested sea, which is also rich with fish and is believed to have large oil and gas reserves under the seabed.
China _ which claims most of the area _ has stepped up naval patrols in recent months and temporarily positioned an oil rig in territory also claimed by Vietnam, sparking deadly anti-Chinese riots. Others claiming parts of the sea are the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia.
EBOLA:
Although Asia has not had any confirmed Ebola cases, the region which has more than 60 percent of the world's population has become acutely aware of its vulnerability to the deadly virus.
More than 5,000 people have died, most of them in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. China and India are the top two destinations in Asia for travelers from the hardest-hit nations.
Nations in the region have stepped up surveillance at airports and are considering quarantine measures, but experts worry that the preparations may be insufficient and Asia should be doing more to join the global fight.
MYANMAR:
The gathering of world leaders in Myanmar's purpose-built capital was supposed to be an international coming-out party for the former pariah state.
But three years after it began moving from dictatorship to democracy, sweeping reforms that marked President Thein Sein's early days in office have stalled and in some cases slid backward, with the jailing of activists, growing threats to the media, and efforts to bar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from running for the presidency.
International attention has focused particularly on violence against Rohingya Muslims in the predominantly Buddhist nation. More than 100,000 Rohingya have fled the country by boat in the last two years.
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP:
The US is looking to Indonesia, Malaysia and other predominantly moderate Muslim nations in the region to help prevent recruitment of extremists for the Islamic State group, following revelations that Australians are among the group's fighters. That includes working to rebut radical ideologies and crack down on terrorist financing.
WHO'S ATTENDING:
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit on Wednesday and the East Asia Summit on Thursday bring together more than 18 leaders. They include Obama, Chinese Premier Li Kequiang, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. This will be the first ASEAN summit for newly elected Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

Volkswagen's talks to raise stake in its Chinese joint venture hit road block

(VW's efforts to raise its…)
BERLIN: Volkswagen's bid to increase its stake in a lucrative joint venture with Chinese partner FAW has stalled just as the German automaker is stepping up expansion in its biggest market, company sources said.
The setback to VW's ambitions in China, where it sells nearly 40 per cent of its vehicles, comes as Beijing seeks to promote national champions that can compete globally and appears to be putting overseas companies under increasing scrutiny.
VW's efforts to raise its 40-per cent holding in FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Ltd. to about 50 per cent have stalled after more than a year of talks, two sources at the German company told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the matter.
"The door (leading to a higher stake) appears to be closed at the moment," one of the sources said. VW's efforts to increase its stake would continue, they said.
VW holds a 50-per cent stake in its second Chinese joint venture, with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. Expanding its holding in the project with FAW would earn it a greater share of both ventures' growing profits which have more than doubled since 2010 to 4.3 billion euros ($5.34 billion) in 2013.
VW and the FAW-VW joint venture company declined to comment. FAW could not immediately be reached for comment.
There is anecdotal evidence from a variety of companies operating in China that demands from local partners, policymakers, and regulators are getting more rigorous.
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY
In return for winning a 25-year extension of the partnership with FAW last month -- from 2016 to 2041 -- VW had to agree to develop more cars in China and to use latest technologies to foster China's push for electric and hybrid vehicles, sources said.
VW conducts most of its R&D work at its German headquarters and is reluctant to share valuable results with other parties, given the risk of counterfeiting.
VW only won Chinese approval to expand its production footprint in prosperous eastern cities last year by opening a plant in Xinjiang, an economically marginalized province in the far west that is rocked by ethnic violence, one source said.
The auto sector has been under scrutiny, with Chinese antitrust authorities pressuring VW's Audi luxury division and the China sales unit of Fiat Chrysler among several carmakers to cut prices.
Other industries, including pharmaceuticals and electronics, have also come under the spotlight as China makes greater efforts to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law.
The probes have left foreign businesses wary of China's evolving laws and regulations, leading some to hold off on planned investments.
"Many companies have adopted a waiting attitude because it's not clear at the moment which way the structural reforms are exactly going to take," Hanna Mueller, a senior manager at Germany's BDI industry federation, told Reuters.
"This (waiting attitude) is more noticeable than years ago."

Difficult to do business in India: VodafoneDifficult to do business in India: Vodafone

("Its not nice to say, but…)
NEW DELHI: Country's second largest mobile operator Vodafone India today said conditions for doing business in the country have not improved much in the last few months but it is "hopeful that change will happen".
"Its not nice to say, but it is reality. It is not like we said 'its difficult to do business in India', it is objectively difficult to do business in India..," Vodafone India Managing Director and CEO Marten Pieters said when asked if conditions have improved for doing business.
"Coming to the telecom industry, we have not seen much change so far but we are hopeful that change will happen," he added.
Pieters cited the latest World Bank report wherein India has dropped by two places as compared to last year in the ease of doing business.
India ranked 142 among the 189 countries surveyed for the latest World Bank's 'Ease of Doing Business' report, a drop by two places from the last year's ranking.

Chhattisgarh: Botched sterilisations claim 11 lives; PM seeks detailed probeEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Can this ad campaign get people in Belgium to stop Googling their symptomsBy Sarah Larimer November 11 Follow @slarimer
When you're looking for health guidance, there are, occasionally, better places to turn than the Internet. (Vimeo)
Look, real talk — who among us has not, in moments of weakness and/or headache-induced distress, put medical symptoms into Google just to confirm that we were, in fact, probably totally dying?
Let that person cast the first stone.
(And then let that person Google "threw out arm casting stone" because that sounds like something that could definitely strain your arm, if you hadn't stretched first.)
The thing is, everyone does this. I mean, almost everyone. Some of us are still old-school, and just call our mothers. But for those who turn to the Internet for all of life's great questions — Why does my tummy hurt? What is the deal with this gross eye thing? [Just insert your own disgusting medical query here] — don't worry. There's help. (So long as you're in Belgium.)

K Suryanarayana, Head - Small and Medium Business Sales, Google India, at a press conference in Chennai. - BIJOY GHOSH
Chennai, November 11:  
Google will soon launch a mobile app to help small and medium-size business get online. This will be part of the company’s “Digitising India” mission to help SMBs establish an Internet presence and connect with potential customers online, according to K Suryanarayana, Head of SMB sales, Google India.
Most of the SMBs have ignored the potential of the Internet to grow.
Quoting a survey, Suryanarayana said that out of the 48 million SMBs, only 5-6 per cent businesses have a website. But nearly 40 per cent of the SMB owners have a smartphone, which can be used to develop online presence, he told newspersons.
The app will be made available next month, he said without giving any further details.
The US-based technology company is on a road show to help SMBs succeed online.
According to a latest research conducted by Zinnov on behalf of Google, only 8-10 per cent of the total SMBs can immediately gain from adopting Internet technologies and grow their businesses by advertising online.
The challenge has been lack of awareness on the benefits of Internet and the know-how required to succeed online.
Google along with Confederation of India Industry has launched Google SME Heroes, which will showcase and celebrate local SMBs that have embraced the Internet to growth their business, he said.

Disclose info related to markets periodically: Prashant Saran‘Need of the hour is to build trust assiduously’
Mumbai, November 11:  
Companies would be required to disclose “non-events” such as loss of market share or technology obsolescence on a periodic basis (annually to start with) to shareholders through an exchange filing.
Yearly memo, updates
Outlining the future of corporate disclosures at an event in Mumbai on Tuesday, Prashant Saran, Whole-Time Member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), said companies would have to incorporate such information in the annual information memorandum and periodically update the prospectus filed by them at the time of their initial public offerings.
This, Saran said, would provide secondary market investors with updated information besides enabling companies to file for future capital raising in the form of rights or further public offerings.
“Right now, the imperative is to build trust, as a lot of trust has been lost in the last decade. We have to build it assiduously. We have been reviewing the Clause 36 of the listing agreement (for timeliness and adequacy) and have suggested that corporates disclose all material events in a manner such that investors will get a meaningful understanding,” said Saran.
The Clause 36 of the equity listing agreement requires a listed entity to disclose details of all events, which will have a bearing on the performance/ operations of the listed entity, as well as price sensitive information to stock exchanges immediately. This usually consists of information on events such as strikes, lockouts, closure on account of power cuts and the like.
SEBI’s discussion paper dated August 19, 2014, is expected to be taken up during the next board meeting likely to be held this month.

We will not sell the scheme  but make people buy: Parag Parikh‘All the employees of the firm are investor in the fund’
BL research Bureau:  
PPFAS Mutual Fund’s first unit holders’ meet held in Chennai on Saturday reinforced its CEO Parag Parikh’s resolve to challenge the status quo of the country’s mutual fund industry. This is the first time ever that unit holders of a scheme were invited to discuss its performance with the fund management team.
Self-scrutiny time
“But for you (investors), we would not have had this opportunity. So we decided to hold an annual general meeting every year, where we will subject ourselves to scrutiny,” said Parikh, addressing a large group of unit holders at Taj Connemara, here.
Reiterating PPFAS MF’s investing philosophy of ensuring preservation of capital and earning a reasonable rate of return, Parikh reassured unit holders that the fund house will not launch another scheme and confuse investors. From special situations such as mergers and acquisitions, open offers to arbitrage opportunities and global themes, the fund has capitalised on every opportunity available in the market, he said.
Innovative detour
“We picked up courage and decided to have just one scheme,” said Parikh. “We do not follow others in the MF industry in chasing assets under management or having a large sales team to do so. The company has gone against the current industry practice wherein the fund house’s sales team identifies and designs the hot selling theme, he added.
“We don’t want to sell the scheme, we want you to buy. You will buy only if the performance is good over a period of time,” he added.
All the 45 employees of PPFAS MF have invested in the fund. “This makes sure that there are automatic checks and balances. Since every employee is an investor too, there is a readymade risk management system in place,” he added.
Best hedging tool
Asserting that equity MFs are the best hedge against inflation and the most tax-efficient way to benefit from special situations such as open offers, he urged investors not to get perturbed by short-term volatility.
“You have given your money to professionals, so don’t worry about the ups and downs; stay invested,” he added, hailing equity MFs as a great investment for the poor.

China is ‘Focus Country’ in this year’s festival
New Delhi, November 11:  
The upcoming International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa will host two biggies of Indian cinema — Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth. While Big B will be the Chief Guest, Rajinikanth will be conferred with the Centenary Award for the Indian Film Personality of the Year.
For the opening film, Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf’s The President has been chosen, while The Grand Master by Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai will be the closing film. The film festival is slated from November 20-30. Speaking to reporters, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said the fact that Goa had become a permanent destination for IFFI, an annual festival, will help the State Government to have dedicated infrastructure for the event.
He said China was the ‘Focus Country’ in this year’s festival. “Their films will be screened and they are also bringing a working group that will engage with Indian filmmakers to discuss on collaborations,” he said, adding that both the countries had signed an audio-visual co-production agreement earlier.
IFFI 2014 would screen 179 films from 75 countries across categories, such as World Cinema (61 films), Master-strokes (11 films), Festival Kaleidoscope (20 films), Soul of Asia (7 films), Documentaries (6 films), Animated Films (6 films). Besides, the Indian Panorama section will include 41 feature and non-feature films, including seven films from the North-East, which is the focus region this year.
IFFI will also pay homage to Richard Attenborough, Robin Williams, Zohra Sehgal, Suchitra Sen, and a special tribute to actor Farooq Sheikh. Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell and Polish film-maker Krzysztof Zanussi are the Guests of Honour for this festival.

Scientists Achieve Direct Brain-To-Brain Communication Between Humansreddit
Telepathy is the stuff of science fiction. But what if the dystopian futurists were on to something? What if our brains could directly interact with each other, bypassing the need for language? The idea isn't quite so far fetched, according to a recent University of Washington study in which researchers successfully replicated a direct brain-to-brain communication between two people.
In an initial demonstration a year ago, one of the researchers was able to send brain signals over the Internet in order to control the hand motions of another researcher. Now, in a more comprehensive study, the researchers repeatedly were able to transmit signals from one person’s brain via the Internet, and used these signals to control the hand motions of another person within a fraction of a second.
The study tested three pairs of participants (each with one sender and one receiver) who were seated in separate buildings on the Washington campus, roughly half a mile apart. They were unable to interact with one another, except for the link between their brains.
Watch the video below for a demonstration.
Here's what happens: One participant, the 'sender,' is hooked to an electroencephalography machine that reads his brain activity and sends electrical pulses via the Internet to the 'receiver,' who has a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil placed near the part of his brain that controls hand movements. With this technology, the sender can issue a command to move the hand of the receiver by simply thinking about the hand movement.
The sender, who is playing a computer game in which he has to defend a city by firing cannons, thinks about firing the cannon at various intervals throughout the game. The "Fire!" brain signal is sent over the Internet directly to the brain of the receiver, whose hand hits a touchpad that allows him to fire the cannon.
“The new study brings our brain-to-brain interfacing paradigm from an initial demonstration to something that is closer to a deliverable technology,” study co-author Andrea Stocco, a researcher at UW’s Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences, said in a university statement . “Now we have replicated our methods and know that they can work reliably with walk-in participants.”
The accuracy among the pairs ranged from 25 to 83 percent, with errors attributed primarily to the sender's failure to "accurately execute" the fire-command thought rather than the hardware.
The UW team has earned a $1 million grant to conduct further research on decoding and transmitting more complex brain processes, expanding the types of information that can be sent from one brain to another.
The researchers believe that there could one day be potential therapeutic applications for people with brain injuries or disorders.
"We believe that it would be worth exploring the idea that you can help the [brain's] recovery process by literally transmitting the waves of a healthy brain to the brain that has been damaged," Stocco said in a UW video .
Although the applications for brain health are far in the future, the research could be a big step towards treating people with brain damage, according to researcher Chantel Prat of the UW Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences.
"This paradigm offers a wide opportunity for developing protocols for interacting with or putting information into a human brain," Prat added in an email to the Huffington Post. "This technology could eventually be used to 'patch' what is missing or lost in a brain-damaged individual."
The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
A special court today issued non-bailable warrant against DMK MP Kanimozhi, facing trial in 2G spectrum case, for non-appearance only to cancel it in less than an hour after her counsel appeared before it and apologised.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini had issued the NBW against her for December 19, noting that neither she nor her counsel had appeared before the court.
“It is 11.30 a.m., neither any advocate for Kanimozhi is present nor any application for her exemption from personal appearance has been filed,” the judge said.
The matter was fixed for commencement of final arguments in the case and Kanimozhi failed to appear before it.
However, the court later cancelled the NBW while allowing the application of Kanimozhi’s counsel who appeared before it at 12.25 p.m.
“NBW is hereby cancelled. He (counsel for Kanimozhi) is advised to be careful in the future.”
The has court fixed December 19 for hearing final arguments as the counsel for CBI and the accused sought time to advance the arguments.
Besides A Raja and his erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, who were present in the court, others accused including former Telecom Secretary Sidharth Behuria, Swan telecom promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka moved exemption plea through their lawyers which was allowed by the judge.
Others facing trial in the case include Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra, three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) — Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair .
Directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal, Kalaignar TV Director Sharad Kumar and Bollywood producer Karim Morani are also accused in the case.
Besides these 14 accused persons, three telecom firms — Swan Telecom Pvt Ltd (STPL), Reliance Telecom Ltd and Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd — are facing trial in the case.
The court had on October 22, 2011 framed charges against them under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act dealing with offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, faking documents, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by public servant and taking bribe.
The offences entail punishment ranging from six months in jail to life imprisonment.

Court to hear final arguments in 2G case on Dec 19Court to hear final arguments in 2G case on Dec 19

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
A Delhi court today fixed December 19 for hearing final arguments in the 2G spectrum allocation case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and 15 others.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, who was scheduled to hear the matter today, deferred the case after counsel for CBI and the accused sought more time.
“Put up for December 19 for final arguments,” the judge said.
During the brief hearing, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Anand Grover said that he required some more time to advance his arguments.
The SPP’s submission came after Vijay Aggarwal, counsel for Swan Telecom promoter Shahid Balwa, one of the accused, asked the court how it can commence final hearing when an application has been moved by CBI for examining more witnesses.
Earlier, on September 10, the court had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case.
The Central Bureau of Investigation had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 30,984 crore to the exchequer in the allocation of 122 licences for 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the Supreme Court on February 2, 2012.
The special judge, who is exclusively dealing with 2G scam cases, had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case in which CBI had examined 153 witnesses, while the accused have called 29 witnesses in their defence.
The recording of evidence in the case involving Raja and 16 others had started three years ago on November 11, 2011, after the court had framed charges against the 17 accused named in the first two-charge sheets filed by the agency.
The court has recorded the statements of 153 CBI witnesses, including Reliance ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani, his wife Tina Ambani and former corporate lobbyist Nira Radia, running into over 4,400 pages in the case.
Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behuria, Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra, three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) — Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair — are facing trial in the case.
Directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal, Kalaignar TV Director Sharad Kumar and Bollywood producer Karim Morani are also accused in the case.
Besides these 14 accused persons, three telecom firms — Swan Telecom Pvt Ltd (STPL), Reliance Telecom Ltd and Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd — are facing trial in the case.
The court had on October 22, 2011 framed charges against them under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act dealing with offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, faking documents, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by public servant and taking bribe.
The offences entail punishment ranging from six months in jail to life imprisonment.

New Labour Minister needs to handle key amendments
New Delhi, November 10:  
Bandaru Dattatreya, the first Minister from the newly formed Telangana to join the Narendra Modi Cabinet on Monday, said social security and protection of workers is both a priority and ‘religion’ for his Government.
Taking charge as Minister of State (Independent charge) for Labour and Employment, Dattatreya said that in keeping with Modi’s vision of ‘Shrameva Jayate’, his priority will be skill development and job generation.
On the recent labour law reforms that are being seen as “anti-worker” by trade unions who said were not taken into confidence, the Minister said he would study various labour laws and ensure that social security for workers in the organised and unorganised sectors is protected.
Dattatreya takes over at a time when the Modi Government is on an overdrive to initiate labour reforms tailored to ease ‘doing business” in India.
Under his predecessor Narendra Singh Tomar, the Government had initiated a string of labour reforms in response to Modi’s call to foreign companies to ‘Make in India’, such as steps to end ‘inspector raj’ and self-attestation.
Among the key challenges ahead for Dattatreya will be to initiate amendments to some more labour Acts, as well pushing for passage of pending Bills in Parliament, such as the new Factories Act.

Our support to BJP stands: Sharad PawarMaharashtra’s interest behind this stance, says NCP
Mumbai, Nov 10:  
NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday reiterated that his party’s earlier offer to support the BJP Government in Maharashtra stands.
This came a day after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackarey threatened to sit in the Opposition if the BJP, its ally at the Centre and former coalition partner, takes support from the NCP in Maharashtra.
Repeating his party’s stance since the State Assembly results came out on October 19, the NCP strongman said that to support the BJP is a “conscious and collective decision” in the larger interest of the State.
Pawar said the NCP and the Congress do not have enough seats to form a government. Hence, in the interest of having a stable government, his party has offered unconditional support to the BJP, which emerged with the highest number of seats.
Shielding ministers
When questioned if this move is designed to shield some of his ministers from investigations, Pawar said: “The Government at the Centre and the State is free to conduct investigations.”
However, he did not clarify on whether his party will vote in favour of the BJP government in Maharashtra, or abstain from voting altogether on November 12, when the new government will be required to prove its strength on the floor of the House.
“We will decide based on the situation then,” he added.
If the NCP abstains from voting, it will bring down the effective size of the house to 247, bringing the BJP within sniffing distance of comfortably winning the trust vote in the 288-member Assembly.
The BJP, which has 122 MLAs, needs to have at least half the House strength to cross the line.
Policy issues
“We have not been contacted by anybody from the BJP on the issue of our support,” Pawar said, adding that the NCP will oppose the BJP if any of its policies are “anti-people.”
Asked if he has sent a letter of support to the governor, Pawar said: “Why should we give anything in writing? We know how to act on the floor of the House.”

Rail safety  customer service will be my priorities: Suresh PrabhuThe new railway minister, Suresh Prabhu.
New Delhi, Nov 10:  
Suresh Prabhu today took over as the new Railway Minister and said rail safety and customer service would be his priorities, as he seeks to unleash the true potential of the transport behemoth.
“We have faced lot of challenges in running the railways in the past. We do have potential which has not been properly utilised,” he told reporters after assuming charge.
Prabhu, who took oath as a Cabinet minister yesterday shortly after he joined BJP from Shiv Sena, replacing SD Sadananda Gowda who was shifted to the Law Ministry in the reshuffle.
“The Prime Minister has decided that the condition (of railways) has to change...Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety as passenger safety is increasingly becoming an area of concern,” he said.
Observing that the people have reposed lot of faith in the government, he said the steps they undertake in railways will be seen in due course of time.
“What we will do will be seen in due course of time, so no announcement will be made is the announcement,” he said.
Prabhu said the economy is also dependent on railways.
Railways is an integrating factor for the economy and, “if we work in this direction we can propel economic growth’’, he said.
With the public transporter having the largest workforce in the country, Prabhu said addressing their concerns will also be high on his agenda as they are the driving force behind the railway’s journey.

Being Busy as a Status Symbol: Why American Culture Values a Lack of Leisure Time and What We Can Do About itreddit
One of the most startling discoveries since my move to New York City a few months ago is the standard response to the question, "How are you?" Whereas in the U.K., the standard response is "Good, how are you?", a common response in NYC is "Busy!"
Here, I suggest that while being busy can signal higher value to others in the specific American context, widespread busyness in today's society can be dangerous. Rather by understanding the underlying mechanisms, we can exert agency to still be perceived as high-status -- without the potentially detrimental effects of being too busy.
This 'busy-means-high-status effect' is not just a recent development driven by mounting pressures due to rising individualism, technology and connectivity. Even Alexis de Tocqueville, a French political thinker of the 1830s and 1840s who wrote extensively about his journeys to the United States, titled one of his book chapters "Why the Americans Are So Restless in the Midst of Their Prosperity." Indeed, a recent study by Harvard Business School doctoral student Silvia Belleza and colleagues shows that being busy at work and a lack of leisure time are shorthand for inferring high status ( see working paper here ).
One can go so far as to trace this perspective to the Protestant work ethic, which emphasizes hard work, frugality and diligence as a constant display of a person's salvation in the Christian faith. This term was originally coined by the German Max Weber in his 1904 book The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism .
Weber argues that Protestants re-conceptualized work as a duty that benefits both the individual and society as a whole, transforming the Catholic idea of 'good works' into an obligation to consistently work diligently as a sign of grace. Hard work, as an indicator of who may be predestined for salvation, thus became a value for society to strive toward. Weber contends that this work ethic was instrumental in the definition of societies in Western Europe and the United States.
Grant Wood (1930): American Gothic
In stark contrast to Weber, in his 1899 book The Theory of the Leisure Class , American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen proposes that high status is defined by its lack of productive activity and its commitment to demonstrations of idleness. The images that quickly come to mind are those of (predominantly British) royalty, who openly engage in rather purposeless activities such as hunting and polo. In fact, the traditional concept of royals as "blue blood" stems from the pale skin that royals were able to maintain due to their lack of hard work in the fields. Veblen maintains that as societies mature, leisure time gives way to 'conspicuous consumption,' or the spending of money on and acquisition of luxury goods and services to publicly display economic power.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, playing polo in July 2007
So why is it then that being busy is associated with high status? To answer this question, let's bring in perspectives from biology and sociology. Biologist Amotz Zahavi's 1975 'handicap principle' suggests that a signal of strength (or high status) is one that is costly to the signaller (as this could not be afforded by an individual who is weak), as well as highly visible. From this perspective, being busy would be associated with high social status because it is costly to the person working long hours (in that she forfeits the opportunity to engage in leisure time) and communicates visible value to those around her (e.g., that she is in high demand). Indeed, this is the perspective that Belleza's research paper proposes.
An alternative explanation emerges if we turn to the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. In his 1979 work Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste , he claims that how an individual chooses to present herself depicts her status -- and crucially, her distance from lower social groups. For example, tastes in food and culture may be indicators of class because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual's fit in society. Importantly, Bourdieu proposes that foods formerly associated with the lower classes achieved upper-class status only because individuals from higher echelons of society could consume them without fear of being classified as lower class. Instead, being able to consume traditional 'lower-class' food such as lobsters or livers became a way for the upper class to distinguish themselves from the middle class, who, if they were seen to consume these food products, could be falsely taken for a lower-class member. Therefore, in contrast to Zahavi's handicap principle, which proposes that individuals aim to engage in behaviors that are costly and visible, Bourdieu's perspective on distinction highlights that individuals strive to engage in behaviors that distinguish them from lower social classes.
Does being busy reflect Bourdieu's notion of distinction? To answer this question, Belleza and colleagues bring in the concept of intentionality: to what extent is the individual's busyness driven by need (for example, juggling multiple jobs) or by choice (for example, because the individual loves her job so much)? In fact, Belleza's study shows that only individuals who intentionally engage in busy behaviors are perceived to be of higher status, thus tentatively supporting the idea that this is a potential way to distinguish oneself from lower social classes.
Interestingly, Belleza's research shows that the busy-means-high-status effect is reversed in Europe. Here, being busy is penalized, as observers attribute a lack of control and poor time management to the individual. This difference coincides with a decline in both Protestantism and its unique work ethic in Europe . Instead, Western European citizens value leisure time and time with family, thus reflecting Veblen's leisure class proposition. Whereas Americans work longer hours than ever, average European work hours have become shorter over the last decades . Some companies, such as Volkswagen, have even gone so far as to limit access to work e-mails, such that employees can't access work servers half an hour after the end of work .
There is a real danger in being too busy. Constant work overload can lead to burnout, a failure to prioritize important tasks and decreased social support, which in turn can reinforce burnout . However, if being busy is merely a way of signaling high status to others or distinguishing oneself from lower social classes, this norm can be changed. Indeed, if being busy is the norm, as social commentators seem to imply, maybe Americans can learn from Europeans and demonstrate their status by taking time out for themselves. Otherwise, a lack of leisure time, leading to burnout, or a desire to demonstrate high status may lead to dishonesty and other scandals. In an age of financial crises and fraud scandals, an emphasis on leisure time could therefore provide an alternative solution to recent calls for more regulation . And after all, who wouldn't want to disprove a German thinker and support an American one?

Facing Down Corporate Election Greedreddit
Previously published on BillMoyers.com .
In the midst of the midterm elections and the obsession with which party would control the US Senate, there were races at the local and state level with deeper implications for the future of the country.
In the small city of Richmond, California, a slate of progressive candidates faced off against a challenge from pro-business candidates backed to the tune of more than $3 million by the energy giant Chevron. For years, Chevron has treated Richmond like a company town and its large refinery there has been a constant source of health and safety concerns.
Since 2007, Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, a Green Party leader, and her allies on the city council have faced down not only Chevron but other corporate interests like the real estate and financial industries as well. This year, Chevron fought back with an expensive barrage of negative campaign media. But on Election Day, the progressive slate triumphed, despite the roughly $250 per vote Chevron spent.
McLaughlin -- who this year was term-limited as mayor but won a city council seat -- and Harriet Blair Rowan, a college student and journalist who uncovered the Chevron money story for the news website Richmond Confidential, talk with me this week about the role unlimited sums of corporate cash have played in Richmond. We discuss the great success of the billions spent by wealthy individuals and companies in other races across the country and how to fight back, using Richmond's example as a model for future fights of organized people versus organized money.

Brzezinski: Why We Need a U.S.-China  Pacific Charter  for Global Stabilityreddit
In Beijing on Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama called on China to be a "partner in underwriting the international order" instead of "undermining" it. One key American strategist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, is strongly promoting the idea that Obama's notion should be pushed further and formalized into a "Pacific Charter."
In this interview, I asked Brzezinski to flesh out his idea:
WorldPost: You have recently proposed a "new opening" to China and a "Pacific Charter" between the U.S. and China. What is the strategic reasoning behind this proposal at this time?
Zbigniew Brzezinski: It is dictated by global trends that point to more and more disorder across the world. It is increasingly difficult for the United States on its own to deal with this burgeoning chaos.
We are seeing today Russia's self-assertion in Europe. By annexing the Crimea and seeking to destabilize the Ukraine, it has opened up once again the issue of territorial changes accomplished by force of arms -- something that has not taken place in Europe since Hitler. The Middle East is exploding with radicalization. That can spread as it already has to Pakistan and Afghanistan and further northeast -- toward China
China today is a major power, co-equal economically with the United States. It is militarily significant. And it has a major stake, just as the U.S. does, in international stability. Without stability, China's top priority -- its economic development -- will be very much at risk.
So both countries have a stake in preventing the world situation from degenerating into violence and instability.
WorldPost: Are you suggesting an alliance?
Brzezinski : I am not talking about an alliance, or some dramatic joint action. I am talking about the two most important countries in the world addressing in a responsible fashion  the issues that threaten both of our interests.Together that can give the world a sense of the big powers working together not only for their own well-being but for the sake of global stability.
What is needed today is the enhancement of the U.S.-China relationship that is not focused on the specific national interests of each, but on the larger agenda of stabilizing the world before the present conflicts spin so far out of control they can't be contained. The world public needs some reassurance that we are not drifting into global chaos.
At a different historical moment, in 1941, that was the impact of the Atlantic Charter between the U.S. and Great Britain.
WorldPost; But Britain and the U.S. shared the same values of democracy and human rights.
Are China and America capable of that kind of partnership with such differing political systems?
Brzezinski : The idea of a "charter" is to indicate that this is a serious undertaking and not a set of slogans. Yes, the differences are great between the U.S. and China. But what is remarkable is that both realize that our degree of interdependence is such that if one suffers so does the other. That is a very powerful inducement for some degree of enhanced cooperation.
It would seem to me that China could play a unique role in stabilizing the Middle East, for example. The role of France and Great Britain has been damaged there by its history of colonialism. The U.S. has been severely weakened by the pre-emptive attack in Iraq and the consequent disintegration there. China, which has serious economic and energy interests in the Middle East but no political baggage, would seem to me to have a great stake in playing a role that reinforces stability there.
WorldPost: Historically, China has been the Middle Kingdom that dominated only its region through a system of tributaries. It has never had a global role. Is it up to the challenge of joining with the U.S. in such a role?
Brzezinski : China is obliged by its own interests -- that now span the globe because of its large economic presence -- to rise to this challenge. The fact that the U.S. and China are so important to each other makes a strong case for the proposition that we would both benefit from closer cooperation because we will both be hurt by the continuing spread of global disorder.
China recognizes the reality that there is not longer a single hegemon in the world upon which the responsibility of stability rests. Now we need a shared commitment to achieve that stability. It only makes sense that the two largest and most influential powers establish the foundation of order in which others -- Europe, Japan, India, the ASEAN nations, Latin America -- are, of course, included.
All can play a constructive role here, as is becoming clear as even Japan and China realize they have a greater interest in mutual stability instead of corrosive conflict.
It would be nice if the Russians could also be partners in shaping a new stability. But right now they seem bent on a form of national fanaticism.
WorldPost: What is the time frame of your thinking?
Brzezinski : The time is now. It is time to get past the usual empty bromides about some kind of cooperation in the distant future. If the world's two top powers cannot manage to get a handle on unfolding events sooner rather than later, we all will suffer.

You Can t Be Whatever You Wantreddit
I remember in second grade, my teacher went around the classroom and asked each student what they wanted to be when they grew up. Some kids wanted to be doctors and lawyers, but most wanted to be athletes or superheroes. When she got to me, I told her I saw myself as a scientist! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was my Saturday morning show, and Donatello was my favorite. He was the smart one, the problem-solver and since he liked science so did I. He wore purple so I rocked purple, and when Donatello had his bow I had my stick. He was my friend, and when my mom told me I would never be Donatello I didn't talk to her for an entire week.
Looking back, it seems silly that I would ever want to be something I'm not, but you and I do it everyday. It's called work. Think about it, most people don't grow up dreaming of desks, cubicles and computers. My first job was so bad that I scheduled bathroom breaks: two times in the morning and three in the afternoon. Who wants to live like this? No one, yet here we are: at a place we didn't plan.
I wonder, do we plan too much? I think back to kindergarten and coloring. The lines were just a guide, and what my crayons created was anybody's guess. Sometimes it was a masterpiece and other times a mess, but It was always honest and original. I think that when we plan too much, we pander to the crowd. Art becomes diluted when we design with the audience in mind.
The lesson is don't do it for the applause. Eventually people won't care and the only thing left is your motivation. I know this because I went into banking for all the wrong reasons. Think Wolf of Wall Street, except I was poor, overworked and completely sober. I was wide awake and getting off on the prestige and promise of riches. And it was all good until you find yourself living a lie you can't keep up. Like anything else, you can try faking it forever but forever is a long time.
The problem is that we're not born with unlimited choices. The same minds that created South Park are unlikely to succeed in say, aeronautical engineering. Would you trust your dentist to design your new home? Of course not, it's laughable. Yet, most of us misplace our talent, trading it in for a trap. Thinking we can do it all, instead of doing one thing and doing it well.
You know that box that everyone's telling you to think outside of? Well, they're all wrong. Jack is in the box and so are you. You and I are a collection of our interests, abilities, skills and strengths. No matter how much we try to conform, you can't change who you are. We can't think outside the box because inside is the content of our character. It's the stuff that makes you unique.
The thing to do is open the box. Jump in, get comfortable and kick your feet up. Start feeling familiar with yourself. Take a tour and what you'll discover is that you came into this world with a very specific calling. For me, it's business and building my blog . If you were born to sing then shout your song. Learn that lesson so you can teach what you've been taught. Walk in your truth, and give meaning to your work.
We all have a job to do, a self to become. The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to give that gift away. You can only give what you got, but you must know what you have first.
Ever think to yourself, "If I just find my passion, everything else will figure itself out!" Yea, me too and while passion is important, it's also filled with too much pressure. If you're like me, the more you think about something the less likely you are to do it. So stop wasting time. Let someone else do the heavy lifting for you. How often have you received a compliment on your cooking, advice or athleticism? Recognize when your cause is calling. Pick up.
We spend so much time trying to figure out why we're here and what we're supposed to do. The answer is simple. Just DO YOU. You can't be whatever you want in this life. You can only be you. Might as well go about the business of becoming who you were meant to be.

PM arrives in Myanmar; to step up ties with ASEANPM arrives in Myanmar; to step up ties with ASEAN
PTI

New Delhi, Nov 11:  
The 12th ASEAN-India summit kicks off tomorrow with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to make a strong pitch to step up engagement with the 10-nation bloc by improving regional connectivity to give a boost to trade and people-to-people contacts.
Modi arrived in the Myanmarese capital this afternoon by a special Air India plane, starting his 10-day three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia for the G-20 Summit and bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott and Fijian premier J V Bainimarama.
Modi was received by Myanmar Health Minister Than Aung at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport.
“Landed in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar to a very warm welcome! Great being in this beautiful country,” Modi tweeted after his arrival.
The Prime Minister will attend the India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.
‘Act East’ policy
Asserting that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is at the core of India’s ‘Act East’ policy, the Prime Minister said before leaving for Myanmar that he was looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take “our relationship to a new level, which will supplement our deepening bilateral ties with each member’’.
“ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration and where India will play a crucial role, ” Modi said, adding that ties with ASEAN are “deep rooted’’.
Modi expressed confidence that these meetings with the leaders of ASEAN and East Asian blocs would be fruitful.
India-ASEAN 5-year plan
Indian officials said New Delhi is keen that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should lay emphasis on enhancing people-to-people contacts, augmenting trade, besides reinforcing strategic and political engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
An ambitious project is underway to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand. It was originally envisaged to be completed around 2017 but it is behind schedule and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway.
Bilateral trade
Officials said the free trade pact in services and investment between India and the ASEAN is expected to help the bilateral trade touch $100 billion by 2015.
The bilateral trade grew 4.6 per cent from $68.4 billion in 2011 to $71.6 billion in 2012.
ASEAN’s exports were valued at $43.84 billion and imports from India amounted to $27.72 billion in 2012.
The ASEAN community has the third largest population. It would be the seventh largest economy in the world and the third fastest growing economic unit this century.
It comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
East Asia Summit
Modi will be also participating in the 18-nation East Asia Summit (EAS) on Thursday before leaving for Brisbane to attend the G20 Summit.
“At the East Asia Summit, I look forward to discussing with ASEAN and seven global leaders how we can strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity,” the Prime Minister said ahead of the deliberations.
The EAS comprises 10 ASEAN nations, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.
On the sidelines of the international summits in Myanmar, Modi is slated to meet Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Singapore President Tony Tan, besides the host President Thein Sein.

The BSE Sensex on Tuesday gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data on Wednesday.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government's reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of $82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore on Monday, according to the stock exchanges' data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released on Wednesday, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy's, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.

Brent oil falls to $82 per barrel after hitting four-year lowAtlantic basin
(Most analysts believe production…)
LONDON: Brent crude fell to $82 per barrel on Tuesday as a firm dollar and robust production from U.S. shale fields outweighed a drop in Libyan output, although it recovered in part from a four-year low early in the day.
The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies and hit a seven-year high against the yen, suppressing demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities by making them more expensive in other currencies.
But a supply shock in Libya supported prices as a rival government that has seized the capital took control of its most productive oilfield, El Sharara.
El Sharara and the eastern oil port of Hariga, which was shut by protests on Saturday, remained closed on Tuesday, bringing Libya's output sharply down from a peak of over 900,000 barrels a day achieved in September.
"Libya is likely to see a reversal of its recovery in oil output as the civil war deepens," analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note.
Brent for December was down 34 cents at $82 per barrel at 1415 GMT after reaching $81.23, its lowest since October 2010. U.S. crude was down 10 cents at $77.30 per barrel.
The Brent benchmark has fallen nearly 30 percent since late June due to rising production, slowing global demand and no signal from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it will cut output at a Nov. 27 meeting.
Falling prices have had little impact on drilling in the United States, with output from the fastest-growing and largest shale fields showing no sign of slowing, the Energy Information Administration said.
There was no breakthrough in negotiations between Iran and Western powers to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions after talks in Muscat, officials said, but talks continued on Tuesday. A deal could result in the lifting of Western sanctions, paving the way for increased Iranian oil exports.
But Iran has repeatedly refused to let a United Nations atomic energy official into the country, diplomats said, indicating continued mistrust between the two sides.
JPMorgan slashed its 2015 Brent price forecast by $33 to $82 per barrel on Monday, citing supply pressures in the Atlantic Basin and the apparent inability of OPEC member states to work cohesively to restrain production.

Jonathan Alcorn / ReutersFamily trumps profits at these stores closed on Thanksgiving
Ben Popken TODAY

Jonathan Alcorn / Reuters
A crowd of shoppers browse at Target on the Thanksgiving Day holiday in Burbank, California November 22, 2012.
If you think Thanksgiving is for family, not shopping, these stores agree.
Even though it means missing an opportunity to gain sales, dozens of retailers are again taking a stand and keeping their doors shut to give their workers a break and their reputations a boost.
They're pushing back against "Black Friday creep," in which the historic kickstart to the holiday shopping and deal season has been getting earlier and earlier until stores started opening on Thursday.
According to a National Retail Federation survey, of those consumers who have or will go shopping during the Thanksgiving holiday times, 31.8 percent said they planned to go shopping on Thursday.
But they won't be showing up at any of these stores. The growing list of retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving this year includes American Girl, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath and Beyond, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Burlington Coat Factory, Costco, Crate & Barrel, Dillard’s, DSW, GameStop, Hobby Lobby, HomeGoods, Home Depot, Jo Ann Fabrics, Lowe’s, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Petco, Pier 1, Publix, REI, Sam’s Club, Sur La Table, Talbots, T.J. Maxx, and Von Maur Department Stores.
Last year, home improvement chain Menard's took out full-page ads just to advertise that they'll be closed on Thanksgiving.
Video: Sears, Macy’s and Kmart and announced last year they they would be opening their doors on Thanksgiving day. NBC News’ Stephanie Gosk filed this report in 2013.
Retailers who do keep the doors shuttered say they're recognizing the value of family.
"First, we want our associates to have that time to spend with family," said Tara Raddohl, a Sam's Club spokeswoman, "Second, our members have told us they want that day to spend with their loved ones."
It's so against the trend that one chain had to start sending out press releases just to deal with the influx of media attention they received for not opening on Thanksgiving.
“Some of life’s most cherished traditions begin with family and friends. As a family-owned business since 1872, we value most the opportunity to spend quality time with loved ones on Thanksgiving and other holidays,” said Jim von Maur, president of Von Maur, an Iowa-based department store chain with 30 stores in 14 states, in the press release.
"The exceptional service and character our associates display day in and day out has been shaped by the likes of their parents, grandparents and friends," he said. "Giving them the opportunity to spend the holidays with those who have made such a lasting impact on their lives is a tradition we’ll never break."
Melody Wright, the store's Chief Operating Officer, questions whether stores that open on Thanksgiving are even making any more money.
"Most consumers say I have to spend X dollars and this is where I'm going to get it," she said. That amount is going to be the same whether it's spent on Thanksgiving, or four days before Christmas, she said.
A tiny camera hidden at the front door of over 1,000 retailers to count who comes and goes agrees. Last year, data from these ShopperTrak devices showed there was about the same number of shoppers going into stores on Thanksgiving as a normal Thursday in November, said company founder Bill Martin.
"They're getting sales on Thursday at the sacrifice of Friday, Saturday or Sunday," said Martin.
Because of the deals they have to offer to induce shoppers and because of overhead costs, "they're not making a lot of money as a result," he said.
Despite this, many stores, fearful that customers' wallets will be emptied by another store opening for Black Friday before they do, have continued an opening-hours arms race that accelerated during the recent economic downturn.
Target, Macy's, Kohl's, Sears and other retailers have announced opening hours of 6 p.m. J.C. Penney has tried to beat them all by opening at 5 p.m. This week, beleaguered electronics store RadioShack said they'll be opening at 8 a.m.
Their shoppers won't be visiting any of Von Maur's stores the same day. That's fine by Wright.
"If that means we make less profit on that particular day, we're willing to live with that," she said. "We've never been tempted that you would sacrifice the importance of family and holiday tradition and try to convince yourself that it will be more profitable."

NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman's return to Earth means that humanity is without a social media guru in space. But fear not, for soon another American astronaut, Terry Virts, will make the journey to the cosmos, and from the looks of it, his social media game is strong.
Wiseman (aka @Astro_Reid ) spent more than five months on the International Space Station conducting research and helping to care for the station — oh, and taking amazing selfies and epic landscape shots. He became the Internet's space darling . Wiseman even took the first space Vine !
1st Vine from space! Single Earth orbit. Sun never sets flying parallel w/terminator line #ISS #Exp40 @ast ... https://t.co/6TwyNdewCU

He returned Sunday with German Alexander Gerst (aka @Astro_Alex , a pretty decent social media space guy himself) and Russian commander Maxim Suraev.
Virts blasts off for the ISS on Nov. 23 and will be aboard the space station for more than five months. He will conduct at least two spacewalks during that time, according to NASA , while also helping to support hundreds of experiments in the station's laboratory.
But before he departs our planet, Virts has been in Russia training with his crew-mates -- an astronaut from the European Space Agency and another from the Russian Federal Space Agency. Virts, aka @AstroTerry , has been tweeting and 'gramming photos of his final weeks on Earth, which leads us to expect great things from him once he begins his orbit.

Oh, and he's a fan of horses. "I think the odds are 100 percent that we're going to be watching the Kentucky Derby from space," Virts told Louisville Fox affiliate WDRB .

Fiat Chrysler CEO sees Ferrari IPO in Q2-Q3 ...FCA
(The spin-off is part of a…)
BALOCCO: The initial public offering of luxury carmaker Ferrari is expected to happen between the second and the third quarter of 2015, the chief executive of parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said on Tuesday.
FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said last month he would spin off Ferrari from the group, sell a 10 per cent stake via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake in the luxury sports car brand to its shareholders.
The spin-off is part of a bigger capital-raising plan that also includes a $2.5 billion convertible bond issue to help cut debt and fund an ambitious business plan at the world's seventh-largest carmaker.
Marchionne said on Tuesday that after the capital raising the free float of FCA, which moved its primary listing to New York last month, could increase to around 20 per cent of the group's capital. A roadshow to market the capital raising with US investors is planned for December, he added.

Chhattisgarh: Botched sterilisations claim 11 lives; PM seeks probeEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Need help kicking your sugar habit This might help.By Abby Phillip November 11 Follow @abbydphillip
(SugarScience.org)
Dragging the American public kicking and screaming away from its favorite sugary treats is not easy. But it is even more difficult to break the news that it isn't just that doughnut that's laden with sugar. A majority of packaged foods of just about every kind come with hidden sugars that most people don't know about.
A new project by a team of 12 scientists and public health professionals at the University of California in San Francisco have taken on this daunting task.
SugarScience.org , the Web site associated with the project, launched Monday promising the "unsweetened truth" about sugar. For the health conscious, the information should come as no surprise. But for a lot of Americans, the harsh truth might be harder to come to terms with.
Take some of the bits on the site's homepage:
"Too much added sugar from soda and sports drinks can overload critical organs over time leading to serious disease."
"Added sugar is hiding in 74 percent of packaged foods."
"Too much fructose, a common form of sugar, can damage your liver, just like too much alcohol."
The researchers spent a year analyzing more than 8,000 scientific papers — scrutinizing them for conflicts of interest or author bias and throwing some that didn't meet high scientific standards. The result was a public information project aimed at clearing up the confusion. The facts presented on the site are vetted by scientists and backed by peer-reviewed research.
"There's a lot of confusion and misperception and conflicting information out there around sugar and health,” said UCSF health policy Prof. Laura Schmidt, the project's lead investigator,  according to the San Francisco Chronicle . “We wanted to develop an authoritative, go-to place where people can get truthful information, and we wanted to package it in a way that’s accessible to the average person.”
(SugarScience.org)
Most doctors and public health professionals would agree: Sugar is the elephant in the room for health. It is linked to the number one cause of death among Americans , heart disease, as well as diabetes and obesity.
But taking on sugar — like tobacco, alcohol and other money-making products that fuel public health concerns — is difficult and fraught with risk.
New York City learned the hard way when former mayor Michael Bloomberg instituted a ban on large containers of sugary drinks in 2012. Not only did the soda industry revolt, but so did the NAACP, despite the fact that heart disease, diabetes and obesity, all potential consequences of the overconsumption of sugar,  disproportionately affect African Americans .
Rejecting the "nanny state,"  60 percent of New Yorkers opposed the ban in a 2012 poll .
Years after Bloomberg's failed attempt, voters in the city of Berkeley approved an anti-sugar measure this month. It was a more modest proposal to tax sodas , sports drinks and other sugary beverages in an effort to influence consumer behavior.
In San Francisco, a similar measure failed. But according to the city's public health office, Americans are already feeling the consequences of a failure to address the country's rampant sugar problem.
“We're now just beginning to understand the impact that sugar has, beyond that you're just drinking empty calories," said Tomas Aragon, a health officer at the San Francisco Department of Public Health . "I don’t think people really understand it. They don’t really know what’s going on. But sugar is having a huge impact on society, and we're all paying for it.”
The American Beverage Association, which represents major soda makers like CocaCola, PepsiCo and Snapple, recently announced a new initiative to reduce the amount of beverage calories in the American diet, in an effort to forestall state-mandated taxes or outright bans on sugary beverages.
The difficulty of reducing the impact of sugary drinks on Americans' diets over the years illustrates how much knowledge is key. Most people who aren't scrutinizing the labels of their food and drink would find it difficult to know what has some form of added sugar in it and what doesn't.
But when they do, there's evidence that it changes their behavior. For example, a recent study found that kids consumed fewer sugary drinks if you told them how far they had to walk to burn it off.

Two-day conclave to discuss ways to boost services exports
New Delhi, November 11:  
Almost a decade after agreeing to mutually recognise qualifications of service providers in a number of sectors in each other’s countries, India and Singapore are close to sealing a deal that would ease rules for nurses.
“Our nurses are highly sought after. We have made some progress with Singapore and soon we should have some kind easing of rules related to movement of nurses,” said JS Deepak, Additional Secretary in the Commerce Ministry, at a press conference on Tuesday. Explaining why it took so long for India and Singapore to make headway in the area of mutual recognition agreements and why the country was yet to sign such agreements with Japan and South Korea, Deepak said that these processes required a lot of time and negotiations.
“It is a challenge. It requires reforms before it can happen,” he said.
India and Singapore signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2005 which led to reduction in tariffs on several products.
The Government and the industry will discuss ways to boost services exports, including those of professionals, at a two-day services conclave beginning on Wednesday.
Specific issues to be discussed at the meet include reforming e-commerce policy, boosting IT/ITES sectors, and making firmer inroads into sectors such as health, education, tourism and yoga, Deepak added.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also speak at the conclave organised by the Commerce Ministry and industry body CII.
Services push
The BJP-led Government, which is pushing manufacturing in a big way, is also now focussing its attention on services given the fact that the share of services in the country’s GDP was 57 per cent in 2013-14.
Exports of services in 2013-14 were estimated at $151.47 billion compared to goods exports worth $312.5 billion.
The Commerce Ministry will also organise a global services fair in New Delhi in April next year which is expected to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The conclave, to be attended by sectoral experts and professionals, will identify the challenge areas in services exports and strategise a road map for its sustained and accelerated growth.

Alastair Hughes, CEO (Asia Pacific) of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL)
Bangalore, November 11:  
Alastair Hughes, CEO (Asia Pacific) of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), who was in Bangalore to hold a board meeting of the Asia Pacific region comprising China, Japan, Australia, South East Asia and India, spoke to BusinessLine to share the real estate market sentiment and key issues on corporate leasing.
How is the realty market in India as compared to other countries in Asia Pacific ?
India has seen a dramatic recovery. The hangover did not last very long as it had in 2010-2011. The market is very dynamic here right now. While Asia-Pacific began to recover in 2012-2013, India went through a lull, largely due to lack of business confidence, driven by political situations.
Now, it feels like India is in sync with the rest of Asia-Pacific, which is in recovery mode post the global financial crisis. I would like to admit that 18 months ago, people were talking about China, Indonesia, different parts of South-East Asia and Japan. India didn’t feature much in the conversation with international investors because people were a bit concerned about the direction the country was going in. Now everybody is talking about India.
With India back in the reckoning, what is the likely flow of investment?
In terms of volume of money coming into the market globally, it will be about $125 billion this calendar year. 2007 was the last big investment year at $110 billion. Post the Lehman Brothers crisis, it fell dramatically to $40 billion in 2009.
These numbers include both the buying out of assets and leasing. Of the $125 billion this year, a small proportion of it has flown into India.
For India, the cumulative flow from 2007 till the third quarter of 2014 was around $14 billion. But from January-September of 2014 about $1.3 billion has already come in.
So, out of the $125-billion worth of transactional volume of Asia Pacific investments in 2014, only about $1 billion dollars is for India. Now with a stable Government at the Centre, there could be a potential capital inflow. So, we are looking at Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).
If the Government offers taxation relief, then by March 2015 we shall be looking at $10 billion of REIT that can be listed straight away. The top 18 developers in India have got ready stock that has potential for REIT, the valuation of which is about $10 billion.
Are you considering any time frame for both the REIT and taxation relief?
At this moment, due to double taxation, it does not make sense, something which the industry has represented to the finance minister. We anticipate it by the next financial year or early 2016.
What kind of demand do you expect international investors to have?
At present, we see an increase in liquidity. Last year, about 60 per cent of investment came from outside the UK, which includes the Middle-East, Singapore or China.
Interestingly in Shanghai, which you would consider to be Communist after all, about 40 per cent of buyers came from somewhere outside China. In India, at present, small volumes are coming from outside.
What is the profile of the $1.4 billion committed to India?
It is mostly from foreign direct investment (FDI). If you were to look at institutional Indian private equity, it is half a billion dollars.
So as a proportion, FDI is till more than the Indian institutional investment and the primary reason for that is that in India, insurance companies and pension funds are not allowed to invest in real estate.
Hence, very little institutional money is available other than the pure private equity money that has been raised in the domestic market.

I expect all central universities to implement credit transfer scheme next year: Smriti IraniPresident Pranab Mukherjee and Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani during the National Education Day celebrations in New Delhi on Tuesday. PTI
New Delhi, November 11:  
For integrating vocational and conventional education, Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on Tuesday launched Skill Assessment Matrix for Vocational Advancement of Youth (SAMVAY).
“I hope that from next academic year all central universities will implement credit transfer scheme to facilitate seamless movement of students,” Irani said on the occasion of National Education Day.
A credit framework is now in place which allows lateral and vertical mobility within vocational educational system and between current education systems. It defines the rules for credit allotment and follows the National Skills Qualification Framework.
Under the framework, skill knowledge providers or trainers will be registered by AICTE or other authorised bodies. Once a student completes the skill modules as required at a certification level and acquires the credits from the trainer, he/she can submit the credits to the institute which would transfer them to the technical board or university. After this, certification would be awarded by the university or technical board after compiling the vocational skill and formal education credits.
President Pranab Mukherjee also launched the Know Your College portal which aims to increase transparency and awareness about the opportunities of higher education. It has been developed to help prospective students make informed choices about pursuing higher education.
Apart from these, the Ministry also launched Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan to connect the country’s institutions of higher education and develop technical solutions to address challenges in rural India.
On the occasion, the PRAGATI scholarship was launched to encourage girls to pursue technical education at undergraduate level.

Buy a ship  flag out  and then seek more leewayBuy a ship, flag out, and then seek more leeway
NK Kurup
Indian shipowners want to be a national carrier and also have the freedom to flag out
November 11, 2014:  
It was at shipowners’ request that the government introduced the ‘Indian controlled tonnage’ scheme, allowing domestic firms to own foreign flag vessels — suggested as an easier way to buy more ships and take advantage of overseas business opportunities. The scheme allows shipping lines to flag out or register their vessels under any flag of their convenience subject to certain conditions.
To its credit, the country’s maritime administration implemented the scheme in less than a fortnight after it was announced in the Union Budget. However, shipowners who asked for the facility appear to have developed cold feet, saying that conditions in the policy are restrictive. There could be scope for relaxing the conditions, but they do not make it difficult for a company which is already operating vessels to buy a ship under the controlled tonnage scheme. Instead of waiting for more leeway, it would be better for shipping companies to make a beginning to create this new class of tonnage.
Conditions
What are these conditions? The most restrictive is said to be the one which makes it mandatory for those going for controlled tonnage to maintain their Indian tonnage at April 1, 2014 level.
This means, a company will have to first go and buy a ship to register under the new category; it cannot flag out one from its existing fleet. Also, the controlled tonnage should not exceed the owned ones. This condition is to ensure that Indian tonnage is maintained at a certain level.
After all, the objective of the policy is to increase the Indian (controlled or owned) shipping tonnage. Shipowners, however, think the provision restricts their freedom to sell ships. If their local tonnage falls below the stipulated level, they will not be able to operate those acquired under the foreign flag. In short, shipowners want full freedom to flag out and flag in vessels at their will.
Such flexibility, they argue, is crucial for them to make optimum use of their assets in the global shipping market, which is subject to cyclical fluctuations.
National tonnage
Indeed, shipping firms, like any other enterprise, need the freedom and flexibility to buy and sell assets. And more so, as shipping firms often make up their operating losses through asset trading. But here, the restriction is a safeguard against a possible fall in the national tonnage.
Indian shipowners, as pointed out by an official, want the best of both worlds — be a national carrier and also have the freedom to flag out without any restriction.
Blanket permission to flag out may lead to the danger of domestic shipping gradually losing its steam. This is not to say that there should not be any relaxation in the said provision, but to point out that the policy should not be seen just as an easier option to flag out at the cost of losing Indian tonnage. There are other conditions such as having a minimum 50 per cent Indian crew on board the controlled ships, and mandatory training of cadets. These are not seen as major barriers.
While granting domestic shipping lines the option to flag out, New Delhi should think about ways to make their life under Indian flag more comfortable.
Why should they flag out when there is enough cargo available on their own shores?
Currently, Indian ships carry less than ten per cent of the country’s cargo — a fact those making new schemes such as controlled tonnage need to ponder.

Keep your edge at work with  rookie smarts0
The book offers steps veteran workers can take to regain the edge they had back when they knew a lot less. A starting point is evaluating whether you are, in fact, in need of new challenges.
Some of the warning signs include: consistently getting good feedback; not preparing for meetings because you already know the answers; being busy but bored; and no longer feeling you're learning something new each day.
If you find yourself uncomfortably comfortable, it might be time for a change. That can come from requesting new assignments at work — in areas you're less familiar with — or even just spending time with younger employees and trying to see work through those fresh sets of eyes.
I asked Wiseman the key to taking these steps.
"This really comes down to humility," she said, "the humility that's born out of desperation. It's not a low sense of self; it's about being willing to learn from people at all levels. Newcomers don't really bring new ideas; they bring no ideas. When you bring nothing, it propels you into the most powerful form of learning, which is desperation-based learning. We don't learn because we want to; we learn when it's too painful not to learn."
Penelope Trunk, a career coach and co-founder of Quistic, which provides online career management courses, questioned the rookie mindset approach. Her contention is that some people are wired to seek out new challenges and keep learning, while others are content with the status quo.
She believes those innately driven to push themselves in new directions will do that on their own and those comfortable in more predictable routines shouldn't be made to feel they have to change.
"When a person says we should all have a rookie mindset, it's depressing if you don't," Trunk said. "Why should they have that mindset? They're fine."
I agree people are wired differently, and I certainly respect Trunk's belief that workers who don't aspire to constant waves of new challenges shouldn't be made to feel bad.
But I can't quite bring myself to say there's anything wrong with encouraging workers — regardless of how they're wired — to challenge themselves. Even if it's not what they want to do, taking on new tasks, learning new skills and having fresh ideas can be critical not just to success but to continued employment.
I began writing this workplace column knowing precious little about the subject matter. That put me in a position where I had to — and still have to, almost every week — learn from experts like Wiseman and Trunk.
It's a good position to be in. It keeps me energized and hungry. Maybe that's the way I'm wired, but I think operating under these circumstances can have value for everyone.
So regardless of your job, at least consider the benefits of stepping beyond the things you know you do well. You might find that being uncomfortable and confused has its advantages.

Oral contracts can be difficult to enforce0
Q: My husband and I plan to retire in about five years. Our mortgage balance is about $250,000. We would like to have our house free and clear of any debt when we stop working. Is there any way we can determine how much extra we would have to pay on a monthly basis to achieve our goal?
A: I appreciate that you would like to have a house free of any mortgage. But over the years, I have represented and counseled clients who found themselves "house rich and cash poor."
Keep in mind that even if there is no mortgage to pay, you need to carry insurance, pay the yearly (or semi-yearly) real estate tax and keep the house in good condition. That all costs money.
So before you jump into paying a lot more money monthly, do your homework. Will you have enough assets to live on — not just survive — in your retirement years?
Readers have suggested that if push comes to shove they can always get a reverse mortgage. Yes, but that could be expensive and, more importantly, it could eat up the value of the house for your heirs.
Now to answer your question. The Mortgage Bankers Association has a website with a lot of helpful information, http://www.homeloanlearningcenter.com . You will find a link called "mortgage payoff goal." You have to fill in your current loan balance, interest rate (be careful if you have an adjustable rate), current monthly payment and when you want the payments to end.
It's fairly easy. Let me give you an example: Your loan balance is $250,000, interest rate is 4.25 percent, and you pay $1,200 monthly (do not include escrows for taxes and insurance in your calculations). To pay off the loan in five years, you will need to make additional monthly payments of $3,432.
True, you will save over $176,000 in unnecessary mortgage interest payments, but is it really worth it? Keep the extra money in a secure investment for that rainy day.
Here are two alternative suggestions. First, if your interest rate is 6 percent or higher, give serious consideration to refinancing. Interest rates are in the low 4s, and there is no guarantee they will stay low for much longer.
Second, instead of making large extra monthly payments, add a little extra every month. In our example, if you add $100 each month, in other words making one extra monthly payment per year, you will reduce a 30-year loan down to about 22 years. It won't give you a house free and clear, but you will have money in the bank when you may need it.

Years after sexual harassment settlement  Ford plant sued...3
In a statement, Jimmy Settles, United Auto Workers vice president, said: "UAW-Ford takes charges of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation filed by all of our members very seriously including our members at Ford's Chicago Assembly plant. The economic and social justice extended to our members remains our focus. We have studied the claims filed by our members and others that have followed and will continue to aggressively take every action possible to safeguard the dignity and civil rights of our members."
The women say company representatives told them to stop calling the harassment hotline, and at least one woman said she was suspended for continuing to report abuse.
"I never got any help. In fact, I got retaliated against," Charmella Leviege, one of the women who filed the suit, said. Other plaintiffs are Christie Van, Maria Price and Helen Allen.
They allege they were subjected to jeers, lewd comments, sexual suggestions and catcalls by co-workers and supervisors. They also have filed employment discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Their suit, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges other women at the plant on the Far South Side have been subjected to a hostile work environment that includes unwelcome and unwanted sexual advances by co-workers and supervisors, requests for sexual favors, men exposing their genitals and/or showing pictures of their genitals and pornographic images.
The plant employs about 500 women.
Allen, a maintenance worker, said the location of the plant's labor relations office, in sight of co-workers, makes it difficult to file complaints without being identified. Once she said she was called into the office after calling the harassment line. Then, a few minutes after she walked out, her supervisor was called in. As a result, workers immediately knew she had complained about her supervisor, she said.
"When you complain, you become the problem," Allen said.
Van said she was knocked to the ground from behind as she was leaving the plant last year and that her assailant stomped on her back and told her not to look at his face. The man, she said, called her a "snitch." Van complained to Ford about the incident, according to the lawsuit, but she said the company didn't investigate.
Van said she took a medical leave and that a year and a half passed before Ford moved her to its stamping plant in Chicago Heights. Van said her life has been turned upside down because she spoke out against abuses. If she can't talk to supervisors, Van said, "Where do I go for help?"
The 2000 settlement covered claims at Ford's two Chicago plants.
Essence Clark, a forklift driver at the assembly plant, filed suit against Ford in May over incidents she said took place from 2010 to 2012. She alleges she was called derogatory names and reported the incidents to her supervisor and the company's labor relations unit, but that "nothing was done." She said she was later terminated, according to court records.
"I believe (Ford) perceived me to have a mental disability and terminated me because of it," she wrote in the suit, which is pending.
Ford, which described the conduct that Clark complained about as "neither severe nor pervasive," said it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any alleged harassing behavior. "(Clark) unreasonably failed to avail herself of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided, or otherwise failed to avoid harm," the company said in court documents.

Where to get advice for your 401(k)By Jonnelle Marte November 6 Follow @jonnelle
(Photo from Flickr used under Creative Commons license from user American Advisors Group )
A few months ago I reported on a study showing that found people who get advice regarding their 401(k) plans are better savers.
Not only did they save more in their 401(k) plans, but they had a better idea of how much they should save before their last day of work, the Natixis study found . There was, however, one major hold-up: Many people surveyed said they did not seek financial advice when it comes to retirement savings. Most also did not use the tools and calculators offered by their plan providers.
Some of this is due to inertia. People love to procrastinate when it comes to financial decisions. But readers who weighed in suggested it’s also difficult to know where to start. Where should people go to get solid advice when it comes to their 401(k)s and other retirement accounts?
They’re probably not getting it at the office. For many people, a workplace retirement account will be the primary source of income once they are ready to stop working. But employers are not rushing to give workers financial advice. In fact, many would prefer to hand off those responsibilities to a third party as a way to limit their responsibility, says Mitch Tuchman, managing director of Rebalance IRA, a company that manages retirement investments.
So where to go for advice?
Exhaust do-it-yourself options. Many 401(k) providers, such as Vanguard, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, offer online tools that help people figure out just how much they’ll save at their current pace and if that will be enough. “The first step is just being aware that these things are available,” says Ed Farrington, executive vice president for retirement for Natixis. Vanguard, for instance, has a tool that estimates and compares how much income a person will need in retirement and how much income they’ll have after factoring in current savings, Social Security and any pension income that’s expected. (If there is a wide gap between the two figures, workers can get a sense of how much more they need to save.)
The company also offers a tool that shows people how much their money would grow if they increased their savings rate by one percentage point or two percentage points each year. These calculators can help people answer one basic question: Am I saving enough? And they may offer a wake-up call for those who haven’t paused to think about how much they’ll end up with later.
Savers can often connect with someone online or over the phone who can help them understand how a fund or investment option works, what the historical performance has been like and what fees are required. But some people may need more guidance when it comes to assessing their investment strategy and if they’re being too aggressive, or not aggressive enough, with their allocation.
Check out third-party services. When it comes to investing decisions, people who don’t have the time or the expertise to devise a strategy — and stick to it– often turn to options such as target-date funds , which adjust automatically and are designed to become more conservative as a person approaches retirement. But people who want a more personal approach, or who want to be more hands-on with their retirement account, can pay an investment advisory firm to come up with a target portfolio.
For a flat fee of a few hundred dollars, Smart401k will ask about goals, income and risk tolerance and then make an investment plan using the options available in the person’s retirement account. It’s up to the saver, however, to follow through and invest according to the plan. Financial Engines  offers similar advice online at no cost for investors who want to handle their own investments, but will charge a fee to manage the money directly.  Rebalance IRA offers a service where it will manage investments for people who have at least $100,000 in an individual retirement account. (Financial Engines charges a fee ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent of assets invested to manage accounts. Rebalance IRA charges a fee of 0.5 percent of assets.)
Some firms will offer quarterly reminders encouraging people to re-balance their accounts, or to make sure they’re sticking to the targets set. (After a run-up in the stock market, for instance, some people may find stocks are making up a bigger portion of their original portfolio than originally planned.)
These services can be more customized than what a person can get through a target-date fund. And because the firms receive a flat fee, they aren’t paid to recommend one fund over another. Often, the target portfolios, which can be crafted by a financial adviser or by computer software, are created based on low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds.
Get face-to-face guidance. Of course, some people will get guidance from a pro, such as a financial adviser or a broker. But as our columnist Barry Ritholtz recently explained , the process of finding the right person requires people to assess not only their goals, but to suss out what standards apply to that professional. There are also differences in how these pros get paid. Registered investment advisers will generally charge a fee that amounts to a percentage of assets under management. Brokers will usually charge a commission.
Those differences may also lead to differences in what advice those pros offer — and that advice that may not always be in your best interest, he cautions. As with the search for any service, people should get recommendations from friends and colleagues. They should also check a person’s credentials, says Catherine McCabe, a senior managing director with TIAA-CREF. “You want to understand the advice that they’re offering and if it’s objective advice,” McCabe says, “so that you’re not being pushed into funds you don’t want to be pushed in to.”

Why you shouldnt use retirement savings to pay off debtBy Jonnelle Marte November 4 Follow @jonnelle

For many workers, years spent building up retirement savings can fall apart at what would typically be a milestone worth celebrating: the start of a new job.
The ability to cash out a retirement account comes with consequences. You’ll have to pay taxes on the money along with a 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal. Still, it’s an all-too-tempting option for some.
Rather than rolling over that retirement money into an IRA or another savings account, some people take the money and walk. And they’re more likely to do so when they have debt, a new report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute shows.
For instance, only 12.4 percent of respondents with no debt cashed out their accounts after changing jobs, according to the study. That share increases to 27.3 percent for people who owed between $3,000 and $10,000.
People also became less likely to roll over savings into an IRA as debt levels increased. Nearly 28 percent of people with no debt decided to roll over their savings into an IRA, compared to about 11 percent of people with $10,000 or more in debt.
The study looked at retirement data from 2008 and 2010, when retirement savers were asked what they did with their plans after leaving a company. Behavior varied not only by debt, but by income. People who made less were also more likely to cash out their savings. More than 30 percent of those who made less than $25,000 a year cashed out, compared to about 10 percent of those who made more than $75,000.
The survey did not ask people if they were planning to use the cash to pay down their debts, but using tomorrow’s income to pay down today’s debts can come with a cost. For one, the pot will be worth a lot less after taxes and fees. Take a hypothetical 30 year old who cashes out $16,000 from a retirement account. That person would pay $3,200 in federal and state taxes along with $1,600 in penalties, leaving him with $11,200, according to an analysis by Fidelity Investments.
He would also miss out on the investment growth he would have seen had he left the money invested, says Jeanne Thompson, a vice president for Fidelity. “It could grow significantly over the course of your career,” she says.
People should weigh how much they might earn by keeping the money invested against the cost of carrying credit card debt. The growth on the investment could outpace any savings a person would see from paying down the debt. For instance, that 30 year old paying off $10,000 in credit card debt (at an average interest rate of 15 percent) might rack up more than $5,000 in interest charges over 10 years of making $200 monthly payments, calculates Jack VanDerhei, research director for Ebri.
The same amount invested with the typical asset allocation for someone that age could nearly double over 10 years to about $19,600 when adjusted for inflation, VanDerhei says. That amounts to about $4,600 in lost investment growth. (That does not factor in that a person would need to withdraw more than $10,000 in order pay off the debt in full, after taxes and fees.)
Of course, paying off the debt could help people catch up on their savings later. Eliminating debt can help improve a person’s credit score, which can in turn affect the jobs they land and how much they pay in interest on other loans.
Age also plays a role in how people will treat savings. A separate study by Vanguard found that people in their 20s are more likely to withdraw their savings than older savers. Some people may underestimate how much even a modest amount of savings can add up to over time and so don’t see the value of leaving it in a retirement account, says Maria Bruno, senior investment analyst with Vanguard. But by withdrawing the funds, younger investors are giving up the advantage they have of starting early. They miss out on the power of compound interest.
And they may need to make much larger contributions later to catch up, Thompson says. “They will at some point probably need to double down on saving,” she says.

China and U.S. set to grapple for regional space during APEC summitUpdated: November 9, 2014 14:32 IST
China and U.S. set to grapple for regional space during APEC summit
Atul Aneja
AP China's President Xi Jinping, center, with large screens showing him, delivers an opening speech for the APEC CEO Summit as part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit at the China National Convention Center in Beijing, on Sunday.
TOPICS
summit
World leaders are converging in the Chinese capital to participate in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to witness a collision of two visions — Chinese and American — on the economic and geopolitical future of the region.
Ahead of the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is hosting a bevy of world leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, announced that Beijing will fork $40 billion into a Silk Road Fund. The reference to the development of the Silk Road encapsulates China’s vision of steering an economically inter-linked South, Central and East Asia, which can co-develop and collectively engage in trade and commerce with Europe along a land corridor.
China has also positioned itself at the center of a 21st century Maritime Silk Road, whose conceptual lines are still blurred, but point to Beijing’s leading role in forming an integral maritime commercial corridor along the Indian Ocean, and sections of the Pacific.
The string of Chinese initiatives for regional consolidation, follow the U.S.-led Asia Pivot; a doctrine marshalled by the Obama administration to bolter military force levels along China’s periphery, in cooperation with top allies, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines.
As the U.S. continues its battle to override the fall-out of the 2008 economic crash, it has accelerated its push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a regional free trade organisation, which includes Japan and Australia, but excludes China. The TPP has been widely perceived as an extension of the Asia-Pivot, powered by Washington, and has been tagged by some China-watchers as an “economic-NATO”.
At the APEC summit, the Chinese hope to log centre-stage a formal endorsement of Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) — their counter-initiative to the TPP.
The contrasting lines of the two economic blue-prints became more sharply etched on Saturday, when China’s ministers of foreign affairs and trade briefed reporters on their perception of the FTAAP.
Simultaneously the U.S. hosted a session on TPP negotiations among trade ministers of 12 partnering countries at its embassy in Beijing. President Obama is expected to hold another meeting of TPP leaders, in the Chinese capital on Monday — the day of the formal launch of the APEC summit.
The battle of the two visions is now resonating in the public domain, with Xinhua, the state-run Chinese news agency, amplifying in its report on Sunday that the economic potential of the FTAPP is far greater, when compared with the TPP and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)—a grouping led by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The write-up quoting a report from the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) pointed out that FTAAP is estimated to add $ 2.4 trillion to the global economy. The figure stands out in comparison with TPP’s estimated contribution of the $223 billion and the RCEP’s $644 billion.
As the global leaders start arriving, speculation is rife about three possible big-ticket meetings on the sidelines. President Putin has already landed in the Chinese capital, but it is unclear whether he would meet President Obama. Analysts say that following the ascendancy of the Republicans during last week’s mid-term elections, the U.S. President may find it difficult to nuance a domestically driven hardline stance towards Moscow, with a softening of attitude that is required to get Russia’s cooperation to strike a nuclear deal with Iran. The possibility of a meeting between President Xi and Mr. Abe is also in focus, following early signs of a thaw in tensions between the two countries.

Uber Looks to Pick Up Another $1 Billion in Equity: ReportBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
US taxi service firm Uber said it is in early talks with investors to raise money at a higher valuation than $17 billion it secured with June's round of funding, Financial Times reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.
Uber is planning to raise at least $1 billion more in capital from its existing investors, which includes Blackrock, TPG, Google Ventures and Menlo Ventures, and new funds from beyond Wall Street and Silicon Valley, especially in Asia, FT reported.
Google Ventures is a capital investment arm of Google.
The company still has $1 billion in the bank from its most recent round, FT reported, citing people familiar with Uber's finances.
The ridesharing company gained ground in Las Vegas last week when a District Court judge ruled against a restraining order that would have temporarily prohibited it from operating in Clark County, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.
Taxi drivers around the world have urged lawmakers to regulate or ban such services, which allow users to use apps on their smartphones to hire a private driver, rather than calling a taxi company.
Uber could not be immediately reached for comment.

We re still a long way from solving the minimum wage...16
"We've got to get into teaching people how to fish," said Allen Sanderson, a senior lecturer in the University of Chicago's Department of Economics. "In the high-tech world that we live in, somebody who's unskilled, their economic life is basically over. They're virtually unemployable. So one has to find out how to fix that. Even if it takes 10 years, it's going to be much, much better in the long run."
In the end, I agreed that just raising the minimum wage is not the best idea. It's a Band-Aid over a bullet wound. The income gap and the struggles low-wage workers face need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner, so why not make a moderate increase in the minimum wage while putting programs in place that give people a fighting chance to move up into higher paying jobs.
Sounds good, right? The problem is, I still don't hear politicians who oppose raising the minimum wage talking about logical alternatives that will help low-income workers.
Sanderson agreed: "Politicians have a very short time horizon. In some ways, they just don't give a rip about something that happens 10 years out, they care about something that's two years out."
Sonn, with the National Employment Law Project, agrees that comprehensive change is needed, but believes a wage boost should come first because it's "a readily achievable first step."
"We need to tackle and modernize our job training system, but that's not enough," Sonn said. "We need revamped job training and K-12 education and a college system that better fits our economy. But it's clear none of that is adequate to raise income levels for people on the bottom. It's numerically impossible to turn all low-wage jobs into stepping-stone jobs, because there are too many of them in our economy."
This all makes me sigh rather loudly.
The smart thing for us to do is attack this problem from different directions — a moderate wage increase; better education; smarter job training; tax credits that target those who need it most. But it's clear the political will isn't there, and even though politicians pride themselves on being communicators, they've done a lousy job explaining the need to look at more than just the per-hour money.
Unless wage increase opponents get their acts together — swiftly — it's clear states and cities will take action and the minimum wage will go up.
I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I want people to make more money, and I don't presently see another option on the table.
I just think we could do better. And we're not.

My Appeal to Our Leaders and to All of Us: Let Us Think  Propose and Act TogetherThe following speech was delivered on November 8, 2014 at the New Policy Forum symposium in Berlin.
I
I am pleased to welcome all the participants and to see among them both the veterans of our Forum and some new faces. I expect all of them to make a contribution to serious and constructive dialogue which is so necessary now.
Our conference is being held simultaneously with the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the wall that divided Germany and Europe. I would like first of all to congratulate the Germans, and all of us, on the anniversary of this truly historic event.
Historic shifts that seem unexpected to contemporaries may later appear inevitable, preordained. But let us recall the time when it was all happening and how tumultuous and urgent the process of change was. Its outcome -- the peaceful unification of Germany -- was possible only because it had been prepared by great changes in international politics and in the minds of people.
Those changes were triggered by Perestroika in the Soviet Union. Having embarked on the course of reforms, glasnost and freedom, we could not deny that same path to the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. We rejected "the Brezhnev doctrine", recognized the independence of those states and their responsibility to their own peoples. I said as much to their leaders during our very first meeting in Moscow.
When, under the influence of changes in the Soviet Union, internal political processes gained momentum in neighboring countries, and the citizens of the GDR demanded reforms and, soon afterwards, unification, the leadership of the USSR was faced with the need to make difficult choices.
Not just in our country, but in many European countries as well, doubts and apprehensions were being raised by the process of unification. One could understand the doubts of Margaret Thatcher, François Mitterrand and other leaders. After all, the tragedy of the Second World War was still fresh in memory. There were other reasons, too, for their wariness.
Even more, the people of our country, which suffered the most from Hitler's aggression, had reasons for concern.
Meanwhile, the events were unfolding with increasing speed, with the people being the main actor -- the people who demanded change and declared their intention to live in a united country: "We are one nation."
During a meeting of the Soviet leadership in January 1990, we discussed the evolving situation and came to the unanimous conclusion that the Soviet Union should not stand in the way of unification -- but that it must happen in a way that would be in the interests of the whole of Europe and of our country as well as the Germans themselves.
If we had evaded a realistic and responsible assessment or taken a different decision, the events could have taken a very different, dramatic turn. And the use of force could have led to bloodshed on a large scale.
We took the path that required political decisions and active diplomacy. In order to address the external aspects of German unification, the 2+4 mechanism was created. The most difficult issue was the problem of the united Germany's membership in NATO.
I was in favor of a neutral Germany. President Bush objected: "Why? Are you afraid of the Germans? So they must be included, 'anchored' in NATO." I replied: "It looks like it's you who are afraid of them."
We discussed various possibilities. Eventually, it was agreed that the united Germany would decide for itself as to its membership in the alliance but, in the process, the security interests of the USSR must be taken into account.
This required intense talks. In the end, the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany recorded the following provisions:
-- the presence of Soviet troops in the territory of the former GDR for a transitional period;
-- non-stationing of NATO's foreign troops in that territory after the transitional period;
-- non-stationing of nuclear weapons there;
-- significant, almost 50 percent reduction of the personnel of the FRG armed forces.
Those were important obligations, which have been observed throughout the ensuing period.
During those years, the Germans have proved their commitment to peace and democracy and the government of Germany has pursued a generally constructive and responsible course of action in the international arena.
I am confident that history will give high marks to the political leaders active at that time.
II
The unification of Germany was a major step in the process of ending the Cold War. New prospects opened up for the world and particularly for Europe. The shape of a new Europe was emerging from the Charter of Paris signed by the leaders of all European countries as well as the United States and Canada.
It appeared that Europe might emerge as an example to others by creating a solid system of mutual security and becoming a leader in solving the problems of a global world.
Yet, the events took a different course.
European and international politics did not stand the test of renewal, of the new conditions of the global world in the post-Cold War era.
One has to admit that since the creation of our Forum at the dawn of this century, we have never met in such a tense and fraught environment. Bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East against the backdrop of a breakdown in the dialogue between major powers is of enormous concern. The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it's already begun.
And yet, while the situation is dramatic, we do not see the main international body -- the UN Security Council -- playing any role or taking concrete action. What has it done to stop the fire and the killing of people? It should have acted with determination to evaluate the situation and develop a program of joint action. But this was not done, and it's not being done. Why?
I would characterize what has been happening over the past few months as the collapse of trust -- the trust that was created by hard work and mutual effort in the process of ending the cold war. Trust -- without which international relations in the global world are inconceivable.
Yet it would be wrong to link it only to the recent events. I have to be frank with you here: This trust was not undermined yesterday; it happened long before. The roots of the current situation lie in the events of the 1990s.
The end of the Cold War was just the beginning of the path towards a new Europe and a safer world order. But, instead of building new mechanisms and institutions of European security and pursuing a major demilitarization of European politics -- as promised, incidentally, in NATO's London Declaration -- the West, and particularly the United States, declared victory in the Cold War. Euphoria and triumphalism went to the heads of Western leaders. Taking advantage of Russia's weakening and the lack of a counterweight, they claimed monopoly leadership and domination in the world, refusing to heed words of caution from many of those present here.
The events of the past few months are consequences of short-sighted policies, of seeking to impose one's will and faits accomplis while ignoring the interests of one's partners.
A "shortlist" will suffice: the enlargement of NATO, Yugoslavia, particularly Kosovo, missile defense plans, Iraq, Libya, Syria.
To put it metaphorically, a blister has now turned into a bloody, festering wound.
And who is suffering the most from what's happening? I think the answer is more than clear: It is Europe, our common home.
Instead of becoming a leader of change in a global world, Europe has turned into an arena of political upheaval, of competition for spheres of influence and, finally, of military conflict. The consequence, inevitably, is Europe's weakening at a time when other centers of power and influence are gaining momentum. If this continues, Europe will lose a strong voice in world affairs and gradually become irrelevant.
Here in Berlin, during the anniversary of the fall of the wall, I have to note that all this has also had a negative effect on relations between Russia and Germany. Continuation of the current course could cause lasting damage to our relations, which have until now been exemplary. Let us remember that without Russian-German partnership there can be no security in Europe.
III
So how do we begin to get out of this situation?
The experience of the 1980s testifies that, even in apparently hopeless situations, there has to be a way out. The situation in the world was then no less urgent and dangerous than now. Yet, we succeeded in reversing it -- not just normalizing relations but putting an end to confrontation and the cold war. Political leaders of that period can rightly take credit for that.
This was achieved primarily through the resumption of dialogue.
Negative tendencies can and must be stopped and reversed. The key to it is political will and the correct setting of priorities.
Today, the foremost priority should be renewal of dialogue, regaining the ability to interact and to listen to and hear each other.
First signs of a renewed dialogue have now emerged. The first, albeit modest and fragile results have been achieved. I am referring to the Minsk agreements on cease-fire and military disengagement in Ukraine, trilateral gas agreements between Russia, Ukraine and the European Union, and the suspension of the escalation of mutual sanctions.
In this context I want to urge you to consider carefully Vladimir Putin's recent remarks at the Valdai Forum. Despite the harshness of his criticism of the West and of the United States in particular, I see in his speech a desire to find a way to lower tensions and ultimately to build a new basis for partnership.
We must -- and the sooner we do it the better -- move from polemics and mutual accusations to a search for points of convergence and a gradual lifting of sanctions, which are damaging to both sides. As a first step, the so-called personal sanctions that affect political figures and parliamentarians should be lifted so that they could join the process of seeking mutually acceptable solutions.
One of the areas for interaction could be helping Ukraine to overcome the consequences of fratricidal war and rebuild the affected regions.
IV
It will not be easy to achieve those short-term goals. But, at the same time, we need to pursue vigorous efforts in all the other areas of our common agenda.
I would single out two areas where dialogue is vitally important and where much damage has been done to it. It is, first, cooperation in addressing global challenges and, secondly, pan-European security.
The global problems -- terrorism and extremism, including of sectarian nature; poverty and inequality; the environment, the problem of resources and waves of migration; epidemics -- are getting worse by the day.
And, different as they are, one thing is common to all of them: None of them has a military solution. Yet, political mechanisms to solve them are lacking or dysfunctional, lagging behind the pace of their deterioration.
The lessons of the continuing global crisis should persuade us that we need to seek a new model that would assure political, economic and environmental sustainability. This is a problem that must be addressed now, without delay.
Let me now speak about European security. I think we have seen once again that it must be pan-European. Attempts to solve the problem of security in Europe be enlarging NATO or through an EU defense policy cannot bring positive results. Indeed, they are counterproductive.
We must, therefore, go back to the drawing board and work on plans to build a system of European security that would provide assurance and guarantees to all its participants.
We need institutions and mechanisms that would function in the interests of all. It has to be recognized that the OSCE, an organization to which a lot of hope was attached, has not been up to the task.
Does that mean that it should be torn down in order to build in its place something new and yet unseen? I don't think so, the more so since OSCE has now assumed important control functions in Ukraine. But it is, I would say, a building that requires major repairs and some new construction.
Years ago, Hans Dietrich Genscher, Brent Scowcroft and other policy-makers proposed creating a Security Council, or Directorate, for Europe. I shared their approach. Along the same lines, Dmitry Medvedev during his presidency proposed an initiative that called for creating a mechanism of European preventive diplomacy and mandatory consultations in case of a threat to anyone's security. Had such a mechanism been created, the worst scenarios of Ukrainian events could have been averted.
Why have these and other "European ideas" been filed away in the archives? The leaders are, of course, to blame for it -- but also all of us. I am referring to the European political class, civil society institutions, and the media.
We need to consider a non-governmental initiative to resume building a common European home. I suggest that we think about the form such an initiative could take. I hope that during our discussion ways towards it could be evaluated and specific proposals made.
V
I am by nature not pessimistic, and I have always described myself as an optimist. But I have to admit that it's very difficult to be optimistic in the current situation. Nevertheless, we must not submit to panic and despair or resign to negative inertia. This could draw us into a vortex without a way out. The bitter experience of the past few months must be transformed into the will to reengage in dialogue and cooperation.
This is my appeal to our leaders, and to all of us. Let us think, propose and act together.

Toys R Us Black Friday Sales Will Start At 5 P.M. On Thanksgivingreddit
Toys R Us announced Friday that it will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and stay open for 30 hours straight until 11 p.m. on Black Friday.
The kids toy store chain is one of a growing list of companies staying open on Thanksgiving in order to add an extra day to one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year. While shoppers tend to show up in droves for Black Friday kickoff events, many have criticized retailers for asking low-wage employees to come to work, instead of spending the holiday with family and friends.
A representative from Toys R Us told The Huffington Post Friday that the company asks workers to volunteer to staff Thanksgiving weekend shifts. If there aren't enough volunteers, workers are assigned the shifts.
"We have so much excitement leading up to Thanksgiving and Black Friday," Adrienne O’Hara, a spokesperson for Toys R Us, told HuffPost. "Employees are really excited, it's an event."
O’Hara said hourly workers receive time-and-a-half for working Thanksgiving Day, which is generally the case at many large retailers.
This year, Macy's , Kmart, Sears , J.C. Penney and Walmart, among others, will be open on Thanksgiving Day. Other stores like Costco and Sam's Club will close.
Are you working a retail job on Black Friday? We'd love to hear about your experience. Email our reporter Hunter Stuart at hunter@huffingtonpost.com

How a crash and burn can reignite your careerHow a crash and burn can reignite your career
By Brian J. O'Connor, Tribune Content Agency, Funny Money
Elections Periodicals Republican Party
Sometimes, you have a bad day at the office. Sometimes you have a very bad day at the office. And then you have Terri Lynn Land, who, on Election Day, had an extremely terrible, horrible, no-good unbelievably very bad day running for office.
Land was the Republican candidate for an open Senate seat here in my home state of Michigan, and ran a campaign that one columnist called, "a national embarrassment." Her first press event was most commonly described using the phrase, "deer in the headlights." When Land created a big TV spot to make people sit up and notice, they did. Unfortunately, according to a leading Republican pollster, what they noticed was "this is the worst ad of the political process."
Finally, in the last two weeks of campaigning, Republicans yanked $850 million of TV ads from Land, who lost by a 34 percent margin.
0
To which I say: Big honkin' deal. Even if the Land campaign was the political equivalent of New Coke, the Yugo and "Gigli" rolled into one, it proves that there are only two kinds of people in this world: Those who've already nosedived into a spectacular, eye-rolling, potentially career-killing belly flop -- and those who will.
Step one: From bad to sad
What should Land, or any of us do, after we publicly crash and burn? First, hold off on updating your resume and let the flames die down, says Prudence Cole, a Grosse Pointe, Mich., executive career coach who runs BeingAtWork.com.
"The best approach is to reflect on what the teachings are from the experience you've just had, and then try to figure out what to do next," Cole says.
The first step is to deal with your anger, hurt and humiliation, not unlike the seven stages of grief. "A lot of executives try to run to a new job right away," Cole says. "But if this is a major turning point in your life you need to work through your emotions."
While the temptation may be to get back up on the horse that just so publicly bucked you off, it's healthier to consider whether you made a big mistake in a career that suits you, or whether it's time to make a change.
"These career crises are important opportunities and turning points where you're getting a wake-up call about whether you're supposed to be doing something different," Cole says. "Maybe not, but you need to think about that before you jump in the saddle again."
A big mis-step forward
If the first step is feeling bad about doing bad, another step is to revisit your successes, and remind yourself that you can -- and have -- done good work in the past. Then figure out what went wrong. If you were pursuing something you believe you should do, did you go about it badly and need to improve your execution, or did you do it with the wrong people in the wrong place, and need to find a corporate culture where you can succeed? A more difficult question, and one that you'll want to work through with a career coach, is whether you did a bad job at something you secretly don't want to be doing.
The final step is becoming comfortable acknowledging what went wrong and focusing on where you're headed now.
"Get to a point where you can actually talk about it," Cole says. "You don't have to hide it, since everybody knows about it."
In that light, a big, astonishing career fiasco can free you for your next success. If you get better at the job, people are impressed. If you crush it at a new company, people see that the problem wasn't you. And if you do something entirely different, well, who can blame you?
The worst that can happen, it turns out, usually doesn't.

China to Establish $40 Billion Silk Road Infrastructure FundYou are here: Home Economy
China to Establish $40 Billion Silk Road Infrastructure Fund
Reuters | Updated On: November 09, 2014 17:31 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Beijing: China will contribute $40 billion to set up a Silk Road infrastructure fund to boost connectivity across Asia, President Xi Jinping announced on Saturday, the latest Chinese project to spread the largesse of its own economic growth.
China has dangled financial and trade incentives before, mostly to Central Asia but also to countries in South Asia, backing efforts to resurrect the old Silk Road trading route that once carried treasures between China and the Mediterranean.
The fund will be for investing in infrastructure, resources and industrial and financial cooperation, among other projects, Xi said, according to Xinhua.
The goal of the fund is to "break the connectivity bottleneck" in Asia, state media quoted Xi as saying during a meeting in Beijing with leaders from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Tajikistan.
The Silk Road Fund will be "open" and welcome investors from Asia and beyond to "actively" take part in the project, Xi was cited as saying, ahead of a separate summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping, also being held in the Chinese capital.
It was not immediately clear precisely how the fund would work, when it would start operations or where it would be based, though in all likelihood it would be China.
But Xinhua said it would focus on China's Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, which aim to build roads, railways, ports and airports across Central Asia and South Asia.
"Such a framework accommodates the needs of various countries and covers both land and sea-related projects," Xi said, adding China is ready to welcome its neighbours "to get on board the train of China's development".
Training places
China will also provide neighboring countries with 20,000 places for training "connectivity professionals" over the next five years, Xi said.
China has sought to address fears in the region - and globally - that its bounding economic growth will inevitably bring about a more assertive, muscular diplomatic and military approach to issues such as territorial disputes.
One of the ways it has done this is to offer large loans to places like Southeast Asia and Africa, to show that China is a benign growing power only interested in helping others escape poverty in the way it has itself over the past three decades.
Last month, Xi unveiled the $50 billion China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, both multilateral lenders that count Washington and its allies as their biggest financial backers.
China has sought to allay concerns that its new bank aims to undermine the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, saying it wants to learn from their experience and that there are more than enough projects around for all the lenders to fund.

Rajiv Pratap Rudy: The fighter pilotRajiv Pratap Rudy
New Delhi, November 9:  
When Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister in May, it was surprising that Rajiv Pratap Rudy, the man who defeated Rabri Devi in Lalu Prasad’s pocket borough in Saran, Bihar, did not find a place in his Cabinet.
That Rudy had already served as a Minister in the Vajpayee Government made his exclusion even more curious. Proximity to his fellow Thakur and former BJP President Rajnath Singh was largely believed to have been the reason for Rudy getting ignored in the first round of Cabinet formation.
But if he was disappointed, Rudy hid it well. During the Prime Minister’s grand swearing-in ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Thakur from Bihar mingled with invitees. Having marked his attendance, Rudy subsequently made himself scarce, not responding to queries from curious scribes. The discretion clearly served him in good stead as he earned BJP President Amit Shah’s trust. Shah involved him in the negotiations with the Shiv Sena before and after the Maharashtra elections and dispatched him to Goa to enforce the succession plan after Manohar Parrikar was asked to resign from the Chief Minister’s post and join the Union Cabinet.
So Rudy is back where he was expected – in the Union Cabinet albeit as a Minister of State with independent charge. A trained pilot and career politician, Rudy’s induction into the Cabinet assumes political significance as elections in his home State Bihar are expected next year.

Comet flyby caused intense meteor shower on Mars: NASAspace programme
NASA on Friday said comet Siding Spring, which buzzed past Mars on October 19, caused an intense meteor shower and added a new layer of ions, or charged particles, to the ionosphere.
The effect of the comet on the Martian atmosphere was detected by two NASA spacecraft, including the MAVEN mission and a European spacecraft.
#MAVEN IUVS data show detection of metals added to #Mars ' atmosphere from #MarsComet dust particles | pic.twitter.com/qQoJUcY8xr
— NASA's MAVEN Mission (@MAVEN2Mars) November 7, 2014
The ionosphere is an electrically charged region in the atmosphere that extends about 120 kilometres to several hundred kilometres above the Martian surface.
Using the observations, scientists were able to make a direct connection between the debris from the meteor shower to the subsequent formation of the transient layer of ions - the first time such an event has been observed on any planet, including Earth, said the MAVEN research team.
“They call this comet encounter an once-in-a-lifetime event, but it is more like once-in-a-million years,” said Nick Schneider, scientist with the MAVEN mission and associate professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
“The numbers suggest a Martian would have seen many thousands of shooting stars per hour - possibly enough to be called a meteor storm - so it must have been a spectacular event that night on Mars,” Dr. Schneider added.
The comet travelled from the most distant region of the solar system called the Oort Cloud and made an approach within 139,500 kilometres of the Red Planet.
— NASA's MAVEN Mission (@MAVEN2Mars) November 7, 2014
That is less than half the distance between Earth and our moon and less than one-tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of Earth.

AirAsia India joins fare war  puts one-way ticket at 699Comments
AirAsia India on Sunday joined the domestic fare war launching a week-long sale offer for its entire network with one-way tickets with prices as low as Rs. 699 including taxes.
The move came as part of its Malaysian parent company AirAsia presenting a 'Big Sale' with three million promotional seats on its network from Kuala Lumpur, with a starting fare of Rs. 2,599 for international flights operated by AirAsia Berhad and Thai AirAsia, the airline said in a release.
The Indian carrier is offering "an all inclusive one way fare" starting from as low as Rs. 699 for flights from Bengaluru to Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Jaipur and Chandigarh and vice versa.
The Malaysian parent company's offer of Rs. 2,599 would be available on flights from Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Tiruchirappalli and Hyderabad to Kuala Lumpur operated by AirAsia Berhad and Chennai to Bangkok flown by Thai AirAsia, the release said.
The tickets can be booked on Airasia's website from tonight till November 16, for travel period from June 10 next year to January 17, 2016, it said.
AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya said "it is our constant endeavor to make air travel affordable for every Indian." He said the 'Big Sale' offer would "allow our guests to plan their travel early with extremely low fares."  
All Indian airlines have been competing with each other to fill up vacant seats, especially during the lean seasons, by offering low fares throughout the year.

Reforms 2.0 set to take off in Winter session  hints FMReforms 2.0 set to take off in Winter session, hints FM

India is set to unveil a slew of reform measures in the coming weeks, including a proposal to amend the land buying rules, and a law to introduce the goods and services tax (GST) for a common national market.
Also on the anvil are plans to pare government’s equity in state-owned banks to 52% and a disinvestment agenda laying down the schedule to sell the Centre’s stake in public sector undertakings (PSUs).
Besides, the government is hopeful that it would be able to get the Insurance Bill passed in Parliament’s Winter Session, which begins on November 24, to raise the foreign direct investment cap in insurance companies from 26% to 49%.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley, tasked with the mandate to steer the economy out of a quarter-century slump, hinted on Sunday that the government was willing to walk the talk on some critical reform measures despite potential political opposition.
“Some changes may be necessary (to the Land Acquisition Act),” Jaitley said at a seminar organised by the IISS and Observer Research Foundation.
“We will first try to reach a consensus and if that is not possible we will go ahead and take the decision,” he said.
Many analysts have cited highly-restrictive conditions in the land acquisition legislation that the UPA government enacted last year as a major barrier for the industry to buy land.
Time and cost overruns have been a major bane for India’s infrastructure projects. Many large proposals are stymied by ambiguous titles of ownership, environmental issues, poor compensation and social concerns.
Jaitley also indicated that the plans to introduce GST, India’s biggest tax reform initiative, has entered the final leg with the Centre holding final round of negotiations with the states to iron out the thorny issues.
If adopted, GST can alter tax administration by giving a one-shot solution by subsuming a string of central and local levies such as excise, value-added tax and octroi into a single unified tax and stitching together a common national market.
The Centre is planning to introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament, which will likely lay out the roadmap for the system’s rollout.
GST’s implementation has faced political hurdles as state governments fear it could rob them of fiscal powers.
“Economy was and is in a challenging situation and one of the principal challenges before us is to restore the confidence, to expand economic activity and move towards increasing the growth rate,” he said.
In September, the government had approved share-sale plans in three major state-owned companies —Coal India Ltd, NHPC and ONGC — that can earn the exchequer Rs. 44,000 crore.
Revenues from selling shares in PSUs is critical to the government’s plans to keep the fiscal deficit — the amount of money the government borrows to fund its expenses — at 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Over the last five months, the Narendra Modi-led government has unveiled string of measures including lifting of state controls on pricing of diesel, plans to put up coal mines for bidding and as also a signature initiative ‘Make in India’ to turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse, remove bureaucratic sloth, make the country more investor-friendly and aid its economic recovery.

Microsoft to use white space tech for free internet in IndiaMicrosoft to use ‘white space’ tech for free internet in India

Microsoft India is ready with a plan to provide free last-mile internet connectivity across the country.
It proposes to use the “white space” – the unused spectrum between two TV channels – to provide free connectivity to large sections of the Indian population.
“Wifi has a range of only about 100 metres, whereas the 200-300 MHz spectrum band available in the white space can reach up to 10 km,” said Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman, Microsoft India. “This spectrum belongs mainly to Doordarshan and the government and is not used at all. We have sought clearance for a pilot project in two districts.”
If the pilots are successful, the project can be quickly rolled out across the country and could give a huge boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India initiative, which proposes to use technology to deliver governance to every citizen of India, even in remote areas.
“The challenge is the lack of digital infrastructure across India. This initiative addresses this challenge in a cost-effective manner and creates an eco-system that will benefit everyone, including manufacturers of routers and other technology devices, other technology companies, besides Microsoft,” Pramanik said.
Microsoft’s initiative also take forward the Prime Minister’s slogan of “IT + IT = IT”, which is Indian talent plus information technology equals India tomorrow and also give a push to the ‘Make in India’ campaign by encouraging the manufacture of equipment locally.
Microsoft, which was part of an international consortium that included BT, Nokia and BBC, conducted the most widespread field trials on white space-based Internet connectivity in Cambridge, US, in 2011. The technology hasn’t been widely adopted anywhere in the world, but experts believe it can lead to a spurt in broadband connectivity in countries such as India. Engineers at Microsoft development centres in India have adapted this unlicenced technology for this country.
The ambitious Digital India project envisages providing broadband connectivity across the country by connecting 250,000 gram panchayats via optic fibre cables, thereby providing digital infrastructure as a utility to every citizen, digital governance and services on demand and digitally empowering all citizens.
The plan was approved by the Modi Cabinet on August 30.

One day while trying to make sense of data from sheets sprawled all around him and his team, Pankaj Tibrewal, then chief operating officer of Pantaloon in Mumbai, finally gave in to an idea he has been considering for a while — Business intelligence data doesn’t have to be necessarily tedious to review, share and discuss.
Last week, Tibrewal and a number of former executives from Evernote, Prezi and eBay launched Chartcube, a free iPad App that makes sharing, discussing and reviewing business data easy, and fun.
“The idea was born when I started working at McKinsey and saw that most companies spend millions in business intelligence tools but still consume data in Excel sheets and PowerPoint presentations,” Tibrewal said, adding, “I realised that users need a lot more flexibility.”

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Tokyo: Japanese electronics conglomerate Panasonic Corp is considering M&A deals as a way to bolster its position in the European white goods market, its chief executive said on Monday.
"We need a partner who understands the European market in the white goods segment," CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga, credited for leading the company's turnaround in the past few years, told Reuters in an interview.
Asked whether that meant a possible acquisition, he said: "I wouldn't rule that out. That's currently under consideration."
After returning to a net cash positive position last quarter for the first time in five years, the company is now targeting 10 trillion yen ($90 billion) in revenue in 2018/19 compared with a planned 7.75 trillion yen in the current year.
It has said it would not be able to achieve that sales target through organic growth alone and that it would consider acquisitions, but Tsuga ruled out large deals.
"We have no intention to buy a big company worth a trillion yen, for example," he said. Companies worth tens of billions, he said, would be reasonable acquisition targets.

BlackBerry CEO Sees Fewer New Devices  Focus on ProfitabilityYou are here: Home Corporates
BlackBerry CEO Sees Fewer New Devices, Focus on Profitability
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 09:49 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Toronto: BlackBerry, which has completed the first phase of its two-year turnaround plan, is now focused on profitability and will not spread itself thin by attempting to launch too many new devices, its chief executive said.
John Chen, who took the reins at the struggling mobile technology company in November 2013, has moved rapidly to try to get the one-time investor darling back on track. The company has sold assets, struck partnerships to lower manufacturing costs and broaden app offerings, and raised cash via the sale of real estate holdings in its hometown of Waterloo, Ontario.
"Once we turn this company to profitability again, I will do everything I can to never lose money ever again," Mr Chen told Reuters in an interview this week. "That is definitely something I am very focused on doing."
The Hong Kong-born executive, 59, made his name at Sybase, a struggling database software firm that he rescued and sold a decade later to SAP for $5.8 billion in 2010.
"If you look at my track record at Sybase, I think we made money for some 60 quarters in a row, even when the dotcom bubble blew up we were profitable. I like that philosophy," said Mr Chen, who added he believes the worst is now behind BlackBerry.
"We will survive as a company and now I am rather confident," he said. "We're managing the supply chain, we are managing inventories, we are managing cash, and we have expenses now at a number that is very manageable. BlackBerry has survived; now we have to start looking at growth."
A year ago, the smartphone industry pioneer was in the midst of a painful restructuring, scrambling to find a suitor and trying to play down media reports of its "death spiral."
A year after Chen stepped in as CEO, BlackBerry may have regained some of its lost swagger. The company is hiring again and though it has yet to turn steady profits, Mr Chen has begun acquiring small companies and investing in growth.
"He stepped in to catch a falling knife, which is what BlackBerry was at the time losing $1 billion plus," said Prem Watsa, whose Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd is a major shareholder and which helped bankroll a debt recapitalization that led to Chen's arrival.
"He came in and very quickly stabilized it and very quickly laid out a roadmap to breakeven."
Concerns linger
The company is not out of the woods yet - even Chen stops short of saying the turnaround has succeeded - but talk of the company sliding into oblivion has faded.
"John Chen has succeeded in changing the conversation about BlackBerry, and that is probably true both internally as well as externally," said IDC technology analyst John Jackson.
Despite the progress, many analysts are yet to be convinced. Thomson Reuters data shows that 25 of 37 analysts covering BlackBerry have a 'hold' rating on the stock. Only one has a 'buy' rating and the rest rate the stock a 'sell.' And although its shares have strengthened since Chen's arrival, its Toronto-listed stock has been bound in the C$6 to C$12.50 range in the last 12 months.
"Overall we think John is doing a solid job, but our concern continues to be: how will BlackBerry drive demand for its product," said Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. "The demand side of the equation is still a concern, both around selling millions of devices each year and converting enterprise software users into paying buyers in a very competitive market."
To spur growth, BlackBerry is launching its latest mobile device management platform, BES 12, this week. The system will allow companies and government agencies to manage and secure not just BlackBerry devices on their internal networks, but devices that run on rival operating systems such as Android, Windows and Apple's iOS.
In December, the company will launch BlackBerry Classic, a device similar to its once popular Bold smartphone.
New device plans
In September, BlackBerry reported a profit, on an adjusted basis, from its struggling handset business for the first time in five quarters. Tough competition from Apple, Samsung and other rivals has eaten into BlackBerry's once dominant market share, hurting revenue and profitability in both the unit and company.
BlackBerry is "reasonably comfortable" it can keep making money from its handset business, given operating margins, Chen said, noting orders for its new unconventionally-shaped Passport device have increased.
"I'm happy in the receptivity of the design. I'm happy that this product is a successful product, but we did not make that many of them, so it is in limited supply almost everywhere."
There is no final decision yet on what new devices will be launched in 2015, said Chen adding that the focus will be on a core set of smartphones that are most likely to succeed. That includes at least one radically new device and product refreshes on its Passport, Classic and its mid-level Z3 touchscreen phone.
"I'm not going to build a general purpose device, simply because it is a 5-inch touchscreen," he said, referring to the wide array of fairly standardized touchscreen smartphones in the market right now. "The Chinese can build one for 75 bucks, I can't get enough parts together for 75 bucks."

Airlines stocks surge on new draft civil aviationpolicyFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Stocks of Jet Airways and Spicejet surged up to 7 per cent today after the government unveiled draft civil aviation policy which proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, rationalise jet fuel cost, among others.
Shares of Jet Airways advanced by 6.82 per cent to settle at Rs 268.60, while Spicejet surged 5.02 per cent to end at Rs 15.68 on the BSE.
Terming UPA’s aviation policy as “opaque”, government today brought in a fresh draft recommending listing of state-run Airports Authority of India and chopper firm Pawan Hans on stock exchanges and steps to beef up Air India operations, hinting at its stake sale too.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju unveiled the draft civil aviation policy which also proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, MRO and helicopter operations and improve passenger facilitation.
The draft would now be open for wider consultation with all stakeholders, with the Minister saying he hoped to finalise and implement it by January next year.
On high taxes on jet fuel, Raju said the Centre has been requesting states to lower the taxes as fuel costs are close to 40-45 per cent of an airline’s total operational cost.

Mutual fund asset base at record high of Rs 11 lakh cr inOctFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) climbed to record high of nearly Rs 11 lakh crore in October on the back of strong capital inflows and surge in equity markets.
The country’s 45 fund houses together had an average AUM of Rs 10,95,653 crore at the end of October 31, 2014, up from Rs 9,59,415 crore in the preceding month, according to the data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).
The AUM data for individual fund house is not being disclosed.
Industry experts said the monthly rise in AUM is largely on account of gains in equity markets and strong capital inflows. Besides, retail participation in equity schemes has increased significantly during the recent months.
The fund houses together witnessed an inflow of Rs 1.24 lakh crore. During the month, the benchmark BSE Sensex grew by over 1,200 points or nearly five per cent.
The assets managed by mutual funds had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore-mark for the first time in May, when the markets went up after the General Elections’ result.
Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.

Unemployment Rate Falls To 5.8 PercentU.S. Creates 214,000 Jobs In October; Unemployment Rate Falls To 5.8 Percent
Posted:
The U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October, as the unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
More from the AP:
WASHINGTON (AP) — Three days after voters registered their sourness about the U.S. economy, the government said Friday that employers added a solid 214,000 jobs in October, extending the healthiest pace of hiring in eight years.
The Labor Department also said a combined 31,000 more jobs were added in August and September than it had previously estimated. Employers have now added at least 200,000 jobs for nine straight months — the longest such stretch since 1995.
The burst of hiring lowered the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent. It is the lowest rate since July 2008. Yet workers' average hourly pay rose only slightly, a glaring weak spot in an otherwise solid report.
Voters identified the economy as their top concern in Tuesday's elections. That suggested that economic improvement hasn't yet been felt by many Americans. The sluggish pace of pay growth is a likely factor.
Average hourly pay rose 3 cents in October to $24.57. That's just 2 percent higher than the average wage was 12 months earlier and is barely ahead of the 1.7 percent inflation rate.
"While the labor market is improving and in many respects has already healed, employee bargaining power remains virtually nonexistent," Dan Greenhaus, an analyst at the brokerage firm BTIG LLC, said in a research note.
Still, the brightening jobs picture led more people to start looking for work last month. The percentage of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one rose in October to 62.8 percent. And 267,000 people who had been out of work said they were now employed. Their hiring reduced the number of unemployed to just under 9 million.
The job gains were broad-based, though many lower-paying industries posted especially large increases. Retailers added 27,100 jobs. Restaurants, hotels and entertainment firms gained 52,000.
Some higher-paying industries also showed progress. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs, up from 9,000 the previous month. Transportation and shipping companies gained 13,300. And professional and business services, which includes accountants, engineers and other higher-skilled fields, added 37,000.
Analysts say the economic expansion remains strong enough to support the current pace of hiring. Over the past six months, the economy has grown at a 4.1 percent annual rate.
U.S. manufacturers are expanding at the fastest pace in three years, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. A measure of new orders showed that factory output will likely continue to grow in coming months. A separate survey by the ISM found that retailers, restaurants and other service companies grew at a healthy pace last month.
Home sales rose in September at their fastest rate this year, a sign that housing could pick up after a sluggish performance for most of this year.
Still, faltering global growth could create trouble for the U.S. economy in the months ahead. Exports fell in September, the government said this week, widening the trade deficit. That led many economists to shave their predictions of economic growth in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent or less, down from the government's initial estimate of 3.5 percent.

Gold  silver prices slip on poor buying  weak globalcuesAfter a smart recovery over the weekend, gold prices slipped modestly at the domestic bullion market today on fresh bouts of profit-taking as well as lack of local buying support amidst bearish global cues.
Silver, too, retreated after a brief rebound on renewed speculative selling following weak industrial support.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) eased by Rs 25 to end at Rs 25,925 per 10 grams from last Saturday’s closing level of Rs 25,950.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also moved down by a similar margin to settle at Rs 26,075 per 10 grams as against Rs 26,100 previously.
Silver (.999 fineness) dropped by Rs 390 to finish at Rs 36,110 per kg as compared to Rs 36,500 last weekend.
On the global front, gold dropped in early trade as a short-covering rally that boosted prices from 4-1/2-year lows lost steam, with buyers still wary that rising stock markets, upbeat US data and softening investment flows would spell further fall in the yellow metal.
Spot gold was down at USD 1,171.80 an ounce during the European morning trade, while silver, too, fell to USD 15.68 an ounce.

Starting a Small Business Is Anything But Routinereddit
Starting a new business requires total dedication and focus. However, the long days and stress can often be taxing on your body, mind and social life.
Here are a few simple things you can do to maintain a sense of normalcy while building your small business, and re-gain control of your day:
Take breaks -- when you are working for yourself, it's easy to get lost in your day. There will be days that slowly creep by, and others that pass at the blink of an eye. It is important that on even the busiest days you dedicate a moment to doing something other than your work. Stretch, walk around, call a loved one -- do something different for a change of pace, so you can go back to your work feeling refreshed.
Try to keep to a routine -- this is especially important during your first few months in business. It's a strange feeling going from commuting and working a nine to six job, to working from home at various hours. You may not be able to control your new, crazy schedule, but you can take control of your day. Set your alarm for the same time every morning, read the newspaper or cook breakfast. Hold on to your daily routine as much as you can.
Stay social -- starting a small business can be lonely, especially if you work by yourself. Schedule a time each week to meet up with friends and family or sign up to attend local networking events. Personally, I have found that I am most productive after having a coffee break with a friend in the early afternoon. It works like a reset button and helps to break up my day.
Avoid being sedentary -- being a small business owner, you are undoubtedly busy. You may now have a shorter commute, if you even have one at all. If you find yourself sitting at a computer all day, don't let your body get used to the limited movement. Join a gym or sign up for a fitness class to keep your body as sharp as your mind.
Be flexible -- your days aren't what they used to be. You may feel like you don't know normal anymore -- and that feeling is okay because you're making strides towards adjusting to your new normal.
Did you recently start your own small business? What tips do you have for other small business owners who may be adjusting to their new daily routine?

U.S. Postal Service HackedThe U.S. Postal Service Has Been Hacked

U.S. Postal Service delivery trucks sit at the Brookland Post Office in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, May 9, 2013. The USPS is projecting a loss of as much as a $6 billion for the year as it keeps pressure on Congress for help, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said this month. The service is scheduled to release second-quarter results May 10. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images | Bloomberg via Getty Images
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Postal Service said Monday it is the victim of a cyberattack and that information about its employees, including Social Security numbers, may have been compromised.
The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating, the agency said in a statement.
Postal Service spokesman David Partenheimer said personal information that may have been obtained in the attack includes employees' names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, emergency contacts and other information.
However, he also said that customers at local post offices or those using its website, usps.com, were not affected.  But people who used its call center may have had telephone numbers, email addresses and other information compromised.
The agency isn't recommending that those customers take any action.
The Postal Service provided no immediate information on how many people may have been affected. It employs over 617,000 workers.
"The intrusion is limited in scope and all operations of the Postal Service are functioning normally," Partenheimer said.
"It is an unfortunate fact of life these days that every organization connected to the Internet is a constant target for cyber intrusion activity," Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in a statement. "The United States Postal Service is no different."
"Fortunately, we have seen no evidence of malicious use of the compromised data and we are taking steps to help our employees protect against any potential misuse of their data."

Despite Narendra Modi vow  nearly third of Cabinet charged with rape  rioting  more* PM Narendra Modi has promised to clean up politics
* Seven of 21 new Indian ministers charged with crimes
* Corruption was key battle ground in 2014 elections
* Nearly one third of cabinet members face prosecution
Attempted murder, waging war on the state, criminal intimidation and fraud are some of the charges on the rap sheets of ministers Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed to the cabinet on Sunday, jarring with his pledge to clean up politics.
Seven of 21 new ministers face prosecution, taking the total in the 66-member cabinet to almost one third, a higher proportion than before the weekend expansion.
At least five people in the cabinet have been charged with serious offences such as rape and rioting.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said any suggestions there were criminals in the cabinet were “completely baseless.
“These are cases arising out of criminal accusations, not cases out of a crime,” he told reporters on Monday, adding that Modi had personally vetted the new ministers.
Ram Shankar Katheria, a lawmaker from Agra, was appointed junior education minister yet has been accused of more than 20 criminal offences including attempted murder and promoting religious or racial hostility.
Katheria was not immediately available for comment and a mobile phone number given by his office was switched off.
The inclusion of such politicians does not sit easily with Modi’s election promise to root out corruption, and has led to criticism that he is failing to change the political culture in India where wealthy, tainted politicians sometimes find it easier to win votes.
“It shows scant respect for the rule of law or public sentiment,” said Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which campaigns for better governance. “Including these people in the cabinet is a bad omen for our democracy.”
Modi won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in May with a promise of graft-free governance after the previous government led by Congress party was mired in a series of damaging corruption scandals.
NEW CABINET MORE TAINTED THAN OLD?
Soon after coming to power, Modi called for courts to fast track cases against politicians in an effort to curb political criminality in the world’s largest democracy. Cases in India’s overstretched judicial system often drag on for years.
Yet Modi’s cabinet includes twice as many politicians facing criminal charges as the previous Congress party one.
Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the new junior chemicals and fertilizer minister, was another eye-catching choice. He is charged with around 20 offences, including intent to wage war against India, criminal intimidation and abetting a mutiny.
Ahir did not respond to requests for comment, and it was not immediately clear what incidents the more serious charges pertained to. His secretary said the cases were politically motivated.
Ahir is best known for helping unearth corruption in the coal industry while he served on a parliamentary committee.
Shrikant Sharma, a spokesman for Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it was up to courts to decide if ministers were guilty, and said many of the charges related to political rivalries.
The BJP is led by Amit Shah, the closest aide of Modi, who is accused of ordering police to carry out three extrajudicial killings and running an extortion racket when he served under Modi as home minister in Gujarat almost a decade ago.
He has denied the charges. He is facing a trial in Mumbai.
The number of lawmakers charged with offences has more than doubled in the last two decades. About a third of federal and state legislators face charges, the ADR said.
Politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win an election as their untainted peers, making them the preferred choice of candidates for political parties in India, according to a study published last year by the group.
In office, these politicians are sometimes accused of enriching themselves or their backers by siphoning off money from government spending.
“We hear again and again the country’s leaders promise to clean up the system,” said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation. “Self interest prevails over principles. That is why the system never changes.”

Google study: Phishing successful 45 per cent of the timeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Certain websites included in phishing emails successfully lure users up to 45 per cent of the time, according to a new Google study.
Researchers at Google and the University of California, San Diego found that emails that try to trick users into handing over their information work way better than believed.
Once the user reaches bogus pages, which tend to imitate legitimate sites, 14 per cent of people unwittingly submit their information to hackers, ‘Huffington Post’ reported.
The study found that the percentage of people who get tricked was “much higher” than they expected.
Researchers looked at 100 phishing emails picked out of a random sample self-reported by Gmail users.
They also reviewed a random sample of 100 phishing websites caught by Google’s Safe Browsing system to further understand how the scams work.
Investigators were then able to look back and see how people interacted with the emails and websites.
The study found even on the worst-performing phishing websites, 3 per cent of users still submitted their data. On the most effective phishing sites, as many as 45 per cent did.
Researchers said 20 per cent of hackers access compromised accounts within 30 minutes of getting their credentials.
This is big business for scammers, as one attacker can be responsible for millions of phishing emails, Google noted.

Adani Power on Monday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs.799 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 as compared to a net loss of Rs.1,072 crore in the same period last year.
During the period, the company’s consolidated total income increased by 36 per cent to Rs.4,148 crore from Rs.3,045 crore in the same period last year.
“Our result reflects higher volume of power generation and improved operational efficiencies which were off-set by the challenges in business that have led to power purchase agreements (PPAs) becoming non-remunerative coupled with limited availability of domestic coal,” said Adani Power Chief Executive Officer Vineet S. Jain. “However, with implementation of tariff orders and improving operational efficiencies, we are confident of revival in our power business performance,” Mr. Jaain added.
Adani Power shares closed with a loss of 2.41 per cent at Rs.46.50 on the BSE.
Adani Ports
Adani Ports & SEZ, on Monday, reported that its consolidated net profit rose by 68 per cent Rs.574 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, from Rs.342 crore in same period last year.Consolidated total income increased by 33 per cent to Rs.1,865 crore from Rs.1,407 crore in the same period last year.

The consolidated cargo handled by the company was 25 per cent higher at 35.18 million tonnes in the second quarter. Mundra port handled 26.57 million tonnes of cargo.
“We had a robust quarter with growth on our major cargo categories, and we continue to maintain our volume at high level performance in our port business. Our focus is on leveraging the benefits through our pan India presence and integrated logistics business,” Adani Ports CEO Sudipta Bhattacharya.
“The results show the continuity of our growth trajectory as a result of each of our ports showing strong performance,” Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said.

Prasad to meet tope-commerce headselectronic commerce
In a bid to reinvigorate the Postal Department by linking it with booming e-commerce, IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is scheduled to meet heads of Amazon India and Flipkart this week.
Amazon India Vice-President and Country Manager Amit Agarwal and Monique Meche, Vice President of Global Public Policy at Amazon are scheduled to meet Mr. Prasad on Tuesday.
Flipkart co-founder and CEO Sachin Bansal is also expected to meet the Minister on November 13, sources said.
The agenda of the meeting is to discuss the ways in which India Post can be utilised by e-commerce players to deliver goods across the country.
The government is also looking at using e-commerce to improve the efficiency of postmen, and contemplating ways to incentivise them for timely delivery of goods.
“The postmen are expected to get some reward for timely delivery of products, although its just an idea as of now,” said a source.
India Post has over 1.55 lakh post offices, of which more than 1.39 lakh are in the rural areas. According to market analysts, last-mile delivery of products ordered by online shoppers will figure as one of the major deciding factors for e-commerce firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and so on.
The opportunity in back-end logistics for online shopping segment is estimated to be about Rs.3,500-4,000 crore, a major part of which is last mile delivery.

CPCL to maximise petro products sales within Tamil NaduUpdated: November 10, 2014 23:51 IST
CPCL to maximise petro products sales within Tamil Nadu

sales
Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) will try to maximise petro products sales within Tamil Nadu to offset revenue losses on account of payment of two per cent Central Sales Tax (CST).
At present, it sells about 1,300-1,400 tonnes of fuel per annum to neighbouring States, accounting for Rs.250-300 crore . This year, it has already paid Rs.125-crore CST. CPCL produces 350,000 tonnes of diesel per month, of which nearly 85,000 tonnes is sold outside the state.
Talking to The Hindu, CPCL Managing Director Gautam Roy said: “This is the biggest challenge facing us right now. Instead of selling the fuel to clients in other States, we will try to maximise the sale within Tamil Nadu. CPCL, being a standalone refinery, is not able to get back the amount paid as CST. Hopefully, this will change with the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax.”
CPCL is paying CST whenever it transports fuel through the Chennai-Bangalore pipeline, even for HPCL terminal located at Ennore.
The company for the first time transported diesel through a tanker from Chennai Port to Kamarajar (Ennore) Port for HPCL terminal. The second round of transportation would take place soon.
“We have adopted this method to avoid paying CST. Like Chennai Port, even Kamarajar Port is congested. It took nearly 6-7 days to send the fuel. We have to pay some demurrage. If this is sorted out, we can think of sending more fuel through this route,” he said.
CPCL is likely to complete laying of 42” crude oil pipeline spanning 17 kilometres soon. It had received all the necessary clearances, except from the Ministry of Road Transport. “The old crude oil pipeline passes through several habitats. We are going for the new one through a different route keeping safety into consideration. The Rs.3,110-crore residue upgradation project will be completed by December, 2015, or early 2016,” he said.

IT firms see best hiring quarter in three years

Indian IT sector has seen robust head count addition in the recently concluded September quarter, making it the best in three years.
A scan of recent quarterly reports, show top five IT firms have hired 35, 200 employees on a net basis in the July-September quarter, up from 14,300 employees in the same quarter last year. The previous best was September 2011 quarter, when these firms added over 40,000 people.
The strong hiring trend comes amid reports that $118-billion domestic IT industry hiring will slow due to automation and change in business models. According to report by research firm Crisil, incremental recruitment by the IT services industry will halve to 55,000 in fiscal 2018 from 105,000 in fiscal 2014, despite a 13-15 per cent revenue growth forecast for this period. It also pointed out reduction in employee costs from 69 per cent of total costs in fiscal 2013 to 64 per cent in the last fiscal.
In the July-September quarter, Cognizant lead the pack accouting for a third of the hiring. The firm added 12,300 employees, which is the best in its history. Tata Consultancy Services saw net head count addition of 8,326. Infosys (4,127 employees), Wipro (6,845 employees) and HCL (3,831 employees) also saw healthy net additions.
“The skills that we need shift a little bit. So we want to make sure that we do not have any skills mismatch. So, we scarified a little bit of utilisation so that we have the right skills for the changing demand and position ourselves well so that we do not have revenue leakage as we go into next year,” Cognizant President Gordon Coburn said in the recent earnings call.
According to foreign brokerage firm J.P. Morgan top six companies (including Tech Mahindra) collectively hired more employees 38,009 on a net basis, in the September 2014 quarter, than in any quarter over the past three years.
“For us it the most striking statistic of September 2014 quarter,” analysts Viju K. George and Amit Sharma wrote in a research note.
“This has partly to do with utilization peaking in the sector (except Tech Mahindra & Wipro). It also has to do with catch-up from fresher commitments made at the campuses some time ago. Nevertheless, adjusting for these two factors, we find employee addition in the sector heartening. Lateral hiring is still over 50 per cent of total hiring on aggregate,” the report said.
“Strong hiring numbers across the industry indicate confidence on pipeline and current assessment of growth opportunities. We do recognize that part of the hiring would be to build bench and provide cushion against increasing attrition rates. Nonetheless, the magnitude of increase in hiring numbers is a significant positive,” according to Kotak Institutional Equities.
“Admittedly, employee growth is not a perfect indicator of demand strength but there cannot be fulfilment of strong demand (if it exists) without employee addition. Not everything can be automated to obviate employee hiring and where automation is doable, there are limits to how much automation companies can single-mindedly pursue without sacrificing revenue growth,” J.P. Morgan noted.

Lawyers allege  criminal cover-up  in GM ignition switch recall0
The emails, according to a lawyer representing the victims, contain evidence of "a criminal cover-up that cost lives and caused severe injuries."
"This meets the traditional definition of gross negligence," said Hilliard. "This shows a conscious decision made with callous disregard for the safety of others."
The emails, which are dated between December 2013 and February 2014, illustrate an ongoing discussion between GM and Delphi about how many parts are needed, how quickly they can be produced and at what cost.
Several emails put the number of parts needed at between 500,000 and 700,000 units at a cost of about $2.6 million.
"That many replacement switches, ordered on an 'urgent' basis, is a de facto recall," Hilliard said.
Hilliard's firm represents approximately 2,200 individual plaintiffs in cases he said involve at least 100 deaths.
"The total number of deaths caused by GM's conduct will never be known, because their cover-up was successful," Hilliard said. "They covered this up for 10 years. As a result, vehicles are gone, accident records cannot be restored, and no one remembers what car it was that ran that stop light and caused someone's death. As a result, a large victim population will never see justice."
GM, in response to published reports concerning the emails, did not dispute the veracity of the emails. The company said in a statement, "These emails are further confirmation that our system needed reform, and we have done so. We have reorganized our entire safety investigation and decision process and have more investigators, move issues more quickly and make decisions with better data."

The great communicatorJawaharlal Nehru’s last press conference took place on May 22, 1964.
Written by Inder Malhotra | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:06 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 10:33 am
In Jawaharlal Nehru’s time, the expression “communicator” hadn’t come into vogue. Yet British political scientist W.H. Morris-Jones said it all when he wrote that Nehru “rules a country of continental size and bewildering diversities with a microphone”. His tryst-with-destiny speech had already been hailed as “one of the best in the 20th century”, and his extempore oration after the Mahatma’s assassination came close to it. Nehru’s awesome record in speaking directly to millions has already been written about. Parliament was, of course, so important a forum for his constant dialogue with the country that it needs to be discussed separately. The written word was also an effective instrument of communication for him. Indeed, he wrote so enormously as to boggle the mind. Fifty-seven volumes of his “Selected Works” — alas, not collective ones — have brought the narrative only up to February 1960. Five volumes of his letters to chief ministers, published only in the 1980s, are a treasure trove for the historian. Someone has wisely decided to bring out a single-volume extracts from these, appropriately titled Letters for a Nation.
To cap it all, there was the Nehru Press Conference, a unique institution, the like of which has never been seen since his passing. With rare exceptions, he regularly held it once a month. The number of journalists being small at that time, until the construction of Vigyan Bhavan, the press conference could easily take place in a committee room in Parliament House, even though a contingent of senior officers from the ministry of external affairs unfailingly joined the hack pack. At Vigyan Bhavan, a commission room was enough.
Nehru always arrived on the dot and asked what subjects we wanted to discuss. He noted them serially and dealt with each at length, answering every question, and then moved on to the next topic. Spiced with humour, his press conferences used to be a combination of enlightenment and entertainment. Some members of the fourth estate used the occasion for self-expression rather than for eliciting information. This often led to hilarity. For instance, during a discussion on some crisis in the Banaras Hindu University, K. Rangaswami of The Hindu demanded that the word Hindu go from the university’s name. Another journalist interjected: “Then so should the entire name of the gentleman’s newspaper.” Nehru joined the ensuing laughter.
When, in 1957, at the height of the Cold War, the Communist Party of India came to power in Kerala in a free and fair election, Delhi-based foreign correspondents got alarmed. One of them asked at his press conference: “Sir, what will happen when Kerala is repeated in all Indian states?” Nehru smiled and with a brief pause, replied: “When that misfortune overtakes us, we will deal with it.”
After President Kennedy announced the “man on the moon” mission, Lawrence P. Atkinson, an elderly journalist specialising continued…

Progress But No Deal In Trans-Pacific Trade TalksObama Urges World Leaders To Approve Elusive, Potentially 'Historic' Trans-Pacific Trade Deal
 | By                                                                JULIE PACE
reddit
BEIJING (AP) — President Barack Obama pressed world leaders Monday to break stubborn logjams that have held up an agreement on a trans-Pacific trade deal that is eagerly sought by the White House and could lead to rare consensus with congressional Republicans.
"This has the potential for being an historic agreement," Obama said as he opened the trade talks being held on the sidelines of the broader Asia-Pacific conference in Beijing.
Ahead of Obama's arrival in China Monday, the White House had downplayed the prospect that an elusive deal would be reached during the president's eight-day, three-nation trip to the region. Following the leaders' meeting, a senior Obama administration official said the negotiations continued to make progress, but there was still no final agreement.
The leaders did not set a timetable for finalizing the pact, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity because the person was not authorized to publicly discuss the talks.
In a joint statement following the meeting, leaders from the 12 nations involved in the trade talks said they have been encouraged by recent progress.
"We remain committed to ensuring that the final agreement reflects our common vision of an ambitious, comprehensive, high-standard, and balanced agreement that enhances the competitiveness of our economies, promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, spurs economic growth and prosperity, and supports job creation in our countries," the statement read.
Obama has made the Trans-Pacific Partnership a centerpiece of his efforts to boost U.S. economic investment in Asia, which he said Monday was "the fastest-growing, most populous, most dynamic region in the world economically."
The results of last week's U.S. midterm elections had made the political climate in Washington more conducive to international trade pacts. While some members of Obama's Democratic Party are wary of the impact trade deals could have on U.S. labor unions, Republicans have been supportive of giving the president authority to speed up approval of a final pact by making it harder for lawmakers to make changes.
Disputes between the U.S. and Japan on market access for their major industries have been at the heart of the stalemate over the trade deal. China is not a party to the trade talks.

Promoter pledges fall for first time in sevenquartersFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Making most of the market rally, the promoters of BSE-500 companies have reduced the percentage of their pledged shares for the first time in 7 quarters. As on September quarter, the percentage of promoters’ shares pledged within BSE-500 universe stood at 11.76%, from 12.01% in June quarter, as per Capitaline data.
Experts attribute this trend-reversal to the surge in the markets. “The rally has shored up the value of the company’s shares. Subsequently, the drawing power of the promoters’ shares has gone up. The promoters are asking lenders to either raise their borrowing limits to match rise in the value of the shares or allow their shares to be released,” said SP Tulsian, an independent analyst. However, shares pledged with banks as collateral for working capital are unlikely to be released, he added.

The BSE Sensex has gained 31.67%, while the CNX Nifty has gained 32.36% YTD Infrastructure companies have been the major beneficiaries. From 96% in June quarter, HDIL’s promoters released all their pledged shares in September quarter. YTD, the stock has gained 63.12%.
The logistics player Gateway Distriparks has seen its pledged shares fall to 25.83% in September quarter from 49.43% in June quarter. The stock has gained 120.41% YTD.
For construction company NCC, the percentage of promoters’ pledged shares have dropped by 19 percentage points in September quarter. YTD, shares are up 179.11%.
Additionally, Aban Offshore’s shares have gained 66.39% in YTD, while the percentage of promoters’ pledged shares have fallen by 11 percentage points in September quarter. Indiabulls Power’s promoters had 100% of their shares pledged as on June quarter. However, that ratio has fallen to 81% with shares gaining 51.22% in YTD.
However, experts don’t see the fall in percentage of pledged shares as a reliable indicator of balance sheet improvement. “The improvement in gearing will depend upon the borrowing programme of individual companies. If borrowings are large, then further fall in the percentage of pledged shares is unlikely,” said Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Securities.

Coming soon: Quicker  easier delistingprocessFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to remove a clause requiring acquisition of a minimum 50% shares by a promoter to delist a company from the stock exchanges. This, and a host of other changes seeking to simplify the framework for share delisting and reduce the time involved in the process, will likely be announced at the Sebi board meeting on November 19, sources told FE on conditions of anonymity, as they were part of the committee that gave feedback to Sebi on its consultation paper.
Sebi will also announce an improved framework on prevention of insider trading after the board meeting in Mumbai.
The new norms will enable Indian stock corporations to delist shares in about 60-70 days by cutting the time required for various approvals as against the current norms that spans the process across 140-150 days and, sometimes, even more than a year. The move will help companies save cost and time with a faster process and also check any manipulation in the share price associated with a longer time-frame.
The framework will cut the time required for various approvals – board, shareholding, stock exchanges and regulatory — to about 30 days, and help the companies conclude the offer and finish delisting formalities in another 30-40 days.
In addition to the reduced time-frame, Sebi will likely remove the clause that requires promoters to acquire 50% of the balance shareholding after the company achieves 90%, which will enable the company to raise promoter holding by just 1%. As per current norms, a company with promoter holding of 89% has to raise its shareholding by 5.5% to 94.5% to fulfil both criteria.
Corporate law and investment bankers also recommended aligning minimum public shareholding (MPS) norms, the takeover regulations and delisting, wherein the company has to notify its intent to delist the company. Experts said Sebi will also clarify and disallow the merger of unlisted companies with a listed entity for delisting. The new Companies Act allows such delisting.
“There is a lot being discussed and Sebi has finalised a few things. One thing is for sure: Reverse book building is here to stay with certain tweaks in the process,” said a senior official of a leading corporate law firm, requesting not to be identified.
In May this year, Sebi had floated a discussion paper on proposed new delisting norms, including a reduced time-frame and a broader price discovery mechanism.
Many large firms have struggled to delist, owing to their failure to acquire a minimum 50% shares from public shareholders. Companies were forced to pay a huge sum as the exit price, or reduce the promoter holding to 75% as prescribed under the MPS.
Firms that were unsuccessful in delisting their shares include AstraZeneca Pharma, Oracle Financial Services Software, Timken India, Novartis India, Thomas Cook, Saint-Gobain Sekurit India and Ricoh India, among others.
Experts said delisting is a complicated process that requires the company to get approval of 2/3rd of the shareholders through a postal ballet, establish an acceptable price through reverse book-building and increase the holding to the required threshold. Given the uncertainty involved in the delisting process, public shareholders typically expect a steep exit price from the company.

Maintain buy on BEL after strong margins &executionFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘buy’ rating on Bharat Electronics (BEL) with a target price of R2,354 per share. The stock is trading at 15.6x FY16e earnings. We believe the opportunity for BEL is large given the increased focus of the new government on modernisation of current fleet and procurement of new capital equipments. We continue to believe BEL offers good investment opportunities to the investors who want to invest in the Indian defence sector with a long-term view.
BEL reported sales of R1,290 crore, up 24% y-o-y. Pick-up in supply to major projects like Akash Missile System, Passive Night Vision Devices ,Electronic Support Measure System, Low Level Light Weight Radar, Tactical Control Radar, Stabilised Optronic Pedestal, L-band Radar, Missile Warning System etc helped support healthy sales growth. The company reported ebitda of R110 crore. Gross margins improved by 230 bps to 43.1%, while other expenses were down 5% y-o-y to R140 crore. Other income was up only 1% y-o-y to R110 crore. Adjusted PAT was up 147% y-o-y to R140 crore. Major planned projects for execution in FY15 are Akash Missile, Low level light weight radar, 3D- Tactical control radar, Passive night vision devices, Missile warning systems, upgradation of Schika.
Order book at the end of Q2FY15 stood at R22,800 crore, down 8% y-o-y. The order inflow for the quarter stood at R820 crore down 19% y-o-y.

Maintain hold on Bata India; upsidelimitedFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘hold’ on Bata India and a September 2015 target price of R1,200 per share, based on 25x 1-year forward P/E (the sector’s 5-year mean). We cut our CY14-15 EPS by 2-5%, and lift CY16 EPS by 1.4%. Bata’s nine months CY14 core EPS was below expectations, at 64% of our previous CY14 forecast.
We recommend investors to wait for better entry points and buy the stock on declines (below R1,200 levels) for a more favourable risk-reward. The stock is trading at 39.9x CY14 P/E and 31.3x CY15 P/E, leaving limited room for any share price upside in the near term. Bata continues to execute well in terms of new product launches (especially in the mid-range to premium-end segments), marketing and store rollouts, and it should benefit from any spending upturn given its high operating leverage. But we believe that the risks of a delayed recovery in consumption and high retail costs are not adequately priced.
After a period of lull in the past three quarters, when net sales growth was stuck in high single digits, Bata India’s net sales growth rebounded to 13.1% y-o-y, 2.8% above our expectation. The company continues to maintain its target of opening 100 new stores in CY14 (99 new stores opened in CY13). We estimate an same store sales growth (SSSG) of 8% in Q3 versus a low of 5% in the last few quarters. Note that its SSSG levels stood at 14-15% a few years back.

NBFCs wake up to a tougherworldFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
In a move towards a level playing field, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed tough norms for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), bringing them on a par with banks. However, the regulator has softened the blow by limiting the norms to companies having asset size of Rs 500 crore and above.
“The new rules are bad news for NBFCs engaged in small business financing including transport financing. The Mor committee recommendations of differentiated provisioning based on the risk profile of players don’t seem to have been accepted,” said group director, Shriram Group, GS Sundararajan.

RBI has given ample time to NBFCs to adhere to the new norms. For NBFCs belonging to a group, the entire group asset would be taken into consideration while determining the threshold of Rs 500 crore, the RBI said. Tier-I capital and provisioning for both standard assets and NPAs have been raised to levels currently prescribed for banks. “We are fully complaint with norms specified by RBI since we follow prudent accounting practices,” said Bajaj Finserv managing director Sanjiv Bajaj.
All NBFCs will need to have net owned funds of Rs 1 crore by March 2016 and Rs 2 crore by March 2017, the RBI has mandated. “It will be incumbent upon such NBFCs, the NOF of which currently falls below Rs 2 crore, to submit a statutory auditor’s certificate certifying compliance to the revised levels at the end of each of the two financial years as given above,” the central bank said in its guidelines on Monday.
From FY16, all NBFCs with asset size of over Rs 500 crore will be labelled systemically important and will have to keep Tier-I capital of 8.5% and raise it to 10% by March 2017.
Over the next three financial years — by March 2018 — these NBFCs will have to provide 0.40% for standard loans and declare a loan as non-performing once the interest or principal is due beyond 90-days. Currently, NBFCs were allowed to declare a loan as NPA after repayments were due beyond 180 days and overdue for 12 months or more in case of lease rental and hire purchase instalments.
“We already treat an account as NPA after 90 days of interest overdue, even though the regulatory requirement is 180 days. Therefore, the revision in guidelines would not affect us much,” said I Unnikrishnan, Manappuram Finance executive director.
On an immediate basis, for FY16, systemically important NBFCs must keep a standard asset provisioning of 0.30%. NBFCs will also have to adhere to the norms of early recognition of distressed assets prescribed for banks.
Further, only rated asset finance companies will be allowed to accept public deposits, RBI said. All unrated asset finance companies will have to procure a rating by March 2016 without which these companies cannot renew deposits.
As a step towards meeting the broad objective of harmonising regulations to the extent possible within the NBFC sector, the credit concentration norms for asset finance companies will be in line with other NBFCs with an immediate effect. All existing excess exposures would be allowed to run off till maturity, RBI said.

Summitry and substanceThe PM must trust his own instincts rather than conform to the prevailing canon in the political class and the bureaucratic establishment on the issues to be discussed at the EAS and G-20.
Written by C Raja Mohan | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:22 am
The East Asian Summit (EAS) in Myanmar and the global economic gathering in Australia this week give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a valuable opportunity to end Delhi’s defensive multilateralism and affirm the emergence of a self-assured India that can actively shape the international order in Asia and the world.
This week’s back-to-back summitry complements Modi’s intensive bilateral engagement with the leaders of great powers and regional partners over the last six months. As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi had travelled extensively in Asia, and his instincts about China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia have served him well in expanding the scope of bilateral relations in the region.
Modi has less exposure to multilateralism. But the PM must trust his own instincts rather than conform to the prevailing canon in the political class and the bureaucratic establishment on the issues to be discussed at the EAS and G-20.
It was the deeply entrenched negativism in Delhi that tripped up Modi on the WTO’s trade facilitation agreement a few months ago and reinforced India’s image as the skunk at the global trade party. Modi has been quick to see the damage and has ordered an intensive negotiation to find a solution to the impasse. A quick closure on trade facilitation and food security would significantly improve Modi’s credibility as an international interlocutor.
Modi has inherited a deeply defensive approach to multilateralism in Delhi. Independent India began as a champion of liberal internationalism, multilateralism and Asian regionalism. By the early 1970s, Delhi’s inward economic orientation and third world radicalism made India increasingly marginal to global economic negotiations. Within Asia, India’s strategic alignment with Soviet Russia put it at odds with its eastern neighbours, including China, and Delhi voluntarily cut itself off from regional institution-building.
Worse still, India emerged as a perverse actor in the multilateral arena, often negotiating against its own interests and becoming a permanent protester. Instead of building a bomb after China tested its first nuclear weapon in 1964, India pushed for the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which ,when finalised, was an instrument it could not sign. Turning hostile to the NPT, India campaigned for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty from the 1970s and would not accede to it when the world was ready for it.
In the 1980s, India argued against direct broadcast satellites and transborder data flows, two areas where it would eventually develop impressive niche capabilities. At the Uruguay Round, India vehemently argued against the inclusion of services in the new agenda for trade liberalisation.
If the crisis at home and a new wave of economic globalisation in the world compelled continued…

New Apple Web Tool Helps You Ditch iMessagereddit
Jumping ship from the so-called " Cult of Mac " to a different platform isn't always easy. For example, people switching from an Apple device to an Android device have complained of missing out on text messages.
Apple recently made an effort to ease the transition, with a new tool to help users switch from the iOS platform (used on the iPhone and iPad) to competing operating systems like Android or Windows Phone without losing texts in the process. The Deregister iMessage page lets users easily deactivate the Apple proprietary messaging service linked to their phone number so that they can get text messages on a new phone.
It's unclear when exactly the service was launched, but an FAQ from Apple about it was "last modified" on October 22, meaning it may have quietly rolled out at the end of last month. Apple did not respond to requests for comment about the deactivation tool.
Users no longer have to worry about iMessage eating their texts.
The tool seems fairly simple: If you don't have your iOS device anymore, just punch in your phone number, get a code, input it into the tool and you're officially off of the iMessage service.
For those who still have an iOS device but plan to switch, the Deregister iMessage page gives instructions for quickly turning off iMessage in "Settings."
Users who switched away from iOS have long reported not getting texts from previous iMessage contacts. Apparently, this happens because Apple sends iMessage data through its own servers instead of your cell-phone service provider's network.
Apple was sued over this issue earlier this year. Following the lawsuit, Apple reportedly tweaked software to make it easier for support staff to help customers with the issue. Apple did not respond to requests for comment about that lawsuit and whether the new Deregister iMessage page was related to it.

A Rose Among the Thornsreddit
After last Tuesday's devastating results in the midterm elections with Democrats losing control of the Senate and other vital seats, including several governors' races, many were frustrated. I myself was extremely disappointed by Democrats that ran away from President Obama, and even more importantly, ran away from his policies and successes like the Affordable Care Act, an improved economy, lower unemployment rates, criminal justice reform initiatives and much more. As I was tempted to wallow in disgust and indignation, the president made an inspiring announcement: his nomination for the next Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. In every sense of the word, she is a rose in the midst of thorns.
Ask anyone who has ever worked with, dealt with or interacted with Lynch and they will tell you that she is fair, courageous and serious when it comes to upholding the law. I had the pleasure of knowing her in 1997 when she was a senior prosecutor in the case against NYPD officers accused of beating and sodomizing Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. Though she was extremely dedicated and always balanced, she never sought headlines; for her it was always about doing effective work. And while she was part of the team that successfully prosecuted the case against the officers in the Louima incident, she could never be attacked as being anti-police because there were other cases which she did not take on, like the one against the cops involved in the shooting death of Sean Bell.
Despite her tremendous track record, Lynch has kept an extremely low-profile and humbly continued her work prosecuting a range of criminals from terrorists to corrupt politicians. Last year, she announced a massive immigration bust at 7-Eleven stores in Virginia and New York accused of running a modern-day plantation system. She has overseen the prosecution of several elected officials, including Pedro Espada Jr., a former Democratic New York State Senator and William F. Boyland Jr., a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn. She also led the investigation of Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of Staten Island who was indicted on 20 counts earlier this year.
Lynch and her team have previously prosecuted several terrorism cases, including one against the men attempting to blow up bombs in subways in New York City. As if these accolades weren't enough, she has also worked for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established by the UN Security Council to "prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law." Lynch is without a doubt a consummate professional whose entire career embodies impartiality and justice.
When current AG Holder announced his resignation, many, including myself, were saddened to hear the news. For those of us in the civil rights community, we were pleased to see Holder take on modern-day challenges like voter suppression, sentencing disparities and ways to reform the criminal justice system overall. Once he stated his intent to resign, we were all clearly anxious to see who his replacement would be. My great fear was that after the groundbreaking work Holder did preserving civil rights, voting rights and more, his established agenda would be compromised.  But I am pleased to see that Lynch is someone who will continue the tradition that he began. I know many Americans may feel disillusioned after last week. There is a lot of reflection that we must do as individuals, as communities, as leaders and as those who are on the side of progress.  But there is also room for encouragement with the nomination of Loretta Lynch. She is by all accounts, and by my own personal experience, a gutsy, no-nonsense, fair and tremendously qualified legal mind who will serve this nation well as the next Attorney General.
There may be a lot of thorns everywhere right now, but she is the rose pushing through to lead the way.

The old, tested power games

The Hindu CHANGED RELATIONS: A significant aspect of the rural-urban interaction in Bawana is the consolidation of new identities in ways that are startlingly different from the past. Picture shows the mahapanchayat proceedings. Photo: V. Sudershan
TOPICS
social issues (general)
Masculinity was deployed to reinforce community identity in the mahapanchayat held in Bawana in north west Delhi
On 2nd November, a group of us visited Bawana in north west Delhi to observe the proceedings of the mahapanchayat held there. The embers of the violence in the resettlement colony of Trilokpuri were still smouldering and Bawana, where a taziya (Muharram procession)has been taking place since 2004, seemed to be on the verge of becoming the latest addition to the urban violence.
On our way to Bawana, we chatted with our autorickshaw driver. The Aam Aadmi Party is useless, he said; it was given a chance, but blew it. I don’t want to talk politics, he added, but Narendra Modi is a good person. “He means business and wants to do things for the country. I don’t really like politics or want to talk about it,” he repeated and trailed off.
Rural-urban relations
What was once Bawana village has, over the last decade or so, transformed into a bustling urban locality. In addition to government infrastructure projects, such as the 6,000-acre Bawana-Narela industrial area, it also hosts one of Delhi’s best-known resettlement colonies that houses former residents of slums and bastis. A short distance from the sprawling Rohini sub-city and home to some of Delhi’s best roads, Bawana is also at the centre of another life of the city — where older caste and ethnic affiliations meet new processes of the market and party politics.
While urban Bawana may have swallowed its village heart, the rural continues to meet the urban in complex ways. In the current environment, a significant aspect of the rural-urban interaction in Bawana is the consolidation of new identities and new feelings in ways that are startlingly different from the past. These in turn alter everyday relations between people who, otherwise, have lived as neighbours and co-workers.
The mahapanchayat was held at a marriage hall in the heart of Bawana. The organisers announced that 25-30 villages were represented and villagers had come of their own free will. The event was scheduled for 4 p.m. and crowds began to gather half an hour earlier. There was a steady inflow of young men and these easily formed the bulk of the gathering. They came on motorcycles, in cars, buses and tractors. As the crowd built up, the master of ceremonies shouted slogans about protecting Mother India and the cow, and called upon a local singer to entertain the gathering. The performer sang of the sanctity of village bonds, having respect for elders, protecting women, and the attack on Hindu culture by aliens. The gathering — about 700-800 men and three women — broke into frequent applause. Soon after, a procession of about 50 slogan-shouting young men entered the venue, many waving the national flag. The mahapanchayat was now called to order and a village elder was nominated as head of the gathering. We will not talk about politics, the master of ceremonies said; we are simply here to defend our ways of life. The “other” community, he continued, believes in violence and we are capable of answering their violence with our own show of strength. Why don’t we push them in front of running trains and into canals to match their violence, he asked to a great deal of laughter and applause. Various politicians and local leaders, some protected by armed guards, pledged to support “the will of the people.” The taziya procession, the mahapanchayat resolved, must be stopped or, various speakers asserted, there would be terrible consequences. Some young men distributed flyers that said that if the population of Hindus was to diminish, the country risked partition. We do not wish to talk politics, the announcer intoned in the background.
Hyper-masculine space
As we departed the marriage hall that had taken on the form of a hyper-masculine space — the only woman on the dais was presented as a village leader but was not invited to speak — there was another announcement: should the taziya procession not be cancelled, a “secret” message outlining further action would be circulated through mobile phone to those in the gathering who had volunteered their numbers to the organisers. Outside the venue we ran into some locals who were, however, more than willing to be open about their thinking. When we were ushered into the office of a local residents’ group, an elderly man told us that this was all a plan to divide the community for political benefit, and that Hindus and Muslims had been happy neighbours in the area. This is all a plan by the Congress, he continued, to block the “Modi wave.” He showed us photocopies of a letter signed by some local Muslim leaders to the administration urging it to cancel permission for the taziya procession. The local Muslims, we were told, do not want the procession. It is the Muslims from the Bawana resettlement colony that insist on it, and the Congress has encouraged it for vote-bank politics. He did not wish to talk politics and this was not a political event, the old man insisted.
So, what is politics at a time when no one wishes to talk politics? First, it is the task of identifying the goals of organised party politics with the politics of everyday life. Despite the fact that the organisers of the taziya procession had agreed to change its route, some groups have been assiduously working to propagate the idea that the only a show of force from beleaguered Hindus would put an end to it. This contributes to the idea of a community whose ways are under threat and the making of a “sensitive” area.
Second, at urban peripheries, older and economically better-off groups have become involuntary neighbours to newer arrivals. The Jat-dominated Bawana township is right next to the resettlement colony with its mixed population. There is no lack of interested groups, of all political shades, who seek to portray this situation in terms of “threats to our life-worlds from outsiders.” Our young men, the mahapanchayat organisers repeatedly announced, will happily spill their blood for the sake of their traditions.
Finally, it is the young men at the gathering we need to think about: how do new forms of urban masculinity manifest in power games beyond local communities? How is masculinity deployed to reinforce community identity? Who stands to benefit from the exhortations to young men to protect the honour of their women and community?
Trilokpuri shows us that no one does.

Domestic LPG can be sold to public sector units onlyDomestic LPG can be sold to public sector units only
PTI  New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 23:37 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 23:39 IST(10/11/2014)

In a setback to non-state LPG marketing firms, the government’s top law officer has ruled that all domestically produced cooking gas (LPG) should be sold to public sector units for subsidised sale to consumers.
Ranjit Kumar, Solicitor General of India (SGI), has upheld the oil ministry’s view that sale of LPG by domestic producers to anyone other than state-owned oil marketing companies is not permissible under the LPG Control Order, sources said.
Non-state LPG sellers, also known as ‘parallel marketeers’, cannot source the fuel from domestic refiners, he added. They have to import LPG if they intend to sell the fuel in domestic market.
While India has surplus refining capacity, it does not produce enough LPG to meet all of its demand. LPG is produced by both public sector firms such as IOC as well as private firms including Reliance Industries. This LPG is sold to consumers mostly through distributors appointed by the government, at subsidised rates.

Rauner pledges support for incubators  U.S. veteran entrepreneurs0
Also at the news conference, held at the Union League Club of Chicago, Bunker CEO Todd Connor announced his team’s commitment to raising $2 million for the Bunker Expansion Opportunity Fund, which will help finance expansion to seven other cities including Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. He said the new incubators will open within 12 months. Other sites are Colorado Springs, Colo; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; and Tacoma, Wash.
“Twenty-five percent of active-duty personnel indicate an interest in starting their own business when they graduate from the military,” Connor said. “And yet the channels for them to do that are few and far between.”
U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies, also addressed the crowd of veterans and businesspeople. He said he is working with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to make sure veterans fill Senate staff roles.
“There’s no better way to take care of our veterans than to get them a job and a company to run,” Kirk said.

Column: Instrumentality of stateLetters to  the editor
While Air India which has a negative net worth of around R20,000 crore battles with myriad problems, from increased competition to trying to get its operations together, it faces a peculiar problem. It has 3 Boeing 777-200 LRs that it does not need to fly, but doesn’t know how to deal with—it floated a tender to lease them out, got a good bid from Etihad Airways, but since the bid is a single one, the company is not sure if it should go that route since this could invite censure from the CAG and worse from the CBI.
Some years ago, when the Railways floated a tender for an electric locomotive factory, the fact that there was just a single bidder—US firm General Electric—was cited as the reason for not going ahead with the tender. This is despite the fact that, in this case, the bid given by the private party was lower than the internal estimate prepared by the Railways—before the bid was invited—of how much it would cost to produce the electric locomotive if it was done in-house.
Across PSUs, the same story is being played out almost every day. So while finance minister Arun Jaitley has done well to say that he is open to privatising sick PSUs—79 of them had accumulated losses of R55,656 crore in FY13—the problem goes far beyond just the sick PSUs. While it would send out a great reforms signal if privatisation picks up and if PSUs like Air India and MTNL are privatised, there is a limit beyond which privatisation can’t proceed—even the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government privatised just 10-15 mid-sized PSUs out of 219 central PSUs, and the Vajpayee government had an aggressive privatisation programme.
To be sure, some part of the slower decision-making in PSUs has got to do with the issue of their bureaucratic culture where there is no special reward for decision-making but a large part of the solution is to fix what is known as L1-itis—tenders have to be called for everything and if they are not given to the lowest bidder, this is seen to be violating the law.
One way to fix this is to do what ONGC has just done. Its board has accepted a proposal from the Boston Consulting Group to revamp its tendering process to give more weight to the technical criterion—in other words, choose the best possible vendor, and then look at the costs.
Whether that works remains to be seen, but how is ONGC to deal with a situation in which there is just one tender, and can the losing parties go to court as they have done, successfully, in the case of other PSUs? And how do you deal with the post-tender negotiations that simply have to take place in a dynamic business environment with both demand and supply conditions changing?
The key issue here is what is called ‘instrumentality of state’, a provision in the Constitution (Article 12) which says PSUs are like an arm of the state—once this is accepted, PSUs are bound to act like the state, in an impartial manner. This is where the tenders and other issues follow. So while no losing bidder can go to court against Vodafone hiring Ericsson to handle its network, they can against MTNL or BSNL—by the way, one of the Pitroda committee recommendations for turning around BSNL is to outsource its network operations in the same manner private firms do.
The L1 and instrumentality-of-state argument, new defence minister Manohar Parrikar would do well to keep in mind, may even hit the newly-minted Make-in-India programme. Under the programme, to begin with, firms are to do joint R&D with the defence forces, with the government picking up 80% of the tab—later, if the R&D is successful, the work is to be operationalised. How are the initial vendors to be selected since bidding is difficult in cases where the work is at the conceptual stage as in, say, the next generation of fighter aircraft? One option is to, as in the US, go in for cost-plus contracts, but since this requires vigorous audits, the defence ministry will have to engage in a long discussion with the CAG on how and what is to be subject to audits—several reports of the CAG tend to get into pointless detail on issues that don’t really concern the CAG. For the record, one is not talking of the Coalgate or 2G reports here, but audit reports on private sector projects would do well to at least do some benchmarking of costs and efficiencies before pronouncing them guilty.
Last year, in order to address this issue, the UPA government proposed a constitutional amendment to get PSUs outside the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution. The proposed amendment, however, got struck down by Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran who said PSUs would still be subject to writs under Articles 32 and 226; besides, he said, removing PSUs from the ambit of Article 12 would run afoul of the judiciary as it violated the basic structure of the Constitution.
But the government would do well to relook the issue. While Parasaran dismissed the proposed amendment, he pointed out that in Pradeep Biswas vs Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002), the Supreme Court had said that for an entity to be an instrumentality of state “it should have been entrusted with such functions as are governmental…by being of public importance or being fundamental to the life of people and hence governmental.” Just using the falling market shares of PSUs should make it clear they are no longer fundamental to the life of people, or governmental in nature—BSNL’s market share is 10%, MTNL’s is under 1%and Air India’s is around 17%. Apart from going to the Supreme Court again, if PSUs are to be saved, the government needs to approach Parliament on the matter, if need be through a joint session.

Editorial: Mid-course correctionsLetters to  the editor
Given how many of the ministerial mergers—finance and defence, telecom and law—never made sense, prime minister Narendra Modi has done well to expand his cabinet and do away with the forced mergers made in the name of minimum-government-maximum-governance. The flipside of the ministerial M&As, of course, as FE has advocated earlier, the prime minister missed an opportunity in merging four ministries that look after agriculture—water resources, fertiliser, food and public distribution and agriculture itself—into one mega-ministry with a single agenda of taking India’s agriculture into the 21st century. The weekend’s cabinet expansion, of course, is linked to the BJP’s political ambitions, so there are 7 ministers from Bihar (including the BJP allies like Ram Vilas Paswan) and 12 from Uttar Pradesh which will go to polls in the next 2-3 years. The size of the Cabinet has got many saying that, at 66, it is not much smaller than the UPA’s 78—and there could be a few more additions if the sulking Shiv Sena comes along after Modi refused to submit to its blackmail. While a compact Cabinet would obviously be easier to manage, the important thing is whether a government is agile or hamstrung. So far, Modi’s Cabinet has proved to be remarkably agile and matters have got cleared quite fast—indeed, decisions such as the opening up of the coal sector were hanging fire in the UPA for years without a resolution.
Of all the ministers inducted, Suresh Prabhu’s case has been the most interesting, and not just due to the fact that his party wasn’t too keen to have him as a minister and he had to join the BJP in order to find a place in the Cabinet. Prabhu was one of the dynamic ministers in the Vajpayee government and it is to his credit that the concept of competition in the electricity sector was brought in through the Electricity Act of 2003—the Act itself was written by Gajendra Haldea who is now an infrastructure advisor to the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments. The choice of Railways for Prabhu may seem natural given how its modernisation—and induction of both FDI and competition in it—is critical to the Modi scheme of things, but it is nonetheless curious. For one, while Prabhu is in charge of Railways, you have a committee headed by Bibek Debroy which is supposed to suggest ways to restructure the Railway Board—the heart of the Railways functioning—as well as resource mobilisation for major railway projects. Prabhu himself heads a committee on integrated development of the power and coal sector—Piyush Goyal is the minister here. It doesn’t help that Prabhu is also the Sherpa for the G-20 and was, till recently, supposed to be in the reckoning for the head of the new Reforms Commission. Whether such multiple responsibilities will be a source of weakness or a source of strength for the government is to be seen. Apart from the obvious control of the PMO, the fact that Arun Jaitley is sort of an economics minister with most economic decisions referred to him first helps smoothen matters—getting a full-time deputy in Jayant Sinha instead of a part-timer in Nirmala Sitharaman who had her hands full in commerce and industry is also some help for Jaitley.

Editorial: No more laboured reformLetters to  the editor
President Pranab Mukherjee finally giving his assent to Rajasthan’s sweeping labour law reforms opens up a brand new chapter in labour reform across the country; indeed, it will trigger a new phase in Centre-state reforms with the Centre facilitating reforms in various states. Till now, in the case of labour law reforms for instance, if the central law was different from the state law, the central law prevailed. The current central law requires that, if a unit has more than 100 workers, it requires government permission to either close down or retrench workers—Rajasthan raising this to 300, as per the current law, is irrelevant. Or it was till last week when the President signed his assent to the Rajasthan law under Article 254(2) of the Constitution—this allows states to have a law that is different from that of the Centre as long as the President okays it. Rajasthan also proposed other changes—the proportion of workers that needed to be represented has been doubled from 15% to 30% for a union to be recognised, and the Contract Act is to apply to companies having 50 workers instead of the earlier 20—and all have been accepted. In other words, new industrial and other units may find it more attractive to set up shop in Rajasthan; and the state itself is free to, at some point in time, raise this limit even higher if it helps attract investment.
Immediately, the door has been opened to other states who wish to have progressive labour laws. Madhya Pradesh, for instance, has cleared amendments similar to the ones in Rajasthan, and states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have also indicated they want to make their labour laws more industry-friendly. So more states can be expected to line outside the President’s door.
Even more exciting is the possibility for other reforms.
Rajasthan’s draft land acquisition policy envisages higher compensation than the Central one, but does not have the social impact assessment clause which is what is holding up land purchases for industry. If the President signs on Rajasthan’s law —which essentially means the Centre has to agree with the proposals—once the state assembly passes it, this opens up a window for states to have more progressive land acquisition laws. In other words, the use of Article 254(2) opens up an exciting new phase in state-level reforms in various fields.

Editorial: Compulsory VotingLetters to  the editor
No one will disagree that dispensing one’s civic duties by voting in elections is paramount. But should it be compulsory, too, with a penalty for failing to do so? The Gujarat government has pushed through a new law that makes voting compulsory, albeit in just civic elections. The Gujarat Local Authorities Laws Bill 2009 has received governor OP Kohli’s nod, after having been returned twice by his predecessor, Kamala Beniwal. The new law doesn’t yet specify the penalty for the violation of its mandate, but the government is free to notify any measures whenever it chooses.
It is indeed desirable that governments try and inculcate the sense of civic responsibility among citizens, but they can’t do this yielding the threat of legal repercussions. As pointed out by Beniwal while returning the Bill, the law violates the spirit of individual liberty that is safeguarded by Article 21 of the Constitution. There are other ways in an electoral democracy of getting the voter to participate. The ‘none of the above’ (NOTA) option, for example, spurs many, who would have otherwise abstained from voting, to register their choice. It is in the best interest of voters to cast their vote in the civic elections, given these shape the most direct interface of governance. But it shouldn’t be forcibly extracted.

Column: From Ananda  with loveLetters to  the editor
I spent a few days last week at Ananda, a spa in the Himalayas, and, boy, was it a delight! I twittered with the birds, talked to the trees and twinkled with the stars. The air was so clean my brain stopped working. It was wonderful.
As I returned to earth, I found I had a remarkable clarity. Stopping at Delhi airport around 5 p.m., I could feel the focused intensity of the economy coming back to life. And, when I arrived in Mumbai around 8:30 p.m., there was no mistaking the buzz. The city was alive, cooking with gas—it felt as if it were 2005 all over again. Clearly, economic growth in 2015-16 will be higher than the most optimistic estimate now.
And Mumbai itself will be one of the key drivers. As anyone with a modicum of sense knows, any meaningful investment in the city will deliver far more value to India’s growth story than that same investment anywhere else. And whatever you may feel about prime minister Narendra Modi, there is no doubt that he has more than a modicum of sense. Thus, with the new BJP (or, more correctly, Modi) government in Maharashtra, look for fast and furious changes—Suresh Prabhu as railway minister is already the first step.
Unfortunately, while high energy, high powered development is just what the doctor ordered for Mumbai (and India), the fundamental problem of corruption remains loud, front and centre. In Maharahstra, 74 of the 122 BJP MLAs (nearly 61%) have criminal cases against them, 46 of which are for serious crimes; the comparable ratio for other party MLAs is lower, but a still-atrocious 55%. Thus, as growth and investment accelerates, there will be more and more opportunities to loot the treasury, which, if unchecked, could very quickly drag the growth explosion into a morass of corruption, as bad as we have seen in the recent years. Given his articulated plan to run a clean government, Modi will need to police the BJP’s MLAs in Maharashtra, as well as those in other states and, of course, his MPs, all of which would be a full time job.
The good news, of course, is the announcement of the Delhi assembly elections. Clearly, it will be a two-horse race between Modi (the favorite) and the AAP, resurrected by circumstance. Given the BJP’s money power, which appears to be much more than the Congress at its best (or worst, depending on how you look at it), it will be very difficult for the AAP to get a majority. Nonetheless, sitting in the opposition with a respectable number of seats may well be a win-win. More important is the campaign, where the AAP will be able to demand candidates who are criminal-case free and transparent about their (and their party’s) funding. Indeed, if the AAP plays its cards right—meaning it doesn’t scream about generalised (or even specific) corruption, but simply focuses on these two issues—we could end up with an election where the two key candidates for each seat is clean, at least from these perspectives. This would be a major victory for Indian politics, and will set the stage for improvements in subsequent elections.
This is the kind of structural change we need to sustain GDP growth, which, as I have already mentioned, is accelerating. Of course, this means that inflation management will remain tricky. Currently, with India an outlier in a world of falling commodity prices and threatening deflation, RBI will find it extremely difficult to titrate monetary policy to manage inflation expectations on the one hand and ensure that the rupee doesn’t remain too strong for export competitiveness on the other.
This is all the more important given that global growth is stumbling again. Europe is closed for business, China is slowing down and Japan is on the ropes. The US trade deficit has started widening, reinforcing the fact that while US growth may be improving, global demand remains pathetically weak.
This also points—with Ananda clarity—to a continued strengthening of the dollar. With the yen on a straight and rapid path downwards, gold languishing below $1,200, and the Euro heading for the cellar —remember it started life at below parity to the dollar—there ain’t no place to go but the dollar. Its beginning to feel like the late-1990s again, when the dollar was the only game in town and it rose and it rose and it rose. And it rose some more.
If this does turn out to be the case, the rupee will have to fall and fall and fall and fall. Except that with India quickly becoming the second-best (after the US) game in town, investment flows could hold up this natural process.
To manage this extremely tricky situation, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan should take his key advisors on a retreat to Ananda. I would be happy to play tour guide.

There is a common belief social mobility has stalled. This is not the caseReddit
“Social mobility” is a leitmotif in British politics. Successive governments have launched strategies to improve “equality of opportunity”. Alan Milburn, a Labour MP, publishes an annual report listing “indicators” of its progress. There is common agreement that social mobility has stalled: that the UK is in an uniquely immobile spot. The truth is far more nuanced but it is nevertheless a depressing picture.
There are at least two difficulties when interpreting claims about social mobility. The first is that people mean different things when they talk about the idea . They might be referring to what academics call “absolute” mobility: whether someone moves in to a different occupational class or income bracket over their lifetime. Or they might be talking about “relative” mobility: the probability that someone from a certain background (usually a working-class one) will end up in a different class. And are they talking about upward or downward mobility?
The second issue is that social mobility is inherently hard to measure in real-time . The best known study in the field is based on a comparison between a cohort born in 1958 and one born in 1970. This tells us nothing about what has happened to the generation born in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Although there has been some research looking at people now in their late 20s and early 30s, many of our assumptions about mobility in 2014 are based on findings from the 20th century.
A new study by academics at Oxford university and the London School of Economics updates our understanding. It looks at four cohorts: Britons born in 1946, 1958, 1970, and 1980-84. Therefore we can now see what happened to social mobility in the start of this century. For each group, the academics use a standard measure of occupational class, which breaks down jobs into seven types based on the tasks involved, making it possible to compare jobs of 50 years ago with those of today. The findings show how much movement there is between the class a person is born into (defined by that of their father) and where they end up at the ages of 27 and 38.
The overall picture undermines the idea that social mobility is in decline. The share of people moving one from class to another – and the odds that they will do so – has remained essentially constant. Three out of four Britons were in a different class (as defined by the researchers) at age 27 and 38 compared with that of their fathers. Someone born in the top social class is 20 times more likely to end up there than someone born in the lowest class; a terrible yet constant inequality in chances.
In other words, there is movement. Mobility has not ground to a halt. The problem, as the academics show, is that the direction of that mobility is increasingly downwards, and the pervasive extent of poor inequalities in life chances.
Men born in the 1946 cohort were at age 27 twice as likely, and at age 38 three times as likely, to have moved upwards rather than downwards. These differences narrow across successive generations. Upward mobility declined between those born in 1970 and those born in the early 1980s. So much so that by age 27, men born between 1980 and 1984 have an equal chance of having moved upwards or downwards.
The picture for women is similar, with downward mobility increasing over time, albeit without the decline in upward mobility experienced by the male cohorts.
What explains these changes? The authors cite the “evolution of the British class structure”. What they present is the opposite of what happened during what they call the “Golden Age of mobility”: the generation after the second world war where a massive expansion in professional and managerial jobs created lots of opportunities for people to move up the social ladder. More people will move down for the simple reason that more of them start at the top with nowhere else to go.
Too often politicians talk about social mobility without reference to the structure of the economy. This is the deep context for the worries among “millienials” and parents of milliennials that they will fare worse than their mums and dads. In the short-run, the number of good jobs is finite, and there are more people trying to hold on to them. ( One wonders what the digital revolution will do to social mobility.) It helps to explain efforts by parents to help their children by funding unpaid internships, stints in London, Master’s degrees, and so on. “The emerging situation”, write the authors, “is one for which there is little historical precedent and that carries potentially far-reaching political and wider social implications”.

The eight risks to D.C. in the MLS stadium dealBy Jonathan O'Connell November 10 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
City Administrator Allen Lew is trying to get his stadium deal through the D.C. Council. (The Washington Post)
There are myriad reasons for the D.C. Council to support Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s proposal for a D.C. United stadium on Buzzard Point.
Doing so would keep the team in the city and allow United to leave the crumbling RFK Stadium. It would accelerate development in Southwest where currently there are vacant lots. It would create economic benefits in three parts of the city: Buzzard Point; on U Street NW, where the Reeves Center would be redeveloped; and in Anacostia, where a new municipal building would be developed.
In all, the likely economic benefits outweigh the costs by millions of dollars, according to a recent report commissioned on the stadium deal by the D.C. Council.
And yet when the council held a hearing Nov. 5 to review the report’s findings, much of the discussion was about the risks to the city in completing such a deal.
The concern may stem from unhappy memories of the approval process for Nationals Park. The District’s then-chief financial officer, Natwar Gandhi, first projected the cost of that park at $535 million plus financing fees. After a series of escalations and overruns , the total ended up near $800 million, with taxpayers footing nearly the entire bill.
City Administrator Allen Lew, who oversaw the construction of Nationals Park, has carefully tried to protect the District against some of cost escalations that affected Nationals Park, namely those related to the acquisition and clean-up of the needed land.
By agreeing to land prices with developer Akridge, Pepco and other private landowners ahead of time, Lew said he has largely guarded against the same kind of cost variance. In his testimony , Lew also told the council that it was “important to note that nothing in life is risk-free.”
“There is risk in everything we do, and it is impossible to structure a major transaction, or for that matter a walk across the street, without risk,” he said. “To my way of thinking, the question is not whether there is risk, but rather is the level of risk appropriate for the transaction and has the risk been properly managed. In this regard, I believe the development team has done their job and done it well.”
To assess the city administrator’s claims the council relied on a former city administrator Robert C. Bobb. After serving under Mayor Anthony Williams, Bobb became D.C. school board president before being appointed emergency financial manger of the Detroit school system.
Now in the private sector, Bobb was one of the consultants that prepared the report. In it, he laid out what he considered the top eight risks to the District. Here they are in the order they are listed, explained below in layperson’s terms:
1. If D.C. finds it needs to change the deal along the way, Akridge could terminate it.
The deal permits Akridge to renegotiate its land swap if the District alters it in a way that “materially impacts” the deal. If D.C. has already begun spending money on the project, that money could be lost.
2. The District’s obligations could run beyond $150 million. 
Bobb points in particular to the possible cleanup costs of the Akridge and Pepco sites, for which there are no caps to the District’s costs. (A spokesman for Lew called the possibility of undiscovered environmental issues or site preparation problems creating such overruns “remote.”)
3. The District could spend $150 million preparing land for the stadium, but the team could fail to build it.
The District must fund and complete all its obligations to the agreement by Dec. 31, 2016, while the team is required to provide a completed stadium by March 1, 2018. Something could go wrong in the meantime. Since the team has provided little financial information to the District, little is known about the team’s ability to finance construction of a stadium.
4. The District’s money is at greater risk than the team’s.
For instance, if the District has not completed needed stadium infrastructure by the end of 2016, the team could terminate the agreement. D.C. will have spent its money; the team will not have.
5. The District has limited recourse if the stadium isn’t built.
The agreement caps damages the District could win in a disagreement with the team at $5 million, and that’s only if United has already spent $4.5 million on the project. Bobb’s words: “Potentially the District may not receive any liquidated damages after spending all of its $150 million on the stadium project.”
6. Little planning has been done for the Anacostia building.
Lew plans for the government to relocate offices to a new Anacostia municipal center in three years. Bobb says, however, that “there has not been a determination of the funding source or cost estimates for the proposed center. There is also no schedule for the development, relocation and occupancy of the new government center.”
If the new building isn’t ready in time, the District would incur extra costs. How likely is it the District could plan a building, run a developer competition, vet the plans with the community and complete a new building in three years?
7. The stadium may need renovations or upgrades.
Stadiums often need some upkeep once they are 10 or 15 years old. Will the District be asked to pay those costs? Unknown.
8.  There is a “high probability” the team will seek more property tax relief.
Even if United gets the $50 million in tax breaks it has requested in the deal, it would begin paying a portion of property taxes in its sixth year in the stadium and 100 percent of property taxes in the 21st year there.
Bobb: “There is a high probability that at some point [the team] would seek a permanent property tax exemption or alternatively a reduction in the assessed value of the stadium land, placing property taxes paid to the District at risk of elimination or significant reduction.”

Why We Need to Seek Out Feedback -- Even When it Hurtsreddit
A young woman I've been mentoring called me the other day, distraught.  "It happened again," said Ms. Fragile.  "I just finished a big project and loads of people told me it went really well. But my boss called me and once again, starting going over all the ways I could have handled things better -- even though she never told me ahead of time to do anything different. She even asked me to critique myself!  It's frustrating. How do I handle the constant criticism?"
There's a common belief that women seem to have a tougher time with criticism at the workplace. In my experience, we tend to take it more personally than men. We see criticism as an attack on ourselves, rather than our work.  But maybe we're overly sensitive because we're criticized more than men, whether it's justified or not.  A 2014 study by linguist Kiernan Snyder for Fortune magazin e of performance reviews found that 88 percent of the reviews received by women contained critical feedback, compared to 59 percent of the men.  And woman reviewers were just as likely to be critical of women as male reviewers.
It sucks that woman are criticized more than men, especially when all too often, we get shafted for the same behavior that is praised in a man (the abrasive, bitchy woman rather than the assertive, hard-charging man.)  But I knew Ms. Fragile needed to get past any sort of gender politics.  The important lesson for her is that a boss who gives you specific, performance-based feedback is a tremendous gift.  Here's how my conversation went with my wounded friend.
"So, when you were growing up, did your parents say all your art projects was amazing?" I asked. "Did your teachers tell you that you were a hard worker?  I bet you almost always got As, right?
"Uh, I got a couple of B's," said Fragile.
"Well, in the real world, where you get a paycheck in exchange for adding value to an organization, everything you do isn't perfect.  Consider yourself very fortunate that you have a boss that provides both autonomy and performance-based feedback.  She lets you make your own decisions and then afterwards asks you to talk about what could have been improved.  It seems like your boss wants you to take what you learn and apply it to the next project. Does that seem right?"
"Yeah, I guess so," replied Fragile.
"The great thing about your boss is she seems to be focusing on your actual work, and she's even asking you to join in the appraisal. One of the strongest predictors for success I've seen is a person's willingness to seek out feedback and learn from it.  Team members who came to me ten years ago begging for critiques are now superstars."
"Well, maybe," she said. "But it just makes me feel really crappy to think about all the mistakes I made."
"If you're beating yourself up over not doing a 'perfect' project, ask your boss if she would could step in and help you analyze things mid-way or periodically, instead of doing a post-mortem. She sounds like the kind of manager who understands the importance of providing subordinates with the freedom to make their own decisions, but there's a lot to be said for providing feedback mid-stream."
"I definitely don't want to be micro-managed," replied Fragile.
"You should read Ed Catmull's Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration. It describes how Pixar uses "Braintrust" sessions to give its directors continuing feedback as they make their films.  Even a superstar director makes a better movie when colleagues weigh in periodically throughout a film's development. But it's still up to the director to decide what to do with the notes they get, even from their superiors. Get a copy and then ask your boss to read it too."
"Did you forget I work for an accounting firm?" asked Fragile.
"It doesn't matter!  It's just about the process. The important thing is to stop looking at feedback as an insult.  Instead, seek out even more of it -- go to peers, clients, anybody, and ask them what's working well and what you could improve.  If you happen to get feedback that you don't feel is warranted based on your gender, such as being called abrasive, ask the person to give you a specific, performance-based example. You'll get a thicker skin and I guarantee you'll become a  more valuable employee."

The Economy Won t Move Becasue Managers Won t Movereddit
This economy needs more "animal spirit."  The great economist, John Maynard Keynes , coined this term to describe the willingness of business managers to expand aggressively and identified it as essential for economic growth.  It is, he argued, what impels them to hire and spend. Companies today surely have the wherewithal to become more aggressive.  Profits and margins are strong and balance sheets are in remarkably good shape.  Yet, managers seem to lack the confidence to move.  Hiring has remained historically restrained and so, accordingly, so have household incomes and spending, at least relative to past recoveries, and so also has the pace of overall economic growth.  Spending by businesses on new facilities, equipment, systems, and intellectual capital has also remained historically restrained.  Nor are their signs of a change in such patterns, at least not significant enough to alter the substandard character of this recovery.
Certainly, managements have the resources to be a lot bolder than they have been.  According to the Federal Reserve , non-financial corporations have seen the value of their financial assets jump 4.7 percent a year since 2009 and 4.8 percent a year since 2012.  Their cash on hand has increased during these two periods at annual rates of 3.3 percent since 2009 and a whopping 5.8 percent rate since 2012.  Cash holdings now exceed 10 percent of total liabilities.  The value of their real estate assets has increased at a 9.1 percent annual rate since 2009 and at a still stronger 12.5 percent rate since 2012.  Total assets have jumped at annual rates of 5.6 and 5.4 percent during these two periods respectively.  Business caution has, however, so held down the growth of liabilities that their net worth has jumped 6.5 percent a year since 2009 and 6.6 percent since 2012.
This story of improvement and caution is much the same for smaller business .  Non-financial, non-corporate firms in the United States have seen their total assets expand 9.5 percent a year since 2012.  Their cash holdings have grown less impressively than those of larger companies, but, like their larger brothers and sisters, caution in these smaller firms has held back increases in liabilities, which have expanded at only a 1.2 percent annual rate since 2009 and only a 1.9 percent rate since 2012.  Their net worth, accordingly, has jumped at a 7.8 percent yearly rate since 2009 and a 6.6 percent rate since 2012.
Despite the impressive improvement in business' financial resources, two considerations in particular have held managements back.  First is the legacy of the great recession of 2008-09, perhaps "wounds" is a better word.  During that difficult time, managements came up short on several counts.  Many report that they had trouble making payroll.  The financial crisis that accompanied the recession exaggerated such pressure.  Many small and quite a few larger firms found lenders less than eager to honor lines of credit previously arranged.  Little wonder, then, that managements remain reluctant to use their assets and their cash as fully and as aggressively as they once did.  On top of these powerful influences, Washington, beginning in 2009, passed a great deal of complex legislation.  The Affordable Care and the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform acts stand as prominent.  Whatever the merits of these laws, their complexity created considerable uncertainty among managements about the costs of hiring or credit and even the future availability of credit, a consideration that greatly exacerbated the reluctance engendered by the recessionary experience.
Business has, accordingly, hired at a slower pace than in the past.  Even the 2014 pickup in the pace of payroll growth falls short of the historic standard.  So far this year, according to the Labor Department, payrolls have grown on average by 226,667 a month, up from 194,250 a month in 2013 and 186,333 in 2012.  Though a welcome improvement, past recoveries in the 1980s, 1990s, and earlier in this century, have seen much stronger payroll gains, often in excess of 300,000 a month.  Reflecting the slow pace of hiring, real incomes in this recovery have grown less robustly than in past cycles.  The lavish use of overtime and an upgrading in the average skillset of new employees has helped overcome some of the effects of the hiring shortfall, but not enough to change the adverse incomes comparison.  So far this year, overall real personal income has accelerated to a 3.6 percent annual pace of increase, from negligible growth in 2013 and 2012.  Though also a welcome improvement, the established trend nonetheless remains well below that of past cyclical recoveries.
The present rate of growth in incomes is good enough to sustain some expansion in consumer spending, and also give some hope of an acceleration going forward, but nothing to match past cyclical recoveries.  The strain is not just that households have seen their spendable resources grow along a shallow slope, but their sense of the shortfall, and the still constrained jobs market, has kept them from extending themselves as they once would have.  To be sure, this caution on the part of households does guard against an over extension that might in time lead to a bust, but it also blocks a rise to that happy medium between excess and greater levels of economic activity.
Managements have remained reluctant to spend and expand in other ways as well.  The most telling sign here is how little their capital spending exceeds ongoing rates of depreciation.  In past recoveries, companies quickly increased spending on new equipment, premises, and intellectual capital, increasing it on average from barely over depreciation rates during the recession to almost 45 percent above such rates in the early stages of recovery and even higher later in the expansion.  But this time their caution has held them back so that new spending on equipment, premises, systems, and intellectual capital, even after years of albeit slow recovery, still barely exceeds depreciation rates by 20 percent, less than half the historic average.  Apart from directly holding down spending flows into the economy, this relatively timid behavior also limits future potentials for productive capabilities, productivity, hiring, and upgrading.
Sadly, there is little sign that the old "animal spirits" are likely to return quickly.  Time, no doubt, will erase the bad memories of 2008-09 and perhaps permit more aggressive behavior among business managers.  But as the evidence just presented indicates, it will likely take considerably longer before behavior changes substantively, and then the turn will likely occur only slowly.  Meanwhile, the uncertainties connected with Washington's ambitious legislation linger.  Regulators have yet to write, much less clarify, many of the rules connected with the Dodd-Frank financial legislation , leaving all in business and finance up in the air about costs, availability, even required procedures in getting credit.  There was some hope as 2014 approached that a full implementation of the Affordable Care Act would clarify its costs, benefits, and burdens.  But so much of the bill has been modified temporarily, some for indefinite periods, that the most oppressive uncertainties remain in place.  And all this offers ample reason to expect that this recovery will continue at an historically slow pace, if perhaps not quite as substandard as it has been his far.

Netanyahu: Attackers Should Consider Moving To West Bank Or GazaIsrael's Prime Minister Netanyahu Vows Harsh Response To Violence

By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday publicly challenged Israeli Arabs protesting against a deadly police shooting in one of their villages to go and live under Palestinian rule in the West Bank and Gaza.
Ahmed Tibi, a prominent Arab legislator, said the comments - some of the most biting Netanyahu has directed at the country's Arab minority - showed the right-wing Likud party leader had "gone off the rails."
Rock-throwing protests have erupted in several Arab communities in Israel since police on Saturday shot dead an Arab man who attacked their vehicle. Police are investigating allegations he was killed after walking away from the officers.
"To all those who are demonstrating and shouting their denunciation of Israel and support of a Palestinian state, I can say one simple thing: you are invited to move there - to the Palestinian Authority or to Gaza," Netanyahu said.
"I can promise you the State of Israel will not put any obstacles in your way," he told a meeting with Likud legislators.
Arabs make up about 20 percent of the Jewish state's eight million population.
Talks between Israel and the Palestinians, who seek their own state in the West Bank and Gaza, broke down in April, with the Palestinians angry at the continued building of Jewish settlements in occupied territory and Israel furious at attmepts to bring the Islamist group Hamas, which officially denies Israel's right to exist, into the Palestinian government.
Tibi accused Netanyahu, who has publicly pledged to explore the possibility of revoking the citizenship of Israelis who "call for Israel's destruction," of pandering to far-right potential challengers in Likud.
The party is to hold a leadership vote in January amid mounting speculation of a national election, due only in 2017, within months.
"These kinds of things have never been said by any prime minister - not by (Menachem) Begin, nor by (Yitzhak) Shamir," Tibi told Reuters, referring to the late nationalist leaders and pre-state underground chiefs.

B-Schools and Learnings From the Great Warreddit
Throughout 2014, the world will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. This anniversary will generate much thought about the war itself, as well as its causes, effects and implications for humanity. Just as there was much tumult among world powers in 1914, today's higher education landscape is rapidly changing, with many potential implications for business school strategies, outcomes and success.
There are four primary dimensions of World War I that can be translated as a note of caution to today's business school landscape:
1. Providing Outcomes in Demand
Governments had broad support around the time of the Great War -- as long as they provided outcomes demanded by their citizens. Similarly, business education has been enormously popular because of the implicit general belief that it provides good economic outcomes. However, as more schools have developed undergraduate and MBA degrees and the alumni pool has grown, it is inevitable that the economic value of business degrees will decline on average. Thus, as the cost of business education -- including opportunity costs -- continues to increase, average returns will decline and popularity may follow suit. In this environment, which appears to exist today, the B-schools that thrive will be those that continually adapt and provide students with in-demand business skills. The underlying lesson is that it is important to anticipate where the market is going, as well as to provide the outcomes it demands today.
2. (In)Effectiveness of Strategy
The strategies of both the Allied and Central powers in World War I were largely ineffective, leading to a stalemate that lasted from 1914 through 1918. Though each side employed new weapons and technologies, the effects were calamitous and ultimately unsuccessful, as neither side advanced and many died.
I frequently speak with students who wish to study and understand business strategy in order to prepare for the world of consulting and to develop the skills to be successful managers. They often underestimate the importance of knowing a business thoroughly and seek immediately to be in a position determining strategy. However, strategies regularly play out differently from intention -- especially when guided by little experience. To the extent that B-schools and business faculty increase their distance from the economy and industry, there will be greater variance in the success of their proposed strategies. Moreover, as long as B-school faculty focus much of their research on empirical analyses of the past, the disconnection with evolving markets will render research-generated studies inadequate. For this reason, B-schools should encourage research projects that combine data analysis and interactions with people. The lesson is that we must get out of the office to understand the relentlessly changing environment of business if we are to produce successful strategies.
3. Differentiation From the Crowd
Both the Allied and Central Powers implemented new technologies and weaponry, but their satisfaction with historic approaches contributed to the war's stalemate. It was, in due part, America's rapid adoption of new practices (automobiles, manufacturing methods, etc.) that reshaped the world economy and prosecuted the war to a conclusion. In today's higher education landscape, it seems every university aims to be the residential college of the future. However, as B-schools -- including the very top ranked and "best" schools -- show little discomfort with the order of things, we are vulnerable to disruption by new challengers. While I won't venture a guess as to whom these challengers will be or which will prevail, they will likely appear from sectors ignored or disrupted. And the winning solutions will be those preferred by the customers of business education -- not the providers. The lesson is to be comfortable at your peril.
4. The Importance of Forward Thinking
The armistice signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918 ensured that the German people would suffer as a result of the aggression inflicted by their leaders. However, there was neither forward thinking nor adequate contemplation of the choices that a suffering people would feel impelled to make. As a result, two decades later, Europe, Asia and the wider world were rocked by devastation on a larger scale in World War II.
Today's B-schools display less forethought than might be expected. An emphasis on generating revenue has created a situation in which some important outcomes -- e.g. the integrity of graduates or faculty -- receive little attention. Similarly, emphasis on lectures, theory and classroom learning, even when facilitated by technology, means the vast majority of business students have little experience creating results. Fortunately, some schools have recognized this disparity and in turn have made experience-based learning central to their mission. Client-based consulting projects, fellowships, cooperative education programs and case competitions are just a few examples of how students can gain practical hands-on business experience. The lesson is the need to build experience into education so students are prepared for their careers.
As we reflect on the centennial of the Great War's beginning, let's hope that the parallels noted above for business schools are resolved by the 100th anniversary of the war's end. There are many crucial lessons and areas of growth for B-schools and these key learnings will generate much good for the future economy and provide meaningful lessons for tomorrow's business students.

10 Steps To Fixing A Credit Report Error• Incorrect balance amounts
• Late payments you don't recognize
Mark these discrepancies clearly on your report and make copies of the pages on which they appear (for your records, and to send out when you file a dispute).
3. Write a Dispute Letter
As old-fashioned as it may seem, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission recommends writing a letter to dispute an error in your report, rather than submitting a claim online. The FTC even provides a free sample letter on its website.
4. Be Clear and Concise
Don't waste energy going into a sob story, throwing around angry words or trying to add in impressive legalese to make your letter seem more impressive. Simply state the error you're disputing and, in the simplest and more straightforward of terms, why you are disputing it. For instance, write "I was not late on this payment" or "I never opened a line of credit with this company."
5. Keep Each Dispute Separate
If you notice multiple errors in your report, write a separate dispute letter for each one. This may seem like tedious extra work, but it's the fastest way to get each mistake resolved. It's easier for the credit bureau to respond to individual disputes rather than a batch, and it's easier for you to track each resolution should any of the disputes become drawn out.
6. Include Backup
The more evidence you can provide to prove your case, the better. This includes copies of statements, checks you've sent, bank account statements that prove a payment cleared, etc. Attach a copy of every bit of documentation you have in your possession so the credit bureau can't dismiss your dispute on the grounds that you didn't provide enough information.
7. Keep Careful Records
A credit reporting agency can very easily claim they lost or never received your dispute letter -- or they could very easily actually lose or never receive it. Cover yourself by making copies of everything you send out and keeping detailed records of your correspondence -- when you sent it, when you followed up, what the response was, etc.
Not only will this keep the credit reporting agency honest; it could come in handy if you need to escalate the dispute, in order to prove that you did everything in your power to resolve the matter.
Should your dispute be successfully resolved, you'll still want to hang onto all correspondence in the event the error crops back up on a future report.
8. Mail It Out
Send each dispute letter via certified mail, return receipt requested, to both the credit reporting agency and the data furnisher (the lender or collection agency who provided the information on your report).
9. Be Persistent
Credit reporting agencies have 30 days to respond to your dispute letter from the date they receive it. Make a note on your calendar to follow up with them after that time if you haven't gotten a response.
Don't let errors on your credit report stand. Follow up regularly and consistently, and if you're not getting an answer (or your dispute is rejected), head to the next step.
10. Escalate If Necessary
If you're not getting a response or you're not able to fix an error on your report, it's time to take your complaint to the next level. Send another letter to the credit reporting agency and data furnisher and "cc" the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and your state attorney general (also by certified mail, return receipt requested).
If you still hit a dead end, you may need to take matters to court. You can find a consumer law attorney with experience handling credit disputes by asking your colleagues and friends for recommendations, visiting the National Association of Consumer Advocates' website, or asking your financial advisor or accountant if they can refer you to a trusted attorney.
Besides fixing an error on your credit report, there are several other ways to improve your score . Our credit score is very important and it's worth the time to give yours a check-up.

China and India are two major forces in process of formation of a multi-polar world: Chinese ambassador to IndiaPresident Xi Jinping concluded his historic and very successful state visit to India [in September].
Posted: November 11, 2014 12:03 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 12:14 am
Edited excerpts from a speech by the Chinese ambassador to India, Le Yucheng, at a roundtable discussion on Apec in New Delhi on November 4.
Apec is the largest, highest-ranking and most influential economic cooperation mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region. It is of great strategic significance in the world with 21 members, 40 per cent of the world’s population, 57 per cent of the total world economy and 46 per cent of the total global trade. Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the theme of 2014 Apec is “Shaping the future through Asia-Pacific partnership”.
Never before had the cooperation in Asia-Pacific been so full of hope and opportunities. Yet, never before have we had to deal with so many risks and challenges.
This year’s Apec meeting will focus on three priorities. One, advancing regional economic integration. Important items under this priority include promoting Asia-Pacific free trade area, supporting the multilateral trading system, advancing cooperation on global value chains and supply chains and strengthening capacity-building in trade and investment.
Two, promoting innovative development, economic reform and growth. The objective is to promote pragmatic cooperation around “the five pillars” of economic reform, new economy, innovative growth, inclusive support and urbanisation in order to leap over “the middle-income trap”, to bring green development and innovative growth, to build a blue economy and an internet economy, and to achieve urbanisation. Three, strengthening comprehensive connectivity and infrastructure development. Connectivity has three pillars: first, physical or hard connectivity, which includes transport, telecommunications, ICT and energy infrastructure; second, institutional or soft connectivity, which includes customs, supply chain, financial and regulatory coherence, structural reform, etc; third, people-to-people connectivity, which includes business mobility, labour and professional mobility, tourism facilitation, and transnational education. This year we have the mandate to develop the blueprint, which will address the achievements and challenges of connectivity in this region, as well as the key initiatives for enhanced Apec connectivity and strategies for implementation.
Asia-Pacific is the region where our home is. As a member of the Asia-Pacific big family, China sees the prosperity of the entire region as the foundation of its own wellbeing. I’d like to share with all of you our ideas about the common development in four key words all starting with the letter C, “the four Cs”.
The first word is “creative”. China’s reform and opening up over the past 30 years is a textbook example of creative thinking and large-scale innovation. Recently, Alibaba’s IPO success has become a household story. Alibaba might be the star at the moment, yet it is just one in the Milky Way of Chinese private enterprises that have made great achievements over many years. Other Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE have embraced competition at home and abroad and emerged as industry leaders.
The second word is “conducive”. Since its formation, the new Chinese government has introduced reforms to simplify the administrative approval system so as continued…

INVEST in Our Veterans and Our Energy Futurereddit
Each Veterans Day, our nation pauses to salute the service of our brave servicemen and women who fought for our nation, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice.
According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 1.8 million veterans call California home. Nearly 50,000 veterans live in the Congressional districts that we serve; it is an honor and privilege to represent them in Congress.
Thanks to strategic investments to create and preserve good-paying jobs, the national unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent. However, the unemployment rate for our nation's 9/11-era veterans is 7.2 percent. This is unacceptable.
As a nation, one of our most pressing priorities should be providing good-paying jobs for veterans.  As members of the Appropriations Committee, we have long fought to prioritize funds for our veterans because after fighting for our nation, no veterans should have to fight to find a good-paying job at home.
First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Dr. Jill Biden have been working together on such an initiative for many years and have had great success. But, we still must do more.
Congress needs to build on their actions by providing positive incentives for companies to hire veterans. We must provide opportunities for veterans to transition their military skill set into respected civilian competences.
That is why we have introduced a bill to take a small, but positive, step to promote good-paying job opportunities for our veterans. The INVEST -- Incentives for our Nation's Veterans in Energy Sustainability Technologies -- Act ( H.R. 5494 ) will help put our nation's veterans to work building our nation's sustainable energy future.
Our legislation would provide a tax credit reward to renewable energy sector companies that hire veterans. It is a simple step that will have profoundly positive implications for creating good-paying jobs for veterans and developing a sustainable energy grid, improving energy efficiency and developing new technologies.
We should INVEST in our veterans, advanced technologies and our sustainable energy future. This legislation would achieve all three goals making it a win-win-win.
During their service in our armed forces, our veterans gain expertise in advanced technologies, an expertise we can use in the civilian sector to build renewable energy infrastructure.
We are proud this legislation has earned the endorsement of American Legion and Veterans for Common Sense.
Additionally, scientists, business and military leaders and the American people agree that addressing environmental sustainability is critical for our economy and the future of our humanity.
For several decades, other nations have been making investments in the sustainability energy technologies that will power our future.  Tragically, the U.S. has not maintained a competitive edge in this industry sector. We are being outcompeted.
As these technologies begin to power a greater share of the global economy, the U.S. will become beholden to foreign companies that have developed and perfected these technologies.  We cannot allow this to happen.
Let's employ the ingenuity and expertise of our nation's veterans to build the world's sustainable energy future, right here in America.
Let's create good-paying jobs for veterans that are also good for the planet.
Let's help our veterans continue their fight to make the world a better and more secure place by providing jobs building a more sustainable future.
On Wednesday, Congress will return to session for four weeks. In that time, Congress could quickly pass the INVEST Act and help put our nation's veterans to work building our sustainable energy future.
Even though this is a "lame duck" session, we can still accomplish something to help our veterans, our economy and our environment.

Big Foods weird war over the meaning of mayonnaiseMayonnaise’s identity crisis goes to court. Courtesy of Hampton Creek.
A big-money war is brewing over the meaning of America’s best-selling condiment: mayonnaise.
The maker of Hellmann’s mayo, food giant Unilever, has  sued  the San Francisco start-up behind Just Mayo, an egg-less, mayonnaise-like sandwich spread giving Big Mayo a run for its money.
The global food giant argues that Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo is not, as Unilever lawyers wrote, “exactly, precisely, only and simply mayonnaise,” as defined by the dictionary and the Food and Drug Administration, which says  mayo must include “egg yolk-containing ingredients.”
The Just Mayo identity crisis, Unilever lawyers said, has hurt Hellmann’s market share, “caused consumer deception and serious, irreparable harm to Unilever” and the mayo industry as a whole. The firm wants Hampton Creek to stop calling it Just Mayo, yank the product off store shelves and pay Unilever damages worth three times the startup’s profits.
It is a strangely defensive stance for Unilever, a Big Food titan that made more than $64 billion last year selling foodstuffs in nearly 200 countries (including “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!”, a spread that is not butter). Hellmann’s, which is branded Best Foods west of the Rocky Mountains, dominates 45 percent of the mayo market, data from industry researcher Euromonitor shows.
But market watchers say it highlights the fears from traditional food conglomerates facing unexpected competition from crafty start-ups. It’s perhaps no coincidence that the biggest battleground is mayonnaise: Americans buy $2 billion  of the stuff every year — more even than ketchup, salsa or soy sauce.
“It’s not about using the (mayo) word,” said Michele Simon, a public health attorney who  wrote  about the suit. “It’s about the fact that this company is taking market share away. And now it’s like they’ve awakened the giant.”
That the plant-based Just Mayo is a new type of food will lend an interesting dimension to the legal proceedings: Brand disputes typically quibble over words, not the definition of the product itself.
But the very modern legal battle will be fought on regulatory territory that is decades old. The FDA’s definition of mayonnaise was set in  1957 , decades before the phrase “vegan mayo” ever made sense. (Maintaining that “standard of identity” is important: Kraft Foods’ Miracle Whip, which doesn’t meet the FDA’s standard, is technically a salad dressing.)
Unilever doesn’t just call out Just Mayo for what it calls confusing branding — advertisements have called the stuff “mayo,” and its logo resembles an egg — it also says the company has no proof in its claims of beating Hellmann’s in a taste test.
So what’s spooking Big Food? Hampton Creek has some big backers, including Bill Gates, and in a matter of months has spread rapidly to more than 20,000 Walmarts, Costcos and other stores across the country.
While other organic spreads like Vegenaise play up their place in the vegan niche, Hampton Creek has widely promoted Just Mayo as a mainstream brand: healthy, cheap and good for everybody. (Company ads rarely call it “vegan.”)
“We don’t market our product to tree-hugging liberals in San Francisco, even though I’m in the middle of nine of them right now,” said Josh Tetrick, Hampton Creek’s founder and chief executive. “We built the company to try to really penetrate the places where better-for-you food hasn’t gone before, and that means right in the condiment aisle of Walmart.”
The fate of Just Mayo, which swapped out eggs for Canadian yellow peas, will be watched closely by other food conglomerates. Hampton Creek also sells Just Cookies, a line of egg- and milk-free cookie dough, and is working on a gooey egg-free mix, Just Scramble.
The suit comes at a touchy time for Unilever, which just launched an ad campaign promoting itself as devoted to sustainability, and which backed its own soy-based egg alternative, Alleggra Foods, nearly ten years ago.
“Our concern here is not about innovation, it is about misleading labelling,” a Unilever spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “We simply wish to protect both consumers from being misled and also our brand.”
Just Mayo has fought back with the help of celebrity chefs including Andrew Zimmern, who launched a petition , “Stop Bullying Sustainable Food Companies,” that has more than 11,000 signers. The firm tweeted  Unilever’s chief executive’s own words against him (he called for “transformational innovation”) and was less than subtle on its Facebook  about its David-vs.-Goliath status (though the illustration has since been deleted):
Tetrick, the start-up’s chief executive, said his firm is looking at the lawsuit as a chance to not just expand their corporate profile, but to lift up their egg-free sandwich spread as the touchpoint for a larger food-based cultural movement.
“A lawsuit gives us the opportunity to talk about the things that matter,” he said. “So we’ll take it.”

SiX Could Be the Answer to ALECreddit
Politico has an interesting article up which details the efforts in the liberal political donor camp to come up with something to combat the influence of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC.  The new liberal counterpart will be named the State Innovation Exchange, or "SiX."  Creative capitalization seems to be their first innovation.
But I shouldn't get snarky about their branding, because the basic idea is a good one: counterbalance the impressive inroads Republicans have made in state legislatures.  ALEC has an excellent record of accomplishments, from getting laws passed (voter suppression and "Stand Your Ground" legislation, to name two ALEC issues) to providing support (read: campaign money) for state-level legislators.
ALEC has largely been operating in a liberal vacuum.  Their model is to take money from big businesses and then use it to not only help conservatives get elected at their state level but also provide them with ready-made boilerplate legislation for ALEC's pet issues after they do get elected.  Just fill in a few blanks (like "name of state") and an inexperienced lawmaker can easily create a bill ready to introduce into their state legislature.
From the Politico story:
SiX's goal is an ambitious one: to compete with a well-financed network of conservative groups -- including the American Legislative Exchange Council -- that for years have dominated state policy battles, advancing pro-business, anti-regulation bills in state after state.
SiX ultimately plans to raise as much as $10 million a year to boost progressive state lawmakers and their causes -- partly by drafting model legislation in state capitols to increase environmental protections, expand voting rights, and raise the minimum wage -- while also using bare-knuckle tactics like opposition research and video tracking to derail Republicans and their initiatives.
"Progressives are looking around to figure out where to go to push back, and there has not been a vehicle to do that at the state level -- it's the biggest missing piece in the progressive infrastructure," said Nick Rathod, a career Democratic operative who started and will run SiX.
Rathod is right.  It'll be interesting to see how successful he is in his attempts to build a liberal ALEC, but it's hard not to wish him well in the effort.  The idea has been tried a few times before in the last couple of years, but never with the level of funding Rathod hopes to get.  One of these previous attempts actually had a much better name, as branding goes: the American Legislative and Issue Campaign Exchange, which translates to "ALICE" (to counter ALEC).  But, again, I shouldn't get snarky, because the new organization will create one snappy moniker when it forms its own political action committee, to be known (of course) as "SiX PAC."  Now that's a pretty memorable name!
Democrats have been getting pretty thoroughly trounced at the state level, at least beyond blue-state bastions.  It's a basic fact that the United States Senate is still in play politically in each election -- but the House is pretty much guaranteed to remain Republican until 2022.  This is a direct result of Republican success at the state level, where they were able to gerrymander House districts during the 2010 redistricting process.  If Democrats have any hope at all of changing this underlying dynamic, it will have to involve taking over state governments before 2020.
Republicans weren't just big winners in the national Congress last week, they also did surprisingly well in picking up governorships and statehouses.  Democrats need to fight back at this level a lot better than they've been doing, and a national progressive group dedicated to helping win those fights could indeed make a difference.  Most of the successful union-busting and voter suppression efforts are currently coming out of statehouses, not Washington DC.  Progressives need to fight back to defend voting rights and the right to collectively bargain, but they also need to push their own issues forward as well.
Providing campaign help for state-level candidates, in the political world, is the equivalent of buying wholesale rather than retail.  It's cheaper for each individual item, but you've got to buy a lot of them.  State-level races are nowhere near as expensive as national races, but there are thousands of statehouse seats to consider, to put this somewhat more delicately.
Aside from helping good progressive candidates get elected, SiX can use ALEC's playbook once they are in office.  Drafting legislation is tough, so it's a lot easier to have a boilerplate bill to, say, increase ballot access to all.  Using boilerplate also allows for nationalizing the idea behind the law -- for instance, call such a bill the "Right To Vote Act" in the same way the "Stand Your Ground" label was used by ALEC to introduce almost-identical laws in multiple states.
Purists will argue against the idea, for various reasons.  The first comes from the decriers of money in politics, who will doubtlessly denounce SiX as just another way elections will be influenced by big-money donors.  This is, at heart, a politically suicidal case to make.  Sure, we can all denounce Citizens United until we're blue in the face, but the law is what it now is, and to ignore the way politics is currently being played is to lose -- lose winnable races, and lose on all your agenda items.  See: last Tuesday, for more detail.  Money in politics is not a good thing in the abstract, but it is a devastating thing for your side when all the money goes to the other guys.  Foregoing money for purist reasons is to disarm before the battle begins.  At least SiX will be making its donors public, something that ALEC never has done.
Others might argue that money is better spent on national elections, but this just perpetuates the problem of getting resoundingly beaten at the state level in election after election.  You've got to have a "farm team" of legislators to do the nuts-and-bolts state legislating that creates the atmosphere for national action by Congress.  Start in the easy states -- the ones Democrats still control, like California.  Push ideas like mandatory paid sick leave (something California has already passed) in other friendly Democratic states.  Then use the media buzz generated to push for the idea in red states, and at the national level.
ALEC has shown -- painfully, for progressives -- how successful their model can be in getting state laws passed.  We've seen a whole raft of laws from red states over the past few decades which have pushed conservative ideology hard.  Some might call the opposition's tactics evil or morally wrong, but this argument is misdirected.  ALEC uses boilerplate laws as a tool to achieve its goals.  You can disagree with the goals all you want, but you've got to at least admit that their method is working wonders for them.  The method itself isn't right or wrong, it is merely a tool.  A tool which can be used for other goals -- progressive ones.  The tool itself is neutral, and should only be measured by its success.
Which is why I'm hoping SiX can make a go of it at the state level.  National Democrats have been ignoring this layer of government for too long, and the citizens of the affected states have paid a heavy price for this neglect.  An organization dedicated to leveling the playing fields (all 50 of them) strikes me as a very good idea indeed.  It is far too early to predict how successful SiX can be at countering conservatives in the statehouses, but it's not too early to wish them all the success they can manage to achieve.  If they can make some solid gains by 2020, it could mean the difference between the possibility of Democrats ever retaking the House and resigning ourselves to Speaker Boehner for another decade.  That is a worthy goal, and one worth fighting for.
 

Election Results Indicate Huge Mandate for New Trade Pactsreddit
Apparently that is how the DC-insider crowd saw the elections last week. The elite media were filled with news and opinion pieces on how the election opened the door for the approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP). According to the purveyors of elite opinion, this is one of the key areas on which the Republicans in Congress and President Obama can agree.
That assessment is striking since few, if any, of the winning candidates in last week's election made a point of running on their support of these agreements. Nor did President Obama highlight his work on these pacts in his re-election campaign. In fact, the last thing most voters probably remember President Obama saying about trade was his pledge to renegotiate NAFTA when he was running for president the first time, back in 2008.
The turn of the leadership of both parties and the centers of elite opinion to these trade deals shows the incredible contempt they have for the general public and the political process. We just completed lengthy and expensive campaigns where they had ample opportunity to push the case for these deals. Instead we got panicky commercials highlighting everything from the Ebola threat to ISIS beheadings.
But in the view of our political leaders that stuff was just for the kids. Now that we have the election out of the way, the adults are prepared to return to real business.
Let's just be clear what these trade deals are about. They have nothing to do with "free trade," in spite of the fact that the media routinely use that term to help sell TPP and TTIP. The formal trade barriers in the form of tariffs and quotas are already very low. This means that the traditional argument of gains from trade does not apply. These pacts are about putting in place a set of pro-business rules and regulations that would never pass through the normal political process.
To start with the most egregious example, one of the main goals of the United States is to establish a system of special courts that would override the legal system in each country, including the United States. These investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunals would have the final say on most matters involving conflicts with foreign investors.
The rationale for a system of ISDS is that foreign investors may be wary about investing in a country without a tradition of an independent judiciary that can be trusted to treat them fairly. While this may be an arguable position in some cases, does anyone really think that German, Dutch, or U.S. courts can't be trusted to treat foreign investors fairly?
In addition to establishing this extra-legal structure, these deals would also limit the ability of national and state governments to impose environmental regulations, workplace safety regulations, food safety regulations, and Internet privacy regulations. It could also limit the ability to have labor regulations like a higher minimum wage or rules on paid sick days.
The pacts are also likely to include a number of protectionist measures that will raise costs and reduce trade and growth. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry is trying to increase the length and scope of government granted patent monopolies. This will mean more drugs like Sovaldi selling for $84,000 a treatment, when the generic version can be sold for a few hundred dollars. And, they want longer and stronger copyright protection so they can imprison people for sharing music and videos without permission.
TPP and TTIP are everything that people hate about Washington. They are deals being crafted in secret by business interests for business interests. They are never going to be subject to any serious political debate involving the public at large. And the leaders of both political parties are in cahoots on the trade deals and the route for pushing them through Congress.
Just to be clear, there are trade deals that could boost growth and benefit most of the public. We could eliminate licensing rules that make it difficult for foreign professionals like doctors and lawyers from practicing in the United States. Bringing the pay of our professionals down to levels in Europe and Canada would save consumers hundreds of billions of dollars a year and provide a real boost to growth. We can also have trade agreements that reduce rather increase patent protection, saving us hundreds of billions of dollars on prescription drugs and other items.
But that would be the structure of trade agreements negotiated in the public interest. That is not we see in the United States. We instead get the elite media and politicians shoving TPP and TTIP down our throats regardless of how people vote.

Hong Kong: Pro-democracy protesters face arrest  warn officialsA riot police officer swings his baton at a protester in Mong Kok district of Hong Kong. Source: AP
By: Associated Press | Hong Kong | Posted: November 11, 2014 10:48 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 10:59 am
Pro-democracy protesters who have been camped out on main streets in Hong Kong for more than six weeks face arrest after a court authorized police to help bailiffs clear them from occupation sites, a senior government official warned Tuesday.
Chief Secretary Carrie Lam said also there’s no room for further dialogue with the student-led protesters, whom she said had hardened their position, raising the prospect of further violence as the government struggles to end the mostly peaceful standoff.
Lam’s remarks came a day after Hong Kong’s High Court extended injunctions requiring protesters to leave two of the three protest sites while also authorizing bailiffs to seek police assistance to clear the areas.
Lam said that “the police will give full assistance, including making arrests where necessary,” to enforce the injunctions.
She urged protesters to “voluntarily and peacefully” leave the occupied areas so that roads and building entrances can be reopened.
The protesters have been occupying key thoroughfares since Sept. 28 to protest the Chinese central government’s requirement that candidates for inaugural 2017 elections for Hong Kong’s top leader be screened by a panel of Beijing-friendly elites.
On Monday, a judge extended interim restraining orders taken out three weeks ago by bus, minibus and taxi operators against protesters blocking streets in Hong Kong’s densely populated Mong Kok district. The owner of an office building adjacent to the main protest site surrounding city government headquarters in Admiralty district also had a restraining order extended.
Previous police attempts to clear protesters with force from occupied areas have backfired, drawing more demonstrators onto the streets and forcing authorities to back off.

HCC rallies over 12% as Lavasa gets Sebi nod to raise Rs 750 cr via IPO
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 09.35AM IST

Axis Capital Ltd
(HCC rose as much as 12.1%…)
MUMBAI: Shares of Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) today soared over 12 per cent after its realty arm Lavasa Corporation got a go-ahead from market regulator Sebi for raising Rs 750 crore through an IPO.
Lavasa had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in July this year for the proposed initial public offer (IPO).
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Reacting to the IPO go-ahead, HCC shares today rose to a high of Rs 38.25 in early morning trade, with a gain of 12.2 per cent from its previous close. It was trading at Rs 37.35 at the BSE in mid-day trade.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares of land in 'Lavasa' near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money through IPO.
In November 2010, Lavasa had got the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan at that time.
As per draft documents, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

Bus accident: 56 killed after passenger bus collides with truckPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Karachi | Posted: November 11, 2014 11:46 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:20 pm
At least 56 people, including 21 women and 18 children, were killed and several others injured today when a passenger bus collided with a truck in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province. The bus was headed to Karachi from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the north-west when it collided with the truck near Theri bypass in Sukkur district of Sindh.
At least 56 people were killed in the accident, Afzal Somoro, a police official, told PTI. The rescue team shifted the victims to hospitals of Sukkur and Khairpur districts where emergency was declared. A doctor from Khairpur hospital said that 21 women and 18 children were among the dead. Fifteen injured were also being treated in hospitals.
An initial probe shows that the bus driver’s carelessness caused the accident, police said. There were conflicting reports about the accident. Local media said that the driver of the bus was trying to overtake another vehicle and rammed into a truck coming from the opposite side.
However, a traffic police official said that the bus was about to take the road after getting fuel from a filling station when it hit a speeding truck. President Mamnoon Hussain and Sindh province governor Ishratul Ebad expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and ordered an inquiry into the incident.

Google signs 60-year  $ 1 billion NASA leaseapplied science
Google has signed a long-term lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics.
The giant Internet company will pay $ 1.16 billion in rent over 60 years for the property, which also includes a working air field, golf course and other buildings. The 1,000-acre (400-hectare) site is part of the former Moffett Field Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Peninsula.
Google plans to invest more than $200 million to refurbish the hangars and add other improvements, including a museum or educational facility that will showcase the history of Moffett and Silicon Valley, according to a NASA statement.
The agency said a Google subsidiary called Planetary Ventures LLC will use the hangars for “research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies.”
Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have a well-known interest in aviation and space. The company has recently acquired several smaller firms that are working on satellite technology and robotics. But a Google spokesperson declined to discuss specific plans for the property, which is located just a few miles (kilometers) from the company’s main campus in Mountain View.
NASA plans to continue operating its Ames Research Center on the former Navy site. Google will take over operations at the runways and hangars, including a massive structure that was built to house dirigible—style Navy airships in the 1930s.
NASA said the deal will save it USD 6.3 million in annual maintenance and operation costs.
Local officials praised Google’s promise to restore the historic structure known as Hangar One, which is a San Francisco Bay Area landmark.
Google already has a separate lease for another portion of the former air base, where it wants to build a second campus.

Black money will be key issue at G-20  says ModiComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said highlighting the importance of international cooperation against black money would be a “key issue” for him at the forthcoming G-20 Summit in Brisbane.

In his longest foreign tour after becoming PM, Modi will leave for Myanmar on Tuesday to take part in the India-ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit on November 12-13 followed by the G-20 meet in Brisbane on November 15-16 and a bilateral visit to Fiji Islands on November 19.
Modi will meet more than 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and the Pacific Region during his 10-day tour.
India will attempt to build consensus on a global framework for automatic sharing of information to check tax evasion during the G-20 Summit, at a time the government has stepped up efforts to bring back money stashed illegally abroad. Modi’s visit will be the bilateral visit to Australia by an Indian PM in 28 years.
“The G-20 Summit is a key forum for countries to coordinate their activities and pursue collective action to support global economic growth, stable financial markets and global trading regimes,” Modi said on the eve of his foreign tour.
He said he would also discuss how the creation of next generation infrastructure could be accelerated, including digital infrastructure.
He said a closer strategic partnership with Australia would support India’s economic goals, promote its security interests, including maritime security, and reinforce efforts to foster peace and stability in the extended continental and maritime neighbourhood.
On the Myanmar tour, Modi said ASEAN was at the core of India’s Act East Policy and the dream of an Asian century. “I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level,” the PM said.
At the East Asia Summit, the PM will discuss with other leaders ways to strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace and stability.
Modi will be the first Indian PM to visit Fiji in 33 years. “We owe them (Fiji) a debt of gratitude for hosting our scientists on the island in support of our Mars Mission.” He will meet leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations during the visit.

Slowing Profits Growth Offers Wake-Up Call For SensexGold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Mumbai/Bangalore: Indian corporate earnings are growing at the weakest pace in nearly six years, in a more sober reflection of the economy. Weakening corporate earnings growth highlight the continued need of Asia's third-largest economy for increased investment, lower interest rates and a slower rate of inflation, company executives said.
"We did assume at the beginning of the year that domestic conditions would improve post elections," said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of conglomerate Larsen & Toubro.
"It has, sentiment has improved, but the ground reality is still to change. I do think it will take a good six months for it (to) completely kick in. Hence, I want to be circumspect."
The median net profit growth of 102 Indian companies which have reported July-September earnings was 7.7 per cent, the lowest since October-December 2008, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data on companies tracked by at least one brokerage.
Median revenue growth at those companies - including cement maker ACC, financial services provider IDFC Ltd and mobile phone network operator Bharti Airtel Ltd was 10.5 per cent, the lowest in nearly five years.
Revenue growth is likely to slow even more in October-December to 10 per cent, but will pick up to 12.5 per cent in January-March in line with a general expectation for quicker economic growth and a reduction in central bank interest rates.
Even so, the country's biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India, last month said its auto sales growth would slow in the second half of the fiscal year ending March 31, cooling hope of an industry rebound after two years of declining sales.
"The situation of course is not as bright as many people hoped it would be at this point. We do not expect the growth in sales of Maruti will be as high a percentage (as) in the first half and this will slow down," said its chairman, R.C. Bhargava.

Beijing, Nov 11:  
The APEC Summit attended by 21 heads of states, including US President Barack Obama, began today with key issues like a free trade arrangement for the region to be discussed during the meeting.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting the 22nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ meeting at the Yanqi Lake International Convention Center in northern suburb of Beijing.
The meeting is being attended by 21 heads of state including US President Barrack Obama, his Russian counterpart Vladamir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of APEC, which has been the top-level and most representative cooperation mechanism that covers wide range of areas in the Asia-Pacific.
Four achievements
Xi said the meeting is expected to make four achievements, including the launch of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) process, issue a statement on the 25th anniversary of the APEC, promotion of innovation, reforms and growth to seek new momentum for long-term development of the Asia-Pacific and a blueprint to lay a solid foundation for all-round connectivity in the Asia-Pacific.
Xi also said China will donate $10 million for institutional development and capacity building of APEC.
India is not a member of APEC, a bloc largely comprised of the countries of the Pacific region.
New members on APEC?
It is to be seen whether APEC, which specialised in trade and commerce, would consider admitting new members as a ban in this regard had been lifted in 2010.
Image conscious China has spent billions of dollars to spruce up pollution ridden Beijing into a brand new city to bath in the autumn sun by creating a new smog free atmosphere for the conference.
Hundreds of factories in the city and vicinity have been closed down to ensure smog free weather in the city.
The 22nd summit of APEC is being held at Yanqi Lake, about 50 km north east of Beijing, where China has built a special conference centre, a waterfront boutique hotel and 12 VIP villas on an islet, besides the newly opened Sunrise Kempinski hotel nearby.
This is the largest event being hosted by China after the 2008 Olympics.
While not much is expected out of the summit due to the strategic rivalry between US, its allies and China, it has already achieved certain political breakthrough especially in ending a two-year long China-Japan spat over the disputed islands in the East China Sea.

South Korean ferry captain gets 36 years in prisonPrint
Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, on the bus, arrives for verdict and sentence session at Gwangju District Court in Gwangju, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. South Korean prosecutors on Monday, Oct. 27, 2014, demanded the death penalty for the captain of the ferry that sank in April, killing more than 300 people, and life sentences to three key crew members, a court official said.

By: Press Trust of India | Seoul | Posted: November 11, 2014 12:01 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 2:47 pm
A South Korean court on Tuesday handed a 36-year prison sentence to the captain of a sunken ferry, saying he was professionally negligent and abandoned his passengers during the disaster in April that killed more than 300 people. The chief engineer got 30 years, and 13 other crew members were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, Yonhap news agency and other South Korean media reported, citing the Gwangju District Court in southern South Korea.
Captain Lee Joon-seok and three other key crew members were earlier indicted by prosecutors on homicide and other charges. Eleven others faced less serious charges. Lee has apologized for abandoning the passengers, but said he didn’t know his action would lead to so many deaths.

The widely vilified Lee could have received a death sentence for the homicide charges. South Korea hasn’t executed anyone since late 1997, though its courts occasionally issue the punishment. Prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal, according to the court.
Court officials didn’t immediately answer calls seeking confirmation. The 15 crew members tasked with navigating the ferry Sewol have faced scathing public criticism because they escaped the sinking ship while many of their passengers were still trapped inside. A total of 476 people were aboard the ship and only 172 were rescued. Most of the dead were teenage students traveling to a resort island on a school trip.
Nearly seven months after the sinking, 295 bodies have been recovered but nine are still missing. South Korean officials said today they’ve ended searches for the missing because there was only a remote chance of finding more bodies while worries have grown over the safety of divers. Two civilian divers have died after falling unconscious during searches.

Five ways you can use the versatile vinegarlifestyle
Five ways you can use the versatile vinegar
From helping in making a refreshing drink to cleaning your vegetables -- as a versatile ingredient, vinegar can be used for multiple things. (Text: IANS)
Make a refreshing drink: Guzzling vinegar may sound like a recipe for a bellyache, but it's been prized as a revitalising, thirst-quenching ingredient since ancient Roman times. To make your own tart refresher, dilute one part drinking vinegar in four to five ounces of soda water and liquor.  (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Bake a sweet pie: Are you up for a slice of vinegar pie? This classic pioneer-era dessert contains its namesake ingredient, but the finished product is a sweet custard creation with a slight tang, encased in a golden, buttery crust. The beauty of this dessert, which dates back to the 1800s, is that you can whip up a satisfying sweet with little more than pantry staples. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Use up your herbs: Dry your extra herbs or make olive oil ice cubes with them, but you can also use them to dress up your vinegar. Start with fresh herbs that have been washed, patted dry and placed in a glass jar. Cover with a good-quality vinegar and let infuse in a cool, dark place for a minimum of one day and up to a week, until the desired flavour is achieved. Strain through cheesecloth into a clean jar and seal with a cork. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Poach a better egg: Hate those floaty streamers you get every time you try to poach an egg? Add a teaspoon or two of simple white vinegar to the poaching water. The vinegar helps the white set more quickly by lowering the pH of the water, reducing any pesky feathering. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Clean your produce: Produce is healthy. All the little microorganisms that live on it, not so much. Make a DIY (Do It Yourself) produce wash with natural disinfecting properties by mixing a cup of water, a cup of white vinegar, a tablespoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Briefly soak produce in the solution or spray it on, then rinse and rub your bounty under cold water and pat dry. Clean and green. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Obama seeks ban on Internet fast lane dealsUpdated: November 11, 2014 12:45 IST
Obama seeks ban on Internet ‘fast lane’ deals
PTI
AP Mr. Obama asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.
TOPICS
business (general)
Seeking an “explicit ban” on paid prioritisation on the web, US President Barack Obama has said that Internet service providers should not be allowed to cut deals with online services, so that no service is stuck in a “slow lane” without paying a fee.
The move, experts said, would ban companies from cutting deals for faster service. “No service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee,” Mr. Obama, who is travelling to China now, said in a Web video released by the White House. “That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth. So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritisation and any other restriction that has a similar effect,” Mr. Obama said.
Asserting that Internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all web traffic equally, Mr. Obama asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality. Mr. Obama said an “open Internet” is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratising influences the world has ever known, he argued.
“Net neutrality has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation — but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas.
“That is why today, I am asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality,” Mr. Obama said.
The President’s plan would reclassify consumer broadband services under what’s known as Title II of the Telecommunications Act, and would work to “ensure the network works for everyone — not just one or two companies,” the White House said.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Henry A Waxman describes this as a great day for the Internet.
“The President has called on the FCC to adopt the three cornerstones of a free and open Internet: no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritisation,” he said.
“The FCC should now move expeditiously to complete the rulemaking and establish the bright—line rules against blocking, throttling, and paid prioritisation that define a free and open Internet,” Mr. Waxman said.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Internet cannot belong to the wealthy and well-connected; it must be an open space for innovation, entrepreneurship, and communication — a level playing field where success is founded on the best ideas, not the deepest pockets.

Watch Bob Ross And His Afro Clean Paintbrushes Like A Bossreddit
The world loves Bob Ross so much, we'll watch him do just about anything with a paint brush. As long as he's gently cooing at us from beneath his globular afro, there's nothing good ol' Bob and his happy little trees can't do.
He might look like the world's creepiest uncle, painting the world's most epically conventional landscapes, but by golly! do we love a soothing "Joy of Painting" supercut. Bring on the 500-branch evergreens! The little snow-covered mountains! The perfectly toned glaciers! We have an insatiable appetite for your kitsch and carefully coiffed chest hair.
So, naturally, when we came across this three-and-half-minute collection of the "Joy of Painting" guru beating brushes, we couldn't help but pass on the love. Yes, he's just cleaning brushes, tirelessly, with his storied odorless thinner. But it's all we need.
We live vicariously through Ross' brief moments of anger, channeling our own frustration as he "beats the devil out of" his beloved tools. We watch with bated breath as he moves toward the beater rack, eager to pummel his crew with tiny droplets of paint. Are we scared? A little. Is our adrenaline pumping as vigorously as his poor paint brush? Absolutely.
"This is when the brush beater rack will save your marriage ," he once advised. He just likes to wash brushes, guys. Just let him wash the brushes.

US-led airstrikes target Islamic State leaders in IraqThe Pentagon said that US air strikes has helped to keep Islamic State militants from taking Kobani.
By: Associated Press | Baghdad | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:24 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:44 pm

Turkish-Syrian border, on Saturday. Source: Reuters
The U.S.-led coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, a senior U.S. defense official said Saturday.
The airstrikes on Friday night destroyed a convoy consisting of 10 Islamic state armed trucks, said the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe military operations.
He confirmed that coalition aircraft conducted a series of airstrikes “against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul,” using another acronym for the Islamic State group.
“We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,” he said. “We have no further information to provide regarding these strikes.”
The Islamic State group has proclaimed al-Baghdadi as caliph, or supreme leader, of the vast areas of territory in Iraq and Syria under its control and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.
Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.
Despite the airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, Sunni militants have continued to carrying out deadly bombings targeting Iraqi security forces and civilians.
A suicide truck bomber struck the convoy of a top Iraqi police officer killing eight people, including the ranking official, authorities said Saturday, in an attack that bore the hallmarks of militants from the Islamic State group.
The late Friday attack happened when the suicide attacker drove his bomb-laden truck into the convoy of police Lt. Gen. Faisal Malik al-Zamel, who was inspecting forces in the town of Beiji north of Baghdad, police said. The blast killed al-Zamel and seven other police officers, while wounding 15 people, hospital officials and police officers said.
Meanwhile on Saturday, a series of bombings in and around the capital Baghdad killed at least 43 people, with the deadliest blast hitting the city’s sprawling Shiite district of Sadr City, where a car bomb tore through a commercial area, killing 11 people and wounding 21.
There has been an uptick in the number of bombings blamed on Sunni militants in the capital and mostly targeting Shiites, feeding sectarian tensions in the city, as the security forces of the Shiite-led government battle the Sunni militants of continued…

Inflation Seen Cooling Further in October, May Not Budge RBI
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 12:58 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Bangalore: Indian inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India.
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October.
If the forecast is met, it will be even lower than September's 6.46 per cent and the slowest pace of price rises since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
It would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 per cent in October from September's 2.38 per cent, the Reuters poll showed. This data will be released on Friday.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 per cent of the CPI basket, and Capital Economics' India economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
"Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards," Shah said.
The poll also predicted industrial production to have increased a meager 0.6 per cent in September, albeit better than August's 0.4 per cent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply Asia's third-largest economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth.
"Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect," Shah said.
He said the RBI could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the RBI may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
"These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation - a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
"But the RBI is unlikely to oblige."
It will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March, after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the RBI to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 per cent well into next year, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

GOTHAM TV RECAP (Ep. 8): The First Rule of Fight Club: Dont talk about secrets with the Penguin“GOTHAM”: Richard Sionis (guest star Todd Stashwick) runs a deadly fight club for candidates applying to work at his financial firm in an episode titled “The Mask.” (photo: Jessica Miglio/FOX
 
THIS WEEK on Fox’s “Gotham,” Bruce Wayne throws his first punch, Jim Gordon starts getting some much-needed (and -earned) respect in the GCPD — and the economy in Gotham is so bad, people are joining an office “fight club” to land a job.
It’s this week’s weekly mystery, which will surely be solved by the end of the episode.
We know these weekly mysteries on “Gotham” don’t go very far, and are normally solved by 9 p.m. each Monday. This week is no different. There is one MAJOR mystery to this show: Who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents? Not only do we still don’t know — it remains to be seen whether that particular mystery will linger into future seasons. This week, we have an interoffice fight club, with participants willing to take lives to get a job. This episode starts off with a fight full of printer toner and staples in an abandoned office. A business-dressed dead body ends up on the streets of Gotham. And Bullock and Gordon are on the case.
Here are Comic Riffs’ 12 Takeaways from the episode titled “The Mask”:
1. A chat among frenemies
Fish and Oswald are having a mob-chat. Oswald has brought a gift to Fish to show he meant no harm by not dying — as he was supposed to when Fish put out a hit on him. Last week, Falcone made it clear that Penguin was off limits and not to be harmed. This is still eating at Fish as she looks at Oswald with disgust. Fish and Oswald are going over the terms of Falcone’s “peace treaty” that is intended to divide the crime-pie fairly among Fish, Maroni and Falcone. The biggest reminder Oswald brings is that no blood is to be spilled. But Fish tells Oswald maybe there will be a few drops of blood. She takes the gift Oswald originally brought to her (which was meant to be pinned on her dress) and stabs Oswald in the hand with it. Oswald is in pain, but not surprised. He used to work for Fish, after all. When Oswald’s Maroni-sponsored goons prepare to defend their guy, Oswald uses his hand that hasn’t been stabbed to wave them off. Deep down, he knew he had that coming; maybe he even deserved it. But Oswald plans on keeping the peace. Let us also not forget that though Oswald appears to be the property of Maroni, Falcone and Oswald have a secret pact — a pact that has Falcone two steps ahead of Fish and Maroni.
2. Back to school
Although it would have been easy to presume that young Bruce Wayne (who, up to this point, we’ve seen primarily studying case files of his parents’ murders at Wayne Manor) would just be home-schooled by Alfred, it turns out the time has come for young Master Wayne to return to school. Bruce is not eager to go back — but not for reasons that young kids usually don’t want to go to school. Bruce wants to get back to his detective work, and school will just get in the way of that. But Alfred can teach him the basics, right? Bruce suggests home-schooling to Alfred; Alfred says that Bruce needs to be around kids his own age. Speaking of kids his own age, Bruce is approached by a bullyish-looking kid. The kid starts asking weird questions — he wants to know what it was like for Bruce to see his parents killed, and wants to know whether he saw blood and guts. You get the feeling this kid has envisioned the death of his own parents. The kid’s name? Tommy. Tommy? As in Bruce’s childhood friend Tommy Elliot? The boy who will grow up to be Hush, a major Bat-bad guy. It is indeed Tommy. But what we want to know is: How will this play out? Everything in “Gotham” isn’t going to be loyal to the comic-book pages. And it shouldn’t be. In the comics, Bruce and Tommy had an odd, but strong friendship into adulthood before Tommy turned into one of his greatest foes. Tommy looks pretty bad here to begin with. Will he stay that way?
3. A doctor’s visit and more GCPD drama
Gordon and Bullock are on the trail of whoever it was that left a well-dressed body in the streets. Bullock takes Gordon to an “underground” surgeon — a guy who operates on folks who get into things that need to stay off the books and out of hospital records. Bullock and Gordon want to know whether the “doc” has seen any guys with a missing thumb. (Nygma found a chewed-off thumb in the victim’s mouth.) The doc isn’t talking. Bullock is threatening to shut things down; he lets the doc run his “operation” on the low, keeping him out of trouble. Gordon decides to shut things down when he sees that the clothes of the doc’s patient have the same kind of ink (it ends up being printer toner) that the victim has. Gordon brings in the bad doc. Detective Alvarez (J.W. Cortes) is furious that Gordon brought in the doc. Alvarez says that the doc is under his protection because he squeals frequently and therefore shouldn’t have been brought in to the GCPD. Gordon tells Alvarez where he can go, more or less (nowhere nice), and his isolation with everyone on the police force continues.
4. Honeymoon over before it begins?
Jim heads home after bringing in the bad doc. Barbara is there and is not doing well. She’s recovering from being a kidnapping victim of Falcone and Victor Zsasz’s. She’s been drinking and is walking around her apartment with Jim’s spare gun. When Jim enters, she almost shoots him. Jim tries to convince Barbara that everything will be alright. When she wakes up the next morning, Barbara apologizes to Jim, but it’s not as if he can scold her — she was KIDNAPPED by mobsters. Barbara tells Jim that she wanted into his life and that this is just a part of it she’ll have to get used to. She promises to try harder, but tells Jim to leave his spare gun anyway. After a nice make-up between Jim and Barbara, it seems as if things are getting worse before they can get better between the two.
5. Death becomes him: Nygma in the morgue
Nygma is preparing to examine the dead body found at the beginning of this episode. He seems beyond comfortable in this environment, and seems to take joy in the possibility of finding clues that can help out the case. Really though, he’s probably just thinking of everything as one big riddle. And we know how much Eddie loves riddles. There’s only one problem: He’s not supposed to be in the morgue. The real morgue guy chews out Eddie for once again hanging around the dead bodies (clearly not the first time) and tells Nygma to get out — but not before Nygma discovers a clue that will help Gordon and Bullock solve the case.
6. Checking for the mole
Remember Fish’s secret weapon? The failed singer-turned-seductress/house cleaner/creepy mother-like figure? The one who is now working undercover for Fish while doing – well, we don’t know what exactly her relationship with Falcone is, or if her ruse is working. Fish’s undercover agent wants out. Fish won’t have it and goes so far as to make up a story about losing her mother to one of Falcone’s men to keep her young spy motivated. It works. For now. What we still DON’T know is whether Falcone (who is aware of Fish’s desire to take him down and is secretly working with Penguin and having him spy on Maroni) knows about Fish’s spy. Does he really have feelings for Fish’s secret weapon, or is he just using her as another pawn on his board. One thing is for sure: If Falcone is in on Fish’s secret weapon, Fish has lost the battle before it begins.
7. If you can land a jab, you can land a job
Gordon and Bullock arrive at an office where every employee is bruised, battered and defeated — not mentally, but physically. Looks as if they’ve found their secret, corporate fight club. And the place is run by a guy named Richard Sionis (Todd Stashwick), who seems to have a thing for masks. Especially the black mask he wears when he’s forcing his employees to bash each other’s heads in, with the promise of promotion to the victors. And just like that, another Bat-villain from the comics pops up: the Black Mask. A little more corporately professional and less gangster than in the comics, but the Black Mask nonetheless.
Given this evidence of employee fighting written all over the faces of every black-eyed worker, Gordon tells Sionis that it’s time to come clean. Sionis tells him to prove it and looks to welcome a potential confrontation (he’s clearly into fighting, after all). Sionis says he can tell that Gordon has been in combat before; he seems to admire the fact that he’s had to kill to survive. He says to Gordon that true killers are easy to spot. Gordon looks Sionis dead in the eye and says, “Yes, they are.” Gordon has had enough games and grabs Sionis by the neck. He wants to know whether Sionis is in on the murders. Sionis says there’s no proof. Gordon and Bullock have to go. Bullock gets in his weekly zing by telling Sionis that he’d give him a good-cop routine, but it’s not in his toolkit. This is a great scene that completely overshadows the fact that Gordon finds the thumbless guy they’re looking for when he follows a trail of blood into a bathroom (literally everyone in this place is bleeding). Black Mask needs some human resources.
8. Hush your mouth: The punch that started it all
Tommy (although the kid is so clearly not nice, we might as well call him Hush, Hushy, Hush Puppy — something) is still pestering Bruce at school, now asking Bruce questions about his dead mother. Bruce smacks Tommy and tells him never to mention his mother again. When Alfred picks up Bruce from school, Bruce is bruised from a fight. Alfred demands to know what happened, and when Bruce tells him, well, Alfred doesn’t take him to the principal’s office, that’s for sure. Instead, Alfred drives him to Tommy’s house, hands Bruce an old watch worn by his father and points to the door where Tommy lives. Bruce knocks on the door, and — when Tommy answers — Bruce delivers a right cross, with his father’s watch serving as brass knuckles. Tommy looks at Bruce as if he’s crazy. Alfred comes to break things up, but not before reminding Tommy that he was the one who allowed Bruce to pound his face in. Only two things can happen here: Either Tommy will apologize in a future episode and they’ll build an awkward friendship (like in the comics), or Tommy will be a soon-to-be Bat-villain and constant rival to Bruce for the rest of this series.
9. If Gordon goes missing, does anybody care?
Gordon finds Black Mask’s corporate arena — and falls right into a trap. The Black Mask sends three goons to take down Gordon. Meanwhile at the GCPD, Bullock notices that Gordon has been gone too long (basically by now, if Gordon doesn’t answer his cell by the first ring, he’s been kidnapped). No one at GCPD wants to help Bullock look at potential addresses where Gordon could be held captive. So Bullock decides to shout to the heavens that the entire GCPD is full of crap and that whatever anyone thinks of Jim Gordon, he’s one of them and needs help. Captain Essen leads the way by volunteering to help, knowing that when everyone on the force sees her involved, others will follow — and they do. Soon, everyone is helping Bullock. Essen leads the way to rescue Gordon from the Black Mask, but not before Gordon almost kills him, almost returning to being the man who had to take lives to survive on the battlefield — but instead, Gordon doesn’t kill. He’s a good cop, and he’ll take the Black Mask in the right way. Slowly but surely, an alliance among Captain Essen, Bullock and Gordon is forming. Essen apologized to Gordon for not being there for him when he fought Victor Zsasz — she’s clearly trying to show that she won’t leave Gordon hanging ever again.
10. Penguin gets his info
Penguin gets ahold of the man who now has Penguin’s old job with Fish. He has his goons rough the guy up before demanding info. Penguin specializes in secrets. He knows that Fish has one that he doesn’t know, and he wants it now. Fish’s man won’t talk, but after Penguin hangs him upside-down after more roughing-up, Fish’s goon reveals to Penguin that Fish might have a person on the inside of Falcone’s crew. Oswald is pleased — this is info he can use (and we know he will). He orders Fish’s goon to be disposed of so that no one finds him. There’s a truce between gangs in Gotham. No blood can (appear to) be shed.
11 A quick catnip: Barbara’s outta here?
Selina makes a brief appearance. She’s stealing furs and is caught by the GCPD. We know what happens whenever she’s arrested. She demands to speak to Gordon. Gordon was on his way to see Barbara (whom he hung up on earlier while chasing down the Black Mask case). Gordon is frustrated, but agrees to see Selina. Meanwhile, Barbara is frustrated and walks out the door, leaving Jim what looks like a “Dear John” note. This seems a little forced, considering they just made up. And we all know Montoya (Barbara’s former girlfriend) is still out there, although she’s an ally of Jim’s now, so who knows where this is going? If you read the comics, you know that Jim doesn’t have the best luck with relationships. But they have to at least conceive Batgirl first, right?
12. Teach me to fight
Bruce tells Alfred that he enjoyed hurting Tommy and that he doesn’t know what to do with anger that constantly consumes him. He asks Alfred to teach him how to fight. Alfred, without hesitation, says yes. Looks as if Bruce will have a jab to go along with that right cross in no time.

CPI inflation likely fell to 5.80% y-o-y for OctoberCPI-based inflation likely fell to 5.80 per cent for October, shows poll

The country's inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 per cent of the CPI (Consumer Price Index) basket, and Capital Economics' economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
"Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards," Shah said.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 per cent in October from September's figure of 2.38 per cent, the Reuters poll showed.
Official government data for inflation will be released on Friday.
If the inflation forecast is met, it will be even lower than September's figure of 6.46 per cent and the slowest pace of price rise since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
Meeting the forecast would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
The poll also predicted that industrial production increased by a meager 0.6 per cent in September, albeit better than the August-figure of 0.4 per cent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply the domestic economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth .
"Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect," Shah said.
The economist said the central bank could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the Reserve Bank may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
"These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation - a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
"But the RBI is unlikely to oblige."
The country's apex bank will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March,2015 , after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the country's central bank to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 per cent well into 2015, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

Former Union Minister G.K. Vasan, who broke away from the Congress along with his supporters, will launch his party at a public meeting in Tiruchi on November 28.
Addressing a meeting of women functionaries of his break-away faction at a function in Chennai, Mr. Vasan said the ideology and policies of the new party, seen as a regional variant of the Congress, would be revealed at the Tiruchi conference.
Promising positions of power to the women in his party, he said that they should be prepared to be part of the agitations proposed to be launched to highlight public issues two months after the floating of the party.
A trendsetter
The aspirations of women, youth and students would also be fulfilled, he said claiming that his party would be a trendsetter and would draw the attention of the entire country and not just Tamil Nadu. The cadre were enthusiastic about the launch throughout the State, Mr. Vasan said.
Former TNCC president B.S. Gnanadesikan said the Congress was continuing with the “blame game” now at the national level. Unwilling to criticise the parent party, he said the national party was yet to do a “course correction.”

Harsh Vardhan likely to be BJPs face in Delhi pollsEYE BROWSE
Harsh Vardhan likely to be BJP’s face in Delhi polls
The move means that a bigger responsibility is likely to be handed over to the ENT surgeon ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.
By Neetu Chandra Sharma | Mail Today –  Tue 11 Nov, 2014

NEW DELHI: A surprise element of the expansion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council of ministers was the moving out of Dr. Harsh Vardhan from the Health Ministry, a move that immediately triggered speculation that he could be projected as the BJP’s face for upcoming assembly polls in Delhi.
Harsh Vardhan was replaced in the Health Ministry by senior BJP leader J P Nadda and he was given the relatively low profile job of handling the Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Ministries.
The move, sources in the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) said, meant that a “bigger responsibility” would be handed over to the ENT surgeon ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections likely to be held early next year. Some sources claimed he could even be projected as the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate.
There was speculation that the downgrading of Harsh Vardhan's portfolio would give him ample time for bigger responsibilities. “Harsh Vardhan was running the Health Ministry well but he is seen as an important candidate in the upcoming Delhi elections. He may be given responsibilities for the elections. He is a very good candidate for the post of chief minister,” a BJP source said.
“In the last election, we didn’t form the government because we didn’t get a major chunk of votes. Considering the situation in Delhi, Harsh Vardhan may prove to be a great face for the BJP,” the source added.
Asked about his opinion on the matter on Monday, Harsh Vardhan said, “If people have questions regarding my new role, they are welcome. I don’t have anything to say regarding other issues. I only have to say that I will perform my duties loyally in my new role."
“I am proud to get a key portfolio for implementing the PM’s policies and vision. I will get research done on a better prediction model for the monsoons and weather and all other activities will be done in mission mode,” he added.
Harsh Vardhan represents Chandni Chowk constituency in the Lok Sabha. He was earlier an MLA representing Krishna Nagar in the Delhi assembly since 1993. Adding to his profile is his achievement of overseeing the successful pilot project of the Pulse Polio Programme as a state Minister of Health in 1994.
This involved the mass immunisation of a million children up to the age of three in Delhi.

Air India to lease five Airbus A320s from Chinese firmEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Air India will lease five Airbus aircraft from China Aviation Leasing Group Holdings for 10-12 years as it looks to bump up the efficiency of its fleet, which has been struggling with engine problems of late. Notably, eight of its old aircraft have been grounded over the past few months.
A senior Air India official told FE the carrier will get five Airbus A320 CEO (current engine option) aircraft from the leasing company by February 2015.
According to industry sources, the airline will pay about $300,000 per aircraft per month as leasing fees.
“These aircraft will be used on the domestic routes on the all-economy configuration,” the Air India official said.
The national carrier, whose on-time performance (OTP) during September-October, fell below 80% on key routes in the domestic sector, and below 70% on some international routes, is looking to improve operational performance by introducing newer planes on some of the existing routes.
“At present we have very few new aircraft (with new engine). While the old aircraft are causing us some problems, we are gradually overcoming them,” Ravindra Dholakia, a member of Air India’s board, told FE on the sidelines of an aviation event on Saturday.
Air India currently has 108 aircraft in its fleet. The average fleet age of the airline’s aircraft stands at 9.2 years, the highest among competition. Other airlines like Jet Airways and IndiGo have an average fleet age of 5.3 years and 2.4 years, respectively. Aircraft owned and run by SpiceJet and GoAir have average fleet age of 4.2 years and 3.2 years, respectively.
Air India will also take the delivery of its 18th Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) on December 7, which is further expected
to improve operational efficiency.
In the recent past, AirAsia India and upcoming airline Vistara have announced plans to lease aircraft to spruce up their fleet size. While Vistara has announced that it will lease 20 A-320 aircraft from a leasing company, AirAsia India is expected to get six Airbus A-320 planes by the end of 2014. The Bangalore-headquartered airline will also add another 12-14 aircraft to its fleet in 2015-16 through lease.

Sun Pharma didnt have corrective plan to address issues behind recalls: USFDAEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Of the 23 observations raised by the US Food and Drug Administration during its inspection of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries’ Halol plant in Gujarat, one points out that the company did not have a formalised corrective action plan to address issues that caused recall of two of its drugs in January and July, 2014.
FE examined the 19-page Form 483, or an initial observation report, obtained from the USFDA. The details of the document were first analysed by Credit Suisse experts in a research report dated September 26.
Sun Pharma had recalled 2,528 bottles in January after a customer complained that the bottles, supposed to contain diabetes medication metformin hydrochloride, instead contained seizure pills, gabapentin. The company’s foreign subsidiary, Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, had initiated the recall.
In July, two batches, or 41,127 bottles, of depression drug venlafaxine hydrochloride were voluntarily recalled by Caraco after stability results found the product did not meet the drug release dissolution specifications — the rate at which the active ingredient is released from the dosage in the body did not meet the required standards.
The investigators noted in Form 483 that after the metformin recall, a document dated August 23 containing corrective actions was created, which documents the progress of corrective and preventive actions (CAPA). It said, “All the actions have been implemented hence this report shall be treated as final closure report for (the field alert report). However, complaint file shall remain open till recall is terminated.” However, the document seems to be invalidated by the following observation.
“The deputy manager of Quality Assurance confirmed that there is no ‘CAPA’ or formalised (corrective actions) for the above recall drug product,” the USFDA investigators noted in the Form 483. The exact sentence was repeated in the paragraph which analysed the corrective actions for venlafaxine.
When contacted, Sun Pharma declined to comment on a detailed questionnaire asking comments on various observations noted in Form 483.
The inspection of the injectable unit showed some disrepair, according to the document.
“Building used in manufacturing of a drug product is not maintained in a good state of repair. For example, on September 8, 2014 we observed water stains with ceiling damage and on September 12, 2014 we observed water leaks from the ceiling in the personnel corridor of the Parenteral Manufacturing Area (PMA),” the investigators noted. The PMA is the unit’s injectable production area, according to Credit Suisse.
An inspection of the solid dosage unit shows the operations did not include a challenge test for “foreign particles.” Further, the Form 483 said that Halol unit’s production officer explained that they do not document alarm events that occur during routine tablet compression production.
“The engineer officer and deputy general manager of quality assurance confirmed they do not review or evaluate the alarm conditions/events,” the investigators added.
The Halol facility was inspected for 12 days beginning September 8. The investigation was conducted by three investigators – Parul Patel, Daniel Roberts and Thomas Arista.
Credit Suisse pegs attributes 20-25% of Sun Pharma’s profits to Halol. The company posted a net profit of Rs 3,204 crore for FY2014, an increase of 7% over the previous fiscal.
The letter, dated September 19, was addressed to Vipul Doshi, executive vice president in charge of quality and regulatory affairs.
“There are no data integrity issues on the form; therefore, the chances of an import alert are low. However, there are several procedural issues where resolution could take time and until then, approvals could be blocked (impacting growth, as the fastest growing division is US sales from the Indian plants),” Credit Suisse analysts wrote.

Adani Power loss narrows to Rs 799 cr  revenue rises 36%Editorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Adani Power reported a narrower loss and higher revenue over the same quarter of the previous fiscal on account of greater power generation in the quarter ended September 30.
The company posted a loss of Rs 798.71 crore, compared with a loss of Rs 1,071.91 crore in Q2FY15. Net sales were
Rs 4,140.73 crore for the quarter, an increase of 36%.

“Our results reflect higher volume of power generation and improved operational efficiencies which were offset by the challenges in business that have led to PPAs becoming non-remunerative coupled with limited availability of domestic coal,” said Vneet Jaain, CEO, Adani Power.
Despite the strong results, the company did not meet analysts’ expectations of its bottomline. The Street estimated Adani Power to post a loss of 578 crore, according to an analyst polled by Bloomberg. Its Q2FY15 sales, however, surpassed expectations of Rs 3,920 crore.
The company sold 10.49 billion units during Q2FY15, an increase of 15.6% y-o-y. Fuel costs rose 21% y-o-y to Rs 2,506.02 crore. Finance costs, over the same period, jumped 42% to Rs 1,347.88 crore.
“Power sector revival is the top priority of the new government and this has been demonstrated through the various announcements made to implement radical measures which are heartening for the power sector at large,” Gautam Adani, chairman, Adani Power, said in a statement.

In Motown  despondency overtakes optimism after tepid festival seasonEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Car sales growth for FY15 is likely to be below 5% despite initial enthusiasm that the market will bounce back strongly after two years of sluggish sales, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Monday.
The industry body had previously given a more optimistic target of around 10% on the back of improving consumer sentiments and hopes of a sustained macroeconomic recovery after the Narendra Modi-led NDA government came to power at the Centre in May. The modest growth target comes on the back of disappointing passenger vehicle (PV) sales in October, a festival month that included both the auspicious Navratras and Diwali, when consumer spending usually increases.
Click here for graph
“We might see some revival in sales early next year, but the passenger vehicle segment and passenger cars are expected to grow at sub-5% this fiscal. Festival season has been subdued and unless we have some real economic growth, we might not see automobile sales going up,” said Siam deputy director-general Sugato Sen.
Volumes of PVs, which include cars, utility vehicles and vans, fell 7.5% in October after five straight months of growth while car and UV sales dropped 2.5% and 15%, respectively. Since May this year, PV sales had started recovering from their decade-low, posting some growth every month.
Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for light vehicle forecasting at IHS Automotive, said: “There was an inventory pile-up with car dealers till September. So, with lower production days in October because of sveral holidays, automakers were able to control stock in the pipeline.”
During the month, new launches helped market leader Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Honda record volume growth of 1% (97,069 units), 5.6% (38,010 units) and 18% (13,242 units). However, Mahindra and Tata Motors saw a drop of 20% (20,255 units) and 33% (13,665 units).
Two-wheelers sales also came as a surprise, posting their first drop in several months (down 3.6% to 14.61 lakh units). Scooters continued to do well with 11% growth (though lower than 20-30% of the previous months) while motorcycle sales fell 9%. Hero MotoCorp saw sales drop 10% to 5.50 lakh units while Honda saw flat sales. Bajaj also saw an 11% drop though TVS Motor saw an 18% jump in volumes.
The silver lining, however, was the medium and heavy truck segment, whose sales rose 25% to 17,866 units on the back of a pick-up in economic activity and lower diesel prices. India’s truck market, which has contracted by 40% in two years, is now making a comeback. However, light commercial vehicle sales fell 13% to 34,099 units, dragging CV sales 3% to 51,965 units.
During the month, Tata Motors CV sales were down 5% to 25,095 units while Ashok Leyland saw 26% growth.

1 bn tonne coal output by 2019  doable : Goyal1 bn tonne coal output target by 2019 'doable', says Piyush Goyal
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 15:23 IST
Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal.
Aiming to make India self- sufficient in coal , Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday said the target of doubling domestic production from the current 490 million tonnes level was "possible".
He even went a step further and said the country should make efforts to become an exporter of coal by drawing up a clear roadmap for the same.
"We have plans to ramp up coal production to a billion tonnes from its current level of 490 million tonnes (MT). It is clearly doable, it is not a fanciful target, they have 200 mines which have not yet opened up, technological innovations can make it possible," Goyal said.
Out of the total domestic coal production of 565 MT, Coal India produces 490 MT. This is targeted to be doubled to one billion tonnes annually by 2019. The state-run firm will invest Rs 5,000 crore to buy 250 rakes for transporting coal.
The Minister said India should not remain an importer of thermal coal for power plants but on the contrary should be in a position to supply to the world and increase its own power generation capacity significantly.
Goyal said this after meeting global investors where he assured them that the government will address their concerns.
"The investors have had serious concerns in the last 4-5 years like stalled projects, rupee depreciation and uncertain business environment," he said.
However, with the new government in place this has started to change. They are looking at India afresh and going forward the investments in the power sector are going to be quite large and investors both from within India and abroad can see good, robust policy which we are reassuring to all the investors, he added.

Senior officials line up for top jobs at smaller PSEs  mega firms lose outNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The queue to lead the insignificant and unlisted public sector companies is far bigger than those for listed and mega companies in India.
There are more senior management officials in the government and public sector firms who are keen to occupy the corner rooms of puny companies, preferably those which are unlisted ones than the ones which have greater visibility. Data maintained by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) show in the last one year they have selected about 30 chiefs of public sector companies as part of their ongoing recruitment of board-level professionals.
The PESB is tasked with the job of selecting all chairpersons and executive directors for public sector companies except those in the financial sector. These are mostly done through interviews and on occasions, written tests. As the chart shows the highest number of takers this year was for Scooters India, the Lucknow-based two-wheeler manufacturers. The race was so intense that 14 candidates made it to the interview board for a company whose total revenue was just Rs 175.56 crore in financial year 2013-14 (BSE data). At the same time for the giant Rs 25,269.51 crore MMTC only three candidates were shortlisted.
Almost equally intense was the race for Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India where the final list of candidates who appeared for interview was 13. For National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) the contenders were 11.
The picture reverses for the larger companies (by total revenue). For the interview for Coal India due this month, just eight candidates have made to the final shortlist. For CIL’s subsidiary, Eastern Coalfields, there were however 13 candidates in the fray for the top job.
Coal India is listed but none of its subsidiaries are. As India’s largest public sector company and the largest coal company worldwide too, it also throws up massive challenges for its chief. Life in the subsidiaries can obviously never be as challenging and ECL in any case has been the weakest among the seven subsidiaries of Coal India.
The draw is equally dismal for Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. The company is not listed but the government has already lined it up for disinvestment in this financial year. The limit for foreign direct investment in the defence sector has been raised to 49 per cent by the new government so competition would be intense around Hal. Still only five candidates were in the fray for the post of CMD of the company. PESB member and former department of economic affairs secretary R Gopalan said they were aware of the trend. “We are examining how to reverse the trend”.
In November, the PESB would select another five odd chiefs for PSEs and the drying up of pool of good quality people to pick up the challenging assignments is a cause for concern. Corporate governance specialist Kaushik Dutta who heads a Delhi-based corporate think tank, said “public sector chiefs are often hemmed in by multiple authorities. Decision making space is so claustrophobic that the best candidates avoid applying. The weaker candidates make a beeline for the less visible or challenging companies”. The results of weak selection are showing up. There are 277 public sector enterprises in India.
The total investment in these firms (paid up capital plus long-term loans) in them was Rs 8,50,599 crore as on March 31, 2013. The aggregate profit of these companies as a percentage of investment was less than the additional capital put into them in the same year.

Mr. Mayaram, who also had twin roles as both finance and economic affairs secretary, was appointed by the last UPA government.
Mr. Mehrishi is the senior most secretary among the four others who head Departments of Expenditure, Revenue, Financial Services and Disinvestment under the Finance Ministry.
As per norms, the senior most secretary in the Finance Ministry is appointed as the Finance Secretary.
The centre had last week effected major bureaucratic reshuffle and replaced Financial Services Secretary Gurdial Singh Sandhu with a 1981 batch Gujarat-cadre IAS officer Hasmukh Adhia.
At present, Shaktikanta Das and Ratan P Watal are secretaries of Departments of Revenue and Expenditure.

Data tariffs may fall 20 pct with Reliance Jio Infocomm entry; no tariff war: FitchThe entry of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm in the telecom space will intensify competition and may bring data tariffs down by at least 20 per cent, Fitch Ratings said today.
It, however, said no tariff wars are expected as witnessed during the 2009-2013 period.
“The likely entry of new telco Reliance Jio, which is a part of Reliance Industries Ltd in 1H15 will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20 per cent,” Fitch said in its 2015 outlook for Indian telecommunications services.
Reliance Industries had announced that it would launch commercial 4G telecom service of Reliance Jio in 2015 entailing investment of Rs 70,000 crore.
Fitch said Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents’ core voice business, given a weak “voice-over-LTE” technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India.
“We do not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs,” Fitch said.
Fitch expects the top four Indian telcos – Bharti Airtel Limited (Bharti; BBB-/Stable), Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications – to increase their revenue market share to around 83 per cent by 2015 from the current 79 per cent in the USD-30 billion industry.
“Industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos’ 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32-33 per cent (2014: 32 per cent) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs,” it said.
Fitch said the top four telcos will generate a minimal free cash flow (FCF) margin due to higher capex and flat EBITDA; the 2015 industry capex/revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investment.

Coal Minister Says 1 Billion Tonnes Output Target by 2019  DoableGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts

They are looking at India afresh and going forward the investments in the power sector are going to be quite large and investors both from within India and abroad can see good, robust policy which we are reassuring to all the investors, he added.

Sunken S. Korean ferry captain gets 36 years in prisonUpdated: November 11, 2014 15:54 IST
Sunken S. Korean ferry captain gets 36 years in prison

AP This October 27, 2014 photo shows Lee Joon-seok (left) captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, arriving at the Gwangju District Court in Gwangju, South Korea. He was handed a 36-year prison sentence for abandoning his passengers during the disaster in April that killed more than 300 people.
A South Korean court on Tuesday handed a 36-year prison sentence to the captain of a sunken ferry, saying he was professionally negligent and abandoned his passengers during the disaster in April that killed more than 300 people.
The chief engineer got 30 years, and 13 other crew members were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, Yonhap news agency and other South Korean media reported, citing the Gwangju District Court in southern South Korea.
Capt. Lee Joon—seok and three other key crew members were earlier indicted by prosecutors on homicide and other charges. Eleven others faced less serious charges.
Lee has apologized for abandoning the passengers, but said he didn’t know his action would lead to so many deaths.
The widely vilified Lee could have received a death sentence for the homicide charges. South Korea hasn’t executed anyone since late 1997, though its courts occasionally issue the punishment.
One week to appeal
Prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal, according to the court.
Court officials didn’t immediately answer calls seeking confirmation.
The 15 crew members tasked with navigating the ferry 'Sewol' have faced scathing public criticism because they escaped the sinking ship while many of their passengers were still trapped inside. A total of 476 people were aboard the ship and only 172 were rescued. Most of the dead were teenage students traveling to a resort island on a school trip.
Nearly seven months after the sinking, 295 bodies have been recovered but nine are still missing. South Korean officials said Tuesday they’ve ended searches for the missing because there was only a remote chance of finding more bodies while worries have grown over the safety of divers. Two civilian divers have died after falling unconscious during searches.
“As our loved ones remain trapped in the cold waters, this decision is unbearably painful for us. But we requested that the search operations be stopped” because of safety concerns, Min Dong—im, 36, the wife of a missing teacher, tearfully said at a televised news conference.
The Sewol’s sinking, one of the country’s deadliest disasters in decades, led to widespread national grief and soul—searching. Authorities blamed overloaded cargo, improper storage, untimely recuse efforts and corruption by the ship’s owners that prevented enough spending on safety, along with the crew members’ behavior.
Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers approved plans to disband the coast guard and transfer its responsibilities to other government agencies. The coast guard was criticized for unprofessional, slow rescue efforts. Also last week, three relatives of the ship’s billionaire owner were sentenced to up to three years in prison, about four months after the tycoon was found dead after he fled the law.
Prosecutors have accused the crew members of tacitly colluding to abandon the ship even though they knew that passengers would be trapped and killed after it sank. The defense in the trial has denied any collusion among the crew members, saying they were confused, injured and panicked.
Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn’t remember any evacuation order being given before they helped each other flee the vessel.
Lee has said he issued an evacuation order for passengers. But he initially told reporters days after his arrest that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for the passengers’ safety in the cold, swift waters.
South Korea has spent months debating public safety issues that critics say were largely ignored while the country rose to an Asian economic power in the decades after the 1950—53 Korean War. But there have been a series of smaller deadly accidents since the sinking. In mid—October, for instance, 16 people watching an outdoor pop concert fell 20 meters (60 feet) to their deaths when a ventilation grate they were standing on collapsed.

Welcome without warmth for Oz-beating Indian hockey teamIndian hockey has given us much joy recently, being the focal point of a flurry of chest-thumping on Facebook, Twitter. The appreciation, however, still might not be enough to bring the sport into the mainstream of public mind space.
 
Case in point: the lukewarm response Indian team skipper Sardar Singh and his boys received Tuesday at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi on their triumphant return from Australia.
 
After the Asian Games triumph over Pakistan, the team took down world champions Australia 3-1 in a 4-match series Down Under.
 
This stunning performance is being rightly talked up as the ideal preparation for Champions Trophy (December 6-14) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
 
But, why limit the joy to the insiders? Why not showcase our heroes when they return victorious. Why not let fans talk and know more about them? The women’s team scooped up a bronze in Incheon, why not talk about them? 
 
Sure, this volley of questions is jarring, but it could be necessary. One final question: most know their Kohlis from their Rainas, but how many of us can name five players who represent India in hockey?   
 
Australia is among the giants of hockey and beating them at home is no mean feat. This victory also comes after the drama over national coach Terry Walsh’s resignation, which he did not carry through.
 
Though there are reports of a ‘rousing reception’ for the team, here is what an Indian felt when he saw the team emerge from the airport.
 
"I was at the airport to receive a relative, when I saw the entire team walk out. I don't follow hockey much, but could identify Sardar Singh. It did not seem like the return of a champion team,” said Sahil Arora, a commerce student.
 
According to Arora, “It looked like a bunch of commoners, not heroes, arriving.”
 
Going berserk on social media is welcome, as is pouring accolades on the achievers, but it would truly help if these athletes get more than a Facebook post and a tweet for encouragement.
 
This team has qualified directly for the Rio Olympics in 2016 and is holding its own against stronger nations. Good times seem to be dawning for Indian hockey, so, why limit the accolades to the keyboard.

 Brent Oil Falls to $82  Hitting Four-Year Low SlowsOil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
Brent crude traded close to $82 per barrel on Tuesday after hitting a four-year low, as a firm dollar and robust production from U.S. shale oilfields outweighed a drop in Libyan output.
Brent for December fell $1.11 to $81.23 per barrel, its lowest since October 2010, and was around $82 by 4.15 p.m. US crude was down 20 cents at $77.20 per barrel.
The US dollar hit a seven-year high against the yen and was up 0.2 percent on the day against a basket of currencies.
A strong dollar suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities by making them more expensive for purchasers using other currencies.
"The path of least resistance is lower, until the OPEC meeting," said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale, in a research note.
Brent has fallen nearly 30 per cent since late June due to rising production, slowing global demand, and the absence of clear signals from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it will cut output at a Nov. 27 meeting.
Falling prices have had little impact on drilling in the United States, with output from the fastest-growing and largest shale fields showing no sign of slowing, the Energy Information Administration said.
A supply shock in Libya lent some support to prices, as a rival government that has seized the capital took control of the country's biggest oilfield, El Sharara.
El Sharara and the eastern oil port of Hariga, which was shut by protests on Saturday, remain closed.
Libya's output in the coming months will depend on whether that government can consolidate control over assets and avoid international sanctions, but most analysts believe production in 2015 will be significantly lower than the peak above 900,000 barrels a day, achieved in September.
There was no breakthrough in negotiations between Iran and Western powers after talks in Muscat, officials said, but talks continued on Tuesday. A deal could result in the lifting of Western sanctions, paving the way for increased Iranian oil exports.
JPMorgan slashed its 2015 Brent price forecast by $33 to $82 per barrel on Monday, citing supply pressures in the Atlantic Basin and the apparent inability of OPEC member states to work cohesively to restrain production.

Vodafone India loses its position to Italian unitSunny Sen      Follow @SunnySen    Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 17:24 IST

Vodafone India has lost its position in the Vodafone Group Plc. Till last year, it was the third largest contributor to the group's revenues. But now it has been replaced by Vodafone's Italian operations.
Thomas Reisten, CFO of Vodafone India, said the drop was due to the increase in stake in Vodafone Italy, which in turn has increased its revenue position. Also, the services revenue of Vodafone India does not include revenue from Indus Towers, an infrastructure joint venture between Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular .
Vodafone India registered a revenue of Rs 20,642 crore, up 11.7 per cent, in the first half of 2014/15. In the same period, its EBITDA grew by 11.9 per cent. Marten Pieters, Managing Director and CEO of Vodafone India, attributed the growth to increased investments and data growth. Data revenue grew by 65.5 per cent to Rs. 2,552 crore. The company's 3G customer base grew 204 per cent to 13.6 million subscribers.
Vodafone has also increased its capital expenditure by 116.3 per cent to Rs. 3,509 crore in the first half. Though the company has managed grow profitably in India, Pieters might have to review the company's speed of growth, given the drop in position. After all, Vittorio Colao, Group CEO, had said last year that India had the potential to be one of the top two contributors.

For Afghanistan veterans  the war will never endBy Thomas Gibbons-Neff November 11 Follow @Tmgneff

The U.S. military may have handed over Camps Leatherneck and Bastion in Helmand province but the war will never end for the veterans who served there, the author here writes. (AP Photo/Staff Sgt. John Jackson, Defense Department, US Marines)
America closed Camp Leatherneck the other day . The flag was lowered, the Marines looked on, and then, memories in hand, they left.
The sprawling desert outpost is empty now, waiting for its new Afghan tenants, or the Taliban or a dust storm that will consume it like a lost Egyptian city.
I read all about this on my phone, and as I scrolled through the article, my chest tightened and the world got a little blurry. “It can’t be over,” I said to no one in particular.
Was this how my grandfather felt when they signed the Armistice on the USS Missouri in 1945? How the world felt when Hitler died in his bunker?
Is this how my war ends?
The Islamic State is in the Middle East, and F/A-18s are still taking off from aircraft carriers and dropping bombs, and some people still want boots on the ground. The Endless War is marching on, but my Afghan War is ending with a whimper.
My war is over, I whisper, but that tightness in my chest remains. I want to believe it but can’t, because, I, like so many of my fellow Afghan veterans, know our war probably never will.
The Battle for Marjah never stopped. Garmsir district was never pacified. The Korengal Valley will always need just one more patrol. But even though the guns have yet to fall silent, Afghanistan has seen free elections and a surge in infrastructure developments. It’s not all bad, they say.
And yet in other ways the war will always linger for the people of Afghanistan, or for the thousands who fought there over the past 13 years. We’ll carry those sights and smells and the names of the dead that wave in our minds like blood-soaked bandages.
It is not how most of America feels. America wants its wars to end the same way we close our browser tabs — with one swift click.
The Treaty of Versailles, the embrace in Times Square and that lone helicopter on top of the Embassy in Saigon. They are snapshots of the end, pictures that could be printed and hung and admired. “I remember when,” they would say.
I remember when they closed Leatherneck. And I remember that last convoy in 2010 when Corporal Rodriguez mounted the passenger side of his MRAP, taking a few seconds to stare at the fields of poppy and cloudless sky, then muttering, “to hell with this place.”
I remember when I thought my war ended.

Marianne Murciano:  Tamron Hall took my jobMarianne Murciano: ‘Tamron Hall took my job’

Marianne Murciano
Fourteen years after she lost her morning news anchor job to Tamron Hall at Fox-owned WFLD-Channel 32,  Marianne Murciano is speaking out about it.
“Tamron Hall moved in and took my job while I was on maternity leave,” Murciano said Monday on the WGN AM 720 midday show she co-hosts with her husband, Bob Sirott. Murciano’s comments were prompted by a New York Post report about a behind-scenes power struggle on NBC’s “Today” show between Hall and Natalie Morales.
“I’m reading about all this and I’m thinking, wow, yeah, I can see how Natalie Morales must be feeling,” Murciano told listeners of the Tribune Media news/talk station.
Murciano and Sirott met and married during their seven-year run as co-anchors of “Fox Thing in the Morning.” After the birth of their daughter, Daniela Samantha, in May 2000, Murciano went on maternity leave, and Hall, then a 27-year-old relative newcomer, filled in for her alongside Sirott. When Murciano returned to Fox 32 six weeks later, she was reassigned to the noon newscast, where she worked out the remainder of her contract.
Tamron Hall
“It was kind of a shock that I went off to have a baby and that while I was on maternity leave, Tamron Hall was filling in for me, and then she became very close with management, which sounds like what’s happening now, and then suddenly she had my job. . . . Like I was never able even to come back and say ‘I’m leaving’ or anything. It was just done.”
Hall spent 10 years at Fox 32 before joining NBC News in 2007. Earlier this year she was promoted to co-host of the 9 a.m. hour of “Today.”
The New York Post reported Sunday that Morales had been passed over for several key roles and was “planning her next TV move because of the tense atmosphere behind the scenes” at “Today.” The Post’s Page Six column claimed Morales and Hall were locked in a “power struggle” with NBC News president Deborah Turness. “Today” executive producer Don Nash branded the story “total nonsense.”
Whatever the similarities, Murciano doesn’t seem to have any regrets: “It all worked out for the best because I’m glad I don’t have to wake up early in the morning anymore,” she said.

Vodafone India Apr-Sep quarter revenue up 12 pct at Rs 20 747 croreVodafone India today reported an 11.7 per cent growth in its revenue at Rs 20,746.9 crore for the April-September quarter of this fiscal on the back of data revenues, customer additions and stable pricing.
The company had reported a total revenue of Rs 18,571.1 crore in the same period last fiscal.
The data segment now contributes 13.5 per cent to service revenues of the company.
“We have delivered a healthy double digit revenue growth driven by strong customer additions and robust growth in data,” Vodafone India MD and CEO Marten Pieters said here.
The average revenue per minute for the company stood at 49.9 paisa and average revenue per user at Rs 200.
Vodafone has a network of over 1,24,000 sites.
The company made a capital expenditure of Rs 3,509.1 crore for H1 FY15.
Vodafone lifts outlook as new offerings boost demand
London: Vodafone, the world’s second-biggest mobile operator, nudged its full-year earnings forecast higher on Tuesday as improving demand in its big European markets and an investment push into new products helped reduce a drop in revenues.
Faced with increased competition from entertainment groups and fixed-line providers, Vodafone also said it plans to launch a broadband and TV service in its home market to compete with rivals who offer a wider range of products.
The news sent its shares up 4 percent in morning trade, making it one of the top gainers in the FTSE 100 Index.
“There is growing evidence of stabilisation in a number of our European markets,” said Chief Executive Vittorio Colao.
“Our two-year, 19 billion pound investment programme is well underway, and customers are beginning to see the benefits.”
Vodafone, traditionally a pure mobile player, has embarked on a programme to either build or buy fixed-line superfast broadband networks across Europe to enable it to compete with rivals offering mobile contracts alongside television, broadband or fixed-line deals.
Colao told reporters the group would launch a consumer broadband offering with a TV package in Britain supported by its Cable & Wireless fibre network which it currently offers to enterprise customers. It will also use the BT network for those areas where its own infrastructure is not present.
Analysts said the move into more services such as fixed-line telephony, TV and faster 4G mobile as part of the Project Spring network upgrade, had helped the overall results.
The update echoes Dutch rival KPN, which in October showed revenue and profit falling at a slower than expected pace as its strategy of investing in faster networks started to bear fruit.
“This solid set of numbers represents progress, and with only 6 percent of European customers on 4G and Project Spring barely begun, the moment that Vodafone can report positive service revenue growth has probably moved forward,” Citi analysts said.
Vodafone reported second-quarter organic service revenue, which strips out items like handset sales and currency movements, down 1.5 percent, compared with the near 4 or 5 percent falls it recorded in the last six quarters. It also beat the consensus expectation of a fall of 2.8 percent.
It now expects its full-year core earnings to be between 11.6 billion pounds and 11.9 billion pounds, compared with the previous guidance of 11.4 billion to 11.9 billion pounds.
It increased the interim dividend by 2 percent.

CM suspends four health officials
Eleven women died and 34 were reported critical on Tuesday after undergoing “faulty” sterilisation surgeries at a government-organised family planning camp in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh.
Eighty three women underwent the procedure in five hours at the free sterilisation camp, organised by the Bilaspur district health department on November 8, at the Nemichand Jain hospital.
“Around 60 women fell sick after the surgery and were admitted to different hospitals in Bilaspur,”said District Collector S.K. Pardeshi.
“I had two babies in the last three years and wanted to go in for family planning. I got to know the district administration had organised a free camp and I underwent the sterilisation surgery on Saturday. Twelve hours after the operation, I started vomiting,” Deepa Yadav, 22, said.
Sarojini Kewat (26), a mother of four, said she started vomiting a few hours after the surgery while Hemlata Suryavanshi (25), a mother of three, said she developed breathing problems.
Chief Minister Raman Singh visited the victims at Bilaspur hospitals and suspended four health officials, including Health Director Kamalpreet Singh and Bilaspur Chief Medical Officer Dr. S.C. Bhange.
Mr. Singh has ordered an inquiry, besides announcing a compensation of Rs. 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 each for those who fell ill after the surgery. Health and Family Welfare Minster Amar Agrawal, who represents Bilaspur in the Assembly, took “complete moral responsibility” but said that there was no question of resigning.

Unhygienic conditions led to deaths: Congress
The Congress lashed out at the Chhattisgarh government on Tuesday over the death of 11 women due to “faulty sterilisation” in Bilaspur district on November 8.
“Medicines past their expiry date were given to the patients and the surgeries were conducted in an extremely unhygienic place which led to the deaths. This is criminal negligence on the part of the government,” State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel told reporters in Bilaspur after visiting the victims at a hospital here.
Congress leader and Bilaspur Mayor Vani Rao alleged that more than 18 women have died but “the government is deliberately hiding the facts. They admitted patients to different hospitals to conceal the facts.”
Congress workers protested against the State government and demanded resignation of Chief Minister Raman Singh and Health Minister Amar Agrawal and lodged an FIR against the duo at a police station in Bilaspur. “How can they conduct 83 surgeries in five hours when each surgery takes at least 20 minutes?,” asked Mr. Baghel. District Collector S.K. Pardeshi denied the allegations and said the cause of death would be known only after post-mortem.

The rupee ended lower by 5 paise at 61.55 against the dollar due to fresh demand for the US currency from banks and importers amid a fall in crude prices.
There was a renewed dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners, in view of fall in crude oil prices, hitting the rupee value against the US currency, a forex dealer said.
Crude prices extended losses in Asia. The US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for December delivery fell 11 cents to $77.29, while Brent crude for December eased 22 cents to $82.12 in mid-morning trade.
The rupee resumed lower at 61.56 per dollar as against the Monday's closing level of 61.50 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market.
It dropped further to 61.64 before finishing at 61.55 per dollar, showing a loss of 5 paise or 0.08 per cent.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 355.30 crore Monday, according to provisional data from stock exchanges.

Obama  China s President Xi hold talks in BeijingBarack Obama, right, follows China's President Xi Jinping as they enter a room for a meeting after participating in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. (AP Photo)
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: November 11, 2014 6:33 pm
President Barack Obama opened two days of talks Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a sprawling garden compound next to the Forbidden City, telling the Chinese leader he wants to take the relationship “to a new level.”
“When the U.S. and China are able to work together effectively, the whole world benefits,” Obama said.
Obama said he hoped for productive, candid talks of the kind they held last year at the Sunnylands estate in California, where the two leaders aimed to forge a close personal bond during hours of meetings and a long stroll through its manicured gardens.
Xi, speaking through a translator, sought to portray their relationship as one that would only grow over time, drawing on a metaphor about how a pool begins with many drops of water.
Beams of red and blue lights lit up Zhong Nan Hai, the imperial gardens near Tiananmen Square that serve as the center of power for China’s government and the Communist Party of China. After Obama arrived in his motorcade, Xi greeted the American president on a chilly evening with a handshake and led him on a ceremonial walk over a brightly lit bridge, explaining the history of Zhong Nan Hai through a translator.
After the evening meeting with Obama, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, Xi hosted Obama for a private dinner.
The intimate evening set the stage for formal, in-depth talks that Obama and Xi were to hold on Wednesday. The meetings between the two leaders followed an Asia-Pacific economic summit, hosted by Xi, that Obama attended along with leaders from nearly two dozen other countries.

Sena steps up offensive  BJP hints at NCP support ahead of trust voteWith Shiv Sena carrying its confrontation with the BJP a step further on Tuesday , the Maharashtra  assembly will witness a triangular contest for the post of speaker.
     
Haribhau Bagde of BJP, Vijay Avti of Shiv Sena and Varsha Gaikwad of Congress have filed nominations for the post. The deadline for withdrawal is 10am Tuesday.
     
Principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said this is the first time the house is witnessing a three-way contest for the post.
     
In 2009, NCP's Dilip Walse-Patil had been elected unopposed after the opposition candidate Girish Bapat (BJP) withdrew his nomination.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today addressed a meeting of Sena legislators ahead of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government's trust vote tomorrow.
However, Uddhav left the venue without speaking to waiting reporters after the meeting which lasted for more than an hour.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party's MLAs have been asked to remain present at the Vidhan Bhawan at 9 am tomorrow.
     
The voting will start at 11am and will be through a secret ballot and not a show of hands or voice vote.
     
"If one of the candidates polls more votes than that polled together by the other two, the one with the highest votes gets elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and there is another round," Kalse said.
     
The result will be announced in the House itself.Of the total of 288 MLAs, 286 members have taken the oath in the last two days. BJP's Govind Rathod passed away sometime ago, while Surupsing Naik of Congress, who was not present in the last two days, is yet to take the oath.
    
Meanwhile, state Congress president Manikrao Thakre said he had spoken to his NCP counterpart Sunil Tatkare, seeking support for Gaikwad.
 
"NCP has said it will play the role of Opposition. They can support the government in the trust vote but we expect their support in the Speaker's election," he said.
    
Thakre said Tatkare assured him that the issue would be discussed and a decision would be taken.
BJP:  We welcome support of all parties except Congress
A day ahead of the trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly , the BJP said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
 
"The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is responsible for the mess, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
    
The remark by Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
   
"Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around," he said.
    
Asked about Sharad Pawar's NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
   
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of Geete resigning.
    
"Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government," he said.
   
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Fadnavis ready with Plan B
Maharashtra's new chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has been telling friends he has still not shifted his belongings to his official residence because he may have to go back to living in Mumbai's MLA hostel any day.
But if his body language is anything to go by, Fadnavis is more than confident of winning the majority on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday.
Sources close to Fadnavis said the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs — only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house — having pledged their support to his government, in case the Shiv Sena did not join.
In all, 121 MLAs from the BJP, one from the BJP’s ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers’ Party and three from other small parties will bolster the ruling party during the floor test, insiders said.
Although the BJP won 122 seats in the elections, it lost one after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26.
“Some may vote in favour and others may abstain or stay neutral,” said a senior BJP leader, who has been talking to these MLAs. He said some independents were offered ministerial berths in exchange for their support.
The BJP, however, might not need their support if the Nationalist Congress Party (41 MLAs) supports it from outside or the Sena, which has 63 legislators, joins the government. However, it will have to keep its options open in future because the NCP has decided to extend issue-based support and might pull the plug if something goes wrong.
Even the Sena can find a reason to call it quits, said a BJP leader. Fadnavis refused to comment on the possibilities.
“Everything will fall into place. Please wait till the trust vote,” he told HT.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, however, expressed optimism that the BJP government would not only win the floor test but also complete its full five-year term. “It is the Shiv Sena’s decision... we are not worried as many of their legislators have already assured us of support. There are sufficient MLAs (legislators) to help us secure a majority."
In response to the Sena’s demand on the NCP, the BJP maintained it had not asked the NCP for support and blamed the Sena for approaching NCP leaders in a bid to defeat the BJP during the trust vote.
The Sena has warned the BJP that it will sit in the Opposition if the latter accepts support from the Sharad Pawar-led party. 
Hopes of patch-up remain
The Sena may have taken its seats in the Opposition but party sources said it was still hoping for a last-minute turnaround before the trust vote.
A Shiv Sena MLA told Hindustan Times not to conclude anything before the floor test. "Things might move 180 degrees.This is Thackeray style," he said.
The Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for Leader of the Opposition post even as it continued talks with the BJP, with party chief Uddhav justifying the move as an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Congress.
"The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn't work? Then we won't get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader)," Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands --10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister -- to vote in favour of the trust vote. The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House, is 23 votes short of a majority.
A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.

Buy low. Sell high. That’s how you make money in stocks, right? Not so fast.
New research shows buying stocks when they’ve already soared – has been a pretty good way to make money. The strategy is called momentum investing. Pile into winning stocks – and ride the wave higher. “Buying high and selling higher” has been a strategy that’s worked during the past 20 years, says Sam Stovall of S&P Capital IQ.
Here’s the math. The S&P 500 has gained nearly 10% on average each year between 1991 and now. That’s the market’s return and what you get if you buy and hold the market. But investors who rode the best 10 sub-industries of the previous year – and repeated each year – scored a 15% average annual gain, Stovall finds. Winning stocks tend to keep winning – at least for the following year, Stovall says.
Following this strategy, what sectors should you buy now? Stovall lists 10 sectors with the momentum now. That includes airlines, aluminum, biotech, brewers and  distillers. But also home entertainment software, human resources, railroads, residential REITs and semiconductor.
Not everyone agrees with this high-octane strategy. Long-term academic research says that factors like size and valuation have more influence on future stock prices than past price movements. Many investors will be better off buying a diversified basket of stocks of different sizes and valuations — and holding on.
But when the market seems to be headed straight up – it’s hard to argue with momentum. Until it stops.

Alibaba s Ma: financial services IPO  definite   eyes China mainland listing0
Ma, speaking on the company's annual Singles' Day shopping festival , did not give a timeline for when the unit might list. Alibaba's Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said later in Hangzhou that Alibaba would look to list the entire Ant Financial Services Group on mainland exchanges at a future date. Alipay is one unit of Ant Financial.
Alipay is the lifeblood of Alibaba's e-commerce network and China's dominant online payment processor. Set up a decade ago, the service pioneered online payments in China and settled 4.825 trillion yuan ($788 billion) in transactions in the year ended June 30, 2014.
Foreign access to mainland stock markets remains curtailed and subject to quotas, but there are now a series of trial program in place that if expanded could allow significant foreign exposure to firms listed on mainland exchanges.
In October, Ant Financial Chief Executive Lucy Peng said there were no current plans for the company to hold an initial public offering of its own.
As part of an August agreement between Alibaba and Ant Financial, Alibaba shares 37.5 percent of the unit's profit or can in the future take a direct stake in it
The IPO must value Ant Financial at a minimum of $25 billion, according to the agreement, which is detailed in Alibaba's IPO prospectus.
Alibaba has been aggressively offering new financial services around Alipay, including a money market fund for consumers, a mobile payment app and even a new private bank that was approved by the Chinese government in September.
Alibaba controversially spun out Alipay in 2011, but its executives including executive chairman Jack Ma maintain control of the payment processor, considered by some analysts as one of the most valuable assets in the Alibaba universe due to its unique position in Chinese commerce.(1 US dollar = 6.1240 Chinese yuan)

Exclusive: Apple s enterprise assault gets into higher gear0
The iPhone maker has worked closely with a group of startups, including ServiceMax and PlanGrid, that already specialize in selling apps to corporate America. The two people familiar with the plans, but who could not speak publicly about them, say Apple is already in talks with other mobile enterprise developers to bring them into a more formal partnership.
PlanGrid is a mobile app for construction workers to share and view blueprints. ServiceMax is a mobile app that makes it easy for companies to manage fleets of field service technicians by ensuring they have access to the right information.
Apple has been sending dedicated sales teams to talk to chief information officers. At least one financial services corporation, Citigroup, has been in talks to sign on, one of the two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Another person familiar with the developer's plans told Reuters that ServiceMax, whose existing customers include Procter & Gamble and DuPont, has co-hosted eight dinners with Apple over the past year in locations across the United States. About 25 or 30 chief information officers and "chief service officers" typically show up at these joint marketing and sales events.
ServiceMax declined comment on what they were specifically working on with Apple. PlanGrid also declined comment.
But ServiceMax chief marketing officer, Stacey Epstein, said about 95 percent of its customers use Apple devices. Each new customer will typically order thousands of iPhones and iPads, she added.
"The field service market alone is a $15 billion market," said Epstein. "One of our accounts may have thousands of field service technicians. It's a huge market opportunity for Apple."
Apple declined to comment for this story.
'MESSY, STUPID' DEMANDS
Apple has mostly kept its plans under wraps since July, when it announced the deal with IBM. Their partnership has alternately been hailed as a dream alliance, or dismissed as an uncertain tie-up between two companies with very different philosophies.
Many American corporations already deploy tablets among their workforces, for purposes ranging from pharmaceutical sales to mobile accounting.
"From Apple's point of view the enterprise is really messy, oftentimes unreasonable or even stupid in its demands," said John Rymer, an analyst at Forrester. "They've never had a business model to deal with any of that. But they do want the penetration and they do want what market share they can get."
Its rivals harbor similar ambitions. A separate source familiar with the matter said Samsung is stepping up its efforts to sell devices to large enterprise clients. The company hired former chief information officer Robin Bienfait to spearhead that effort, and is on the hunt for acquisition opportunities, the person said. The source requested anonymity as they were involved in private conversations. 
Apple also needed help to penetrate corporations. It is relying on IBM's predictive software, enterprise-grade security and data analytics to set its upcoming suite of apps apart from rival offerings from Oracle and Microsoft, the two original sources said.
Personnel from IBM Global Technology Services, its outsourced IT division, will handle technical support for clients under the initiative, and the two companies also plan on setting up a dedicated 24-7 hotline, according to a recently updated Apple support website.
The iPhone maker may be trying to replicate the model that served the iPhone well: hook the client on the software and content, then keep them coming back for the hardware, which is what drives the lions' share of Apple's bottom line.
"It does make sense, but the devil's in the details," said Rymer at Forrester. "The apps have to work and be economic. Can they produce solutions that are meaningful to enough people and reduce the cost over the customers doing it themselves? We'll see."

Still plagued by accidentsUpdated: November 11, 2014 00:48 IST
Still plagued by accidents
accident (general)
The Indian Navy continues to be accident-prone — after a brief respite. Last week, an auxiliary ship sank off the Visakhapatnam coast . This tragedy claimed the life of one sailor while four personnel were deemed missing. This is the second incident in a fortnight after INS Kora, a missile corvette , was scraped by a merchant ship near Vizag and suffered minor damage. After the latest incident, the Navy is left with just one Torpedo Recovery Vessel. Since August 14 last year, when an onboard explosion sank INS Sindhurakshak, a Kilo-class submarine that was berthed in Mumbai, there have been 15 accidents. In fact, an accident on another submarine, INS Sindhuratna, on February 26 cost the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral D.K. Joshi, his job: he resigned owning moral responsibility . The resignation caused a major shuffle in the Navy’s top brass and the new chief, Admiral R.K. Dhowan , ordered a review of procedures and later stated that the causes of all the incidents had been thoroughly analysed. But the trend has not been arrested, and now it seems the lessons learnt were incomplete. The problem is across-the-board. Submarines, front-line warships and support ships alike have suffered accidents. This suggests systemic lapses, be it in maintenance, acquiring spares or non-adherence to standard operating procedures. Besides, it is essential to take note of Admiral Joshi’s recent comments about his inability to take routine maintenance and procurement decisions for his force. This hints at bureaucratic overreach and a crisis of confidence between the bureaucracy and the military.
It is paradoxical that a Navy that is operating about 180 ships and inducting large modern platforms is plagued by issues of maintenance and spares. In the global context, this does not bode well for a force aspiring to be a blue-water Navy and to establish itself as a net provider of security in the region. It is widely acknowledged that the Indian Navy is a pre-eminent force in the Indian Ocean region. And many navies in the region are looking to the Indian Navy for support and leadership. It comes as no surprise that of late naval diplomacy has become a major thrust area in New Delhi’s diplomatic outreach and the Navy has been extending training and maintenance support to many nations. A dubious safety record at home will raise serious apprehensions in the minds of other nations about the country’s credibility and capacity. Whatever the reasons, these incidents are unacceptable. Mere assurances of review and reorientation will not help maintain the Navy’s image as a professional force if such accidents keep happening. Precious lives, expensive platforms as well as the larger credibility of the Navy and the nation are at stake. It is time for some honest introspection and course-correction.

Death due to sterilisation nothing new in IndiaDeath due to sterilisation nothing new in India
Sourjya Bhowmick , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 11, 2014
First Published: 17:40 IST(11/11/2014) | Last Updated: 09:41 IST(12/11/2014)
Eight women died and twenty-five others are in critical condition after a botched mass sterilisation campaign organised by the state health ministry in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district.
 
Over 80 women were operated upon on Saturday as part of the annual family planning camp in the home district of state health minister Amar Agarwal.
 
After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital, where eight of them died since Monday. At least 64 other women are in various hospitals.
 
Chief minister Raman Singh said a three-member committee has been constituted to investigate the incident and promised stern action against those found guilty.
 
His government has also announced a compensation of Rs. 2 lakh for the family of those who died and promised Rs. 50,000 to those who are undergoing further treatment.
 
Deaths after sterilisation are not a new thing in India. Sterilisation deaths mostly occur due to the rigorous pursue of 'targets' that are assigned to health workers by state and district level health officials.
 
Many grassroots level health workers has gone on record and told Human Rights Watch they are assigned annual targets with special focus on female sterilisation. Superiors even coerce with threats to reduce salary, suspensions and dismissals.
 
Hindustan Times looks at the data from discussions that took place in the Parliament and finds that 1,434 deaths owing to sterilisation occurred between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths.
 
However, these are official numbers and in reality the numbers of deaths may be much higher.
 
The total deaths from 2003 to 2012 roughly translate into 12 deaths per month on an average in the last 10 years.
 
 
 The graph shows that Uttar Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, had the highest number of deaths following sterilisation.
 
Families of all those who die after such operations are not always compensated.
 
For example, 777 cases of compensation were paid for 942 deaths from 2007 to 2012, or a rate of 82%.
 
Significantly, medical lapses during sterilisation have led the central government to spend Rs. 68 crore as compensation under its family planning programme from 2003 to 2012.
 
Men and women take steps to prevent or delay pregnancy, often through surgical procedures. Family planning assumes importance because it reduces pregnancy related risks, minimises infant mortality rate, prevents HIV/AIDS and reduces adolescent pregnancies.
 
In India, such camps are held regularly across the country as part of a long-running effort to control its booming population.
 
According to the World Health Organization, around 222 million women in developing countries want to delay or stop childbearing but do not use any form of contraception.
 
The ministry of health and family welfare says men have an aversion to participating in sterilisation programmes due to fear of physical weakness, social stigma and impotency.
 
The ratio of men's participation was 5.3% out of total sterilisations that dwindled to 2.3% in December 2013.
 
Men in Delhi, Punjab and Assam lead in male participation in sterilisation while states like Bihar, Gujarat and Karnataka have fewer men going in for the methods.

Visit to psychologist is fair game in Griffin divorce  wife saysVisit to psychologist is fair game in Griffin divorce, wife says
Griffin divorce
Ken Griffin and Anne Dias Griffin are embroiled in multimillion-dollar divorce case.
Ken Griffin and Anne Dias Griffin are embroiled in multimillion-dollar divorce case.
Ken Griffin Divorce Weddings
Visit to psychologist is fair game in divorce, Anne Dias Griffin says.
In a contentious divorce, Chicago multibillionaire Ken Griffin has said Anne Dias Griffin violated his rights by revealing that they went to a couple's therapy session days before their wedding.
In a court filing Monday, however, Dias Griffin said she has every right to disclose it as she seeks to invalidate the couple's prenuptial agreement.
Dias Griffin has said that, two days before their July 2003 wedding, she and Griffin, the founder and chief executive of Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, met with a psychologist that Griffin had recommended to help the couple work out their differences, including concerns about their prenuptial agreement.
'Quick update," said the subject line of the email Jan. 10, 2012. ( Becky Yerak )
Dias Griffin, however, has also claimed Griffin didn't disclose he had a past professional relationship with the psychologist and has said that, during the premarital session, the therapist sided with Griffin, telling Dias Griffin that she was being difficult. Dias Griffin has said that the psychologist's advice to avoid conflict on the eve of their wedding made her relent and, under duress, sign the prenuptial agreement that she is now seeking to invalidate.
For his part, Griffin has said that Dias Griffin violated the Illinois Mental Health & Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act by disclosing the visit; as a result, he has been trying to strike the discussion of the psychologist visit from their divorce proceedings.
In an 18-page filing Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, however, Dias Griffin lays out several legal rationales for why she believes that the visit should remain part of the proceedings and that the court should deny her husband's motion to strike her allegations about the session with a psychologist.
For one thing, she said, the mental health act "only applies to situations in which the patient is seeking treatment for a mental health condition."

"Anne's meeting with Kenneth's psychologist, with whom she had no prior relationship, arranged solely at Kenneth's direction, the purpose of which was misrepresented to her, hardly classifies Anne, or Kenneth for that matter, as one who is 'seeking treatment,'" the Monday filing said.
Even if her husband is protected under the act, Dias Griffin argues in her filing that she isn't precluded from disclosing communications between her and the psychologist.
"As the specific communications were directed only to Anne, she had the privilege to disclose or not to disclose those communications," her Monday filing said.
Dias Griffin also argues Griffin essentially waived protections because he permitted public statements "for worldwide consumption" regarding the use of a psychologist.
She cites, for example, articles, including one in the Chicago Tribune, quoting a person close to Griffin, saying that the couple continued to see the psychologist even after they were married — a fact that appears "nowhere in any pleading that Anne filed."
"Kenneth cannot tell or allow his side of the story to be told to the press to promote his case, while simultaneously claiming that Anne's limited disclosure in a pleading violates his right to confidentiality and should be stricken," Dias Griffin said in her Monday filing.
In her filing Monday, Dias Griffin said she learned "many years later" that her husband had a prior relationship with the psychologist.
"By causing Anne, an unwitting participant, to attend the meeting with the psychologist under false pretenses, Kenneth destroyed any confidentiality that might have existed," Dias Griffin said in a Monday court filing.
A representative for Griffin declined to comment on the filing early Monday evening.
@J. Paul Getty's ear -- but if it was a man doing this, you would think it's good strategy.

Griffin's net worth is estimated at $5.5 billion; Griffin says his wife's net worth is about $50 million.
In an earlier court filing, Griffin said it defied common sense that his highly educated wife would have been swayed by a psychologist who she barely knew, particularly when she had three law firms representing her during negotiations for the prenuptial agreement.
"Any reliance by Anne on the advice of a therapist whom she allegedly had just met in deciding whether to executive an agreement that she says is 'potentially worth billions of dollars' would not have been reasonable," Griffin said in an earlier filing.
In a separate filing this week, Dias Griffin addresses several statements that her husband has made in earlier court documents.
She has said she wants sole custody of their three children, ages 6, 4 and 2, with "reasonable visitation" for Griffin, and wants to move with them to New York. Griffin is seeking joint custody and wants them to stay in Chicago.
In a new filing, Dias Griffin admits that the children attend school in Chicago and have friends in Chicago, but she denies that the children have visited New York only "occasionally," as her husband has characterized their trips there.
"They spend substantial amounts of time in New York," Dias Griffin said in her new filing.
Dias Griffin admits in her new court filing that she has net assets of about $50 million before tax liabilities. But that's not enough "to support the children in accordance with the standard of living" that their father established for them, she said. Dias Griffin also says in her new court filing that, had she not given up her own full-time career as a hedge fund manager to raise their three children, her net worth might have exceeded $50 million.
Griffin has said that he has paid for virtually all of the children's expenses during the separation despite Dias Griffin being independently wealthy.
In her new filing, Dias Griffin denies that her husband has "paid virtually all of the expenses for the children and the marital residence" since he filed for divorce in July.
In earlier filings, Griffin said Dias Griffin and her lawyers received drafts of the prenuptial agreement before it was signed.
But Dias Griffin said in her new filing that the prenuptial agreement was hardly "negotiated."
"Although multiple drafts of the agreement were exchanged, and the final agreement contained certain terms proposed by Anne's attorneys, the major provisions remained substantially the same as in the first draft," Dias Griffin said in a new filing.
Also in her new filing, she admitted she was aware that Griffin was worth more than $1 billion when she married him.
Griffin has said that his wife has already received about $40 million in payments under their prenuptial agreement. He has already submitted emails from his wife to the court, acknowledging that she has received millions of dollars in payments.
"Under Illinois law, 'a victim of duress who accepts the benefits flowing from the contract for any considerable length of time ratifies the contract,'" Griffin said in a court document. "This is common sense: one cannot 'have his cake and eat it too.'"
In her new filing, Dias Griffin denies that, by accepting the payments, she essentially ratified the agreement.
Dias Griffin also said that while she "understood the provisions" of the prenuptial agreement, she didn't sign it "willingly."

Drug Distributor Punishes Vets While Receiving Billions From VAreddit
McKesson Corp. is the nation's largest drug distributor and earns roughly $4 billion a year serving as the primary pharmaceutical vendor for the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs. But it doesn't pay employees like Claude Hickerson, a veteran himself, enough to afford health care.
Ranked 15th on the 2014 Fortune 500 and reporting $138 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2014, McKesson is locked in a three-year battle with workers at its Lakeland, Fla. distribution center that voted in 2011 to join the Teamsters but still don't have a first contract. At issue? Fair wages and affordable health care.
Hickerson, a 19-year McKesson worker who served in Operation Desert Storm and reached the rank of sergeant before leaving the Army in 1992, said the company once treated vets like him well. But now that's changed. "When Vets Day comes along, they look to toot their own horn," he said. "But they treat us like anyone else. We get no respect."
The current health insurance plan is unaffordable for many of his colleagues, he said. Premiums have gone up every year while the plan's deductible grows bigger and bigger at the same time. It leaves workers in an untenable situation, forced to choose between providing for their families versus having health insurance.
Although McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren has received an average of $50 million a year in total compensation for more than a decade and is set to receive a $114 million pension upon retirement, many McKesson front line employees in Lakeland rely on public assistance. Employees say it's absolutely outrageous.
"As big as this company is, why in the world do we have people having to rely on food stamps?" Hickerson said. "I think the reason they might be on food stamps is because what they are paying in health insurance premiums."
This is no way to be treating those who have served our country. At the Teamsters, which represent 1,500 McKesson workers in the U.S. and Canada, we make it a priority to honor those who have helped keep America safe here and abroad.
In 1945, we were the first union to guarantee workers their seniority rights when they returned to their jobs. And today, our Teamster Military Assistance Program provides disability assistance to and job placement opportunities for veterans in the construction industry - regardless if they are Teamsters or not. As part of the program, the union works to ensure vets receive proper compensation from their insurance companies for chronic illnesses they may have incurred.
That commitment to our vets extends into the local communities where they live. Members of Teamsters Joint Council 25 in the Chicago area participated in the special bike and run to support equine therapy for military veterans in September, just one example of the union showing respect to those who serve.
Unfortunately, McKesson's actions prove they don't see it the same way. Despite the tens of billions McKesson earns as the VA's top medicine supplier, the company has turned its back on American heroes like Claude Hickerson.  Rather than negotiate a contract in Florida that provides for the needs of its distribution workers and their families, McKesson has waged an aggressive campaign to deny workers their fundamental rights on the job.
In fact, just last week, an administrative law judge in Florida ordered McKesson to stop its unlawful efforts to coerce workers into decertifying their union and to immediately rehire two workers fired in retaliation for their union activity. One of those workers, long-time employee Glenn Gray, was fired after confronting McKesson's CEO at the 2013 annual meeting urging his intervention in Lakeland to ensure workers were compensated fairly and provided affordable health care.
It's unacceptable to have a corporate culture in place that denigrates the work done by this nation's vets once they enter the private sector while at the same time lines its pockets with billions of taxpayer dollars. Law breakers like McKesson should not be rewarded for their bad behavior.
Our vets deserve the respect and admiration of us all. And that includes their employers.

Sachin Tendulkar says he is  no cricketing godLetters to  the editor
Indian cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar may be a ‘god’ for many of his fans but the batting legend has stressed that he is ‘normal’.
“I’m no cricketing god. I’ve made lots of mistakes on the field. I’ve loved playing cricket, but I’m normal Sachin and that’s how it should be,” he told BBC Sport in an interview released here today.
“I consider myself fortunate that people like me, people love me. It’s a special thing. I’m blessed I think. God has been kind to me. I don’t want to take anything for granted. I am only thankful to everyone for being so kind to me and it’s never enough,” he added in reference to a question on hero worship.
The highest run-scorer in the history of international cricket was at the Lord’s Cricket Ground last week for the official launch of his autobiography ‘Playing It My Way’.
During an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live channel he described his life after retirement as “hectic”.
“I’m getting to know a different side of life. For 24 years I was focusing on cricket and nothing else. I feel the first innings of my life was playing cricket and chasing my own dream – and the dream was to win the World Cup. The second innings of my life, the post cricketing years, is to try and give back something to the people who have wished well for me,” he said.
Tendulkar also reiterated his faith in the lengthier form of the game, describing Test cricket as the “main course” and other versions like “starters and desserts”.
“Out of 10 cricketers, if you asked, I wouldn’t be surprised if eight say that Test cricket is the top, then comes the rest,” he said.
The former Indian captain also singled out his century against England in 2008 in Chennai soon after the terror attacks in Mumbai as his “most meaningful”.
“It was a difficult period for all Indians across the globe. I felt really proud that I could do something to allow people to think about something else for a while. It allowed people to smile, which was an even greater satisfaction,” the 41-year-old said.
Asked about his legacy being taken forward by his son, he added: “First cricket has to be in your heart, then it gets to your brain. The key is to be madly in love with cricket, which he is.”

Kiss of Love  rattles Modi s conservative IndiaLetters to  the editor
A mass-kissing campaign against moral policing in a southern Indian city has swept the country, advertised via Facebook, as urban youngsters challenge a deeply conservative society.
Dozens of ‘Kiss of Love’ activists stole kisses and blocked traffic near a metro station in New Delhi at the weekend, outnumbering a handful of right-wing protesters who see such public displays as a threat to Indian culture.
“It’s not about just kissing,” said 26-year-old research scholar Pankhuri Zaheer, one of the organisers. “It’s about … inter-caste marriages, inter-religious marriages, live-in relationships.”
Minor scuffles broke out between the rival groups as the police steered the rally away from the Delhi office of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a radical group considered the ideological parent of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
The ‘Kiss of Love’ activists shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and affiliated Hindu groups seen as self-appointed moral guardians forcing traditional mores on people with a Western outlook.
Police foiled the initial Nov. 2 protest in southern Kerala state by stopping participants reaching the venue. But the Facebook ‘Kiss of Love’ community page got over 110,000 likes and sparked similar demonstrations in cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.
In Kolkata in eastern India, about 100 university students marched last week, carrying posters saying: “Right to love is our democratic right.”  Another protest is planned in Kerala early next month.
Not everyone is endorsing the campaign on the ‘Kiss of Love’ community page. “Love is a personal thing. Enjoy it and don’t make a drama out of it,” reads a comment by Raghu Sharma.
Modi has not yet commented on the protests.  But a spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, affiliated to his party, said: “Our Indian culture does not permit us displaying such kinds of affection in public spaces.”

RadioShack resorts to Thanksgiving openings to boost salesRadioShack resorts to Thanksgiving openings to boost sales

By Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Bloomberg News
Thanksgiving Macy's, Inc. Black Friday (shopping)
RadioShack Corp. will open most of its stores on Thanksgiving for the first time, joining a growing number of retailers expanding their selling hours during the once commerce-free holiday.
More than 3,000 of RadioShack's stores will be open on Nov. 27 from 8 a.m. to midnight, Merianne Roth, a spokeswoman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based chain, said Monday. In previous years, the company operated only a limited number of locations on Thanksgiving.
Lets get real. Who shops at Radio Shack on Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday, period? Plus Radio Shack is closing more locations anyway.
sphill2689

RadioShack and discount retailer Target both Monday joined the list of retailers adding hours on Thanksgiving to lure shoppers at a time of still-shaky consumer spending. The trend has diminished the importance of Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — which once was the traditional kickoff to holiday shopping. A holiday sales boost is especially critical to RadioShack, which has posted 10 straight quarters of losses.
"The company saw a consumer demand for more flexible shopping," Roth said.
RadioShack Chief Executive Officer Joe Magnacca is trying to turn the chain around by revamping its merchandise and store formats. To give him more time to execute a comeback, the company obtained $535 million in additional financing last month. RadioShack had only $30.5 million in cash on its books as of Aug. 2.
RadioShack shares fell 1.7 percent to 93 cents at the close in New York. The stock has lost 64 percent of its value this year.
Target will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, two hours earlier than last year, the Minneapolis-based company said Thursday in a statement. J.C. Penney Co., Staples Inc. and Macy's Inc. also have added hours on Thanksgiving this year.
 

Food giant starts war over meaning of mayoFood giant starts war over meaning of mayo
Bob Fila
Food and Drug Administration Kraft Foods Group Inc.
A big-money war is brewing over the meaning of America's best-selling condiment: mayonnaise.
The maker of Hellmann's mayo, food giant Unilever, has sued the San Francisco start-up behind Just Mayo, an egg-free, mayonnaise-like sandwich spread giving Big Mayo a run for its money.
The global food giant argues that Hampton Creek's Just Mayo is not, as Unilever lawyers wrote, "exactly, precisely, only and simply mayonnaise," as defined by the dictionary and the Food and Drug Administration, which says mayo must include "egg yolk-containing ingredients."
The Just Mayo identity crisis, Unilever lawyers said, has hurt Hellmann's market share, "caused consumer deception and serious, irreparable harm to Unilever" and the mayo industry as a whole. The firm wants Hampton Creek to stop calling its product Just Mayo, yank it off store shelves and pay Unilever damages worth three times the start-up's profits.
The FDA should be fighting this battle, not Unilever!
JamesSchuh

It is a strangely defensive stance for Unilever, a Big Food titan that made more than $64 billion last year selling foodstuffs in nearly 200 countries (including I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, a spread that is not butter). Hellmann's, which is called Best Foods on the West Coast, dominates 45 percent of the mayo market, data from industry researcher Euromonitor shows.
But market watchers say it highlights the fears of traditional food conglomerates facing unexpected competition from crafty start-ups. It is perhaps no coincidence that the biggest battleground is mayonnaise: Americans buy $2 billion of the stuff every year — more even than ketchup, salsa or soy sauce.
"It's not about using the [mayo] word," said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer who wrote about the suit. "It's about the fact that this company is taking market share away. And now it's like they've awakened the giant."
That the plant-based Just Mayo is a new type of food will lend an interesting dimension to the legal proceedings: Brand disputes typically quibble over words, not the definition of the product itself.
But the very modern legal battle will be fought on regulatory territory that is decades old. The FDA's definition of mayo was set in 1957, decades before the phrase "vegan mayonnaise" ever made sense. (Maintaining that "standard of identity" is important: Kraft Foods' Miracle Whip, which doesn't meet the FDA's standard, is technically a salad dressing.)
Unilever doesn't just call out Just Mayo for what it calls confusing branding — advertisements have called the stuff "mayo," and its logo resembles an egg — it also says the company has no proof of its claims of beating Hellmann's in a taste test.
So what's spooking Big Food? Hampton Creek has some big backers, including Bill Gates, and in a matter of months has spread rapidly to more than 20,000 Wal-Marts, Costcos and other stores across the country.
While other organic spreads like Vegenaise play up their place in the vegan niche, Hampton Creek has widely promoted Just Mayo as a mainstream brand: healthy, cheap and good for everybody. (Company ads rarely call it "vegan.")
"We don't market our product to tree-hugging liberals in San Francisco, even though I'm in the middle of nine of them right now," said Josh Tetrick, Hampton Creek's founder and chief executive. "We built the company to try to really penetrate the places where better-for-you food hasn't gone before, and that means right in the condiment aisle of Wal-Mart."
The fate of Just Mayo, which swapped out eggs for Canadian yellow peas, will be watched closely by other food conglomerates. Hampton Creek also sells Just Cookies, a line of egg-and-milk-free cookie dough, and is working on a gooey egg-free mix, Just Scramble.
The suit comes at a touchy time for Unilever, which just launched an ad campaign promoting itself as devoted to sustainability, and which backed its own soy-based egg alternative, Alleggra Foods, nearly 10 years ago. Messages left with the firm were not returned Monday.
Just Mayo has fought back with the help of celebrity chefs including Andrew Zimmern, who launched a petition, "Stop Bullying Sustainable Food Companies," that has more than 11,000 signers.
Tetrick, the start-up's chief executive, said his firm is looking at the lawsuit as a chance to not just expand their corporate profile, but also to lift up their egg-free sandwich spread as the touchpoint for a larger food-based cultural movement.
"A lawsuit gives us the opportunity to talk about the things that matter," he said. "So we'll take it."
 

China wins support for APEC trade plan as Barack Obama meets Xi JinpingNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Chinese President Xi Jinping held informal talks with his US counterpart Barack Obama here today in a bid to iron out differences between the world’s top two economies even as China won support for its “historic” Asia-Pacific trade plan despite American opposition.
Making a difficult trip to China, soon after the poll reversal at home where the Republicans won majority in the Congress, Obama took a leisurely walk with Xi at the well- fortified Zhongnanhai, the home of China’s top leaders, looking to strike a less confrontational relationship.
Obama who is here on a three-day visit to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is due to hold formal talks with Xi tomorrow.
Hours before the Xi-Obama meeting, top world leaders at the APEC summit today agreed to work towards possible adoption of a “historic” free-trade deal proposed by China, in a victory for the Communist giant as it strives for a bigger role in formulating global trade policy.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members’ endorsement of a roadmap for promoting the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) process was “a decision to be written into history books”, Xi said here while wrapping up the two-day jamboree of the 21-member APEC summit held with an opulent display of Chinese hospitality.
The move was “a historic step we took in the direction towards realising the FTAAP,” marking the official launch of the FTAAP process and demonstrating the confidence and determination of the APEC in advancing regional economic integration, Xi said at a press conference after the conclusion of the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.
The FTAAP would build on other initiatives including the smaller US-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but China’s firm push for its plan over US President Barack Obama’s TPP proposal has added to Sino-US trade rivalry.
The summit was virtually deadlocked over US-China differences on different free trade area arrangements.
While Xi pushed hard for Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), Obama stuck to Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which US is firming with 12 countries excluding China.
The US wants a TPP with very high standards to make China go for more economic reforms to meet the eligibility criteria to join it.
China, the world’s top exporter, hit back saying that FTAAP is more inclusive and serves the interests of all countries in the region.
The APEC summit endorsed a road map to study the FTAAP, which Chinese officials say will firmly keep it on the table of the influential bloc dominated by US and its allies.
The “endorsement” of a roadmap for promoting FTAAP process was “a decision to be written into history books”, Xi said.
The move was “a historic step we took in the direction towards realising the FTAAP,” marking the official launch of the FTAAP process and demonstrating the confidence and determination of the APEC in advancing regional economic integration, said Xi, who is also General
Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.
The decision will bring the integration to a new and higher level, benefit economies at various development stages across the Pacific Ocean and inject new energy into the growth of the region and APEC members, he said.
“We have reached consensus that regional economic integration is the driving force behind sustained strong growth in the Asia-Pacific, and APEC should continue to play a leading and coordinating role in pushing forward this process,” he noted.
China virtually seized the initiative by announcing a USD-40 billion fund for its new Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road initiatives which caught the attention of a host of small countries in Asia and the APEC region.
Together with the China-floated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), for which India and 20 countries signed up with USD 50 billion subscribed capital and the BRICS Bank with USD 50 billion capital, it has firmly put China on a high pedestal in the region.
Xi made repeated references to his silk road plans and that of the AIIB during his speeches at the summit virtually making them a central theme of the meeting.
A declaration released after the economic leaders’ meeting said APEC members have decided to kick off and advance the FTAAP process “in a comprehensive and systematic manner”.
The members have agreed to launch “a collective strategic study” on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016, it said.
It also noted the FTAAP will be realised on the basis of the conclusion of the ongoing pathways, which include the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
Both TPP and RCEP are regional free trade arrangements under negotiation but each of them involves only some of the region’s economies, while talks on both arrangements have been stalled by divisions among the negotiators.

Sajjad Lones challenge in Valley: sell soft separatism and Modi togetherComments
Narendra Modi has visited Jammu and Kashmir four times since becoming Prime Minister and the most public political effect became visible this week when People’s Conference leader Sajjad Lone met him.
Sajjad’s Peoples Conference’s has become first influential Hurriyat constituent to line up participation in assembly polls since the separatist amalgam’s birth in 1993.
If the former separatist-turned-mainstream leader sees the “Modi wave” as a means to possibly become chief minister, in the event of a pact, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will get a Muslim face on board and a toehold in the Valley.
The BJP would be hopeful of a strong performance in Jammu and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh, but the Valley (46 seats) holds the key to the majority mark of 44 in the 87-member assembly.
The People’s Conference banks on traditional votes garnered by the party’s founder Abdul Ghani Lone in and around his birthplace of Kupwara district in north Kashmir.
The present leadership is divided between 47-year-old Sajjad, his elder brother Bilal Ghani Lone, a member of the moderate Hurriyat, and their lawyer sister Shabnum Lone, who praised Modi for relief efforts during the recent floods in the state.
Influential senior Lone, assassinated by unknown gunmen in 2002, started his political career in 1967 as a Congress leader and served as a state minister. He launched the People’s Conference in 1978 and has left a significant political legacy north of Srinagar.
Sajjad, who has studied at Cardiff University in the UK, aims at reviving the party and its cadre to join the electoral process. The People’s Conference continues to have support base in Kupwara, Langate, Rafiabad and Handwara assembly segments.
The party has proved in two successive parliamentary polls that it is no pushover.
In 2009, Sajjad contested from the Baramulla parliamentary seat and bagged 65,403 votes, while his candidate Salamuddin Bajad bagged 71,154 votes from the seat in 2014 and came third. Importantly, this was a 15% vote share.
It is this vote share that is seen to be the basis for Sajjad’s latest mainstream move, with Modi in the picture. The People’s Conference would be fancying its prospects in at least four assembly seats in north Kashmir.
Sajjad held at least two meetings in the past with BJP leaders such as JP Nadda and Ram Madhav. There have been no formal announcements of a tie-up — before or after the polls — by either the BJP or the People’s Conference, but Sajjad’s interviews indicate that possibility.
He has already fielded 18 candidates from the Valley. There is a likelihood that the BJP may not pit candidates in his party’s strongholds such as the Handwara assembly constituency.
Sajjad himself is contesting against National Conference’s (NC) Chowdhary Ramzan and People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) Sofi Ghulam Mohidin in Handwara.
The pivot of his politics has remained bashing the NC and the PDP, and resurrecting his father’s constituency by mixing separatism and mainstream politics.
“The NC and the PDP are nothing short of glorified Ikhwanis (counter-insurgents). The only difference is that they wear a tie and act behind the curtains like cowards,” Sajjad has been saying in signature press statements in the last one year.
“For every injustice meted out to Kashmiris, for every humiliation, their leaders have their signatures on every atrocity. They have the same ideology as the BJP and the Congress.”
The biggest challenge for Lone is to make himself acceptable to his father’s separatist constituency. Second, to make soft separatism and backing PM Modi palatable at the same time.
The protagonist of “Achievable Nationhood”, which seeks erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir as a single economic entity with separate sovereign links with India and Pakistan, Sajjad faces an uphill poll battle.
He will remain one of the most talked about candidate of the polls whether he wins or loses.
If the People’s Conference fails to win any seat, Sajjad may have to walk in political wilderness.

Stocks barely rose Tuesday, but it was enough to push the Dow and S&P 500 to another record close.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.16 points, or less than 0.1%, to 17,614.90 and set a new intraday record of 17,638.21. The blue-chip index extended its winning streak to six straight sessions.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 1.42, or 0.1%, to 2039.68 and hit intraday all-time high of 2041.28. The S&P has posted gains for five consecutive days.
The Nasdaq composite index added 8.94 points, or 0.2%, to to a new bull market high of 4660.56.
;Bond trading was closed for Veterans Day.
America's Markets
It was the S&P's 40th record close of the year and the 24th for the Dow.
Stocks will likely move "sideways to up" for the remainder of the year, said James Liu, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. Earnings "continue to look good."
And even a sideways performance through the end of 2014 would be good, considering the S&P is up 10.4% for the year and the Dow is up 6.3%.
While earnings remain strong, the market could face volatility as investors fret about the potential timing of the Federal Reserve's first increase in interest rates since 2006. "That's my largest area of concern," Liu said.
Global stocks were mostly higher  with Tokyo closing at a seven-year as Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.1% to 17,124.11. The index closed above 17,000 for the first time since October 2007.
Helping the mood on Tuesday was news that the U.S. and China have reached an agreement to drop tariffs on a range of technology products including medical devices, global positioning systems, and video game consoles. President Obama made the announcement during a meeting with leaders attending an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Beijing.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.3% to 23,808.28 while the Shanghai composite fell 0.2% to 2,469.67.
European markets posted gains as Britain's FTSE gained 0.2% to 6627.40, Germany's DAX rose 0.2% to 9369.03 and France's CAC 40 jumped 0.5% to 4244.10.
Major indexes closed at record highs Monday. "Investors reflected on sound corporate earnings and an encouraging macro environment," said Will Leys, sales trader at CMC Markets in Sydney. "The likelihood of low rates for the near term, combined with improving sentiment and low commodity prices, is currently offsetting concerns over the global growth outlook. "

You're not happier with your rental car experience, but you're not significantly unhappier either.

That is one of the findings of a new study that shows that after years of steady increases, rental car customer satisfaction has hit a plateau.
Customer happiness declined by a point from 2013, according to J.D. Power 's 2014 North American Rental Carl Satisfaction study, released early Tuesday (today).
On a 1,000-point scale, overall satisfaction ranked 774 for 2014.

That may be a bit of a relief in an industry hampered by inventory and operational issues.
Inventory was tighter, said Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power, based in Westlake Village, partly because of the number of product recalls that took cars out of service. As a result, car rental rates increased an average of $5 a day.

Recalls that reduced inventory also affected wait times, he said, which is also key to customer satisfaction. This survey showed that customers spent 43.4 minutes getting and retrieving their car (which includes pickup, return and shuttle ride). That's an increase from 40.8 minutes from the 2013 survey.
Of the six factors evaluated in satisfaction, costs and fees ranked as most important, followed by pickup process (No. 2), return process (No. 3) and the shuttle bus (No. 5). The rental car itself ranked fourth, and the reservation process was No. 6 in importance in the evaluation.
At the top of the customer satisfaction class: Enterprise and National ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, at 805 and 797 on the 1,000-point scale.
At the bottom: Thrifty and Dollar scored 734 and 725, respectively.
But don’t automatically assume that the bottom two are of lesser quality.
Instead, it could be the kind of customer those companies attract — a customer that is traditionally more difficult to please.
Customers who are price-driven are less satisfied, the study shows — by 34 points on average.
That’s often the case no matter what the product, Garlick said. "We find people who are driven by price as a primary factor are always among the least satisfied in every industry,” he said. “With hotels it’s the same thing."
Surprisingly, the group thought to be part of what might be termed the “fussy” generation — the millennials (which Power identifies as those born between 1977 and 1994) was more satisfied than other “generational” customer groups.
Garlick thinks it could be the respect (or lack thereof) accorded to these younger travelers that contributes to their perception as more critical.
“The fussiness, the petulance, whatever you want to call it, is simply a myth,” he said.

In Myanmar  Narendra Modi eyes regional connectivity booster shot for tradeNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off his 11-day foreign tour on Tuesday afternoon with his first stop at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, where he held bilateral talks with President U Thein Sein.
The focus was on beefing up engagement in the areas of culture and commerce, with the Indian prime minister giving a strong push to improving regional connectivity as a booster to trade and increased people-to-people contact.
Modi landed here in a special aircraft and was given a ceremonial welcome. Tweeting after his bilateral meeting, Modi said that he and President Thein Sein had reviewed the bilateral relationship. “Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations…. We talked about strengthening ties in the fields of culture, commerce & enhancing connectivity.
Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations.
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 11, 2014
On Wednesday, Modi will attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit and the following day, he will take part in the 9th East Asian summit on the first leg of his three-nation foreign tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh’s visit there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar. Among the leaders that he is slated to meet is Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
For the official talks, the agenda includes India’s keenness to ensure that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should focus on improving people-to-people contact, ramping-up trade relations and reinforcing the strategic engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
Issues on the anvil at the ASEAN summit meeting include review of an ambitious connectivity project to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand that was originally envisaged to be completed by end-2017, and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway project. Modi in a tweet earlier this week had said that India’s ties with  ASEAN are “deep rooted” and that strengthening relations with the nations in the grouping are an important part of its ‘Act East’ policy.
He said he looked forward to meeting leaders attending the two summits in Myanmar. “ASEAN is central to our dream of an Asian century, where India will play a crucial role. Am sure the meetings there would be fruitful,” Modi had said.
With the bloc’s plan to float an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, the free trade pact in services and investment signed in September between India and the ASEAN is expected to help bilateral trade climb to $100 billion by 2015, from $71.6 billion in 2012.
Modi is also said to be keen to tap the potential offered by the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit to attract more tourists from southeast Asian nations.
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
The East Asia summit (EAS) is a major forum for leaders in the region and it currently has 18 members. Besides the 10 countries in the ASEAN region and India, the other EAS members are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the US and Russia.
The EAS bloc represents 55 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for around 56 per cent of global GDP.

AMU VC denies banning women from library  says he s not  sexistComments
Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor Lieutenant General Zameer Uddin Shah said on Tuesday he was not "sexist" after reports emerged that he turned down a demand of students of Women's College for access to the university's Maulana Azad Library, saying there would be "four times more boys" in the library if they were allowed in.

Shah found himself in the middle of a storm on Tuesday as human resource development minister Smriti Irani said the AMU V-C's reported remark not only hurt, but also agitated her as a woman. She termed the remark an "insult to daughters".
Irani's reaction came even as the HRD ministry on Tuesday prepared to seek explanation from Shah regarding his remark, saying it amounted to "disrespect to women".
Defending himself even as a debate raged on, Shah said: "These reports are completely wrong. I said there is no space for even a single seat in that library. We are not sexist and we also want women empowerment and certainly don't want to segregate our girls.
"In the women's college we have given grants of Rs. 11 lakh so that the library could be improved with air conditioners like in the Maulana Azad library. Every book which is there at Maulana Library is already available online for the girls," he added.
A female student at the university said on condition of anonymity that the issue of women's safety could not be used as a reason for the varsity not allowing them inside the library.
A faculty member, however, said it was unnecessary to blow up the issue on gender lines. "The issue isn't that simple. There are girls at AMU who come from conservative Muslim families and then there are gender issues. So it's difficult to balance both," he said.
AMU public relations officer Rahat Abrar, too, said the decision over library access did not arise out of a gender bias. "35% girls study in AMU, much more than any other college," he said, insisting the varsity had a favourable environment for female students.

Delhi girl  friend killed by cabbie in DehradunComments
A 27-year-old Delhi woman, who along with her friend was robbed and killed by a cab driver and his accomplices in Uttarakhand during the Diwali holidays, was raped, police said Tuesday.
The couple, who lived in Lado Saria in south Delhi, had left for the neighbouring hill state on October 21 and went missing two days later. It was on Monday that the police informed the families that the couple were robbed and killed near the state capital Dehradun. The police suspect the couple were killed on Diwali night on October 23. 
Four men — cab driver Raju Das, Bablu, Guddu and Kundan — had been arrested, senior Uttarakhand police officer Swapan Kishore Singh said. He is part of one of the three teams investigating the sensational crime.
“One of them has confessed that he raped the girl, but we are still interrogating if the others were also involved,” Uttarkashi superintendent of police Jagatram Joshi told HT. A source identified the man as Bablu. 
The body of the woman, a teacher with a Gurgaon school, is yet to be found. “We are trying to find the girl’s body. This will help establish if she was raped or not,” Joshi said. The body of her 24-year-old friend, a painter from Kolkata, was found in Purola in Uttarkashi district that abuts Dehradun. The couple, said the police, were returning to Dehradun from the popular Tiger Falls in a taxi when three men, who claimed to be friends of Das, joined them. After going some distance, the men asked the couple to step out. They robbed them, raped the woman and then killed them, Joshi said.
Das was arrested Sunday after their team went to Uttarakhand and presented the evidence that the woman’s phone was being used by him, a south Delhi officer told HT on condition of anonymity. “His interrogation led to the arrest of other three,” the officer said.
The men allegedly told the police that they strangled the couple and threw the woman’s body in the Yamuna river from a bridge. They were about to dump the man’s body when an approaching vehicle forced them to abandon the plan. They pushed the body from a nearby cliff, the Delhi officer said.
The murders could have been solved earlier had the Uttarakhand Police taken seriously the call details of the woman’s friend, the officer said. The call log showed the last person the man spoke to was Raju, he said.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Vodafone India, the second largest mobile operator in the country, on Tuesday said conditions for doing business here have not improved much in the last few months but it is "hopeful that change will happen".
"It's not nice to say, but it is reality. It is not like we said: 'It's difficult to do business in India'; it is objectively difficult to do business in India," Vodafone India managing director and CEO Marten Pieters said when asked if conditions have improved for doing business.
"Coming to the telecom industry, we have not seen much change so far but we are hopeful that change will happen," he added.
Mr Pieters cited the latest World Bank report wherein India has dropped by two places as compared to last year in the ease of doing business.
India ranked 142 among the 189 countries surveyed for the latest World Bank's 'Ease of Doing Business' report, a drop by two places from the last year's ranking.
Citing the example of 3G intra-circle roaming (ICR) pacts among operators, Mr Pieters said the government should have ended the matter when telecom tribunal TDSAT allowed them to continue with the arrangements, but the government decided to do otherwise.
The British telecom major is facing a tax liability of over Rs 11,200 crore, along with interest, on its 2007 acquisition of Honk Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa's stake in India's telecom major, Hutchison Essar. The India unit is its subsidiary.
Vodafone India has moved the Delhi High Court alleging the Centre is indulging in "arm-twisting" and "coercive" tactics by refusing to sign its unified licence (UL) till it unconditionally accepts the "restrictive" clauses in the licence. ( Read more )

EPFO mulling multiple bankers' facility for PF deposits
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 09.07PM IST
(Once approved by the CBT,…)
NEW DELHI: Retirement fund body EPFO is working on the idea of having multiple bankers to handle its provident fund returns instead of depending upon its sole banker State Bank of India.
The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation's advisory body the Finance Audit and Investment Committee (FAIC) in its meeting today firmed up the view on recommending multiple bankers, a source said.
Now, the recommendation will be put before the perusal and approval of the EPFO's apex decision making body the Central Board of Trustees' (CBT) headed by Labour Minister, the source said.
Once approved by the CBT, an amendment in the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme 1952 by the government would be sufficient to make the decision effective.
Earlier in August, the EPFO had provided a facility to firms having accounts in any of the specified 56 banks for making payment of their PF dues online through its official web portal or through SBI portal.
A senior official said that with EPFO switching over to the facility of multiple bankers, it would have accounts in different banks in the country.
The official said that this will help firms to have seamless credit of money into EPFO's accounts with any time lag. Besides it would reduce dependence on just one bank.
EPFO has a subscriber base of over five crore and it manages around Rs 6 lakh crore with annual incremental deposits of over Rs 70,000 crore.
In a recent review of the EPFO performance by its Central Provident Fund Commissioner K K Jalan, it was noted that by end of October more than 75 lakh claims were settled in the current fiscal.
Out of these claims, 97.56 per cent were settled within the mandated 30 days and more than 69 per cent of the claims were settled within 10 days of the receipt.
Also, more than 98 per cent of the annual (PF) accounts due for compilation have been updated by EPFO by October end and 13,500 grievances were disposed of during the month.
EPFO received over Rs 7,409 crore as contribution towards social security schemes run by it in October.

(Financials is their most…)
NEW DELHI: UBS, which sees the Nifty hitting 9600 levels by the 2015-end, is overweight on banks (private/PSU), oil and gas, power, telecom and media stocks.
Indian financials is their most preferred 'overweight' sector over the next 18 months as lower inflation and declining rates should support earnings growth and asset quality. Valuations remain attractive versus the historical trading range.
They expect private sector banks to gain market share due to their expanding reach, better client offerings and strong capitalisation ratios. State-owned (SOE) banks could benefit in the near term from lower credit costs, though capitalisation levels are a concern.
They are also positive on oil & gas sector. The key reforms rolled-out recently - gas price revision, diesel price deregulation, and potential steps to lower LPG subsidies -- have cleared a lot of policy uncertainties. UBS expects healthy earnings growth visibility for the sector over the next two to three years.
Here is a list of most preferred and least preferred stocks by UBS with a time-frame of 12 months:
The global investment bank is underweight on auto (2 wheeler) and consumer staples, while it is neutral on autos (four wheeler) and the cement sector.
UBS has turned 'underweight' to 'neutral' on consumer discretionary - given their view of a gradual recovery. They expect discretionary to recover moderately, more so in the second half of 2015, and UBS prefers it to consumer staples.
They turned from neutral to UW on IT Services. Revenue momentum seems to be slowing, with even stronger vendors such as TCS and HCL Technologies reporting softer than-expected QoQ growth in Q2 FY15.
UBS expects concerns of a sector-wide slowdown to increase. They believe that the demand cycle could be slower than expected and 2015 IT budgets would be more cautious than the street's current expectations, said the report.
They have turned from UW to neutral on pharmaceuticals. UBS had previously preferred IT services as a potential beneficiary of the rupee depreciation, but with a weaker outlook for IT now, their preferences have reversed.
UBS has also turned from OW to neutral on small and midcaps (SMIDs) - SMIDs had rallied after the elections on hopes that the growth recovery will accelerate. Their valuations relative to the large caps are now near historical highs.

14 companies raise Rs 562 crore through IPOs in September
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 08.58PM IST
(The two main IPO were that…)
NEW DELHI: Tapping strong investor sentiment, as many as 14 companies came out with initial public offers to raise Rs 562 crore in September this year.
Moreover, experts believe that a flurry of initial pubic offers (IPOs) is expected in the remaining part of 2014-15, especially in the fourth quarter.
According to the Sebi data, 14 companies collectively raised Rs 562 crore through IPOs in September. This included a total of 12 public offers by small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The two main IPO were that of Sharda Cropchem (Rs 352 crore) and Shemaroo Entertainment Limited (Rs 120 crore).
Among the SME IPOs, Momai Apparels topped the chart with Rs 30 crore initial share sale.
Other IPOs that hit the capital markets in September were Naysaa Securities, Sirohia & Sons, Encash Entertainment, Ultracab (India), Aryaman Capital Markets, Atishay Infotech, Dhabriya Polywood, Starlit Power Systems, Vibrant Global Capital, Powerhouse Fitness & Realty and ADCC Infocad.
Over one dozen companies hitting the capital markets in a single month suggest strong investor sentiments, say experts.
"Many more filings are likely to be seen and a flurry of IPOs is expected in the balance part of this fiscal, especially Q4," Prime Database Managing Director Pranav Haldea had said.
"The sentiment has received a further boost with overwhelming response, both in terms of over-subscription as well as in terms of listing gains, to the four main board IPOs of the year," he added.
In the first six months of 2014-15, 25 companies together raised Rs 1,019 crore through initial share-sale as compared to Rs 1,050 crore garnered by 16 firms in the year-ago period.
Of the 25 IPOs in the first half of the current financial year, 21 were from the SME sector.

Jharkhand assembly Polls: Amit Shah releases BJPmanifestoPrint
BJP National President Amit Shah, Union Ministers Arun Jaitley and Dharmendra Pradhan and Jharkhand BJP President Ravindra Rai release the party manifesto along with other leaders ahead of Jharkhand Assembly elections in Ranchi on Tuesday. (Source: PTI photo)
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:40 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 10:40 pm
The BJP on Tuesday released a comprehensive, 56-page manifesto ahead of Jharkhand assembly polls, with the document mentioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi at least five times but having only four lines on the party’s policy on left wing extremism.
The BJP’s document was released by national president Amit Shah in the presence of Union Ministers Arun Jaitley, Dharmendra Pradhan, Sudarshan Bhagat, Jayant Sinha and a host of state-based leaders of the party.
The BJP document talks of adapting a host of schemes that are a part of PM Modi’s vision – Make in Jharkhand, self-attestation of documents, e-governanace, formation of Tarun Dals for youth and houses for all by 2022.
However, when it comes to LWE, probably one of the biggest headaches for administrators in the state – and one which Jharkhand has topped the country in terms of related incidents since 2012 – the BJP has only four lines to talk about. “…We will try to combine social as well as developmental solutions for extremism even as we use administrative tools to bring about a lawful society,” goes the main promise on LWE, which omits the talk of surrender policy and rehabilitation of former rebels altogether.
Though it is an exhaustive document, the BJP’s manifesto will be noticed for the silences. Apart from LWE, it also skirts around resolving the domicile policy – only promising to make attempts to give priority to local people in jobs. Though it talks of attempting to curb migration by providing jobs, the BJP manifesto has nothing to say about stopping human trafficking.
The party seems to be taking a more serious view of the problem of displacement, though. promising policy changes to take care of the problems faced by those displaced by mining and industries.
There are radical declarations on governance – performance-based grading for government employees that could have a say in promotions is one of them. Another is the proposal to have caste certificates issued automatically with 10th standard pass certificates. The BJP also promises a new sports university for the state. On the anti-corruption front, special tribunals are in the offing as well as compulsory declaration of assets by government officials as well as elected representatives.
In what could be a nod to the RSS, the BJP also promises to honour those who were part of Jayaprakash Narayan’s Total Revolution. This, in a situation where successive state governments have failed to even recognise statehood activists.

CAG finds schools in Gujarat functioning under trees & temporarysheltersPrint
Written by Avinash Nair | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:39 pm
The Gujarat-model of education seems has been criticised by none other than the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), after the country’s top audit watch dog found glaring lacunae in the way elementary schools were being run in the state. CAG found schools in Gujarat functioning under trees and temporary shelters.
CAG found that even after four years from the date of enactment of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 or the RTE Act, many of the schools in Gujarat had not been provided with buildings, adequate teachers and basic amenities like drinking water. These facilities were to be provided to all schools by August 2012, observed CAG in a report on Local Bodies that was tabled in the Gujarat legislative Assembly on Tuesday.
In Gujarat there are 31,545 elementary school managed by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) as on March 31, 2013. These consisted of 10,188 primary schools with stand I-V and 21,357 upper primary schools with standard I-VIII.
CAG checked 10 districts that had 14,797 elementary schools between 2008-13 and found that 48 schools did not have their own buildings and 56 schools were in dilapidated condition, in need of repairs. That’s not all. 14 more schools did not have their own buildings.
During the field visits undertaken in Junagadh district, the auditor found a primary school in Dodhi Nes (shown in records as functioning in its own school building) to be operating from a temporary shelter. Another school in Hadala Nes in the same district to be functioning under a tree. CAG has printed the pictures of both these schools in the report which stated that the RTE Act necessitates schools to have an all-weather building.
The RTE Act also provides that a school should have at least one class-room for every teacher with the provision that there would be at least two class rooms in primary schools and three class rooms in Upper Primary Schools. “Audit observed that though sufficient funds were available, due to lack of planning 10 percent (or 3146 schools) of the 31,545 elementary schools were functioning without adequate class-rooms (July 2013),” the report stated. The percentage of inadequacy of class-rooms in Gujarat ranged from one percent (Surat district) to as high as 53 percent in Jamnagar district.
Out of the 300 schools visited by CAG, the pupil-class room ratio (PCRR) in 38 schools was above the norm of 40:1 provided under the RTE Act. An eye-brow raising PCRR of 108:1 was observed in Shamalpur primary school in Bhiloda taluka of Sabarkantha district. “The strength of these classes were more than that envisaged under RTE Act, which adversely affected the quality of education,” CAG observed.
CAG also noticed that safe and adequate drinking water facility was not ensured for students in 175 (58 percent) of the 300 schools visited. Moreover, 82 percent of these schools did not have disabled friendly toilets, while in nine percent of them there were no separate toilets for girls and boys, an issues that have been raised a countless times continued…

iPhones and iPads vulnerable to attacks by hackers:ExpertsiOS bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications.
By: Reuters | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:36 pm
Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc’s iOS operating system makes most iPhones (including the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, emails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple’s App Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed “Masque Attack.”
These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
“It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit,” FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Apple’s iOS has robust security features that make it extremely difficult for attackers to install malware on devices using traditional techniques for infecting Windows machines and Android mobile devices with malicious emails and Web links. The “Masque Attack” makes that possible by exploiting a system that Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through Apple’s App Store, according to David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout.
Those applications are not vetted by Apple for malicious software, unlike apps in its App Store, though users do receive pop-up notifications asking if they want to prevent the apps from installing on devices, he said.
“You can just say ‘Don’t install.’ As long as you do that, you will be protected from this vulnerability,” Richardson said.
FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and representatives of the company said they were working to fix the bug, according to Wei.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on specialized Web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on Apple bugs, Wei said.
He said FireEye decided to go public with its findings after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered WireLurker, the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability.
“Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see more,” Wei said.

NIA searches house of Sahanur wanted in BurdwanblastPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:30 pm
Even as Sahanur Alom, one of the twelve persons declared “most wanted” by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Burdwan blast case, has remained traceless, the NIA today carried out a second search in his house in Barpeta district in western Assam in one week.
A team of NIA sleuths spent about two hours in Alom’s house in village Chatala under Sarthebari police station in Barpeta, after which they also checked a bank account in the Union Bank branch at Majdia, a nearby township. Anwar Hussain Malik, in whose house Alom had organised a special namaz prayer one day ahead of Eid in July, was also quizzed by the NIA.
Though NIA officials remained tight-lipped about the searches carried out today, they were looking for more information and materials about Alom’s involvement with the Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) module based in Burdwan. Last week the Assam Police had arrested Alom’s Sujina Begum, who is also considered an important member of the JMB module.
Sujina, who had studied in a madrasa in Burdwan, who had remained traceless along with her husband Alom and two children since the Burdwan blast of October 2, was arrested in the inter-state bus station in Guwahati last week. She was hiding for a couple of days in a house in Uzanbazar in Guwahati which her father had apparently taken on rent.
The Assam Police has also arrested Alom’s brother Zakaria Ahmed for his alleged association with the Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) module. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on his part is on record saying that the JMB module was trying to set up a women’s wing in the state.

After Mars  ISRO chief Radhakrishnan aims for the moonAfter Mars, ISRO chief Radhakrishnan aims for the moon
By AFP | 11 Nov, 2014, 09.38PM IST
India now has its sights set on low-budget missions to the moon and the sun after becoming the first country in Asia to reach Mars.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India now has its sights set on low-budget missions to the moon and the sun after becoming the first country in Asia to reach Mars, the head of its space agency said Tuesday.
India has been swelling with pride since winning the continent's race to Mars in September when its unnamed Mangalyaan spacecraft slipped into the Red Planet's orbit after a 10-month journey on a shoestring budget.
The mission, designed to search for evidence of life on Mars, sparked mass celebrations which were especially sweet as India also became the only country to reach the planet on its first attempt.
Buoyed by the success, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman K.S Radhakrishnan said the agency was forging ahead with plans to land an unnamed craft on the moon, along with a satellite to study the sun.
"The aim is three years from now, an Indian lander and Indian rover will land on the moon," he told AFP.
"We have a programme to study the sun that is by putting a satellite into the sun-Earth Lagrangian point," he said, referring to the position where the satellite, held by the pair's gravitational pull, can orbit with them.
China completed its first return mission to the moon last month with the successful re-entry and landing of an unmanned probe, but Radhakrishnan played down talk of a space-age rivalry between the world's two most populous countries.
"We don't race with any country. We have our own priorities," he added. But Radhakrishnan did acknowledge India was "certainly" eyeing a greater slice of the $300-billion global space market, by making and launching communication, weather, navigational and other satellites for foreign countries.
The Mars mission highlighted India's launch vehicle, called the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which has long been in "high demand" from countries needing their satellites blasted into orbit.
"We have launched 40 satellites for other countries, 19 countries have used the PSLV," Radhakrishnan said.
ISRO this year successfully tested a second vehicle, called the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), capable of launching heavier satellites that countries are clamouring to have fired into space.
"At the moment there are no contracts (for the GSLV) but discussions are going on," he said in an interview in New Delhi.
India ranks among the top six space-faring nations in technological capabilities -- after the US, Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan and China, the chairman said.
But ISRO manages to compete with the big boys on a tiny budget, with the Mars mission costing just $74 million.
"If you look at the expenditure, we use 7.5 percent of what (the US space agency) NASA spends on space research," the chairman said.
ISRO has helped keep costs down in part by using a myriad of Indian companies to help build its space programme, with nearly 122 local firms assisting on the Mars mission.
India has come a long way since it began its space programme half a century ago when it set up the first rocket launch pad in a field in the southern state of Kerala. A church in a fishing village was the agency's main office.
The chairman said the agency was reaping the benefits of years of hard work, after sticking to its "mantra of self reliance" rather than relying on other countries for assistance.

Abhishek Singhvi case: BJP raises black money issue; asks Sonia to clarifyAbhishek Singhvi
("Congress has created a…)
NEW DELHI: BJP today accused Congress leaders of generating black money in the country while referring to the matter of the alleged tax evasion by its spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi and asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi to clarify on the issue.
"The issue of Singhvi is just a sample as it is only what has come out in the public domain. How many Congress leaders are turning black money into white?
"Congress has created a lot of black money during the last 10 years of its government, which saw a lot of corruption and scams. Congress President Sonia Gandhi should clarify," said BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma.
Terming the matter "a classic case of tax evasion", BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, "This is a classic case of how black money is produced within the country by the tall leaders of Congress."
Attacking the Congress, he said, "It sermonises on black money and this is what is happening in its own house. You are producing black money in your own house and are evading taxes. The Congress has a lot to answer for.
"Either you (Congress) own up that your tall leaders are evading taxes and indulging in generation of black money or you disown Singhvi."
Sharma accused the Congress of being the "fountainhead of corruption" and said this is the reason why its MPs did not give an undertaking on black money in Parliament whereas all the BJP legislators had done so.
"This is only the tip of the iceberg. The country is well aware of the fact that many tall leaders of Congress have stashed black money not only abroad but also at home. Law will surely take its course but will Congress punish Singhvi?" Patra said.
Citing details of revelations by the Income Tax Settlement Commission, Patra said there has been a substantial increase in Singhvi's income and, in a short span of time between Jan. 15, 2011, to March 31, 2011, there was a considerable jump in payments for his legal assistance.
"In this short span of about two-and-a-half months, about 18,199 vouchers were signed by Singhvi. On a single day, March 31, 2011, about 1,207 vouchers were signed. All these are self -made vouchers. No authentic bills were procured," Patra said.
Stating that the revelations of the Commission were a matter of "grave concern", the BJP spokesperson said, "We have seen how Singhvi has no documentary proof to back his claims of how he spent his money. Today he says that all the documentary evidence was destroyed in a termite attack. That is highly ridiculous.
"The corrupt termites are now trying to hide behind the real termites."
  Recalling comments made by Singhvi when the names of black money holders were declared by the Centre before Supreme Court that it was a case of "Khoda pahaad, nikli chuhiya" (dug a mountain, found a mice), Patra hit out at him saying, "Mr Singhvi, the mountain of your personal corruption stands exposed in front of the country today."
Singhvi is said to have approached the Commission seeking immunity from penalty and prosecution by saying that termites ate up his tax and expense records and he could not prove his claims. As per reports, the Commission is said to have added over Rs 91.95 crore to his declared professional income and slapped a penalty of Rs 56.67 crore on him.
Citing the Commission's revelations, Patra said that on February 28, 2012, Rs 5 crore was spent on laptops given to legal assistants whereas Singhvi's salary sheet shows he had employed 14 advocates and professionals to assist him.
"He would have to purchase 1,250 laptops (each costing Rs 40,000) to account for the amount under that head," he said.
He further alleged that Singhvi claimed to have spent Rs 35.98 crore on purchase of solar panels for his company while the owner of the company which sold the panels has agreed before IT authorities that Rs 10 crore was to be repaid to Singhvi in the form of a loan to his sons.
Patra said Singhvi cannot hide behind the excuse of "legal malaise" as the whole investigation began during the tenure of Pranab Mukherjee as the Finance Minister and continued through his successor P Chidambaram's period with only the results having come out now.

NEW DELHI: Government has formed three sub-committees to select heads of eight public sector banks, including Punjab National Bank , Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank .
The three sub-committees are scheduled to hold interviews of eligible candidates on November 14.
Earlier this month, the government had decided that each sub-committee will have two members and all candidates will have to go through all these screening panels separately.
The sub-committees have three outside experts. These experts are former Managing Director of State Bank of India (SBI) S Viswanathan , IIM Indore Director Rishikesha T Krishnan and former Chairperson and Managing Director S Panse , sources said.
Besides, other three members of screening committees are Department of Financial Secretary, Additional Secretary and an RBI Deputy Governor.
The final selection of candidates would be made by the appointment board chaired by RBI Governor and it will be based on the weighted average marks given by each sub-committees to ensure objectivity and transparency.
The selection process for Chairman and Managing Director of the public sector banks was changed following government scrapping the selections made by previous UPA regime.
Last month, the government cancelled selection of heads of six PSU banks and 14 executive directors made during the UPA tenure following a government-appointed panel finding irregularities in the process.
The eligibility criteria remains more or less same in the current fiscal.
Last time, 19 candidates appeared for interviews for six vacancies of Chairman and Managing Director (CMD).
Now, there could be about 16 eligible candidates for posts of eight CMDs, sources said.
Following shortlisting by the high level panel, the names of the candidates would be sent to Finance Minister and subsequently to the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC). In the mean time, the process for vigilance and other necessary clearances would be undertaken.

Let's say you're a veteran with lots of free time — and big ambitions to rake in plenty of pay-back for your service to your country.
Well, some of America's biggest and most patriotic brands have three words of advice for you:  go for it.
If you play your cards right on Veterans Day — and some other days, too — here's how freebie-seeking veterans and active military can cash in. This list is not comprehensive — and some require military ID or have other requirements.
YOUR TAKE: Honor your favorite vet
• Get a free haircut. Veterans who visit Great Clips shops on Nov. 11, can either receive a free haircut — or a card for a free haircut to redeem by Dec. 31.
• Eat a free meal. At Hooters, the freebie meal on Veterans Day can be worth up to $10.99, with any drink purchase.  Applebee's, Chili's and California Pizza Kitchen all offer free meals from a special menu to vets and active military.
• Eat a free buffet. Golden Corral is serving free dinner buffets (with beverages) from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 17, at all restaurants, to anyone who is serving or who has served in the military.  That same date, Bonanza Steakhouses also will offer free buffets for vets and active military.
• Down a free burger. Shoney's offers its signature All-American Burger, free, to vets or active duty military all day on Veterans Day. Or, you can head to Red Robin and get a Red's Tavern Double burger with Bottomless Steak Fries, on the house. Max & Erma's offers a free cheeseburger combo and dessert to vets and active military.
• Drink a free coffee. Starbucks is offering a free, tall brewed coffee on Tuesday to all U.S. military veterans and active duty servicemembers — and their spouses.
• Scarf down free pancakes. IHOP offers vets and active military free Red, White and Blue pancakes from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday.  Bob Evans also has all-you-can-eat hotcakes on Veterans Day for veterans and active military.
• Lick a free cone. Handel's Homemade Ice Cream and Yogurt shops are giving away free single-scoop ice cream cones to all veterans and military personnel on Tuesday.
Work-out for free. 24-Hour Fitness offers free use of the health club to vets and active military through Tuesday.
• Enjoy a free appetizer. Red Lobster, through Thursday, is offering free appetizers to veterans and active duty military.
• Sip a free beer. Restaurants owned by CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries (including Gordon Biersch Brewery, Rock Bottom, Old Chicago Pizza and ChopHouse & Brewery) offer a free craft beer to active and retired military Tuesday.
• Down a free doughnut — and coffee. Krispy Kreme will give a free doughnut and small coffee to anyone who identifies themselves as a veteran or active duty military on Veterans Day.
• Get free game tokens. Chuck E. Cheese will give 20 free tokens to U.S. military vets and active-duty military through Saturday.
• Get your junk hauled, free. For disabled veterans, JDog Junk Removal & Hauling locations, will offer free junk removal to disabled vets who book on Veterans Day.

The termites of the sea have super weird digestive systems  and they might help us make biofuelsBy Rachel Feltman November 11 Follow @rachelfeltman
The worm-like creatures are actually mollusks that feed on piers and wooden ships. (Daniel Distel/Ocean Genome Legacy Center of New England Biolabs)
Shipworms were already weird animals, but they just got weirder. The ocean-dwelling clams, which actually look much more like slimy worms, are some of the only creatures in the world that can eat wood. Now scientists have figured out that shipworms are even more unique than we thought: Instead of breaking down their food using bacteria in their guts (the way basically almost all animals do), shipworms break down wood using bacteria in their gills. 
This revelation was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , with research lead by Daniel Distel, director of the Ocean Genome Legacy Center of New England Biolabs at Northeastern University. Distel, along with researchers from the U.S. Energy Department's Joint Genome Institute, is interested in harnessing the shipworm's unique ability to digest wood to improve the production of renewable, environmentally friendly fuels.
When the shipworms gnaw on wood, they have to digest cellulose — the toughest plant material there is. The cellulose in agricultural crop waste such as corn and wheat stalks represents a massive reservoir of untapped energy.
"If you understand how to break cellulose down into component sugars, it's then a very easy step to go to ethanol — which is a potential biofuel," Distel said.
But in investigating how the mollusks digest cellulose, Distel and his colleagues were shocked to discover that the creatures have an as-yet-unheard-of relationship with the bacteria in their bodies.
Instead of living in the gut and secreting digestive enzymes there, the bacteria that live in shipworms actually take up residence in the gills. Somehow the enzymes they produce make the journey to the gut and aid in digestion, but Distel has no idea how.
"This is the only case described so far," he said, though he believes there must be similar systems out there in nature. "We've never seen an animal use bacteria outside the digestive system for digestion."
It's equally surprising that the bacteria can produce enzymes that survive the journey from one part of the host to the other.
"Our theories on how this might work range from the trivial to the really fascinating," Distel said. On the one hand, it could be very simple: Maybe the system is passive, with tiny holes in the cells in the gill allowing the bacterial enzymes to leak out and find their way to the gut.
The more exotic theory, Distel said, is that the bacteria manage the transport themselves.
"Some pathogens are able to inject proteins into the cells of their hosts, and they have special pathways to secrete those proteins," he said. "Generally those proteins are designed to do harm, to make the host more suitable to the bacteria's needs. But it could be possible that these bacteria have figured out a way to export enzymes into host cells for good, to support their symbiotic relationship."
Distel and his colleagues want to figure out how and why these bacteria do their magic on the shipworms' guts but are also committed to using their digestive skills for commercial applications.
"These enzymes turn out to be fairly complex proteins, made up of several active modules that are connected to each other," Distel said. These bits and pieces can be configured into different combinations to improve their function. "Other organisms do this, but these bacteria seem to take it to an extreme."
He hopes that this strategy of mixing and matching will help scientists find an ideal enzyme for breaking down cellulose, leading to faster and more efficient biofuel production. And, in the meantime, he's hoping to figure out more of the shipworm's secrets.
"They just have a certain charm," Distel said.

Key architect of Obamacare admitted that it was passed by exploiting political ignoranceBy Ilya Somin November 11
At an October 2013 panel, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, a key architect of the Affordable Care Act, admitted that it was passed by exploiting political ignorance . If voters had known that the law would work by forcing young and healthy people to provide massive new subsidies for the old and sick, he doubts that it could have gotten through Congress:
“[Economist] Mark [Pauly] made a couple of comments that I do want to take issue with, one about transparency in financing and the other is about moving from community rating to risk-rated subsidies. You can’t do it politically. You just literally cannot do it, okay, transparent financing…and also transparent spending.” Gruber said. “In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in—you made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed, okay. Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass…Look, I wish Mark was right that we could make it all transparent, but I’d rather have this law than not.”
What Gruber called “stupidity” is better described as ignorance . Even highly intelligent voters have strong incentives to be rationally ignorant about complex political issues .
This is far from the only deception that played a major role in the passage of Obamacare. Perhaps even more important was President Obama’s now-notorious lie to the effect that “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.”
In both cases, people who studied the plan carefully could readily tell that the administration’s statements were deceptive. Forcing millions of people to buy more comprehensive and more expensive health insurance plans than they had previously was an important element of the ACA – a feature, not a bug. This was well understood by health care experts on both of sides of the debate over the law, and seized on by opponents early on. But a majority of the public is often ignorant about even simple aspects of the political system, such as which party controls which house of Congress . The problem of political ignorance is exacerbated by the enormous size and complexity of modern government, which makes it difficult for even relatively attentive voters to keep track of more than a small fraction of what the state is doing . Therefore, it isn’t surprising that the administration’s deceptions about Obamacare fooled enough people to ensure its passage.
It would be a mistake to assume that such exploitation of political ignorance is unique to the Obama administration or to Democrats generally. Conservative Republican politicians and interest groups also often exploit ignorance. Indeed, neither party can afford to abjure this vital political tool/a>. A candidate or party unwilling to manipulate voter ignorance labors at a systematic disadvantage relative to more unscrupulous opponents. Things would be different if voters carefully kept track of political leaders’ claims and punished those who use deception to exploit “the stupidity of the American voter.” But if the public were that well informed about the exploitation of ignorance, there would not be so much ignorance to exploit in the first place.
The underlying problem is not that one party is uniquely unscrupulous, but that both must operate under a structure of incentives created by an electorate that itself has a strong incentive to be ignorant. If we want to change that sad state of affairs, we should consider making more of our decisions in a framework where the incentives are better.
UPDATE: Gruber now says that his 2013 statement was “inappropriate.” Perhaps so. But notice that he does not say it was inaccurate.
UPDATE #2: This post attempts to use my statement that both parties exploit political ignorance as a kind of excuse for the Obama administration’s actions. But the fact that both parties do it does not actually justify either. It merely means that we cannot address the problem by replacing the Democrats with the Republicans or vice versa. The problem is structural and requires a structural fix, such as reducing the size, scope, and complexity of government .

New York doctor  declared Ebola free  released from hospitalBy Mark Berman November 11 Follow @markberman

A visibly giddy Craig Spencer, the doctor diagnosed with Ebola in New York City, was released from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday morning, ending a saga that began nearly three weeks ago when he was rushed there and tested for the virus.
Spencer walked outside to cheers from the medical personnel who had treated him and from the crowd gathered near the hospital. He was greeted with what Mayor Bill de Blasio called “the official mayoral hug,” along with hugs from Chirlane McCray, the city’s first lady, and nurses from Bellevue.
“It’s a very, very good day…Dr. Spencer is Ebola free and New York City is Ebola free,” de Blasio said during a news conference outside the hospital.
Spencer was declared free of the virus on Monday night , 19 days after he was taken to Bellevue and diagnosed with Ebola . His clean bill of health means that the United States now has no known cases of Ebola.
De Blasio praised Spencer for his work treating patients in West Africa and for how the doctor kept up his sense of humor during his treatment in Manhattan.
“It is a good feeling to hug a hero,” de Blasio said. “And we have a hero here in our midst. Someone who served others no matter how much danger, and he has been an inspiration throughout the challenges he has faced.”
During his remarks outside the hospital, Spencer urged the public and the media focus their attention on the crisis in West Africa. He also said medical workers and others who travel to West Africa to fight the disease should not be stigmatized upon their return.
Spencer’s diagnosis prompted concerns in New York, where he had taken the subway and visited restaurants and bars, and sparked a larger debate over how to treat medical personnel returning from the heart of the Ebola epidemic. Government officials from New Jersey and New York to Maine vowed to quarantine these medical workers, a move that was criticized by aid groups and public-health experts.
The New York City health department has said it is monitoring hundreds of people for possible exposure to Ebola, which includes those who treated Spencer at Bellevue and others who had traveled from West Africa. These people are being watched for 21 days, which is the time it takes a person to develop Ebola symptoms.
In addition to being the first (and, so far, only) person diagnosed with Ebola in New York, Spencer was also the only medical worker known to have contracted Ebola in West Africa and returned to the United States before being diagnosed. Several others have contracted Ebola in West Africa and been taken back to the United States for treatment.
Before Spencer, there were three diagnoses of Ebola in the United States: A Liberian man who flew to Texas before being diagnosed and two nurses who contracted the virus while treating him.

Nestle tweeted a joke about the 43 students missing and presumed dead in MexicoBy Caitlin Dewey November 11 Follow @caitlindewey
The  tweet has been deleted. (via Twitter)
They say that the key to good brand humor is the sweet spot between the benign and the totally inappropriate. So late Sunday night, @CrunchMX — the Mexican Twitter account for Nestle’s Crunch candy bar — made a go of it:
“A los de Ayotzinapa les dieron Crunch,” the account tweeted, a little pun on its namesake candy bar. Translation? “They crunched those from Ayotzinapa.”
… “Those from Ayotzinapa” being the 43 trainee teachers who were apparently abducted, killed incinerated and ground up by a local drug gang in late September, and whose disappearance has sparked a national outcry .
As far as social media mess-ups go, this one is a doozy. Nestle and the Crunch brand, in particular, have spent much of the past 24 hours apologizing and condemning the message — mostly in vain.
@CrunchMX Community Manager despedido en 3, 2, 1…
— Mocti (@Moctii) November 9, 2014
One problem is that it’s not entirely clear who’s responsible for the tweet: Nestle Mexico’s vice president of communication told CNN that the company contracts an outside marketing firm to handle that Twitter feed. Immediately after the Ayotzinapa tweet went up, someone from that marketing firm deleted it and tweeted an apology for the “bad joke.” Nestle later claimed, in a series of tweets (but not, mysteriously, in its official statement ), that the account had been hacked.
Whatever happened, it’s almost not even news. Companies doing stupid things on Twitter, whether in the name of humor or some other idol, is less an exception than a norm these days. In fact, even as I write this, I imagine dozens of social media editors across the country are queueing up their branded Veterans Day tweets, the better to stake out an eensy, weensy corner of public attention on a day when such attention is reserved for people who have, you know, served in wars.
To be fair, accidents happen — even to massive corporations. In September, when DiGiorno Pizza tweeted a dreadful non-funny on the domestic violence hashtag #WhyIStayed, the poor, beleaguered sucker behind the account quickly explained that he or she hadn’t read the hashtag — it was all just a “flub,” an unintentional error.
But so many other major Twitter fails are 100 percent premeditated. In fact, they’re over-meditated and calculated, with the backfiring, faux-personal jokiness just an act to move a product or drive “engagement.” There’s even a traveling industry conference dedicated solely to the fine art/science of making brands funny — because “being funny can make people want to work with you and buy from you,” the FunnyBizz conference promises.
Alas, while FunnyBizz’s “engaging, entertaining & enlightening” speakers encourage their brands to “iterate” and “fail,” they do not specify what happens if your jokes end up being in stomach-turning bad taste. @CrunchMX appears to be learning that now: On Twitter and Facebook , consumers unconvinced by Nestle’s “hacking” line are calling for boycotts of the brand.
“Nestle is garbage,” reads one of the very few messages PG-enough to reprint here.
“They have no shame, making fun of the country’s pain,” another post reads. “Personally, thanks to all this, I won’t consume your junk any more.”
On the upside, though — engagement is way up!
Demanding that more be done to find 43 missing students, hundreds of protesters forced travelers at Acapulco airport to walk to catch their planes on Monday. The students disappeared in late September in Guerrero. (Reuters)

Vietnam has a growing middle class, and 60 percent of the population is under 30 years old, presenting an opportunity to attract younger generations to Mondelez products.
“It's a perfect fit for our Asian growth strategy,” Tim Cofer, president of the Asia Pacific business, said in an interview.
Mondelez has an option to buy the remaining shares of Kinh Do's snack business a year after the completion of the initial deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.

6 Leadership Myths and Realitiesreddit
There are many false impressions of what makes a great leader. Many people think that it's baked into your DNA whether or not you are destined to become an effective leader. Well guess what, they are wrong. I've shattered the top leadership myths and am giving you the reality.
Myth: Men make better leaders.
Reality: Gender does not determine leadership capabilities. In fact, women tend to be better at demonstrating concern for others, which is an important trait of being an effective leader. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, is doing this right now. She is transforming the culture of the company through her own example of brutal honesty and accountability in the wake of the Cobalt recall.
Myth: The best leaders are extroverts.
Reality: Being an introvert or an extrovert determines how one recharges. Introverts recharge alone while extroverts recharge by being with others. There are no studies that suggest recharging one way or the other makes you a better leader. The main point is to find a way to recharge regularly to avoid burnout. Peter Drucker, regarded as the father of modern management, worked with many industry leaders and the one thing he found in common among high performing CEOs was that none of them were extroverts.
Myth: Great leaders are born with the instinct to lead. You either got it or you don't.
Reality: Some people want to lead, but that doesn't make them great leaders. Great leadership is a lifetime goal; you do not become a great leader overnight. Sully Sullenberger, captain of the plane that landed safely on the Hudson River, credits his ability to bring the plane down without injury to any passengers to his many years of flying gliders and jets. All the training, learning and preparation made him ready for an unexpected emergency.
Myth: You're not leading if you don't have followers.
Reality: In a knowledge-based economy many people work in teams and a large number of people work remotely blurring the traditional hierarchical distinction between leader and follower. Leadership begins by leading yourself and can include having followers. Einstein was a great and remarkable leader. He never ran an organization and did not have followers in the traditional sense, but his thought leadership fundamentally changed our understanding of physics.
Myth: Great leaders keep their emotions in check.
Reality: Great leaders connect to others on a human level and that requires using emotions such as empathy, compassion and happiness. Everyday, people in your organization are dealing with trying personal situations.  We try to leave these matters at the door or somehow lock them up for the day until we get home, but that isn't very realistic. Effective leaders recognize that employees and colleagues are people and they may have pressing personal matters.
Myth: Leaders are the ones who get us into messes and get us out of them.
Reality: If we are really honest we will recognize that we are part of the messes that get created and we all contribute in some way through our action and inaction. If you want things to change, you have to get the ball moving in a new direction and can begin by changing your own behavioral choices and by setting a good example for others to follow.

How to Get the Best Personal Branding Imagereddit
During my time as a personal branding photographer I have seen some interesting corporate images. I have seen photos that have been taken in a bar, on street corners, in living rooms. Many are fuzzy, low res, grainy and too dark or too light.
Many photos show cleavage, or the elbows of people that were in the original image but have been cropped out.
You need a good-quality business photo for your website, LinkedIn profile, Twitter, Facebook and industry publications. People who want to do business with you might want to see what you look like; regardless of your expertise, a bad photo sends an amateur message.
I have been told time and time again of clients losing out on business because their images do not reflect their expertise within their field.
Why do some business people find it so difficult to obtain a clear headshot that makes them look like the confident professionals they really are? The brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text, which means people tend to gravitate towards images when scanning through a busy newsfeed, as visuals are much easier and quicker to digest. You should be making an impact with your corporate images.
If you want a decent image for your business, nothing beats speaking to a professional personal branding photographer. A specialist will be able to align your images with your corporate message.
A professional branding photographer will be able to spot an out-of-place hair or a crooked tie.
A good photographer will be able to provide the right backdrop, lighting and styling. A personal branding photographer will be able to make sure you look confident and authentic in your personal branding images.

BJP furious after Congress sends no invite to Narendra Modi for Nehru eventLetters to  the editor
Congress’ decision not to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to an international conference to mark Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary reflects the party’s narrow-mindedness and is a disrespect to the nation, the government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said today.
“I think they (Congress) are very narrow minded. There is no politics in being narrow minded. Politics means it should include everybody,” Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah told reporters on the sidelines of an event.
“Modi is so large-hearted that he is supporting Nehru’s birth anniversary (celebrations) despite the change of government. He is continuing to do that.
“From November 14-19, a lot of programmes are taking place. See how large-hearted the Prime Minister is and how narrow minded is the Congress,” Heptullah said.
Congress has not invited Modi to an international conference it is organising to mark the first Prime Minister’s 125th birth anniversary with party spokesperson Anand Sharma saying, “We have not given any invitation to the Prime Minister. We have invited all those who truly believe in democracy and the ideals of Nehru.”
Taking an exception to the move not to invite Modi, BJP said that Congress should not forget that he is the Prime Minister of the country and not of any party. By not inviting the Prime Minister, they are disrespecting the nation, BJP said.
“When Congress disrespects the Prime Minister, it should realise that it is in fact disrespecting the nation,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.
He added that Congress should stop feeling that one is trying to appropriate their heroes and should stop playing politics on the issue.
Congress has accused Modi of trying to appropriate leaders of the freedom movement like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Nehru by launching special schemes and diverting attention from their legacy.
“Can the heroes of yesteryears be stolen by anyone? No one is stealing their heroes. Congress should stop playing politics over people who contributed to the upliftment of this country,” Patra said.

I am confident of winning vote trust:FadnavisMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will have to establish his government's majority on the floor of the state legislature assembly on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:51 pm
The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the BJP would win the vote trust and that he was not going to break or poach upon any political party for eliciting support to cross the magic figure of 145. Fadnavis said, “ Yes, I am absolutely confident of winning the vote of trust on Wednesday.”
Fadnavis (44) who was sworn-in as the chief minister of Maharashtra on October 31, will have to establish his government’s majority on the floor of the state legislature assembly on Wednesday.
Officially, BJP has kept its plans ready to win the vote trust both with or without Shiv Sena, NCP. However, late night saw BJP evolving further strategies to consolidate its support base reaching out for support across parties including Sena.
During an informal talks, taking time out of his hectic schedule, Fadnavis said, “ I have the strategy in place. We are confident of number game and sure to win the confidence motion, I see no threat to the stability of the government.”
Throughout the day Fadnavis received stream of MLAs across party lines pledging support to his government. The chief minister indicated, there were feelers from members representing political parties including Shiv Sena who expressed desire to support the government. However, I am not in favour of breaking any political party. I am not in favour of breaking Shiv Sena, he added.
Till, late night BJP had already elicited support from smaller groups and independents. The BJP has 121 MLAs out of 288 MLAs in state assembly. However, support from smaller groups and individuals saw the BJP taking its tally upto 135 MLAs. The list of MLAs who made a beeline to give support to BJP across parties ensured the government would cross the half way mark of 145 MLAs. The MLAs from Vidarbha cutting across party lines wanted to lend a helping hand to Fadnavis government.
A senior Congress leader said, “ Although we have issued whip to our MLAs, if any body remains absent citing valid reasons we cannot disqualify them.” There were concerns expressed from Sena also with a section fearing some MLAs remaining “absent” would make it easier for BJP as it would drastically bring down the half way mark.
The rules mandate that half way mark is counted on total MLAs present during the voting in the state assembly. If total members present are 288 the half way mark would be 145. But if total members present come down to 265 to 270 with 15 to 18 remaining absent, the half way mark would come down to 135. The BJP is trying to win the vote trust with its own party MLAs plus smaller groups and independents.

("Since negotiations with…)
NEW DELHI: Normal banking operations like cheque clearance in public sector banks are likely to be hit on Wednesday as employee unions have decided to go on one-day nation-wide strike to press for wage revision.
"Since negotiations with Indian Banks' Association (IBA) failed, employees have no other option than going on strike," United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) Convener M V Murali told PTI.
"We have scaled down our demand from 25 per cent to 23 per cent (wage hike), but IBA is not yielding. It has been sticking to its earlier offer of 11 per cent which is not enough," Ashwini Rana, General Secretary of National Organisation of Bank Workers , said.
Banks, including the country's largest one SBI, has already informed customers about the inconvenience they are likely to face tomorrow.
"UFBU has given a notice to IBA calling for nationwide bank strike on the November 12 and All-India State Bank Officers' Federation and All-India State Bank of India Staff Federation being a part of UFBU will also participate in the said strike," SBI said in a statement.
"Since the said call is given at all-India level covering all banks, the bank will not be impacted separately," the statement said.
The staff of public sector banks had gone on a nationwide strike for two days beginning February 10 after discussions with the IBA had failed.
The wage revision of public sector bank employees has been due since November, 2012.
The UFBU is an umbrella organisation of nine bank employee and officer unions.
There are 27 public sector banks in the country with a combined employee strength of about 8 lakh. There are about 50,000 branches of these banks across the country.

(Jaitley chaired the first…)
NEW DELHI: Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley today emphasised the importance of digitisation of the cable TV sector to ensure better service, wider choice of content and transparency within the subscriber base.
Jaitley chaired the first meeting of the Consultative Committee of I&B Ministry to discuss the issue related to implementation of Phase III and Phase IV of the digitisation of cable TV sector during which he expressed his views.
The Minister, who also holds the charge of the Finance Ministry, said that as a process, digitisation had also brought about a change in the broadcasting landscape as well as enabled broadband penetration within the country.
At the meeting which was also attended by Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, MoS for I&B, ministry officials made a presentation giving an overview of the digitisation process. The presentation highlighted the steps taken during Phase I and II and the proposed road map for Phase III and IV.
Officials made specific reference to the initiatives undertaken by the Ministry including the discussions with stakeholders and the campaign to sensitise masses, a statment released here said.
The Information and Broadcasting Ministry has been working to usher in complete digitisation in the cable TV sector across the country by December 31, 2016.
Members of the Committee gave suggestions to ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders were addressed. It was emphasised that multi-system operators (MSOs) should operationalise grievance redressal mechanisms to address the concerns of cable subscribers, the statement said.
It was also emphasised that the quality of domestically manufactured Set Top Boxes (STBs) must be ensured. The issue of digitisation plan of Doordarshan terrestrial network and the steps being taken to implement the process was also deliberated upon.
It was also mentioned that the Ministry needed to take proactive steps to ensure timely registration of MSO applications so as to ensure the large presence of MSOs to implement the digitisation programme during Phase III and Phase IV.
During the discussions, emphasis was laid on the efforts being made by the Ministry to integrate the domestic production of set top boxes (STBs) with the 'Make in India' programme.
Members were also informed that interactions were being held with the STB fraternity to ensure that they utilised their capacity to fulfil the demand for STBs during Phase III and Phase IV.

US stocks steady  Brent crude hits 4-year lowDow Jones
(Oil prices fell further…)
NEW YORK: US stock prices were little changed on Tuesday, hovering near Monday's record closes, while the dollar rose as investors weighed the prospect of further stimulus to aid the recovery of the global economy.
Oil prices fell further on the stronger dollar and robust output from US shale fields, with Brent crude dropping to a four-year low below $82 a barrel.
"We have equity demand driven by the perception of improving economics and companies' earnings prospects," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
In mid-morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.63 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,624.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 1.70 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,039.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.04 points, or 0.07 percent, at 4,654.66.
European shares were boosted by positive results from companies including Germany's Henkel and Hochtief . The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose as much as 0.5 percent before retreating to a 0.3 percent gain.
Earlier, a 2.1 percent rise propelled Tokyo's Nikkei to its highest close since October 2007 on speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might postpone a sales tax hike planned for next October and call a snap election.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was little changed at 420.18.
The rally in Japanese stocks helped push the yen lower versus the dollar. The greenback hit a seven-year high against the Japanese currency, hitting a seven-year high of 116.11 yen in European trading on the EBS trading system.
The euro was little changed at $1.2420, not far from a two-year low of $1.2358 hit on Friday.
In the bond market, yields on lower-rated Spanish and Italian government bonds fell after European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch said on Monday that the "critical" state of the euro zone economy made ECB purchases of government debt possible.
The US bond market was closed for the Veterans Day holiday.
In the energy market, Brent crude futures in London fell 79 cents, or 0.96 percent at $81.55 a barrel after hitting a four-year low of $81.23. It has lost nearly 30 percent since June, partly due to rising production, especially in the United States .
US crude was last down 20 cents, or 0.26 percent, at $77.20.
Spot gold rose $4.77 or 0.41 percent, to $1,154.90 an ounce, rebounding from a 2 percent drop on Monday, as bargain hunters emerged.

Both sides see India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway an opportunity for industrial cooperation
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Myanmarese President Thein Sein met at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of this eastern neighbour of India, on Tuesday, the big focus of discussions was improving connectivity between what they called “brother countries.”
The two leaders spoke about the need for more direct air links, as well as an India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway, and the Kaladan multi-modal transport project. The two nations are now not connected by direct flights. They signed an MoU for a bus service between Imphal and Mandalay only this year.
“Both sides see the trilateral highway as an opportunity for industrial cooperation and sought to explore the possibility of setting up industrial parks along the highway. President Thein Sein said that as India grows and develops, Myanmar will also benefit. The possibility of India investing in special economic zones in Myanmar was discussed,” said a press release.
Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations.

India, Myanmar to raise bilateral trade
Although bilateral trade between India and Myanmar is well below its potential, efforts are being made to enhance it, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told presspersons on Tuesday.
Bilateral trade stood at less than $2 billion in 2013.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Myanmarese President Thein Sein, at their meeting at Nay Pyi Taw, also discussed other economic ties and cooperation in the oil and gas sector, as well as the need for more cultural contacts, including sending Myanmarese students to Nalanda University.
The meeting was one of more than 20 bilateral ones Mr. Modi is scheduled to have during his 10-day, three-nation tour during which he will attend the ASEAN-India summit, the East Asia Summit and the G-20 and Pacific Island Leaders-India summits.
During the tour, he is expected to engage with leaders of 40 countries.
On Wednesday, Mr. Modi will meet Myanmar democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as well as leaders of Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Singapore.
He will also attend the ASEAN-India summit with 10 other countries, where a free trade agreement is being discussed. “ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration,” Mr. Modi said in a statement earlier.
On Thursday, Mr. Modi will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang for the first time, in a structured bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the East Asian Summit. The meeting comes nearly two months after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Delhi. They are expected to review progress in ties based on their announcem-ents during the visit.
In particular, sources said, Mr. Modi will speak about India’s concern over “incursions” by the People’s Liberation Army into the Line of Actual Control.

Hellmann's sues over company's use of 'Mayo'

You have to break some eggs to make an omelet and, according to a lawsuit from the maker of Hellmann's, the same goes for mayonnaise.
The food company Unilever is suing a California company that uses the word "Mayo" in its sandwich spread name, saying that federal regulators and dictionaries define mayonnaise as a spread that contains eggs.
The suit claims false advertising by the company Hampton Creek for labeling its egg-free product "Just Mayo." Unilever says in a complaint filed in federal court that the world mayo implies that the product is mayonnaise, and Just Mayo is "stealing market share from Hellmann's"
"Consumers and cooks have an expectation that mayonnaise should both taste and perform like mayonnaise. Just Mayo does neither," the complaint states, noting that the Hampton Creek product's oils separate when heated.
Unilever holds the biggest share of the U.S. mayonnaise market, which is estimated to be worth $2 billion annually, according to market-research firm Euromonitor. That's more than twice the size of the ketchup market.
Hampton Creek did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday morning. The company told The Wall Street Journal that it doesn't mislead consumers because it advertises the absence of eggs as a benefit.
But a marketing professor hired by Unilever to survey consumers found in an online survey that more than half thought Just Mayo was mayonnaise when they saw the label. The professor said in a document filed last week that 822 consumers participated in the research.
Just Mayo is the first product from Hampton Creek, a San Francisco-based startup that touts the backing of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Li Ka-shing, Asia's wealthiest person. Just Mayo is available at Dollar Tree, Whole Foods and Kroger stores, among other locations.
Hellmann's celebrated its 100th anniversary last year. Mayonnaise originated in France in the 1700s, when a chef seeking to make a creamy sauce combined oil and egg yolks.

Buy low. Sell high. That’s how you make money in stocks, right? Not so fast.
New research shows buying stocks when they’ve already soared – has been a pretty good way to make money. The strategy is called momentum investing. Pile into winning stocks – and ride the wave higher. “Buying high and selling higher” has been a strategy that’s worked during the past 20 years, says Sam Stovall of S&P Capital IQ.
Here’s the math. The S&P 500 has gained nearly 10% on average each year between 1991 and now. That’s the market’s return and what you get if you buy and hold the market. But investors who rode the best 10 sub-industries of the previous year – and repeated each year – scored a 15% average annual gain, Stovall finds. Winning stocks tend to keep winning – at least for the following year, Stovall says.
Following this strategy, what sectors should you buy now? Stovall lists 10 sectors with the momentum now. That includes airlines, aluminum, biotech, brewers and  distillers. But also home entertainment software, human resources, railroads, residential REITs and semiconductor.
Not everyone agrees with this high-octane strategy. Long-term academic research says that factors like size and valuation have more influence on future stock prices than past price movements. Many investors will be better off buying a diversified basket of stocks of different sizes and valuations — and holding on.
But when the market seems to be headed straight up – it’s hard to argue with momentum. Until it stops.

On Veterans Day  10 photos of troops returning homeBy Dan Lamothe November 11 Follow @danlamothe

On the 11th day of the 11th hour of the 11th day of November in 1918, the armistice between Germany and the Allied Powers went into effect, ending The Great War after more than four years of fighting and the deaths of more than 9 million troops and 7 million civilians.
Armistice Day grew out of that momentous occasion, and was celebrated in numerous countries across the world. It became a federal holiday in the United States in 1938, and was renamed Veterans Day in 1954, after World War II and the Korean War created millions of new war veterans, according to an Army history of the holiday .
The holiday is sometimes confused with Memorial Day , which is celebrated in May and has a different purpose: honoring America’s fallen service members. Veterans Day is meant to honor all those who have served, both in combat and outside of it.
In honor of the holiday, here’s a simple tribute on Checkpoint: 10 photos of service members returning from deployments:

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Ideas are cheap in our world today. Tactical execution trumps everything else.
Niche in and find a foxhole to defend and ignore the false promises on the horizon. In most markets you'll have one or two market leaders (see Google and Yahoo) and over time this is probably going to distill down to one.
Every market has competition. End of story. Brands that delude themselves by ignoring and/or not doing competitive review will get their heads handed to them on a platter.
Web site design drives your overall strategy: its' the foundation for much of your tactical marketing and it's excruciatingly painful to rebuild a web site after it's been launched and fraught with peril.
A viable digital marketing strategy is today much more than a web site, great graphics and baseline content .
One of your greatest challenges is grappling with "you don't know what you don't know" - your facing a bewildering mix of technology and process and with little framework for perspective.
Data is exploding at an unprecedented rate, projected to be ten times greater in the next six years.
Content sharing is now platform agnostic: it's anything (text, comments, images, videos, ebooks, social shares) and anywhere and there is so much more of it.
Consumer demographics are shifting rapidly from one social platform to another - brand loyalty is hard to come by.
Bigger brands are leveraging their marketing muscle (social influence) to reach high value customers in multiple ways and outspending smaller brands.
Native advertising is on the rise and helping to blur the lines of how consumers perceive "real" content vs. ads.
Every business small or large is by necessity of changes in the digital landscape (more platforms and higher content volumes) being forced to become a publisher.
The demand for greater levels of technical expertise driven by platform proliferation and inter connectivity of data is overwhelming the ability and resources of small businesses.

The Best Thing Ever Written About Strategyreddit
This weekend, I've been revisiting my misspent youth, by reading again the musings of Bruce Doolin Henderson and his colleagues from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in its early years.  When BCG was an unknown, tiny company, Bruce spent his energy on just two things: inventing the concepts of "business strategy" from scratch; and writing very short "tracts" -- what today we would call blogs -- in the form of dark green Perspectives, each on one aspect of strategy, which he then mailed to CEOs.  Amazingly, this ploy worked.  Or perhaps it is not so amazing, because the quality of BCG "posts" was incredibly high, far higher than almost anything about business on the entire internet today.
And you know what? The early stuff was by far the best.
Today I've picked out two of these essays, one by Bruce and one by a colleague, and explain why they are so useful today.
The Product Portfolio (1970)
Yes, this is the famed "BCG Box", aka the Growth-Share Matrix.  In this early version of the idea invented two years earlier, the "dogs" are called "pets" - these are the low market share businesses in low growth markets.  What BCG soon was to call "cash cows" - after starting by calling them "gold mines", in many ways a better description - are shown on the 1970 chart as simply "cash flow": the high share businesses in low growth markets.  The question mark was always called that - low share, but high growth market.  And my beloved "star business" - with high market share and high market growth - was always called that.
I will focus just on the star business, as I did in my book The Star Principle.  This is what Bruce had to say in 1970:
"The high-share, high-growth product is the star ... The payoff for leadership is very high indeed if it is achieved early and maintained until growth slows.  Investment in market share during the growth phase can be very attractive if you have the cash. Growth in market is compounded by growth in share. Increases in share increase the margin. High margin permits higher leverage with equal safety.  The resulting profitability permits higher payment of earnings after financing normal growth.  The return on investment is enormous."
There we have, in a terse, tightly-argued single paragraph, about the most profound truth ever written about strategy.
Read it again and again, and you see the force of Bruce's micro-economic logic.
There is a virtuous circle that is generated by investing in a star business in the early, high-growth days of a new market.  The star grows very fast - it becomes ten times, a hundred times, maybe several thousand times bigger than today.  And while growing, it is also cash positive and highly profitable.  It also increases its margins and competitive security over time, as it becomes bigger and bigger relative to its rivals, who are stuck with higher costs and usually negative cash flow.
It is a venture capitalist's wet dream.
It is also my investment philosophy, and I can tell you, hand on heart, that it really works.
Yes, we may cavil with one or two of Bruce's assertions and assumptions.  With the benefit of decades of experience and thought, we can see the weakness in his qualifying statement in the second sentence, "if you have the cash".
Bruce made two dubious assumptions: that strategy was largely a financial game; and that the firm's product portfolio was a closed system, where cash had to come from other parts of the portfolio (the cash cows).
We know now that all the cash in the world may not allow a star business to remain successful if a rival comes up with a product that is easier to use, more useful, or more artful.  Product innovation is a more powerful tool for seizing and keeping market leadership in a star business than having a big bank balance - look, for instance, at the fate of IBM in personal computers, or of Xerox when faced with competition in desktop copiers from Ricoh and Canon, or at what happened to Kodak.  In the world of the star, cash is not king.  If it were, no garage-shop boot-strapping entrepreneur would ever win against a large, cash-rich corporation.
And we also know that the idea of the product portfolio was flawed.  Some of the most successful companies in the world in the last hundred years or so have been (or were when most successful) single product star-business companies - Coca-Cola and McDonald's for example.  If a company just has a single star business, it can obtain funding from outside the firm (the venture capital industry was very small when Bruce wrote in 1970, but it was itself a very high growth market about to explode, and large companies could always tap their shareholders for more equity capital).
But hey - the insight that the most wonderful business in the world is a star business is priceless.  If you know this one fact about business, and act on it, you are far better off than all the business school professors and alumni, and all the most highly paid consultants.
Praise be to Bruce!
The Evils of Average Costing (1975)
This perspective, by the late Richard (Dick) Lochridge, discusses what happens when firms "average cost".  This means that when they calculate the profitability of different products, they average the overhead costs, assigning the same percentage to each product.  This is as common now as it was back in the 1970s.
Why is average costing a problem?  Because high volume products typically have much lower overhead costs, so averaging the costs overstates the cost of these products, and understates the cost of the lower volume products.  This encourages firms to introduce more and more products, believing erroneously that they are profitable.
"As a result," says Lochridge, "broad product lines tend to raise the manufacturing cost of all products.  Cost averaging ignores this and therefore overstates the real and potential cost of the high-volume products ... The broader the product line and the larger the number and variety of the customers, the greater the use of overhead cost averaging.  Since the leader typically has the largest product line and the biggest customer base, he tends to do the most cost averaging."
Therefore, cost averaging leads to loss of market share:
"The new entrant in the business is forced to focus because of his basic cost disadvantage ... he focuses on those sectors of the market that are being overcharged ... The overcharged customers tend to be the largest and most price-sensitive ... The leader abandons them to the new entrant because his average costing reports them as being less profitable."
The new entrant should therefore focus on the single biggest-volume product, and the big customers who are more profitable than they appear, and price to win this business.
The market leader should analyse its costs by customer group and by product, without averaging any costs.  It should allocate overheads according to how much overhead is really necessary or used.  This will normally result in big customers and high volume products being much more profitable than they appear to be under average costing.  The prices of those products should then be cut, to ward off danger from new entrants.
Boring stuff?   Maybe.  But absolutely vital.  Too often the market leader shoots itself in the foot by exaggerating the cost of providing its biggest volume products and the cost of serving its largest and best customers, opening the way for smaller rivals to make hay.
The Filofax Example
One of the oddities of the early BCG Perspectives is that they almost never give examples.  So to make the two points above come alive, I'll give you my example - Filofax, my first serious foray into venture capital investing.
Around 1990 Filofax was a star business in trouble.  It was about to lose its star status as a new entrant, Microfile, was taking business hand over fist from Filofax in its biggest market, the UK.  Filofax, you may recall, was the iconic brand in non-electronic personal organizers, and had grown dramatically in sales and value in the early to mid-1980s.  When I investigated it as a rescue investment in 1991-2, it was under pressure from Microfile, which provided a look-alike organizer at half the Filofax price.  Sales at Filofax were plummeting as it lost market share and the company was in danger of going bust.
The problem was very simple.  Microfile had focussed on a single product - its "filled organizer" with a diary, pages for contacts, a Tube map, and various other standard contents.  By just making this product, it had been able to undercut Filofax's costs, despite not having Filofax's volume.
By contrast, the Filofax product range was out of control.  It had a multiplicity of wallets and inserts available for everything under the sun - bird-watching, watch-collecting, esoteric sports and hobbies.  The result was a huge overhang of worthless stock, and complete confusion amongst the Filofax retailers.
I organized a rescue bid for Filofax, changed the management, and focussed on producing a new version of the Filofax filled organizer.  We cut costs dramatically, including almost the whole of the marketing budget!  We cut the Filofax price so it was just above the Microfile price - the level of brand premium (10-15%) that our retailers said was sustainable.  Within three years, Filofax volume had quadrupled and we were making money again.  Filofax was again a clear star business, increasing its market share and leaving Microfile behind.  When we sold the business - just as electronic organizers were getting their act together - we made seven times our money.
Thank you, BCG!
Concepts make money.
Next week I will reflect on a remarkably important and neglected piece by Bruce Henderson on Business Thinking - as fresh as when written in 1977.  It contains insight that is as vital for our personal lives as for our business dealings.
If you want to read the BCG Perspectives for yourself, they are available in book form: Perspectives on Strategy, edited by Carl W Stern and George Stalk Jr.  You might also want to read my book The Star Principle.
You may have noticed that I sometimes write about business theory and examples, and sometimes about psychological and philosophical issues that affect both business and the rest of our lives.  Please let me know if you want more of one or the other, or whether I have the balance now about right.

Smriti Irani targets AMU VC for library  ban  on women undergradsEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was today at the centre of a raging controversy over not giving access to women undergraduates to the main library in the campus, evoking sharp criticism even as government sought explanation over the “insult to daughters”.
The AMU cited space constraints and refuted the charge of having a “sexist approach”.
Taking serious note of it, Human Resource Ministry asked explanation from the AMU Vice Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah with Minister Smriti Irani asserting that education and constitution rights were same for all.
“…there are some reports which hurt you as a woman and also agitates you that when we attained freedom there was a belief that education and constitution rights were same for all….and now we get reports that amounts to insult to daughters,” Smriti Irani said on the sidelines of a function in Delhi.
The Vice Chancellor’s remarks that allowing female undergraduates will attract “four times more boys” to the library, added fuel to the fire.
Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah termed the Vice Chancellor’s remarks as “appalling” and “shocking” while the new MoS in the Ministry Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said such remarks were “not acceptable in a civilised society”.
Terming Shah’s statement as “regressive and antediluvian”, National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam wondered “Is it legal for them (AMU) to bar any student regardless of gender from accessing such services in a university?
The Vice Chancellor’s explanation that there was no fresh ban and that undergraduate girl students studying at the off-campus Women’s College do not have access to facilities of the Maulana Azad Library since it was established in 1960 found few takers.
He said there over 4,000 female undergraduates and the library cannot accommodate them due to space constraints. “There will be no place even to stand (if this is allowed)” he said.
Shah noted that all postgraduate girls and women research scholars “have been enjoying round the clock access to the Maulana Azad Library since its inception” and rejected allegations of gender bias, terming them “not only erroneous but mischievous and defamatory”.

Shiv Sena attacks  dangerous-for-Hindus  AIMIMLetters to  the editor
After Uddhav Thackeray hit out at All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), his party Shiv Sena today stepped up attack on the Hyderabad-based outfit,accusing it of poisoning the minds of minority community and demanded that Maharashtra government take strict action against it.
“The Owaisi brothers (MP Asaduddin and MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi) are in the habit of conceiving and spreading fundamentalist ideas. Both of them have poisoned the minds of Muslims in the country. After achieving success in Nanded Municipal Corporation, they now want to spread their wings to the Marathwada region,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.
In an apparent reference to AIMIM, which won two seats in recently held Maharashtra assembly elections, Uddhav had on Sunday said, “Forces which are dangerous for Hindus have raised their heads in the recent Assembly polls.”
Backing former Union Home Minister and senior Congress leader Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter Praniti’s comments seeking a ban on the outfit, the Sena said people should come forward and support her.
“Praniti Shinde has only conveyed the sentiments of the people of India. Only Shiv Sena has been against the working style of AIMIM. Now even the Congress is speaking against the party, which is admirable,” it said.
“The AIMIM has won two seats in the assembly polls and won second or third place in 14 constituencies across the state. This has emboldened them. (Devendra) Fadnavis government should take strict action against this party. Shinde has made her stance very clear, which cannot be ignored. Shiv Sena will stand firmly behind her,” it said.
AIMIM made its debut in Maharashtra walking away with substantial chunk of Muslim votes in many areas and winning two seats.
Though only two (journalist Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad and Waris Pathan from Byculla) of its 26 nominees won, it has rankled established parties in many constituencies.

Brent oil falls to below $81 per barrel  a new 4-year lowAmerican Petroleum Institute
(Brent extended losses,…)
NEW YORK: Oil prices continued to seek a bottom on Tuesday amid worries about growing US supplies, with benchmark Brent crude hitting a four-year low and nearing a test below the psychologically important $80 a barrel mark.
"The theme remains the same in oil: We have no meaningful way to cut production and the multi-year lows in prices that we're hitting are feeding the hunt for even lower bottoms," said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
Brent was down $1.36 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $81 a barrel by 1703 GMT, after falling earlier to $80.46, the lowest level since September 2010.
US oil's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures
slid 30 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $77.10 a barrel, after a session low at $76.42.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) was expected to report at 2130 GMT that US commercial crude stocks rose last week while inventories of distillates fell and gasoline supplies remained steady, a Reuters poll showed.
The US Department of Energy's statistical arm the Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its inventory data on Wednesday.
The Reuters poll forecast crude stocks rose 300,000 barrels on average last week.
"You have suggestions of an anaemic demand story for oil last week," said James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.
A strong dollar initially weighed on oil as the greenback hit a seven-year high against the yen. By midmorning though, the dollar was down against a basket of currencies, but crude prices continued to slide.
Fear of supply disruptions in Libya, where a rival government seized the country's capital and took control of its most productive oilfield, El Sharara, helped limit the downside in oil earlier in the session, traders said.
Falling crude prices have had little impact on shale oil drilling in the United States, with output from the fastest-growing and largest shale fields showing no sign of slowing, a separate EIA report said on Monday.
JPMorgan slashed its 2015 Brent price forecast by $33 to $82 per barrel on Monday, citing supply pressures in the Atlantic Basin and the apparent inability of OPEC member states to work cohesively to cut production.

Swaraj seeks increased UAE investments durin...External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj seeks increased UAE investments during visit
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 10.14PM IST
(Swaraj said, "I feel that…)
DUBAI: Seeking to allay fears of potential investors from UAE, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today highlighted the new Indian government's economic performance in the past five months as she invited businesses here to join hands as partners in India's growth story.
"I understand the apprehensions in the minds of some of you regarding your past experiences of investments in India. But let me assure you that our government is committed to honour the commitments made and opening up of sectors for foreign investment," Swaraj said during an interaction with top business leaders in Abu Dhabi.
"Bilateral Trade and Investment Protection Agreement (BTIPA) between India and UAE have entered into force with effect from September 23, 2014 and would facilitate safety of your investments," she said.
She said UAE is also one of the countries with which India has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) having certain preferential features conducive for increased investment in India.
BTIPA and DTAA, thus, provide the necessary framework under which investments from UAE into India would not only be safe but would also provide good returns, she said.
Swaraj said, "I feel that there is no better time than now for the UAE business community to join our hands as partners in India's growth story. There are immense possibilities to enhance trade and investment cooperation".
"Indian investors are already one of the largest groups in the UAE. In turn, UAE can also become a substantial source for meeting our investment requirements. Moreover, the UAE and, especially Dubai, can become our gateway to larger MENA region and, indeed, to Africa as a whole," she said.
"Our infrastructure financing needs are estimated to be USD 1 trillion in the next five years. Our ties with UAE have grown on all fronts. UAE has been one of our largest trading partners for the past several years. Our bilateral economic and commercial engagement is broad-based encompassing a wide range of products and services.
"However, given the size of our economies and the wide convergence of interests in many areas, the present level of trade and investments can be enhanced even further," she said.
Later, Swaraj also met Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Nahyan expressed hope that the visit would contribute to strengthening relations between the two countries.
During the meeting, both sides reviewed the existing bilateral relations and took stock of progress and development in joint cooperation in many areas and looked into the ways of enhancing them for common interests. PTI KUN AKJ KUN 11112050 NNNN

Chhattisgarh: 11 women die after sterilisation surgery; PM seeks probeEleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Intermission: Veterans DayBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 11 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Since it is Veterans Day, I have done a lot of thinking this morning about the most powerful depictions of veterans in pop culture in recent years. Documentaries like “The Invisible War,” about the epidemic of sexual assault in the armed services, are undeniably important, and that one appears to have helped bring about real change. But while it is important for pop culture to communicate the costs of service, I think it also matters for us to see depictions of veterans who are more than the sum of their damage and in civilian contexts other than law enforcement. Someone like Edgar Quintero (Desmin Borges) on “You’re the Worst” comes to mind. So who are your favorite fictional veterans and service-members?

• “ Can the Republicans save MSNBC? ” by James Poniewozik: Responding to MSNBC’s ratings slump, Poniewozik suggests that what the liberal-oriented cable channel needs is to be the underdog again.
“With the Obama administration six years old, under attack and in its lame duck phase, there’s no excitement anymore in the Obamaism of Rachel Maddow and company. And with the thrill, the energy, the sense of forward momentum, goes the desire to watch. Its progressive audience may not be changing their views, but some are demonstrably changing the channel,” Poniewozik writes. “Around this time in 2006, Fox’s ratings were down, while CNN and MSNBC’s were rising. And there were plenty of analyses–I wrote some of them–that in part, this may have been because the Fox lineup, ascendent on the early post-9/11 era, was feeling tired and malaised. It couldn’t have been that much fun for conservative hosts to defend Bush after Katrina and around the punishing midterms. Nor, it seemed, was it as much fun for the conservative fanbase to watch.”
• “Lessons from the Church of Satan ,” by Alissa Wilkinson: Yesterday, I highlighted a wonderful interview with the head of the Church of Satan about its recommended movies. Today, I would be remiss if I did not pass along this meditation on the interview from Christianity Today film critic (and my pal) Alissa Wilkinson. Wilkinson has been trying to encourage Christians to think differently about religious movies, and she expands her thinking on the subject in this piece.
“A ‘religious’ film asked the religious questions—what is the nature of humans, what is the end of mankind, how ought we to direct our lives—while ‘Religious’ films give a particular answer to that question derived from an organized system of some sort,” Wilkinson explains. “And so a film made by a non-religious filmmaker may very well be a religious film, or even a Religious film; a Religious filmmaker may also make an ultimately non-religious film, or a film that gives answers derived from quite another belief system. (I’d venture to argue that most of the religious films I’ve seen have been made by non-religious filmmakers; many Religious films, by contrast, have not been religious.) In this case, the Church of Satan recommends films that they see as giving Satanist answers to the religious questions. It sure looks like the Satanists have a much better grasp on this than many other faithful.”
• “ Behind the Famous Story, a Difficult ‘Wild Truth ,’” by Heller McAlpin: The NPR book critic reviews a new memoir from Carine McCandless, whose brother Chris’s death in the Alaskan wilderness became the subject of Jon Krakauer’s “Into The Wild” and a film of the same title. While Krakauer has continued to report on the causes of McCandless’s death, Carine explains more of his life before he set out.
“Carine McCandless gets the grim truth out of the way up front in her introduction, with the quick determination of someone tearing off a painful Band-aid: She and her brother Chris grew up with a volatile, viciously abusive father who made their weak-willed yet hyper-competent mother both his victim and his accomplice,” McAlpin writes. “Carine, who was a valuable source for both Krakauer’s book and Sean Penn’s movie adaptation, had shared this dark family history with Krakauer back in the early 1990s, though strictly off the record in order to protect her parents ‘from full exposure in case they could change for the better.’ (Not surprisingly, they didn’t.) And even though it compromised his book, Krakauer honored Carine’s restrictions. Instead, he hinted at the truth with repeated allusions to an ‘overbearing’ father, which some readers caught, though many did not.”

Scientists investigate the cat genome to see how wildcats turned into lazy furballsBy Rachel Feltman November 11 Follow @rachelfeltman

Your house cat isn't as domestic as you think. Unlike dogs, which have been distinct from their wolf ancestors for over 10,000 years, cats only started living with humans at all around 9,000 years ago. In other words, they started the domestication process after Fido had already finished.
But there are obviously differences between a cuddly pet kitten and a fierce wild bobcat, so scientists have compared a few cat genomes to pinpoint what distinguishes them genetically. Their findings are reported in The Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences .
So what makes your fluffy, taciturn house pet different from a vicious wild beast? It turns out that we've managed to influence some changes at the DNA level.
"Cats, unlike dogs, are really only semi-domesticated," senior author Wes Warren, associate professor of genetics at The Genome Institute at Washington University, said in a statement . "They only recently split off from wild cats, and some even still breed with their wild relatives. So we were surprised to find DNA evidence of their domestication."
The scientists compared the genomes of several domesticated cat breeds to wildcats, looking for places where house cats had changed rapidly. They found three genetic changes that might be related to change in temperament -- which would indicate that they were influenced by human need. After all, we know that domestic dogs were selected from wolves who were less afraid of humans, and friendlier. Over time, this led to the gentler (and less intelligent) creatures that we keep in our homes.
In the case of kitties, scientists found that house cats had more mutations in genes known to decrease aggression, help with memory formation, and allow learning based on positive and negative reinforcement. They also had genes that help in the digestion of plants -- probably because domestic cats had more food available if they could stomach all human scraps -- while wildcats are totally carnivorous.
The main drive of the study was actually to improve human medicine, WIRED reports . Because there are cat-ified versions of diseases like diabetes and HIV, the researchers hope that studying the feline genome will help scientists improve human treatments. But in the meantime, now we know the genes that help make your favorite cat a solitary, sleek (but usually harmless) mooch.

Tribune Media reports lower third quarter earnings0
Liguori cited several factors for the decline in core TV advertising: weakness in overall ad spending, political ads displacing some regular advertising, the elimination of "unprofitable sports programming" and "softness" in Fox Television's prime-time ratings. Tribune Media owns or operates 42 television stations and is the largest Fox affiliate station group.
With television revenues flat, Liguori went to great lengths during the call Tuesday to position Tribune Media as more than a local broadcast company.
"While we experienced declines in core advertising revenues, our business transformation and diversification strategy is beginning to show results," Liguori said. "As a percentage of overall revenues, core advertising from our local station group represented only 62 percent of our total consolidated revenues."
Tribune Media's real estate portfolio consists of 80 properties and some 8 million square feet of space, from the Times Mirror Square complex in Los Angeles to Tribune Tower and the Freedom Center printing facility in Chicago. The company generated more than $13 million in rental revenue during the third quarter, most of it from Tribune Publishing, which leases about 4.1 million square feet.
"We are managing these real estate assets for maximum cash flow, and with focus and purpose are pursuing development opportunities for some of our properties to realize maximum value over time," Liguori said.
The digital and data segment generated nearly $45 million in revenue during the quarter, up from about $19 million last year. Much of that revenue came from the February acquisition of music metadata company Gracenote. During the third quarter, Tribune Media pulled the plug on Newsbeat, a mobile app launched in March to provide audio streaming of newspaper stories, the company said.
WGN America remains integral to Tribune Media's long-term strategy. By January, WGN America will be about halfway toward converting from superstation to a full-fledged cable network, opening the door to increased distribution, ad revenue and affiliate fees from cable providers. The plan includes rolling out more original programming such as "Salem" and "Manhattan," while working to expand WGN America's reach to 90 million homes from 75 million over the next few years, Liguori said.
"We have a three- to five-year horizon to transform WGN America into a formidable general entertainment network," Liguori said.
The former Tribune Co. spun off its newspaper business, including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, to focus on its higher-growth broadcasting and entertainment assets, as well as real estate holdings and equity investments. In September, Tribune Media filed registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for listing its stock on a major exchange. Tribune Media trades as an over-the-counter stock under the symbol TRBAA.
Executives on Tuesday said they expect Tribune Media to be listed on a major exchange by December, pending approval by the SEC.
Tribune Media has seen its stock price fall by about 30 percent since spinning off its publishing assets Aug. 4. Last month, the company authorized a $400 million stock repurchase program to be funded with existing cash balances. Tribune Media Chief Financial Officer Steven Berns said the stock repurchase can "commence shortly," and reiterated the reasons behind the move during Tuesday's call.
"We felt that the share price was low ... and did not represent full value," Berns said. "We think the share repurchase is a good first step."
Tribune Media has nearly 94 million outstanding shares of Class A stock. About 36 percent of outstanding Class A common stock is owned by Oaktree Capital Management; Angelo, Gordon & Co.; and JPMorgan Chase, the former senior creditors of Tribune Co., which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of 2012.
The stock was trading down more than 2 percent to $60.70 Tuesday morning.

Why You Need to Create Visions (Not Just Goals)reddit
Recently, I was listening to Andrew Ferebee's "Knowledge For Men" podcast (which, by the way, I just love), and Ferebee was interviewing Jordan Belfort, the man who The Wolf of Wall Street is based on. I was blown away by something Belfort said regarding goals versus visions. In part, Belfot said, "Too many people go around setting goals." [Insert me saying to myself -- "That's me!".] Further, he said (and now I'm paraphrasing) that people who go around setting goals and accomplishing them without having a vision are usually negative because they hit a goal and then move on to the next one without having a higher purpose, which is demotivating.
This was an "aha" moment for me. As a huge proponent of intentional living, I am constantly setting and achieving goals. However, I never thought about a concrete vision for the goals I set (for my life, business, or anything else). After searching around the web, I discovered there isn't much out there on this topic and felt compelled to write on the distinction between goals and vision to encourage you to create a vision for yourself (life, career, or whatever else) in hopes that it will leave you happier overall.
Goals: An Overview
A goal is a specific target to achieve something. It includes the strategies and tactics you use to move toward your vision. You should set and achieve goals only that promote and are in line with your vision. This is why, if you don't have a vision, goals alone can be defeating (i.e., without a vision, each goal is just something you've completed without a larger "why" in mind).
Examples of goals:
1. To lose 10 pounds
2. To save for a down payment on a house
3. To run your own company
4. To get out of credit card debt
Vision: An Overview
Vision is your why. Vision gives something direction. It's your desired future. Your vision includes what you believe in (your core values) and what you want in your future (what you want to be). It's the powerful reason why you want to do something; your overarching purpose. Your vision is your passion and keeps you excited and motivated. It's what inspires you to do whatever it is you want to do.
For money, business or career, your vision may be very specific. For your life and relationships, your vision may be broader. In either case, your vision should be clear because it is the foundation on which you build.
To create a vision, begin by identifying your core values, your passions, what you believe to be your purpose, and how you envision your life. From there, be more specific and remember to be clear. Your vision should embody your values and your view of the future without being too generic. Your vision can also change over time. The point is to have one so you know why you are doing what you do, and you are happier doing it. The same process applies when you are creating a vision for any other aspect of your life, such as your career or business.
Examples (that match the goals from above):
1. To live a healthy, well-balanced life
2. To provide a happy, loving home for your family in a safe community
3. To help people ________ (insert whatever problem your business is aimed at helping solve)
4. To be free from financial "slavery" and be an example to your children
Creating Goals and Visions
Creating a vision may seem awkward or difficult, but it is definitely worth it. After you know what your vision is, creating goals that are in line with your vision will come more naturally. Instead of feeling incomplete when you accomplish a goal, you will consider your higher purpose, which will leave you happier overall because you'll have your "why" in mind.

AOL Latest Tech Company to Cut Ties With ALECreddit
Following criticism of it teaching climate change denial , AOL, the owner of The Huffington Post, became the latest major corporation to announce a decision to cease funding for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), following similar statements in recent months from a wave of other tech firms including Google , Facebook , Yelp , Yahoo and SAP America .
In a statement to the good government group Common Cause , which had collected more than 21,000 petition signatures calling for the firm to leave ALEC, AOL did not confirm whether the revelations that climate change denial was the motivation for it leaving now, although the timing would suggest that it was.
The recent exodus of tech firms from ALEC has come following increased awareness of the group's role in teaching state legislators climate change denial during its closed door meetings. Funded by some of the largest coal, oil and gas companies , including Koch Industries , ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy , ALEC has long opposed action to tackle climate change, blocked efforts for any kind of limit on carbon pollution and opposed the development of renewable energy. Following renewed public concern about climate change, ALEC's corporate funders appear increasingly unwilling to be publicly associated with the group.
Teaching Climate Change Denial
In August, CMD obtained and released documents from the ALEC Annual Meeting in Dallas, Texas, which took place that month, with legislators being told during a presentation from famed climate change denier Joe Bast of the Heartland Institute, that "there is no scientific consensus on the human role in climate change" and "there is no need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and no point in attempting to do so." Heartland is best known for a billboard campaign which compared those that believe in climate change with terrorists such as the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski.
Another session during the same conference was led by staff from The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), another climate change denial group, which was titled "How to Think and Talk About Climate and Energy Issues." At that session, legislators were provided with talking points to take back to their states, which touted the supposed benefits of increased CO2 and denied carbon dioxide is a major pollutant causing climate change.
Then in September, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt went on NPR's Diane Rehm show. Following a question from a caller about ALEC, Schmidt admitted that Google had made a mistake in providing ALEC with funding because of its position on climate change and its opposition to renewable energy. "We should not be aligned with such people. They are just literally lying," Schmidt said.
Within weeks, Facebook , Yahoo , Yelp , Overstock.com all announced that they too had or would soon leave ALEC. Most recently, SAP America, the German software firm and the ALEC corporate board chair, announced that it  would immediately cease support for ALEC, telling CMD in a statement that this was because of the groups "strange policies" on climate change, renewable energy, guns and voting rights.
The SAP America and AOL announcements will increase pressure on the few remaining tech firms in ALEC, which following AOL's decision include Expedia and eBay .

Your Future Is Callingreddit
When I was a young girl growing up in a small seaside town in England, my recently-widowed mother of four girls always told me that I had better learn how to DO something, so that if I was ever left in the same situation as she had been, I could be financially independent. Practical advice from a practical lady. The other bit of advice that mum gave me was to always have my own money, in my own account, whether I was married, single, in love or out. Again, starkly pragmatic and way before her time. To this day, I can't thank my mum enough for her practical wisdom.
This is the advice I now give to students I mentor as part of my work with the UCLA Anderson School of Business, and it's my advice to just about anyone who'll listen when it comes to finding our place not only in today's volatile economy, but in the widening world. Having work which rewards you is powerful, and makes you powerful -- not only because you have somewhere to go, but you have something to DO. We are called to do it, and this is why it's called our vocation.
In the past half-century, America's concept of work has changed radically. "Desk jobs," office jobs, indoor suit-and-tie jobs became the sort of postwar ideal that guaranteed a bright future. However, not all work requires a suit, or a four-year college degree (or a more advanced degree after that). There is all sorts of work in this world, and it all needs to be done by trained professionals who care about what they DO. Because someone has to be up and on their feet well before dawn to bake bread for the morning rush. Someone has to care for children when their parents work elsewhere. Someone has to cut hair and care for skin. Someone has to possess the skill and training to know how to fix the household plumbing or electrical outage. And, I tell my mentees and students, that someone could be you.
Vocational work almost always revolves around service, and it requires receiving hands-on, technical skill set training, whether the individual aspires to become a professional chef, a landscaper or a licensed professional skin therapist like myself. When performing vocational work, there is usually a great deal of human interaction involved and a sense of pride when using these hard-earned skills. My hardworking widowed mother was able to put food on the table and support herself and four daughters while she was employed as a registered nurse. I began my own career and learned the importance of financial independence at age 13, sweeping up hair cuttings from the floor at the local salon every Saturday. This was my introduction to the professional salon industry where I have built a career in providing education and training for future licensed professional skin therapists. I have seen firsthand the possibilities that a vocational skill set can provide, which can quite literally change the course of someone's life.
Vocational work often becomes a pathway to entrepreneurial success, and this is especially true in the professional salon industry.  A trained professional skin therapist can go on to open their own skin care center just as a trained chef can open their own restaurant. Whereas if you work for a large corporate conglomerate -- while I hope there is opportunity within that setting for you to thrive and grow in terms of your own professional development -- in most cases you have to stick to the script. Big, successful companies are generally running on a proven template, which is flexible only in degrees. A small business, especially when you own it yourself, is another story. You're free to make your own mistakes. That's the risk. The huge plus is that the success belongs to you in a way which is unique to entrepreneurs.
Working in the professional salon industry for the past 30 years has allowed me to see the doors that open for women when they are able to use their vocational skills to start their own business -- they are not only able to gain their financial independence, but have the means to provide for their families and contribute to the communities at large. Interestingly, women own 64 percent of the salon businesses in the USA, as compared to 31 percent of businesses in any other sector. This has been the basis for what inspired us to launch our company's global social impact women's economic initiative, FITE ( Financial Independence Through Entrepreneurship ), which has so far helped fund the businesses of more than 50,000 women entrepreneurs worldwide. We have also added a further empowerment piece called the 'FITE Future Entrepreneurs' program, which provides vocational training to women who wish to pursue a career, and possibly start a business, within the salon industry. The program was recognized this past September at the annual Clinton Global Initiative in New York, where Secretary Hillary Clinton personally announced the new FITE commitment.
Granted, not everyone is an entrepreneur by nature. But for those who do not find fulfillment in crunching numbers at a desk or climbing the corporate ladder, a vocational career may still hold the answer. Vocational work is all about receiving training on a transportable, vital skill that opens doors to new opportunities, provides financial independence and allows direct interaction with people. In short, it allows you the ability to DO something.

Gold imports: FinMin  RBI to tighten 80:20 scheme tomorrowImports of the yellow metal surged after the scheme was relaxed in May
New Delhi, November 11:  
The Finance Ministry has called a meeting with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other departments concerned on Thursday to review the ‘80:20’ scheme for gold imports. The scheme prescribes that any entity importing gold must re-export 20 per cent of it in value-added form.
“Finance & Economic Affairs Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi will chair a meeting on November 13 to review the 80:20 scheme to be attended by key officials from the RBI, Revenue Department and Commerce Ministry. The meeting has been called in the wake of the sudden spurt in gold imports and increase in gems & jewellery exports,” a senior Finance Ministry official told BusinessLine.
The scheme was introduced in July last year to curb gold imports so that the widening current account deficit (CAD) could be checked. CAD is the difference between the payment received and made in dollars. A higher CAD makes the economy vulnerable to higher capital outflow and weakens the rupee.
Though the officials refused to give details, there is a strong possibility of the scheme being tightened, considering the sudden jump in the import of the precious metal. In September, gold imports surged over 400 per cent, taking the trade deficit to an 18-month high.
CAD worries
Since the Government does not want to see the CAD to spin out of control, it wants to take all possible measures in tandem with the RBI. As part of the curbs, the Finance Ministry can revise the import duty on the yellow metal, while as a central banker, the RBI can bring about changes in import or export procedures. Last year the Ministry raised the import duty on gold to 10 per cent.
It is believed that relaxation of the ‘80:20’ scheme in May this year was one reason for the import surge. In May, the RBI allowed star trading houses and premier trading houses (registered as nominated agencies with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade) apart from nominated banks/agencies/entities to import gold under the scheme. It also allowed banks and nominated agencies to provide gold loans for domestic use to jewellers and bullion traders.
RBI had said that the norms had been relaxed to remove hurdles being faced by gems & jewellery exporters and bullion traders.
Exports rise
The September trade data show that export of gems & jewellery turned positive after three successive months of decline. The official said this fact would be kept in mind while reviewing the scheme.

New Delhi, November 11:  
Economic Affairs Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi has been nominated as the Finance Secretary. He will replace Arvind Mayaram who has been transferred to Ministry of Minority Affairs.
Mehrishi is a 1978 batch Indian Administrative Service officer from the Rajasthan cadre. He was appointed Economic Affairs Secretary last month. Apart from Mehrishi, there are four other Secretaries – Ratan Watal (Expenditure), Shaktikanta Das (Revenue), Hasmukh Adhia (Financial Services) and Aradhana Johri (Disinvestment). Normally, the senior-most among the five Secretaries is nominated as Finance Secretary, which Mehrishi is.
After the Government’s announcement on Thursday designating him as Finance Secretary, Mehrishi will lead the bureaucracy in the Finance Ministry in the Budget-making exercise for 2015-16. He was earlier Chief Secretary of Rajasthan Government. Mehrishi has time till August next year in the Finance Ministry, after which he turns 60, the official age of retirement. Mehrishi is among the four Secretaries brought into the Finance Ministry by the Narendra Modi Government, after shifting out Rajiv Takru from Revenue to Minority Affairs Ministry and then to the National Commission for Minorities. He was replaced by Shaktikanta Das. Last month, Mayaram was transferred twice, first to Tourism and then to Minority Affairs.
Earlier this month, GS Sandhu was shunted from Financial Services to the National Authority for Chemical Weapons Convention, and the new Disinvestment Secretary Aradhana Johri was appointed after her predecessor Ravi Mathur retired on September 30.

Soyameal exports in October hit by poor demandSoyameal exports in October hit by poor demand
Our Bureau
Tweet
Bengaluru, Nov. 10:  
Exports of soya meal have seen a sharp decline in October on poor demand from overseas buyers, who are seen resorting to need based purchases in a bearish market.
The export of soya meal during October 2014 was just 29,690 tonnes as compared to 1,94,486 tonnes in the same period of previous year, according to a statement issued by the Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA)
On a financial year basis, the exports during current financial year, that is, from April 2014 to October 2014 stood at 1.27 lakh tonnes as compared to 10.71 lakh tonnes in the same period of previous year showing a decrease of approximately 88 per cent, said Davish Jain, Chairman, SOPA.
Soybean meal exports have declined sharply from December 2013 onwards due to poor supply of soybean, he added.
SOPA has pegged the domestic output of the oilseed at 10.4 million tonnes, an increase of about a tenth over last year. The increase in output is attributed to higher yield per hectare mainly in Madhya Pradesh, the largest producing state.
